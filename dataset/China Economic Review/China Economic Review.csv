School closures can widen learning inequalities and disproportionately hurt vulnerable students. We collected data on the exam scores of university applicants in China before and after a two-month period of school closure. We observe that students from rural, lower-income households are more negatively affected by school closures compared to their urban, higher-income counterparts. The inequality effect remains sizable in the admission exam three months after schools reopen. To strengthen the causal interpretation of the results, we investigate the scores in the previous graduating cohorts who did not experience school closure, and find no evidence of the change in scores over the same calendar period. Our study points to the urgent need to address the educational inequality caused by school closures.","Since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), countries and municipalities have implemented a wide range of policies to slow down the pandemic, ranging from travel bans to school closures and home confinement. As a result, an unprecedented number of students have been suspended from attending schools in person. It is important to assess whether and how school closures affect inequality in learning outcomes across socioeconomic groups. This is to inform policy interventions that aim to prevent educational inequality from fermenting into persistent social inequality (====; ====).====During the school closure, the burden of education falls largely on parents. Research shows that families are the major sources of inequality in educational outcomes. The impact of family background on educational achievement has received much attention in the literature on inequality (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). A large part of the intergenerational transmission of education is attributed to differences in parental financial constraint and investments in children's human capital such as time input (====; ====; ====; ====). Family environments, especially at early ages, are major predictors of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities and health, which lay down a foundation for later educational attainment (====; ====; ====). During school years, the achievement gap by family background continues to be widened during vacation periods in comparison to term periods (====; ====).====Many school systems offer home-based online learning during school closure. Earlier studies comparing online learning to traditional in-person classes have focused on higher education rather than elementary or secondary education (====; ====). The flexibility and low cost of delivery of online learning have allowed it to reach educationally deprived populations (====; ====; ====). Regarding the abrupt adoption of online learning due to the pandemic, however, many have expressed concerns that it may raise extra challenges for disadvantaged students (====; ====). For instance, inadequate distribution of internet infrastructure has limited these students' access to online learning resources (====; ====; ====), giving rise to lower rates of class participation and homework completion (====; ====). ==== provides a theoretical analysis of the impact of school closure and online education, allowing for changes to schooling, peer effects and parental investments. Their model predicts a large learning loss for children from low-income neighborhoods while those from high-income neighborhoods are unaffected.====A number of empirical studies have investigated impacts of COVID-19-induced school closures on education, and the findings vary across contexts (see the review of ====). The meta-analysis by ==== which includes 18 studies from Europe, China and the United States points to a large average learning loss, and tentatively suggests that the loss is larger among younger age groups and for the initial lockdown. In terms of inequality effects, data on test score from European countries and United States suggest that school closures disproportionately affect the less advantaged students (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ==== and ====). Those findings on learning outcomes resonate with the differences in learning time, activity, and access to school support across different socio-economic groups (====; ====). Using test score data from Australian schools, ==== do not find any inequality effect by indigenous status, and the average leaning loss is also insignificant in their context. For Chinese secondary schools, ==== document that the pre-existing gap between students in rural and urban areas has widened after online teaching, and ==== find there is an increase in the test rankings of students with more highly educated parents following the school closure period.====While all of the above-mentioned studies feature primary or lower-secondary education, this paper uses unique data on educational outcomes of Chinese students in the final year of secondary education to assess inequality effects. This group of students are candidates for the national university admission exam, which is considered as a key channel for upward social mobility for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The timing of the school closure is particularly important for this group of students, as it occurred during an intense period of exam preparation known as the ¡°last sprint¡±. During this period, students typically spend massive amounts of time and effort learning in school, making the school closure potentially a larger shock for them. Disadvantaged students, in particular, may be more affected by the closure due to their home environment being less conducive to learning and their parents having more limited bandwidth to support them academically and emotionally. Moreover, the re-opening of schools is only three months before the admission exam. This means that any education inequality arising at this stage is more directly related to the future income inequality for the cohort through university admission and therefore more important to be quantified.====We analyze the scores of 3373 university candidates from five highly ranked high schools who took two official mock exams (i.e., high-quality, centrally marked exams administered by local education authorities), one before and the other after the students had two months of school closure and home-based online learning. We observe that the students from rural families perform significantly worse after the school closure, compared to their urban peers. By contrast, in the control groups¡ª3235 students in the 2019 cohort and 1969 students in the 2018 cohort¡ªwe do not observe such a pattern in similar exams during the same calendar period, suggesting that the observed pattern in 2020 is more likely due to school closure rather than a calendar time effect. Perhaps reflecting the higher intensity of school activities, the inequality effect for the Gaokao cohort is considerably larger than that observed in other secondary school grades, suggested by a rule-of-thumb calculation based on ====.====This result is not driven by any particular school in the sample: while the inequality effect is insignificant for the two smaller schools, it is present if we look at the data of any of the three larger schools. For two out of the five schools, we have self-reported scores of the university admission exams three months after normal teaching resumed. The estimates for both schools are remarkably similar when we use the final exam compared to the mock exam. This suggests that the inequality effect likely has persisted and affected the final admission. The results are also robust when we proxy the socio-economic status by the average income of the student's township.====We further conduct three analyses to gauge the underlying mechanisms. First, while lacking data on COVID-19 exposure density at small geographic units, we use public attention¡ªthe search volume of COVID-19 related terms on a main search engine¡ªas a proxy for general effects of the pandemic. We find that geographic variation in search volume related to COVID-19 does not explain the inequality effect, suggesting that our results are not likely to be driven by the general effects of the pandemic but the school closure. Second, we find that the inequality effect is larger in the subsamples of male students and students taking the arts track. One possible explanation is that those students are more sensitive to adverse home environment. Third, we look at a separate survey to examine home environment and learning behavior during school closure. We find evidence in support of digital divide whereby rural students rely on worse learning facilities (i.e., smartphones rather than computers or tablets, slow internet connection, etc.). Moreover, rural students also report lower participation and satisfaction for online learning.====Our research contributes to the understanding of the impact of school closures and brings education inequality to the attention of the academic community, policymakers, and the public. The human capital loss of under-privileged students can have a profound impact on their labor market prospects and thus long-term social inequality. Our empirical assessment of inequality in learning outcomes can help inform affirmative action policies in admission and call for more public spending to mitigate inequality, promote fairness and facilitate future social mobility.",Assessing inequality in the school closure response to COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000937,Available online 12 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0

The effectiveness of the transition largely relies on not only households' decision to participate but also their sustained use of clean energy after participation. However, the sustained use of clean energy has not yet received sufficient attention in policy making and in literature. This study examines China's Household Clean Heating program, which has switched millions of households' heating energy sources from coal to electricity and gas. We focus on both households' adoption and coal substitution behavior in the program. Based on the large-scale household survey conducted in rural areas of Northern China, we find that both high subsidies and compulsory measures effectively increased the household adoption rate; however, the latter did not guarantee sustained use of clean energy. We also find that In-person and repeated dissemination of program information had a better effect on involvement than passive announcements. Moreover, lower-income households were less likely to participate. Our findings suggest effective implementation approaches and supplementary measures to promote household energy transition, with fewer negative consequences for participants, particularly for the participants with lower income.","Inequality has been increasing in most major countries since the 1980s and has been linked to seismic events ranging from environmental performance to domestic terrorism (====). International and intra-national energy inequalities are prominent between income groups, as energy is embodied in goods and services that people with different purchasing power have varying levels of ability to consume (====). Both inequality and energy inequality are associated with the energy transition process. Therefore, the provision of universal access to energy services to lower-income groups represents an urgent issue for governments worldwide at present (====).====To achieve an effective and fair energy transition, active participation and sustainable usage of clean energy are both critical. The existing evidence points out that many people do not use clean equipment, even though they have adopted it. For example, in India's cooking energy program (PMUY), nearly three-quarters of residents never or barely purchased liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refills, and the participants' average annual LPG consumption was far less than half that of general customers (====; ====). ==== examined solid fuel suspensions (biomass and coal) after adopting clean fuels. The results indicated that two-thirds and four-fifths of participants continued to use solid fuel for cooking and heating, respectively, after the program. A large body of literature documented that households use multiple fuels simultaneously, termed fuel stacking. It indicated that increasing clean energy adoption alone cannot completely switch households away from traditional solid fuel (====).====Households in rural northern China consume approximately 200 million tons of dispersed coal during the heating season (====), most of which is of low quality and contributes disproportionately to air pollution and carbon emissions (====). Hence, to alleviate pollution and energy inequality problems, China has implemented a grand energy transition program for dispersed coal control since 2013, with Beijing piloting the Household Clean Heating (HCH) program in northern rural China. The nationwide HCH program aims to stimulate rural residents to replace dispersed coal with electricity or natural gas. Remote rural areas that do not have clean heating conditions have been provided with cleaner coal==== as a transitionary policy. By April 2021, the first three batches of the 43 pilot cities (see Appendix, Table A1) had completed the transition of a total of 35.26 million households (====).====As the program has been rolled out quickly through mandates and subsidies, households' adoption decisions and reduction in participants' coal consumption have varied across districts, and various challenges have emerged. The most prominent problem has been the reburning of the dispersed coal after participation. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment found that the average rate of coal reburning in some villages reached 36%. Without the sustained use of clean energy, an energy transition program is likely to result in idle infrastructure (====) and the failure of climate and clean air goals.====Therefore, it is critical to understand the determinants of the adoption and sustained use of substitute energy sources for an effective energy transition program. In this study, we identify implementation approaches that are effective in promoting clean energy usage and have fewer negative consequences for participants, especially those with lower income. Based on the Chinese Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS) conducted in Beijing in 2017, we find that >60% of the households covered by the program chose to participate the program, and the participants reduced coal consumption by about 80%. We explore the determinates of the participation, and find that the high subsidies and compulsory measures effectively promoted the adoption of the program, but the latter did not work well in suspending coal and increasing electricity consumption. We also find that increasing publicity about the policy and improving homeowner satisfaction with clean heating significantly promoted the heating energy transition. Further, we find that although poor households have a lower participation rate, households' characteristics only have a limited impact on reducing the quantity of coal used, conditional on participation.====This study makes three contributions to the literature. First, it sheds light on China's experience with household energy transition policies. The HCH program is distinguished from previous practices by its large subsidies and mandatory enforcement. Therefore, this study also provides an opportunity to understand the effectiveness of controversial energy transition measures. Second, most previous studies on energy transition have focused on the penetration rate, whereas the analysis of sustained usage conditional on adoption has not yet received sufficient attention. We examine policy effectiveness from these two perspectives. Third, this study investigates energy transition in rural areas and explores the driving factors contributing to dissolving energy inequality. Our findings have important policy implications for improving the program's effectiveness and reducing energy inequality.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== reviews the previous literature. ==== introduces the Household Clean Heating program in China. ==== describes the survey and summarizes the data. ==== presents the data analysis and findings. ==== concludes with policy implications.",Households' participation in energy transition and sustained use of clean energy: Evidence from China's clean heating program,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000901,Available online 9 June 2023,2023,Research Article,1

We find that InsurTech has significantly reduced the non-life insurance sector's market concentration but plays a limited role in the life insurance sector's market structure. The results are not driven by potential reverse causality and remain unchanged when we employ an instrumental variables approach and use an alternative supply-side InsurTech index. We further explore the underlying mechanisms and find that, instead of competing directly with insurance companies, Fintech companies provide insurance technologies to traditional insurers and help them lower entry barriers and reduce operating costs. Our paper sheds light on how InsurTech is reshaping traditional insurance sectors, and the results are generalizable to Fintech and financial markets.","The global financial crisis of 2008 caused a sharp loss of public trust in traditional financial institutions; this loss of trust became an important trigger for the rise of Fintech. Fintech innovations started in payments and lending with the emergence of Bitcoin and various peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms. The existing academic research traces that the evolution of Fintech focuses primarily on cryptocurrencies and marketplace lending (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). As the investments in those two areas have become mature and even saturated, many investors see insurance as the next great opportunity (====; ====).====As a branch of Fintech, InsurTech resembles other typical Fintech business in being characterized by BigTech companies providing a platform and adopting new technologies at the same time. InsurTech refers to a variety of emerging technologies and innovative business models that have the potential to transform the insurance industry (====). As summarized by existing academic research and industry reports (====; ====; ====), we classify InsurTech firms into three types: distributors, technology solution providers, and full-stack carriers. Distributors refer to various digital agents/brokers that focus on the sales and distribution, and collaborate with incumbent insurers to sell insurance on their platforms. Technology solution providers, such as software vendors, data originators and processors, target part of the value chain in insurance and help incumbent insurers improve their operating efficiency. Full-stack carriers are fully licensed insurance companies that use state-of-the-art technologies to underwrite policies and manage claims independently.====Unlike the direct competition and substitution between Fintech lending and traditional banking (====), InsurTech is characterized by the emergence of super-digital distributors like the Sure insurance platform based in the United States and the Ant insurance platform based in China. Considering that more than 50% of InsurTech deals flows into insurance distributors or brokers (====) and that the premiums collected from full-stack InsurTech insurers are less than 1% of premiums from all insurers,==== the story of InsurTech and the insurance industry is different from the competition between Fintech lending and traditional banking. While some Fintech topics such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs are different from InsurTech, our discussion of InsurTech is generalizable to Fintech areas that involve a digital platform and incorporate new technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and big data.====Specifically, we investigate InsurTech's effect on the market structure of the insurance sector, which fits into a central theme in the literature on ¡°disruptive innovation¡± and industrial development (====; ====; ====). The recently emerged digital distributors==== automate online premium payments through smart contracts, cooperate with traditional insurers to create new scenario-based insurance products, and achieve digitalized marketing and claim management with the application of blockchain. The digital distributor could be a game-changer for the competition among existing insurers and reshape the market structure of the insurance sector.====Based on several unique datasets from six sources, this study makes a key finding that InsurTech significantly reduces the non-life insurance sector's market concentration, but plays a limited role in the life insurance sector's market structure. Although we are not able to explore and identify the importance of all aspects of InsurTech itself, we piece together information for premiums and costs where data are available to capture the changes in different insurance sectors. Our estimates should be viewed as suggestive in understanding the economic impacts of InsurTech. The implications for consumer welfare and market competitiveness would be of great importance for regulators who supervise the insurance industry, given the significant differences between the non-life and life insurance sectors.====InsurTech's effect on non-life insurers is intuitive, since most non-life insurance products are simple and commodity-like. The digital distribution channel levels the playing field for insurers of different scales and allows small and medium-sized non-life insurers to reach the huge customer base of the digital platform with reduced search costs, lower commission expenses, and less geographic limitations. In addition, the digitized marketing, underwriting, and claim management with the blockchain and smart contracts on the platform lower the operating costs, which are particularly important for small and medium-sized non-life insurers. However, due to the complexity of life insurance products, which have long durations and high premiums, the branding and reputation of insurers play a more important role in customers' purchase decisions. As a result, consumers may prefer to purchase a product from large life insurers with good reputations on the digital platform or to purchase a product offline with the help of an agent. In our study, we find that InsurTech plays a limited role in the life insurance sector's market structure, which accords with several prior studies on Fintech and digital platforms such as ==== and ====. The significant difference between the non-life and life insurance sectors has great implications for the entire insurance sector in terms of technology advances, market competitiveness, and consumer welfare.====We start our study by merging the city-level demand-side InsurTech index, with the city-level branch data of Chinese insurers, to explore InsurTech's effect on the market structure of the insurance sector. We find that InsurTech reduces the non-life insurance sector's market concentration significantly, irrespective of the market structure measures used in the regressions; InsurTech plays a limited role in the life insurance sector's market concentration.====However, the InsurTech index may be endogenous and thus merely reflect the competition outcomes in the insurance sector. We formally check for reverse causality through both the demand channel and the supply channel and conclude that the endogeneity of the InsurTech index is not a big concern and does not drive our main results. We also employ an instrumental variables approach to further mitigate the endogeneity concern. To make our results more convincing, we construct a new supply-side InsurTech index. The regression results are consistent with the main findings using the demand-side InsurTech index.====Next, we explore the underlying mechanisms through which InsurTech affects the market structure. Technology advancements and innovations in the financial sector have the potential to increase market access and lower operating costs (====). We focus on these two aspects to pin down the underlying explanations: entry barriers and operating costs. We find that InsurTech has increased the number of both incumbent and new non-life insurance branches, but increased the number of incumbent life insurance branches only. In addition, InsurTech reduces the costs of non-life insurers but has no significant effect on the costs of life insurers. These findings help explain the main findings in the baseline regression.====Our study relates to the growing body of research on Fintech, the majority of which focuses on P2P lending and cryptocurrencies (====; ====; ====; ====). We extend the Fintech literature by focusing on InsurTech, a relatively unstudied area of Fintech. Our study contributes to the emerging field of InsurTech by offering a comprehensive analysis on how InsurTech affects the insurance sector. Several studies focus on the application of telematics data in the automobile insurance market (====; ====; ====; ====). Based on six unique datasets, we provide the first empirical study of InsurTech's effect on the entire insurance sector, including the effect on market structure, entry barriers, and insurers' costs. Last, the structure-conduct-performance hypothesis in the industrial organization literature states that market concentration fosters collusion and facilitates firms' gaining on monopoly rents, which causes inefficient resource allocation (====; ====; ====; ====). We find that InsurTech significantly reduces the non-life insurance sector's market concentration, which provides an avenue to improve market efficiency and enhance consumer welfare.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the data, defines the variables, and introduces the econometric specification. ==== presents the results of the baseline model, explicitly tests the potential reverse causality, shows the results using an instrumental variables approach, and checks the robustness of the baseline results using the new supply-side InsurTech index. ==== considers two possible mechanisms through which InsurTech affects the market structure. ==== concludes.",How is Fintech reshaping the traditional financial markets?

Empirical analysis finds that higher digital finance adoption significantly improves women's bargaining power and thus alleviates intra-household inequality. We explain the underlying mechanism in terms of women's participation in both labor and financial market. The subsample regression results show that the impact differs among families with distinct characteristics in terms of regions, family living patterns and women's fertility status. This paper provides a new perspective for understanding the inclusive contribution of digital finance and forms a timely complement to the literature in related fields.","As the basic economic unit in society, the family comprises individuals with rational preferences (====). In a marital relationship, the bargaining power between husband and wife is not only the major determinant of resource distribution within the family and the ownership of the discourse rights, but a crucial cause of inequality within the family as well (====). This kind of imparity embodies several aspects, including the family status of husband and wife, work division, and decision-making power on household affairs, reflecting the gender inequality embedded through all of society to some extent. Moreover, skewed sex ratios and women's inferior family status have long been themes that have been continuously investigated by scholars (====).====Going as far back as the Paleolithic period, women enjoyed a relatively high social position because of their contributions to population growth and economic development. However, the evolution of production forces and the means of production decrease women's participation in socially productive activities, whereas men gradually capture more social values. Meanwhile, what makes the situation worse is that some internal and external barriers, such as physiological characteristics, cultural conventions, and political institutions, also limit women's bargaining power, as well as the opportunity to improve their positions in the family (====). Today, in the wake of the third Internet-based technological revolution, high-speed developments in the digital economy have a profound impact on social effectiveness and impartiality (====). Digital finance can provide more financial services to vulnerable groups because of its huge advantage of inclusiveness. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider questions such as whether the development of digital finance will influence women's bargaining power and intra-household inequalities, and whether such a digital environment can help change the conventional work division concept of ¡°men outside and women inside¡± in China. This study focuses on the answers to such questions.====Inequality within the family is particularly prevalent in developing countries (====). As a representative developing country, China provides an appropriate research environment. The idea of preferring sons to daughters was unwaveringly rooted in old China. Confined to concepts of ¡°men outside, women inside,¡± ¡°passing on the generations,¡± and ¡°raising children against aging,¡± women were economically dependent on men, and thus enjoyed significantly less bargaining power, nor a relatively equal household position. The good news is that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the women's liberation movement gradually diluted identities based on traditional gender roles. As a result of this ideological emancipation that the rights and interests of the female community in China are guaranteed, learning opportunities, economic participation, and political involvement have all increased, and the labor force participation rate is much higher than that of other major economies in the world as well. Nevertheless, invisible social mechanisms of gender inequality still exist, based on the facts noted in the 2020 Global Gender Gap Report, which states that the Chinese gender equality index ranks 106th out of the 153 countries and regions covered by the report.====Existing literature has proposed several factors that affecting women's intra-household bargaining power, such as sex ratio in the marriage market (====; ====), gender of the first child (====), and pension adjustment (====). In addition, ==== find that fertility rate is negatively related to women's bargaining power within the family, and ==== proves that low fertility rates give women opportunities to master more advanced knowledge and productive technologies, thus to improve their income and labor participation rate. Based on the conclusion drawn from previous studies, it is reasonable to consider the question of whether an increase in financial income can help improve women's bargaining power. More interestingly, ==== suggest that more properties an individual can obtain after divorce, the stronger the bargaining power he or she will possess during the marriage, which further supports that financial condition can be a crucial factor that affect the distribution of bargaining power the gender inequality within the family.====Addressing gender inequality has always been an ongoing concern for both Chinese society and the Chinese government, which is essential to improve family welfare and social vitality. In recent years, China has entered a stage of high-quality development in the field of digital finance. As noted in previous studies, ==== show that increasing inclusiveness of financial sectors will spur savings, investment, and personal income. In addition, some informal financial services will also improve living conditions and economic situations for vulnerable groups such as the poor and female (====; ====). Besides the empirical evidence given by academic research, the foundation of the Grameen Bank (meaning ¡°bank for the poor¡±) can also be considered as an example of inclusive finance, which closely integrated with rural women and improve their family life. Moreover, in 2015, UN-Women's Fund for Gender Equality (FGE) has supported 53 projects in 48 countries, reaching 218,800 people directly affected. For example, an FGE-supported project mentored and trained 25 women entrepreneurs to establish mutual fund cooperatives. Therefore, based on the inspiring evidence, we can see that as a typical form of inclusive finance, digital finance is inseparable from the field of women empowerment. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC), our study investigates whether the development of digital finance in China will have an impact on women's bargaining power within families and, if so, the mechanisms of this effect.====First, we ask whether the development of digital finance has improved women's bargaining power and family equity. Traditional financial institutions are considered inefficient in terms of their distribution of financial resources across customers of different sizes, locations, and demographics. The availability and convenience of digital finance provides opportunities for groups that previously did not have enough access to the financial market. According to the principle of exchange of equal values, women still bear the brunt of housework because of their low income and inferior professional status, which put them at a disadvantage when negotiating with their husbands. We believe that by acquiring financial resources from digital finance platforms, women can improve their financial situation to increase their bargaining power. In the empirical test, we used two proxies to characterize the bargaining power of women in the household: the wife's decision-making power in the decision-making process of family affairs and the wife's relative income to her husband. The former is the core proxy variable. To establish the causal impact of digital finance on women's bargaining power, we use the distance to Hangzhou as an instrument variable to capture the exogenous variation in digital finance. Through baseline regressions and a series of endogeneity and robustness tests, we find that digital finance helps improve women's decision-making power, thereby further enhancing their bargaining power and reducing intra-household inequality.====We then analyze the impact mechanisms of digital finance to demonstrate the channels by which it influences women's bargaining power. To begin, we explore whether digital finance helps improve women's bargaining power by encouraging their entrepreneurial behaviors. To test this mechanism, the total score on five major household affairs is adopted as the dependent variable due to the limitations on data availability for the variable of relative income ratio. We discuss the possible mechanism from the perspective of women's participation in different types of work and find that entrepreneurship plays a more significant role than any other form of labor participation. We construct the interactive term of ====?¡Á?==== and conduct regression analysis based on baseline model. The empirical results suggest that women entrepreneurship enhances the effect of digital finance on women's bargaining power. Meanwhile, we find digital finance has not only promoted women entrepreneurship and working time, but also have no negative impact on the time women spend on household responsibilities, indicating that digital finance can help women balance work and family.====Furthermore, we investigate whether financial market participation by utilizing digital finance also help enhance women's bargaining power. It is common sense that the degree of inclusiveness in traditional finance is relatively restricted for women. The frequency of women's participation in financial market and their financial literacy are usually lower than men (====; ====). Digital finance enables women to be involved in financial markets and to get more financial resources at a lower cost. According to the literature and regression results, we assume that digital finance enhances women's bargaining power by promoting their financial market participation.====Finally, we ask whether the impact of digital finance on women within the family is discrepant among individuals. The degree of influence may be inconsistent owing to some unique characteristics. We categorize the sample in terms of region, family living pattern, and fertility status. By conducting the heterogeneity analysis, we find that the impact will be larger for women within the family in rural areas than in urban districts and for women living with parents-in-law. From an individual perspective, the impact will also be larger for women who have their first child as a girl. Our results further shed light on the inclusive effect of digital finance on women.====This study makes several contributions to the literature in this field. Using convincing micro-databases and constructing representative variables, we quantify the causal relationship between the development of digital finance in China and women's bargaining power within the family through empirical regressions. In terms of research ideas, this study expands the research scope of gender inequality and provides a new perspective on family economics in the digital environment. Existing studies have discussed the welfare effect of digital finance on households, enterprises, and traditional financial institutions, while few have focused on its impact on inequality within households. For instance, how does digital finance affect the division of labor, decision-making processes, and resource allocation within the family? Most studies investigating factors that influence women's bargaining power and family inequalities are primarily from the perspective of women themselves and their offspring, as well as some social aspects, including cultural background, social regime, policy constraints, and gender concepts.

This paper explores the differences in the amount of time Chinese parents spend on childcare stratified by education level and investigates the factors driving these differences. The analysis shows that more educated parents devote more time to childcare than less-educated parents. The educational differences in parental childcare time are particularly pronounced among working parents, parents with school-age children, and parents in the provinces where educational institutions are relatively scarce. Much of the extra childcare time is directed to educational care and travel with children. Compared to households in which the mother has less than a junior high school education, households with university-educated mothers spend 74?min more per day on childcare, with 58% of the extra time devoted to children's learning and education.","Parents devote time and financial resources to raising their children. The time parents spend with their children is the most important input for children's cognitive and social skill development (====; ====), and early childhood development has lifelong consequences (====; ====). Parental time investment in children is also a possible channel for the intergenerational transmission of parental (dis)advantages. A large body of time use studies in developed countries has documented that more-educated parents spend more time in childcare than do less-educated parents (====; ====; ====). While much of the research on parental time with children has been done for developed countries, the literature on this topic for developing countries remains sparse. To fill in this knowledge gap, this paper examines differences in the amount of time Chinese parents spend on childcare stratified by education level.====China provides a unique context for exploring the relationship between parental education and childcare time. The parenting practice of Chinese families is highly influenced by Confucian cultural tradition in which education is regarded as a ladder to higher earnings and social status. Chinese parents generally have high expectations for their children's academic achievements as it is illustrated by the saying ¡°hoping for a son to become a dragon and a daughter to become a phoenix¡± (====). China's transition to a market-oriented economy has greatly enhanced the value of human capital, increasing the demand for higher education (====; ====). While the supply of higher education has rapidly expanded over the past two decades,==== there remains a large gap between the number of young Chinese desiring a college education and the number of college enrollments available, especially at elite colleges (====). College admission in China is determined primarily by students' scores on the National College Entrance Exam. Because academic achievements are cumulative, students start preparing for college entrance examinations as early as in primary school. Because high-quality educational resources are scarce, high schools in China are classified into premier schools and regular schools. Admission to premier schools is also determined by the scores received on junior and senior high school entrance exams. On average, students at premier high schools have a higher probability of being admitted to colleges than those at regular high schools (====; ====). The competition for admissions to premier high schools and elite colleges has put tremendous pressure on Chinese parents to make time and financial commitments to children's learning and school success (====; ====).====Studies have shown that parental involvement in children's education has a positive effect on children's school performance (====; ====; ====). This has raised concerns about equality of educational opportunities for children from families with low socioeconomic status. Empirical research has found that there are large academic achievement gaps between children of more-educated and less-educated parents (====; ====). ==== and ==== found that there is a strong positive correlation between the years of schooling experienced by parents and their children. ==== and ==== showed that parental education is a significant determinant of children's scores on college entrance examinations and of their probability of being admitted to colleges. Thus, studying educational differences in parental time with children will shed light on a possible channel for the intergenerational transmission of human capital in China.====In China, as in most other countries, childcare is typically the mother's responsibility. However, Chinese women also participate in the work force in high numbers and the vast majority of Chinese women work fulltime. As a result, Chinese women experience a great work-family conflict (==== found that Chinese mothers gave up leisure time so they could allocate more time to paid work and more time to the care of their families. The ¡°time squeeze¡± was particularly acute for low-paid working mothers, who had to allocate a substantial amount of time to paid work to support the family (====). Education was found to play a pivotal role in achieving a more balanced distribution of unpaid work (housework and care work combined) between women and men. ==== showed that more-educated urban husbands took on a larger share of unpaid work than their less-educated counterparts. ==== found that wives with an education level equal to or higher than that of their husbands spent less time on unpaid work than wives with an education level lower than that of their husbands. Using a measure that limits childcare to routine care activities for preschool children, ==== documented the trends in parental time with children for the period from 2004 to 2011. She found that during this period, fathers' time spent on childcare increased, while mothers' childcare time slightly decreased. This paper supplements the existing Chinese time use literature that concentrates on domestic gender inequalities by studying parental time use from a new angle.====In this study, we document the patterns of educational differences in total childcare time and the types of childcare activities in which parents engage in two-parent families with at least one child under 18?years of age. We also investigate the factors driving these differences. We examine how parents with different education levels allocate time among paid work, housework, childcare, leisure, and self-care to understand how childcare time choice is compared to other unpaid uses of time in response to economic factors and how education affects parents' tradeoffs between paid work and unpaid activities and between meeting children's needs and their own needs for leisure and relaxation. We also examine the extent to which China's competitive education system may play a role in explaining the educational differences in parental time with children.====Our analysis has obtained robust evidence that in China, as in many developed countries, more-educated parents spend more time caring for children than less-educated parents. The most important component of the extra parental time with children is time spent on activities related to children's education. We found that highly educated, high earning parents value time caring for children more than other unpaid uses of time, so they are more inclined to trade time spent on domestic chores or leisure for time caring for children than low-educated, low-earning parents. Compared to parents with more education and higher earnings, low-educated, low-earning parents face a more acute time squeeze from paid work, which reduces their time available for all unpaid activities, including childcare. We also found that the positive education gradient in childcare time is more pronounced in the provinces where the supply of educational institutions is relatively scarce and academic competition tends to be more intense.====The paper proceeds as follows. ==== provides a brief account of the theoretical background for the study of parental time with children and formulates research hypotheses. ==== describes the data, measures, and empirical methods used. ==== presents the empirical results. ==== concludes.",Educational differences in parental time devoted to childcare in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2300086X,7-Jun-23,2023,Research Article,4

By exploiting an exogenous commercial shock for soybeans and microlevel rural survey data from Manchuria of China in the 1930s, where factor markets were relatively well functioning, this study investigates the influence of HVC cultivation on farmers' agricultural performance, welfare, and inequality both theoretically and empirically. We find that (i) larger farms devote a larger proportion of land to HVCs and that (ii) farmers who cultivate a larger proportion of HVCs have higher agricultural productivity, profit, net income, and expenditure. Furthermore, the adoption of HVCs lowers profit, income, and expenditure inequality by enhancing income from wages relative to land rents, which benefits households with less land.","The improvement of productivity, welfare, and equity in rural areas are major issues for economists and policy makers. As the rural economy develops, production systems evolve out of autarky and become more integrated into commercial markets. Therefore, with the development of commercialization, transformation from traditional grain crops to high-value cash crops (HVCs; such as fruit, cotton, coffee beans, and medicinal herbs) is considered an effective way to improve the productivity and welfare of smallholder farmers (====; ====; ====).==== However, in practice, many farmers, especially smallholders, still grow mainly low-value traditional grain crops. Accordingly, this study focuses on two urgent questions. First, what are the determinants of farmers' crop choices? Second, if only some farmers respond to the market opportunities of HVCs, then what impact will this have on agricultural productivity, especially on farmers' welfare and inequality?====The existing literature have investigated several determinants of farmers' crop choice, such as production ability, subsistence, risk coping, trade cost, and institutions.==== A recent branch of studies integrates such choice into the context of frictional factor markets (especially land) since they are prevalent in the developing world.==== Empirically, although the results of existing studies tend to hold a positive attitude toward HVC adoption, there are still some limitations to the few systematic investigations for causality.==== First, as a type of endogenous choice of farmers, crop choice is affected by a variety of observable and unobservable factors, so the estimated results are inevitably threatened by the potential endogenous bias caused by omitting variables, especially for the nationwide sample.==== Second, since crop choice is endogenous, different farmers react differently to the same market opportunity. Especially in relatively competitive factor markets, the existing research on whether the introduction of HVCs aggravates welfare inequality among farmers is scarce.====To address the above limitations, this paper exploits the booming international soybean trade in the early 20th century as an exogenous shock of commercialization. We then empirically investigate the causal effects of HVCs (mainly soybeans and wheat) adoption on farmers' performance such as agricultural profits, factor productivity and welfare indicators like income, expenditure and the corresponding inequality, with the household-level survey data collected by the Survey Department of South Manchuria Railways Co. in Manchuria (Northeast China) in the 1930s.====To derive a reliable causal effect of HVC cultivation on productivity, welfare, and its inequality in the context of free factor markets, a major challenge is to find the place, where, (1) is suitable for growing HVCs, (2) the shock of commercial opportunity is relatively exogenous, (3) has high factor mobility. Manchuria, where was forced to opened to international markets in the late 19th century in the early 20th century, provides us such an appropriate case. Since there was suitable for soybean cultivation and the exogenous positive demand shock from Europe was very strong, soybeans became the most important commodity for export in that period. In addition, at that time, factors, especially land, can be redistributed without any institutional restrictions in the market by means of sale, mortgage, tenancy, etc.====To deal with the endogeneity of crop choice for HVCs, we rely on the variation in soil suitability for crops across regions to construct exogenous variables. Specifically, we use estimates of potential crop yields across surveyed villages from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)¡¯s Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) database. These yields are calculated by incorporating local soil and weather characteristics into a model that predicts the maximum attainable yields for each crop in a given area. Because of its exogeneity, this potential yield has been used as an instrumental variable (IV) in some important studies (e.g. ====).==== To further measure the competitive advantage of cash crops over traditional grain crops, we calculate the ratio of potential yields between the major cash (almost soybeans) and grain crops (almost sorghum or millet) in each surveyed village as the IV of crop choice.====To guide the empirical work, we first build a static general equilibrium model in which there is no friction in the labor and land markets within a village. The model predicts that farmers will grow a higher proportion of HVCs and earn higher profits when they have higher production ability, face a higher price ratio of soybeans to food crops, and live in localities where are more suitable for growing soybeans. Furthermore, a higher proportion of HVCs reduces the income gap between landlords and farmers within a village by enhancing income from wages relative to land rentals, which benefits households with less land endowment under the assumption that HVCs are more labor intensive than traditional grain crops. The consequences mean that both efficiency and equity can be derived.====The empirical results are consistent with the model's predictions. Our baseline ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates and two-stage least squares regression with IV (2SLS-IV) find that the proportion of land grown HVCs for households is positively correlated with agricultural performance indicators such as per capita farm profit, labor and land productivity (calculated by value added) and welfare indicators such as per capita expenditure on living and per capita net cash income. The results hold in several robustness checks by exploiting a cohort difference-in-differences (DID) estimate, subsamples of different regions, operating farm sizes and soybean suitability at the village level, and dropping the top and bottom 5% of observations.====Furthermore, we examine the corresponding effect on inequality from two dimensions. First, the heterogeneity analysis using quantile regression shows that the positive effect of HVC adoption on agricultural profits is more significant for farmers in the lowest profit quantile, while the effect on welfare indicators such as expenditure and income shows little difference across different quantile groups. Second, the analyses at the village level reveal that the higher the proportion of land grown HVCs is, the lower the Gini indices within the village, indicating that cultivating more labor-intensive HVCs in free labor and land markets can reduce the degree of inequality (and, at the very least, not exacerbate it.====The behavior of farmers in production decisions is a traditional issue in the microeconomics literature. Generally, the crop, input, technique choices of a utility-maximizing farmer are determined by her preferences on consumption and risk (====; ====), constraints on capital (====), transportation cost (====), land ownership (====), climate shocks (====) and so on. Combining with the classic literature explaining cross-country agricultural productivity disparities, some recent empirical studies with structural models have begun to incorporate farmers' occupational choices (agricultural and nonagricultural) into structural models to further discuss the topic about misallocation (e.g. ====; ====). The latest study extends the discussion to farmers' choices in agriculture (cash vs. grain crops) (====; ====). For example, ==== find that restrictive land policies for large farms are the main reason for the low adoption rate of HVCs.====In terms of the impacts of the adoption of HVCs on farmers' performances, plentiful early empirical studies with qualitative and basic statistical analyses have revealed the positive relationships (e.g. ====). Recent systematic empirical studies with rural household survey data have found that cultivating HVCs for commercial purposes can improve income, profits, and reduce poverty in the developing world (====; ====; ====; ====). However, specializing in HVCs also means that smallholders, who are vulnerable, need to bear greater risks. Thus, diversifications in crops and income sources seem to be an effective way to balance profits and risks (====; ====; ====).====Moreover, the adoption of HVCs and its implication for smallholders' welfare are also very important and controversial topics in modern Chinese history. Traditional perspectives hold a negative attitude on cash crops since the markets were controlled by big imperialistic countries (e.g. ====). ==== considers that although cotton is more profitable, smallholder farmers can not cope with risk when they specialize in cotton planting. On the contrary, some other influential works approve that commercialization and market-oriented production stimulate growths in agriculture and income in pre-war China (====; ====; ====). Thus, systematic investigations are still needed.====Overall, this paper first contributes to the empirical literature on the impact of HVC adoption on farmers' productivity and welfare in both historical and contemporary dimensions. We incorporate this issue into a free-factor-markets context, which is also a crucial determinant of efficiency and equity (====). Compared with the existing literature, this study not only uses various methods, such as IV and DID to deal with endogeneity but also investigates the impact of HVC adoption on the whole rural economy from the perspective of farmers' factor allocation and inequality.====Second, this paper is also related to the literature on farmers' choices and agricultural productivity. While existing literature focusing only on whether farmers grow HVCs, this study further investigates farmers' proportion choices for different crops, and unlike ====, we also introduce the land tenancy market into the analysis====.====Finally, this paper has implications for contemporary rural land policy. Recently, a series of studies have documented the productivity losses caused by the factor misallocation resulting from land restrictive policies (e.g., ====; ====, ====; ====; ====),==== but there has been rarely any further discussion of the effect of such policies on inequality.==== This paper is not a direct assessment of these restrictive policies but rather uses the historical context of free labor and land markets to examine their influence on inequality. Our results show that, at least in a specific context, land transfer liberalization can not only improve the efficiency of factor allocation but also reduce (and, at the very least, not exacerbate) inequality, which provides historical experience that supports the market-oriented reform of the land market in contemporary China.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the historical background of agricultural production and soybean trade in Manchuria. In ====, we model farmers' factor allocation and crop choice and analyze their impacts. ==== describes the data and variables used in this study. The corresponding empirical methods and results are given in ====. In ====, the influence of HVC cultivation on the inequality indices related to households' welfare is examined.

However, their health has greater externalities since they play a central role in families and in daily village operations. It is therefore important to investigate the causal effect of RCenR on the health of the acting heads, which remains econometrically underexplored. This study controls for cross-prefecture contiguous-villages group fixed effects and uses the expected once-off government housing subsidy as the ","Health plays an integral role in the quality of life, and is central to human survival and development (====). Health is also essential for human capital, which significantly contributes to economic growth, especially in rural areas of developing countries (====; ====). Good health may generate higher income by increasing the productivity and working hours of rural residents (====; ====), whereas disease has a substantial negative impact on their welfare (====; ====). By reducing medical expenses, better health can prevent rural populations from falling into the ¡°poverty trap.¡± According to a 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) report, more than one third of the world's population lacks access to basic health care services, and about 13% encounters expensive health care, particularly in the rural areas of developing countries (====). In addition, rural residents have lower life expectancy and poorer health than their urban counterparts (====; ====). This situation is primarily caused by a lack of health care resources (====; ====). Residents in rural areas also experience low medical insurance coverage and a deterioration of their living environment, which may undermine their physical and mental health, and therefore, their quality of life (====; ====).====Rapid urbanization and industrialization led to rural recessions in many developed countries and regions after World War II. This resulted in diminished rural populations, the abandonment of arable land, and a significant decrease in the quality of infrastructure (====; ====; ====; ====).====China has been gradually implementing RCenR policies in rural areas since 2004 as well. RCenR was established to develop rural areas and organize rural residences in the face of rapid urbanization. RCenR can achieve more efficient land arrangement and save rural construction land. Centralized residences and saved land earmarked for construction can attract and create more businesses in rural areas as well as providing greater opportunities of local non-agricultural business and employment. Moreover, RCenR communities have more aggregated population and governments can build infrastructure and provide public services to rural areas at a lower cost, leading to a better balance of welfare distribution between urban and rural areas. Essentially, RCenR relocates dispersed rural residents to centralized communities, resulting in significant changes to their production modes, lifestyle, and social welfare. RCenR may also have an important impact on the health of rural residents. Although many countries have resorted to RCenR to address rural development problems, the impact of RCenR on the health of rural residents remains underexplored econometrically.====This study examines the effect of RCenR on the health of acting heads of rural households (shortened as ¡®acting heads¡¯ hereafter) in China. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have driven a large number of farmers to out-migrate to cities as workers (====; ====). The out-migration of young and middle-aged workforce has resulted in many household members being left behind in rural areas, notably older people, women, and children. Numerous studies have examined the resultant welfare changes in these groups (====; ====; ====; ====). However, the well-being of rural acting heads represents a gap in the literature. In this paper, the acting head refers to the de facto head of the household among the family members who remain in the local area. If there are no out-migrant workers in a family, or if the registered head of the family chooses not to out-emigrate, the acting head is then the registered. In this study, 58% of households have at least one out-migrant worker in their families.====The acting heads play a central role in their family and in the community (====). They are the decision-makers in terms of financial and other important household affairs, and they are the core of daily family operations (====; ====; ====). Acting heads also have an important effect on the health of the family members (====) and the education of the younger generation (====). ==== notes that if the acting heads are healthy, the probability of incurring heavy medical expenses for the households can be reduced by 5.5%. In addition, acting heads are key participants in community or village affairs (====; ====). Greater household decision-making power allows the acting heads to play a stronger role in their family and community. Thus, the health of acting heads has greater externalities. On the other hand, the acting heads are older and their health is worse than average rural residents. In the survey dataset collected in 2017 that this study uses, the mean of the ages of acting heads is 55.03?years old (standard deviation?=?12.16), which is much larger than that of rural population (46.19?years old) including left-behind and non-left-behand calculated by using China Family Panel Studies dataset,==== and they are in the range of ages with higher number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths of all cancers and five leading cancer types (====). In the dataset this study uses, only 54.8% of the acting heads feel that they are healthy. The ratio is much lower than that of rural residents (65.10%).==== Since acting heads are older and less healthy than average rural population and their health has greater externalities, it is very important to examine the effect of RCenR on the health of acting heads, which this study aims to do.====However, unobservable factors and possible reverse causality may make it difficult to estimate the causal effect of RCenR on the health of the acting heads. To overcome these concerns, this study adopts two strategies. First, it adopts an approach similar to ====, who used contiguous cross-state county pairs in the USA. By controlling for contiguous cross-state county pairs fixed effects, ====, in line with ====. This study conducts multiple tests to verify the validity of the proposed IV.====Prior studies on changes in the living environment and their effect on farmers' health focused mainly on the impact of urbanization, yielding conflicting results. For instance, ==== used difference-in-differences estimators to assess the impact of urbanization on health. They found that urbanization has a substantial and negative impact on health, principally because it results in unhealthy lifestyles, such as the increased tendency to smoke and eat unhealthy food. In contrast, ==== found that urbanization provides rural residents with access to better education, higher income, and higher level of medical insurance, thereby improving their health. Like urbanization, RCenR can also improve local infrastructure, exerting a significant impact on the lifestyle of rural residents. RCenR can protect the existing cultivated land and support the development of agriculture. They also improve the living environment of rural households by consolidating rural homesteads and thus may improve the health of rural residents in general.====Although several studies address the impact of RCenR on gross income (====; ====), employment (====; ====), and social communication (====; ====), the impact of RCenR on the health of rural residents remains relatively unexplored. This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, most prior studies have examined left-behind children, older people, and women. This study is the first to examine the effect of RCenR on the health of the acting heads. Second, the study employs an IV to address potential endogeneity biases, ensuring the robustness of the study. Third, it explores the possible channels through which RCenR affects the health of the acting heads. It is found that RCenR improves their health by increasing income, promoting households to shift from agricultural activities to non-agricultural activities or employment, increasing the use of clean energy and clean water, and facilitating access to medical services. These findings are important because they can assist developing countries to improve their rural development policies.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the possible channels through which RCenR affects the health of the acting heads. Section 3 describes the background of RCenR. Section 4 presents the data and ====.

Based on the ongoing reform in China and generator-level data in 2019, we identify three channels through which the reform could affect ","China was responsible for 33% of the world's carbon emissions in 2020, and its power sector accounted for 43.1% of the country's total emissions (====). Some started from the supply side, improving fossil-fuel energy generation efficiency and encouraging the replacement of fossil-fuel energy with renewable energy (====; ====; ====). Some studies have focused on the demand side, optimizing the electricity consumption structure to control total emissions (====; ====; ====). In 2015, China initiated a new round of power sector reform, aiming for a more efficient and environmentally friendly power industry. Distinguished from power sector reforms in other countries, China's reform in this round made efforts on both the supply and demand sides. The main measures included encouraging the development of high-efficiency generators by introducing market mechanisms, prioritizing renewable energy generation, and reducing electricity prices. Given the complexity and interaction of the measures, whether and how China's power sector reform could reduce carbon emissions remains open for research.====Researchers have studied the impact of power sector reforms on carbon neutrality worldwide. ==== found that power market reform in Texas in the United States made a significant contribution to its leading role in renewable power, which promoted the reduction of carbon emissions. ==== reported a potential 30¨C50 million ton decrease in carbon emissions after introducing market mechanisms into the power sector of the United States. ==== pointed out that power sector reform would be a key step toward Japan's emission reduction target in 2030. ==== concluded that power sector reform in South Korea reduced CO==== emissions, and the main measures included expanding the use of renewable energy and imposing restrictions on the operation of coal power plants. ====Research on China's power sector reform and carbon neutrality has increased in recent years. Some research has focused on the dispatch transition in the reform. For example, ==== estimated the coal consumption change from the traditional ¡°equal share¡± dispatch to economic dispatch, and found that the new approach would reduce fuel consumption by approximately 6%, thus reducing carbon emissions. ==== investigated the benefits of economic dispatch in China and found a 7%¨C10% reduction in CO==== emissions. Some research has focused on the impact of relevant policies on the reform. For example, using data from Guangdong, ==== qualitatively provided an overview of the policies, operations, and potential effects of power reform. Other studies have assessed carbon pricing instruments. ==== conducted an ==== investigated the synergistic effects of power sector reform and carbon pricing in the China Southern Power Grid and concluded that if there was no concurrent power market reform, moderate carbon pricing alone would not be sufficient to effectively reduce carbon emissions.====In contrast to the existing literature, which generally focuses on specific measures in the reform, we systematically investigate the effects of power sector reform on carbon emissions. Based on the institutional background and long-term equilibrium framework, we first identify three channels through which reform could affect carbon emissions and investigate their interactions. The first channel encourages replacing low-efficiency generators with high-efficiency ones by introducing market mechanisms, referred to as the ¡°reshaping generation competition¡± channel. The second is giving renewable energy administrative priority in generation, referred to as the ¡°promoting renewable energy¡± channel. The last channel involves reducing electricity prices. Then, combined with the generator-level data in 2019 in China, we establish formulas to estimate the carbon reduction potential of the three channels, as well as the obstacles in the process. Finally, considering the complexity of the emission reduction process through power sector reform, we specifically propose the corresponding solution. We find that the ¡°reshaping generation competition¡± channel and ¡°promoting renewable energy¡± channel could reduce CO==== emissions by 205.4 and 311 million tons, respectively, while the ¡°reducing electricity price¡± channel would increase emissions by 98.1 million tons. However, under average cost competition, replacing low-efficiency generators with high-efficiency generators is difficult, and the administrative priority of renewable energy would lead to high implicit costs. Based on the simulation results, we propose that carbon pricing at the level of 400¨C600 yuan/tCO==== is needed to achieve the full carbon reduction potential of the reform.====This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the potential effects of China's power sector reform on carbon emissions.====Second, we perform a detailed ==== assessment of the potential effects of the reform. Compared to ==== analysis, which previous literature mostly uses, ==== analysis combined with scenario discussion can illustrate various potential carbon effects of the reform. Using ==== analysis, this study proposes a new perspective on the evaluation of reform effects and reveals potential problems in China's power sector reform and emission reduction.====The final contribution is that we build a unified framework of long-term equilibrium to analyze the reform's carbon effects. The existing research mostly adopts a short-term marginal cost competition framework, which is widely used in full marketization contexts in places such as the United States and Europe (====). However, China's electricity market differs from that of these countries, and China's reform still contains some central planning-dominated methods (====; ====).

This study uses the data of urban clusters from 2010 to 2019 and focuses on the relationship between the polycentric spatial structure of urban clusters and the urban¨Crural income gap. The findings show that the development of urban cluster polycentricity can reduce the urban¨Crural income gap, and the higher the degree of polycentricity in morphology, the smaller the gap. However, the relationship between polycentric spatial structure and the urban¨Crural income gap is ¡°U¡± shaped, indicating the need for rational planning of urban polycentric development patterns rather than simple expansion. In addition, the polycentric spatial structure of urban clusters can reduce regional disparities by promoting factor mobility and industrial structure optimization. However, this depends on the level of industrial development and infrastructure. This study highlights the importance of a balanced approach to urban development that takes into account regional disparities and issues of social equity.","Does an appropriate urbanization development model achieve a win-win situation for regional economic growth and coordinated development? Does the polycentric spatial structure reduce the income gap between regions? So far, there is no consensus on these issues in the theoretical literature. The conclusion depends on factors such as the distribution of investment, human capital, the integration process, degree of market development, and government intervention (====; ====). Existing studies provide considerable evidence of the causes of regional disparities in China, but they have also neglected to consider spatial development in their assessments. Along with rapid economic growth, there is likely to be change in the spatial distribution pattern of economic activities resulting from factor mobility. This change has important implications for regional economic growth and income disparities (====). The studies by ==== and ==== suggest that the relationship between regional polycentric development patterns and regional income disparities is ambiguous. In the Chinese context, however, ==== and ==== suggest a positive correlation between the spatial structure of regional polycentrism and economic growth. These studies suggest that polycentric spatial structure may reduce the regional income gap.====We investigate the relationship between the polycentric spatial structure and urban¨Crural income disparity in Chinese urban clusters using the year-end city population, the number of collaborating journals (¡°ESCI,¡± ¡°SSCI¡± and ¡°SCI¡±) on the Web of Science as the basic data on polycentric spatial structures. We also elaborate on how the polycentric development of urban clusters promotes the reduction of regional income disparity in terms of industrial development and infrastructure. Our empirical analysis uses data from six urban clusters in China for the period 2003¨C2019. Our results show that the spatial structure of urban cluster polycentricity can reduce the urban¨Crural income gap. Specifically, the higher the degree of urban cluster morphological polycentricity, the smaller the urban¨Crural income gap. Furthermore, there is a ¡°U¡±-shaped relationship between the spatial structure of urban cluster polycentricity and the urban¨Crural income gap. These results suggest a threshold value for polycentricity in its effect of reducing the income gap, and, rather than expanding cities we should plan their reasonable polycentric development. In addition, the polycentric spatial structure can reduce regional disparities by promoting factor flows and industrial structure optimization. Nevertheless, the realization of these mechanisms is constrained by industrial development and levels of infrastructure.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== and ==== find that the polycentricity of urban spatial structures contributes to higher labor productivity and economic efficiency. ====; ====). ==== and ==== indirectly verify the important role of domestic value chain division and resource integration. This finding is based on the role of the interaction between domestic and global value chains in promoting the upgrading of global value chains in Chinese manufacturing with Chinese city networks acting as the spatial carrier.====The relationship between polycentric spatial structures and regional income disparity remains understudied. This is surprising since narrowing the regional income gap appears to be an important consequence of regional economic growth. This relationship is unclear according to a few studies, such as ==== and ====, who investigate the relationship between polycentric spatial structure and regional income gaps. Unlike this study, these focused on urban or national spatial scales. There are specific reasons for our focus on urban clusters. In the context of globalization, international and regional competition has increasingly manifested as urban competition, especially in urban clusters with mega-cities as the core (====; ====Given the above arguments, we fill the existing research gap by examining urban clusters in China and the relationship between the polycentric spatial structure of urban clusters and the urban¨Crural income gap. We address three questions. First, does the polycentric spatial structure of urban clusters affect the income gap? Second, how does the polycentric spatial structure of urban clusters affect the income gap after considering differences in geographic location, city size, and urban clusters? Third, what are the effects of industrial development and infrastructure construction in urban clusters on the relationship between the polycentric spatial structure and the income gap?====Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, we fill a gap in research on the relationship between the spatial structure of polycentric urban clusters and the urban¨Crural income gap in China. We provide a new perspective and methodology for understanding the relationship between spatial structure and socioeconomic issues within urban clusters. The study finds that the polycentric development of urban clusters helps to narrow the urban¨Crural income gap. Furthermore, there is a ¡°U¡± shaped relationship between the degree of polycentricity and the urban¨Crural income gap, which provides an important reference for urban planning and economic development.====Second, our study proposes new ideas and mechanisms relating to the impact of urban cluster polycentric spatial structures on the urban¨Crural income gap. The results show that the role in reducing regional disparities played by the spatial structure of the urban clusters' polycenter includes factor flow and promoting industrial structure optimization; however, it is also constrained by industrial development and infrastructure construction. This finding broadens the understanding of the mechanism of spatial structure within urban clusters in influencing development, but also has practical policy implications.====Finally, we use the urban population at the end of the year and the number of ¡°ESCI,¡± ¡°SSCI¡± and ¡°SCI¡± journals in the official website of Web of Science as methodological indicators. The number of cooperating journals is used as an index to measure the degree of polycentricity of urban clusters in terms of ¡°morphological polycentricity¡± and ¡°functional polycentricity.¡± These two indices not only consider the diversity of spatial structures of urban clusters, but also provide references for other related studies.

And as ==== puts it, ¡°A group of Fintech firms are changing the way consumers borrow.¡±==== BNPL is often likened to a credit card that evaluates applicants in a fundamentally different, and more inclusive, way from traditional credit cards¡ªnamely, by accessing information sources such as payment history, digital footprint, and online social networks (====; ====). A large proportion of BNPL users (especially in China and such European countries as France and Sweden) did not have credit cards or credit scores¡ªand hence consumer credit¡ªbefore BNPL, and they are usually younger than 30.====Globally, BNPL is projected to account for $680 billion in transactions by 2025,====; ====; ====; ====), BNPL has not been, yet its FinTech aspect and inclusive consumer base make it different and warrant thorough investigation. As ====While credit card data is gathered and tracked by regulators, there is no publicly available database on BNPL-related consumer spending or debt levels because BNPL operates in a legal gray space without specific requirements for information disclosure. Therefore, we use a unique data set from an early experiment conducted by a representative FinTech company, Ant Group (hereafter ¡°Ant¡±), which owns Alipay, one of the most popular mobile payment tools in China. In June 2017, before its massive ==== of BNPL, Ant drew millions of mobile-payment users who were eligible for BNPL from its preexisting Alipay customer base, randomly assigned some of the users to a treatment group, and extended BNPL credit to them; it assigned the other eligible users to a control group, which was not offered credit. The unique experiment, combined with monthly consumption information obtained from Alipay users' payment records, allows us to estimate the causal effect of BNPL on consumption.====Although China is not the only setting in which we can investigate this issue, it possesses several notable features. First, in economies in which mobile payment is less popular, BNPL makes mobile payment more attractive and increases adoption,==== which might also boost expenditure and contaminate an evaluation of BNPL. In contrast, mobile payment boomed in China early¡ªfrom 2011 to 2015¡ªseveral years before the arrival of BNPL. In fact, the mobile-payment adoption rate among Chinese adults reached as high as 82% in 2017, and the growth rates in mobile-payment coverage and usage both decreased to nearly zero after that.==== Thus the Chinese setting enables us to focus on BNPL instead of mobile-payment adoption. Second, this experiment was conducted during the early stages of BNPL, when FinTech companies did not advertise and promote it; thus, ordinary Chinese people did not expect to be granted access to, nor were even aware of it. Third, since the demand for BNPL usually comes from financially underserved consumers, the extensive margin is more important than the intensive margin in capturing the overall effect. More than two-thirds of adults in China do not have a credit history and credit score, making it easier to evaluate the new credit facility's extensive margin there compared with the United States.==== While existing studies mainly focus on the consumption response of an increase in a preexisting credit limit (====; ====), our setting allows us to observe and assess the extensive margin of BNPL for consumers granted credit for the first time.====Based on a subsample of the experiment including 50,000 users from the treatment group and another 50,000 users from the control group, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effect of BNPL on the monthly total consumption.==== We first corroborate one of the specific findings in ==== that access to BNPL raised average monthly consumption. Notably, in the treatment group, 86.9% did not actually use the credit extended to them, but the credit line still significantly increased their consumption by RMB 42, or approximately 16.8% of average monthly consumption recorded in Alipay.====; ====; ====; ====).====We then discuss potential biases, payment-shifting behaviors, and other credit access. We find that, even after accounting for these concerns, the consumption-boosting effect is still significant both statistically and economically.====We move on to investigate several concerns and heterogeneity about the consumption-boosting effect of BNPL. While BNPL is situated in an e-commerce setting, we find that the treated users increase their consumption both online and off-line by economically meaningful magnitudes, which means the effect of BNPL spills over to the overall consumption bundle. Regarding possible excessive consumption due to BNPL, we find that the treated users mainly expand their expenditure on necessities instead of entertainment, which aligns with media reports on, and surveys of, young and low-income BNPL users.==== Further cross-sectional analyses show that the consumption-boosting effects are more pronounced for men, for younger, tech-savvy people, and for users in second-tier cities whose populations have more preexisting liquidity to spare.====Our findings have important implications. First, regulatory concerns about overspending and systematic risk due to BNPL have arisen worldwide. According to our study, at least during the early stage, the liquidity-insurance mechanism accounts for the bulk of the consumption-boosting effect. Our findings provides complementary evidence to ==== suggest that the credit offers are based on students' purchase patterns and find that online borrowing is prevalent among the students. Regulators should scrutinize these factors and issue appropriate regulatory requirements for BNPL industries.====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====); little is currently known about BNPL, apart from the work of ====. Second, most existing studies implicitly assume that only utilized credit can boost consumption and document a debt response alongside a spending response (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In contrast, our findings reveal that even unused credit can stimulate consumption without accompanying debt accumulation. We attribute this effect to a liquidity-insurance mechanism, which has been discussed in the corporate finance literature on credit lines (====; ====; ====) but has not been deeply explored in the consumer-finance literature. Finally, our research complements earlier studies on consumer credit (====; ====; ====). Because most consumers in our study were granted credit for the first time, we can assess the significance of FinTech-driven financial inclusion. Our findings align with those of ====, who examine first-time borrowers from a major European FinTech bank, thus reducing concerns about external validity.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In our models, BigTechs borrow debts to invest between socially efficient prudent assets and socially inefficient risky assets. Limited liabilities imply that with a higher capital adequacy ratio, BigTechs are more risk averse and favor the prudent asset more. Then we examine how better information of BigTechs will affect BigTechs' incentive for excessive risk-taking, welfare, and capital regulation. The major results produced by our models are as follows: (1) Better information of BigTechs does not eliminate and could in some circumstances exacerbate their excessive risk-taking behavior. (2) Better information of BigTechs does not necessarily improve welfare. BigTechs could employ better information to more precisely identify the socially inefficient risky asset to invest in, causing more severe resource misallocation. (3) Capital regulation is an effective tool to curb BigTechs' excessive risk-taking and to ensure that better information of BigTechs will improve welfare.",".) BigTechs have technological advantages in collecting and processing information, especially the information about small firms and consumers that are under-served or unserved by traditional financial intermediaries (FIs hereafter) such as banks. A large body of empirical work has found that BigTechs have information advantages over banks.==== According to ==== Whereas some argue that BigTechs should be regulated less stringently than traditional FIs because they are equipped with more advanced information technologies.==== This debate is at the center of the IPO suspension of Ant Group in 2020, which motivates us to build theoretical models to address an important issue: What should be the appropriate regulation for BigTechs providing financial intermediation services?==== In this paper, we focus on one of the regulation tools that is most relevant to BigTechs, capital requirements. Specifically, we build theoretical models to examine whether or not BigTechs should be subject to the same capital requirements as traditional FIs.====The key to answering this question is to understand (1) why FIs need capital requirements; and (2) what is the difference between BigTechs and traditional FIs. The economic rationale behind capital regulation for FIs is as follows. Due to asymmetric information in financial intermediation and limited liabilities, FIs tend to take excessive risk, which is socially inefficient. A sufficiently high capital adequacy ratio discourages FIs' excessive risk-taking, which is socially beneficial. This economic rationale can be applied to BigTechs in financial intermediation as well because, in essence, they use the same business model as traditional FIs. That is, similar to traditional FIs, BigTechs make profits by borrowing at a lower interest rate and investing in assets with higher return rates. However, BigTechs do differ from traditional FIs by having more advanced information technology.====Thus, we establish theoretical models where BigTechs are modeled as FIs with better information. Specifically, following ====, we assume that FIs (BigTechs) borrow debts to invest between two types of assets: a prudent asset with a higher probability to succeed and a higher expected rate of return; and a risky asset with a lower probability to succeed and a lower expected rate of return. Thus, the prudent asset is more socially efficient. With the perfect information about the returns of the two assets, the FIs will favor the prudent asset over the risky one if and only if its capital adequacy ratio exceeds a threshold level. This is because with more capital at stake, the FIs will lose more if an asset fails. As a result, the FIs will favor the prudent asset more because of its lower probability to fail.==== Thus, our model adopts the economic rationale behind capital regulation for FIs as previously mentioned.====Next, we introduce imperfect information to the model by assuming that an FI does not know for sure the type of an asset. Instead, it has a screening technology that helps identify the type of an asset: By incurring a screening cost, the FI will receive a signal for an asset about its type. A good (bad) signal signifies that the asset is more likely to be a prudent (risky) asset. This assumption allows us to study how better information affects the FI's incentive for risk-taking and in turn capital regulation. Here better information is interpreted as a higher precision of the signal, which helps FIs identify the type of an asset with more certainty.====In such a setup, we study the capital regulation policy. Here we measure social welfare by aggregate returns, which are defined as total returns yielded by all the assets in the economy deducted by the fixed cost that FIs incur when screening the assets. We believe that aggregate returns are an appropriate measure for welfare because it gives total resources available to all the economic agents in the economy. Thus, a socially efficient allocation should maximize aggregate returns in the economy. The optimal capital regulation policy should aim at a socially efficient allocation. In particular, we examine how the improvement of FIs' information technology will affect the capital regulation policy. We first examine a one-period model that illustrates the core idea of this paper. Then we extend it to an infinite-period model to examine how the concern for charter value will affect FIs' behavior and capital regulation. Finally, we extend the one-period model by introducing multiple dimensions of uncertainty. In this model, besides the uncertainty about the degree of riskiness of an asset, we introduce additional uncertainty about an asset. Specifically, we assume that among assets with a similar degree of riskiness, some yield higher returns than others. We call the former a high-quality asset and the latter a low-quality asset. FIs cannot perfectly distinguish a high-quality asset from a low-quality one. We believe that the introduction of the second uncertainty captures the fact that with more advanced information technology, BigTechs can select better borrowers among risky low-income borrowers that are under-served by traditional FIs. As a result, BigTechs improve financial inclusion by lending to these borrowers. Thus, in this model FIs' information technology produces two signals, one to signify the degree of riskiness of an asset as in the previous models, and the other to signify the quality (return) of an asset. In this model, better information is interpreted as a higher precision of either signal.====Our models produce the following major results.====First, in all the three models, we find that an FI will invest in an asset with a good signal if and only if its capital exceeds a threshold level, regardless of the precision of its signal. Thus, our models demonstrate that better information does not eliminate BigTechs' incentive for excessive risk-taking. Thus, capital regulation has to be in place for BigTechs to prevent their excessive risk-taking behavior.====Second, in the extended one-period model, we find that the threshold level of capital that induces an FI to invest in an asset with a good signal could even increase as the FI's information becomes more precise. Thus, our models suggests that better information of BigTechs can even exacerbate their excessive risk-taking behavior.====The intuition behind this result is as follows. In the extended one-period model where we consider multidimensional information, better information can affect an FI's expected profit from assets with good and bad signals ====. In case information improvement favors an asset with a bad signal over one with a good signal, the threshold level of capital for the FI to invest in an asset with a good signal becomes higher. This result suggests that better information of BigTechs could alleviate or exacerbate their excessive risk-taking behavior, depending on how it affects BigTechs' expected profits from prudent and risky assets relatively.====Third, in all the three models, we find that without proper capital regulation in place, better information of BigTechs will not necessarily improve welfare. Specifically, so long as capital is below the threshold level that induces an FI to choose an asset with a good signal, more precise information in fact helps FIs better identify the risky asset to invest in, resulting in more resources allocated in the socially inefficient risky asset. In particular, when better information exacerbates FIs' excessive risk-taking behavior and raises the threshold level of capital for FIs to invest in the asset with a good signal, better information can cause a discontinuous substantial drop in social welfare at certain capital levels. This is because at these capital levels, the FIs used to invest in the asset with a good signal. However, better information increases their incentive for risk-taking and induces them to switch to investing in the asset with a bad signal, causing more resources allocated in the risky assets. We find this result is of importance because it suggests that proper capital regulation is the key to ensuring that better information of BigTechs will indeed improve social welfare. Otherwise, BigTechs could potentially employ their better information to do more damage to the economy, which justifies the concern for potential financial instability caused by the lack of capital regulation for BigTechs.====In sum, our models provide theoretical guidance for BigTechs' capital regulation. The key takeaway is that better information of BigTechs does not eliminate their incentive for excessive risk-taking. In certain circumstances, more advanced information technology may even exacerbate their risk-taking behavior. In this case, BigTechs could employ their better information to better identify socially inefficient risky assets to advance their own interest, causing even more severe resource misallocation. Capital regulation as an effective tool to curb this incentive ensures that better information of BigTechs will promote more efficient resource allocation and improve social welfare. Note that the findings of our study can be applied not only to the Chinese market but also to the financial markets all over the world. This is because we build an abstract model where BigTechs are assumed to be financial intermediaries with more advanced information technologies. This assumption captures the key characteristic of BigTechs in financial intermediation, regardless of the countries they are located in.====Our paper is related to several strands of literature. It is first related to the literature on capital regulation of traditional FIs such as banks.==== In particular, our paper is closely related to ====. We adopt the basic setup in their model with some simplification. Our models differ from theirs by extending their model with perfect information to ones with imperfect information. That is, in our models, FIs have imperfect information about the type of each asset. By doing so, we can examine how better information of BigTechs affects their risk-taking behavior, capital regulation, and social welfare.====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, and ==== among many others. ==== and ==== argue that existing regulations should be applied to FinTechs based on the service they provide, which they call ¡°a case by case regulatory approach¡±. Our models adopt this view by treating BigTechs in financial intermediation as FIs. ==== argues that regulations on BigTechs and FinTechs will affect the competition between them and traditional banks. Regulators must find a balance between encouraging new entry to promote competition and offering a level playing field for all the participants in financial intermediation. Many policy discussions vocalize concerns for potential financial instability caused by rapid growth of BigTechs and FinTechs in finance.(See, e.g., ==== and ====.) Our models reveal that without proper capital regulation BigTechs could indeed employ better information for excessive risk-taking, causing financial instability.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces a one-period model and examines its policy implications. ==== introduces an infinite-period model and examines its policy implications. ==== extends the one-period model with one dimension of uncertainty to one with multidimensional uncertainty. ==== concludes.====Proof: An FI will choose project ==== if and only if====where ==== and ==== are given by Eqs. ====, ====, respectively.

Most mobility studies focus on two adjacent generations (====; ====; ====). Besides data limitations, this focus is partly driven by the possibility that the intergenerational transmission of social status may be approximated by a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process. If true, it means that multi-generational mobility (that is, the persistence of social status across multiple generations) can be extrapolated from mobility over two consecutive generations at a geometric rate (====). Recent evidence shows that the intergenerational process can substantially deviate from an AR(1) process (see ==== for a review) and that multi-generational mobility has to be directly measured. While there have been many multi-generational mobility estimates for developed countries, evidence from developing countries is largely missing. This paper uses a nationally representative household survey to estimate three-generational educational mobility in China and establishes its trend for grandchildren born between 1950 and 1990.====Researchers have pointed to the study of diverse social institutions as a way to understand the mechanisms of social mobility (====). Among the proposed mechanisms of multi-generational mobility, some argue that grandparents could affect grandchildren through direct influence (====; ====) or uncles and aunts (====). The closer ties among extended families in China present an opportunity for international comparison, which can shed light on the theoretical discussion. Furthermore, in the past century, China has experienced World War II (1937¨C1945), the Civil War (1945¨C1949), the planned economy era (1949¨C1978), the Cultural Revolution (1966¨C1976), and the period of economic reform (since 1978). This turbulent history has created significant variations in two-generational mobility across time (====; ====; ====). We aim to answer two research questions by studying multi-generational mobility in China. First, does China, a developing country with cultures and institutions different from developed Western countries, display substantially different multi-generational educational mobility (multi-generational mobility henceforth)? Second, do the significant changes in China's two-generational mobility across birth cohorts translate into large variations in the correlation of education levels between grandparents and children?====Analyzing a nationally representative household survey, we find that the persistence of education between grandparents and children is higher than the extrapolations of the persistence between two consecutive generations. Furthermore, grandparents' education still has an economically important and statistically significant effect on children's education after controlling for parents' education (we call this the direct grandparent effect hereafter). Along the male lineage, the ratio of the direct paternal grandfather effect to the father effect is estimated to be 20%. These results show that educational mobility in China does not follow an AR(1) process.====An international comparison with existing studies shows that the direct grandparent effect in China, relative to the parent effect, is within the range of estimates from other countries. The similarity between China and Western countries is somewhat surprising, considering Chinese grandparents, relative to their Western counterparts, are more involved in their grandchildren's upbringing (====). Next, we study the time trends of intergenerational mobility up to three generations (G1 for grandparents, G2 for parents, and G3 for children) and how the trend in two-generational mobility translates into three-generational mobility. We confirm that two-generational educational persistence exhibits a pronounced U-shape for cohorts of children born between 1925 and 1990 (that is, mobility first increases, then decreases), with the lowest point appearing for children born in the mid-1950s. In the three-generation sample, the second generation is mostly born on the downslope of the U-shaped curve, and the third generation on the upslope. The decreasing educational persistence between the first and second generations partially negates the increasing persistence between the second and third generations. The resulting three-generational mobility trend is relatively stable.====When exploring mechanisms, we find potential explanations for why the direct grandparent effect in China is not stronger than what is found in developed countries. We first check whether additional information in the parents' generation, which is usually not included in previous studies, accounts for the direct grandparent effect. To this end, we include a rich set of parental characteristics and controls for the social status of uncles and aunts. The grandparent effect decreases by 63% and becomes statistically insignificant with the full set of controls. In other words, the omitted information on the second generation is an important driver of the observed direct grandparent effect because the grandparent education acts through them or as proxies for them. We then explore the possibility of grandparent effects emerging through direct interaction. We find no consistent evidence that grandparents with more direct interaction with their grandchildren have stronger direct grandparent effects. Considering these two sets of results, we conclude that direct grandparent-child interaction is not the main driver of the observed grandparent effect, which may explain why closer ties between grandparents and grandchildren in China do not result in a stronger direct grandparent effect relative to Western countries.====This study makes several contributions to the literature. First, we are the first to provide three-generational mobility estimates for China that are comparable with the international literature. ==== study the effect of the Communist Revolution on social stratification in China. Their specification regresses G3's education on the deviation of G2's education from G1. This is not a commonly used three-generational mobility measure and cannot be readily adopted in cross-country comparisons. ==== utilize the data from rural China and G3 children who live in the same household as G2 to estimate three-generational mobility. Their sample does not include urban China and likely suffers from the co-residency bias (====). We show that the grandparent effect in China is within the range of estimates from other Western countries. China's unique cultural and institutional environments do not create an outlier in multi-generational education mobility. Second, we show that the drastic changes in two-generational mobility in China do not translate into equally drastic fluctuations in multi-generational mobility. Third, our exploration of mechanisms shows that the observed grandparent effect can mostly be explained by omitted characteristics of the second generation. Grandparent-child interaction does not enhance the grandparent effect.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 provides the conceptual framework. Section 4 introduces the data source and data processing procedures.

Similar increases in grades have also been observed in Canada, France, and Sweden, among many other countries (====). Such an increase raises concerns on the validity of grading practice and the consequence of grade inflation. Unfortunately, most educators agree that escalation of grades today does not result from improvement of teaching quality or learning skills (====).====Grades intend to communicate valuable information. Therefore, grade inflation leads to a range of economic and social consequences for students, schools, and society. In particular, even if lenient grading offers an attractive signal in subsequent academic career and job hunting (====), it is highly likely to reduce students' motivation to exert effort in later stages (====). Moreover, grade inflation erodes a school's reputation (====) and increases the friction of talent matching (====).====However, the potential reasons for grade inflation havenot been well explored. Present studies have mainly used descriptive analysis and mostly focused on grade inflation at higher education levels (====; ====; ====; ====). Only a few quantitative analyses have been conducted on grade inflation caused by temporary teachers (====; ====; ====). Accordingly, several mechanisms may contribute to grade inflation. (1) ====. Structural differences across courses may cause grade inflation, which may lead to markedly lenient grading (====). Some teachers with onerous tasks may resist spending most of their office hours justifying low grades on assignments or examinations, and thereby simply give high grades to avoid possible conflicts and contradictions (====). (2) ==== Teachers may also practice grade inflation out of consideration for students. Some educators acknowledge that students now face excessive academic burdens and social pressures, thus teachers may find grade inflation preferable for students' psychological feelings (====). (3) ====. Teachers play a decisive role in students' grades, however, teacher evaluations largely depend on student performance in turn. That is, teachers may practice grade inflation for job reasons such as job security and financial benefits (====). This phenomenon may be more prominent for female teachers who are faced with considerable discrimination and uncertainty in the labor market (====). For example, women receive significantly lower teaching evaluations from students than their male colleagues (====; ====). Studies have also found that female faculty members are less likely to receive tenure, recognition, and credit than their male counterparts (====). ==== also shows that compared to male teachers, female teachers are less likely to obtain a high-level title, administrative status, and award.====Mounting evidence has documented that teacher gender plays a non-negligible role in students' grades (====; ====; ====). However, few studies have explored the causal relationship between teacher gender and grade inflation, and almost no discussion on grade inflation at secondary education level. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the relationship between teacher gender and grade inflation at secondary education level. The closest literature to us is ====¡¯s work. Rather than higher education, the immense benefit of our setting is that the obligatory subject curriculum in secondary education reduces manipulation on the choice of teachers. Moreover, the research on secondary education is important as dynamic formation of human capital dictates that early educational experience may matter more (====). In addition to different learning stage, our research also differs from theirs as follows. First, we conduct more sensitivity analysis to test the cause of high grades, such as using the value-added model and controlling for average scores, etc. Second, we further consider the potential underlying mechanisms under grade inflation, such as course setting, student psychology, and job reasons. Third, we also explore the impact of grade inflation on students' behaviors in the later stage.====Specifically, the randomly assigned samples from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS, a representative survey on Chinese middle school students) has enabled us to clearly distinguish the impact of teacher gender on students' grades. We find that (1) Students taught by female teachers obtain 1.57 grades point higher compared with those taught by male teachers. High grades are not the result of students learning real knowledge, but the result of grade inflation. (2) Female teachers practice grade inflation for different students, and the effect is more pronounced among female students, low-ability students, and students in senior grades. (3) Female teachers may adopt a high-grades practice due to potential pressures under discrimination and uncertainty rather than for the sake of course or students. (4) Last, high grades brought by female teachers lead to less effort for students in the second year.====Our findings may contribute to present studies in three ways. First, we verify that female teachers have a significant positive impact on students' grades, providing a new factor of grade inflation from the perspective of teacher characteristics (====; ====). We also deeply explore the real impact of teacher gender on students' achievements and provide another insight into high grades with female teachers rather than role model in previous studies (====; ====; ====). Second, most studies on grade inflation have explored the phenomenon at higher education level (====; ====; ====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the data and variables. ==== provides our conceptual model. ==== presents a series of empirical results. ==== concludes the study.====Higher grades may be correlated with more favorable outcomes for female teachers. Referring to ====, we use the panel data feature in investigating the title upgrading==== among teachers. Taking the job promotion as the explained variable (1?=?the teacher gets promoted compared to the first wave, 0?=?otherwise), we take the sample of teacher as unit ====. The core explanatory variables turn to the gender of teacher ====, average grades taught by teacher ==== at year ====, and the interaction term of these two variables. The coefficient of the interaction term ==== is of our main focus, reflecting whether female teachers experience a significant higher probability of being promoted for higher grades compared with their male counterparts.==== represents the job promotion of subject ==== for teacher ==== in school ==== at year ====, ==== means the gender of teacher ==== (1?=?female, 0?=?male), ==== indicates the average grades of subject ==== given by teacher ==== in school ==== at year ====, and ==== stands for teacher characteristics of teacher ==== as the baseline model. Moreover, we control for the school-by-subject ==== fixed effect, and ==== means the error term. Standard errors are clustered at the class level.====Consistent with our hypothesis, female teachers have a higher probability of being promoted for high grades compared with their male colleagues. This result may be the case why female teachers are more likely to practice grade inflation. However, due to data restriction, above results need to be interpreted carefully. Specifically, as we do not have direct information about the real motivation of grade inflation, we provide these tests as complementary evidence as well as a suggestion for future work.",Are female teachers more likely to practice grade inflation?

The results show that experiencing one more hot day relative to local historical contemporaneous average values during pregnancy significantly increases the likelihood of mental health disorders in adolescence. The impact is larger in the first and second trimesters. Individuals born in the northern region and whose mothers work in agriculture are more vulnerable to high temperatures. Prenatal exposure to hot days is more harmful to the mental health of older adolescents. Additionally, the adverse effects are similar for both men and women and individuals with rural and urban hukou. Biological effects, income effects, and human capital accumulation might be three operative channels of the impact. These findings add to the evidence on the lasting health effects of early life exposure to climatic shocks and call for policy interventions during pregnancy.","Mental health disorders are causing huge economic losses and posing threats to the lives of younger and younger people.==== Adolescence is a critical period of human brain growth and life development, closely related to changes in behavior and social interaction, maturation of brain structure and cognitive, and maturity of consciousness (====; ====). Therefore, many lifetime disorders and psychological disorders first manifest during adolescence (====). The detrimental effects of mental health disorders during childhood and adolescence on future's health and economic outcomes are more important and larger than that of common physical health problems (====; ====; ====). However, due to inadequate health care and government health expenditure and insufficient awareness, adolescents are more severely affected by mental health disorders than physical health problems in low- and middle-income countries.==== The overall prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 is 17.5% in China (====). Limited and underdeveloped treatment and support services for adolescents' mental health disorders, combined with the accelerated pace of life and the increasingly fierce social competition, have exacerbated the mental health problems of Chinese adolescents. Therefore, it is urgent to comprehensively explore the factors affecting adolescent mental health and take early interventions. Although many economic researchers have paid attention to the impact of exposure contemporaneous economic, environmental, and climate shocks on mental health, little is known about early-life determinants, particularly environmental conditions.====Global warming has become a considerable concern and attracted widespread attention of scholars and policymakers.==== The recent economic literature has found that extreme heat is an important environmental risk that impairs adult mental health (====; ====). As the world's largest carbon emitter, China has experienced a noticeable rise in temperature with an average temperature warming rate of 0.26==== per decade from 1951 to 2020 (====). China's warming rate is higher than the global average rate over the same period, and the impact of climate change in China is particularly pronounced. In Chinese meteorology, high temperature is defined as daily maximum temperature reaching >35====.==== The existing literature shows that high temperature refers to daily average temperature above 30==== (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Air conditioning is one of the most important avoidance behaviors against high temperatures. Due to the backward level of economic development and technology, the penetration rate of air conditioning in China in the last century was much lower than that of developed countries. Residents of developing countries are more vulnerable to high temperatures than those of developed countries because adaptation facilities are generally more limited.====This paper estimates the impacts of prenatal exposure to temperatures on adolescent mental health using a unique dataset from the 2010 wave of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). The CFPS 2010 provides detailed individual birth information, self-reported mental health status, and other demographic characteristics for 3045 individuals from 25 provinces. We use the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) instrument to measure self-reported mental health status. Based on birth of city and month, we merge individual dataset with city-level meteorological dataset. We find that exposure to high temperatures during pregnancy significantly increases the frequency of depressive symptoms in teens after including other meteorological variables, individual and parental demographic characteristics, and a series of two-way fixed effects. These impacts are more pronounced in the first and second trimesters. An extreme hot day in spring and autumn has a greater negative impact than that in summer during pregnancy.====Our main findings remain unchanged after conducting several robustness checks across various dimensions, including alternative fixed effects and clusters, alternative dependent and independent variables, alternative temperature intervals and sample, and placebo tests. Age heaping doesn't confound our main findings. Additionally, we rule out confounding factors of selective mortality, selective fertility, migration, and adaptive tools that may response to temperatures and drive our results of mental health. In addition, the adverse effects of prenatal exposure to high temperatures are larger for adolescents born in the northern region and whose mothers work in farming. Older adolescents are more sensitive to high temperatures. Heterogeneous effects are absent across gender and hukou status. We also provide evidence that exposure to heat waves during in utero period reduces subjective happiness.====We then explore the influencing channels through which prenatal exposure to high temperatures affect adolescent mental health, including biological effects, income effects, and human capital accumulation. First, we show that exposure to high temperatures significantly reduces birth weight. Second, we check whether exposure to high temperatures affects annual net household income and the proportion of annual net household agricultural income. All the coefficients are significantly negative. Third, we explore the link between in utero exposure to extreme hot temperatures and test scores. The results suggest that prenatal exposure to heat waves significantly decreases cognitive performance during adolescence. Finally, we rule out other contemporary shocks, such as household shocks, household size, physical illness, and individual negative behaviors. Our mechanism analyses provide suggestive evidence for the biological effects, income effects, and human capital accumulation, which might be the main channels behind the deteriorating impact of in utero hot days exposure on adolescent mental health.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, it may be the first study to explore the relationship between exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy and adolescent mental health disorders by coupling meteorological variables with an individual dataset from a nationally representative survey in the largest developing country. Although existing literature examines the effects of temperatures on self-reported mental health and expressed sentiment (====; ====; ====; ====), they mostly focus on the contemporary short-term effects of ambient temperature fluctuations in developed countries. Only limited research explores the day-to-day impacts of temperatures on individuals' expressed sentiment and the annual effects of temperature variability on individuals' depressive status in China. ==== demonstrates the association between an increase in temperature variability and higher probabilities of depression. ==== also suggests that temperature extremes lead to a reduction in city-level expressed sentiment constructed by social media posts. In this paper, we use the K6 score to capture symptoms of depression and mental disorders and explore whether prenatal exposure to high temperatures have long-lasting impacts on adolescent mental health status.====This paper is in line with ====, which finds that one degree warmer than the local historical average in the calendar year before the year of birth increases depressive symptoms in adults using self-reported depression and anxiety data for 19 African countries. We and ==== are interested in estimating the impact of exposure to temperatures during gestational period on mental health outcomes - but focus on individuals of different ages (adolescents aged 10¨C15 versus adults aged 18 or older) in different countries (China versus African countries). The conclusions of this paper and ==== consistently demonstrate that elevated temperatures during pregnancy impair mental health in adolescence and adulthood. This paper finds that experiencing an additional day with daily average temperature over 30==== during pregnancy (9?months prior to birth) relative to local historical average values significantly increases the K6 score by 0.05 points compared with a day in the 20¨C25==== bin. Our conclusions are in line with ====, we construct new indicators of mental health and temperatures to re-estimate the linear and nonlinear relationships between prenatal exposure to temperatures and adolescent mental health in ====. Our coefficients are larger than that of ====. Additionally, ==== uses an OLS model with temperature point and year of birth fixed effects and a vector of country time trends to explore the linear effects of in utero temperature in the year before birth, whereas this paper constructs the variables for the number of days with daily average temperature falling into eight 5==== temperature bins to explore the nonlinear effects of exposure to temperatures on mental health status. On the one hand, while there has been much research using nonlinear does-response function to explore whether extreme temperatures have larger impacts on physical health outcomes, little is known to the nonlinear link between temperature and mental health status. The existing studies have found that the health hazards of extreme temperatures are much greater than the average effect. This paper extends previous literature on the nonlinear relationship between temperature and health. On the other hand, the increased risk of frequent extreme weather shocks, such as persistent hot temperatures and heat waves, is an important threat to climate change, causing greater economic losses. Therefore, investigating the effects of extreme temperatures provides empirical evidence for policymakers and residents to formulate policies and take adaptive measures to reduce the hazards of climate change. A nonlinear does-response function can capture the effects of extreme temperatures.====This paper is also closest to ====. Based on the same data source (CFPS) and estimation specification, we investigate the nonlinear relationship between temperatures and the K6 score in China. But we focus on the effects of temperatures experienced at different times (pregnancy versus 30?days before the survey) on mental health of different individuals (adolescents aged 10¨C15 versus adults aged above 16). On the one hand, adolescence is an important transition period from childhood to adulthood. The mental health of adolescents is crucial to cultivating personality, forming spirit quality, and establishing ideals and beliefs. Effective early prevention and intervention of mental health problems in adolescence can help reduce health problems and welfare losses in adulthood. On the other hand, estimates for Chinese adults may not be simply extrapolated to Chinese adolescents due to different natural conditions and socioeconomic backgrounds, including natural adaptation to temperature shocks, living conditions, the levels of health care, and the awareness of mental health disorders. In addition, we deviate our interested meteorological variables from local historical contemporaneous average values. But these core meteorological variables in the previous 30?days used by ==== are not deviated from historical contemporaneous values. ==== finds that an additional day with daily average temperature over 30==== experienced one month before the survey date leads to an increase in the K6 score by 0.21 points. The absolute value is 4.2 times larger than the estimated coefficient of this paper. This difference may be due to the fact that we focus on different indicators of high temperatures during different periods. We further compare the results by using changes in standard deviations. The difference becomes smaller.====Second, the main finding of this paper extends to a growing economic literature on ¡°fetal origins hypothesis¡± that early life conditions have profound effects on later life outcomes (====). A large body of literature has provided empirical evidence for the persistent adverse effects of early life negative shocks, such as high temperatures in utero (====), water drinking in utero (====), extreme floods in utero and in infancy (====), Ramadan in utero (====), infectious diseases in early childhood (====), hunger episodes in childhood (====; ====), and wars in childhood (====).==== Additionally, several studies have also found that prenatal exposure to temperature shocks has negative effects on birth outcomes in both developed and developing countries (====; ====; ====). This paper complements the existing literature by investigating the medium-term impact of exposure to hot weather during pregnancy on adolescent mental health. The adverse effects of prenatal shocks on welfare losses extend from birth and childhood through adolescence into adulthood. Income effects, family inputs, and fetal selection have been empirically confirmed to be the main channels behind these adverse effects (====; ====; ====). Our mechanism analyses provide suggestive evidence that physiological and biological effects, income effects, and human capital accumulation may be the main channels through which exposure to high temperatures in utero period affects adolescent mental health after excluding other contemporary shocks and selection issues, calling for health care for pregnant women.====Third, this paper adds to the literature on the early life determinants of mental health by investigating the link between prenatal exposure to high temperatures and adolescent mental health. Despite mounting research on the effects of a variety of contemporaneous economic and climatic shocks,==== little is known about how early life shocks exposure drives individuals' mental health status. ==== and ==== are two exceptions, who find that early life income shocks (cocoa price fluctuations) and exposure to conflicts (American war in Vietnam) significantly have enduring effects on adult mental health. Understanding the early life contributors to mental health is crucial for early intervention and prevention of mental illness.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe data source and present summary statistics in ====. Empirical specification is presented in ====. ==== reports the empirical results and rules out selection issues.

Using a matched dataset of firms' production and custom data, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits firms' differential pre-event exposures to the policy. We find that the subsidy policy increases firms' imports of subsidized products, and improves their export quality. Furthermore, export quality improvements due to capital goods imports are larger if (1) firms are more productive; (2) the exporting product is the firm's core product; (3) the product is a differentiated good; and (4) the destination market is larger and richer. Further analysis suggests that capital goods imports can also boost firms' total exports and the number of exporting destinations and products. The mechanism tests reveal that capital-skill complementarity can explain improved export product quality through capital goods imports. Capital goods imports also lead to increased skill management that can improve export quality as well."," However, importing capital goods is often constrained by firms' internal and external financial resources. Gathering information from foreign markets, establishing relationships with foreign suppliers, and purchasing capital goods all incur substantial costs that prevent firms from accessing advanced foreign technologies (====). At the beginning of 2008, the Chinese government announced an import subsidy policy for firms importing products from a specified product list consisting mainly of capital goods. This paper exploits this subsidy policy as a quasi-natural experiment and investigates how increased capital goods imports would influence firms' export product quality upgrading at the micro-level.====In September 2007, the ¡°====This subsidy policy provides a quasi-natural experiment setting that allows us to empirically investigate firms' production responses to a policy shock that lowers firms' cost of purchasing certain capital goods. In particular, we focus on a sample of firms that engage in importing and exporting simultaneously and investigate changes in their export product quality in response to the policy. Studying the determinants of export quality upgrading is of great economic importance. For many developing countries, including China, expansion of the exporting sector is a driving force for economic growth and structural transformation. Improvements in export product quality can boost export performance and further accelerate economic growth.====How can imports of capital goods promote the upgrading of export product quality? First, capital-embodied technology can directly improve firms' productivity and thus output performances. The literature in the field of neoclassical theory shows that improvements in technical progress are embodied in newly-introduced machinery and equipment, which are key to long-run productivity movements (====; ====). The importance of imported capital goods on productivity growth has also been examined in previous literature (====; ====). The second and indirect channel is through the complementarity between capital and skilled labor. Imports of capital goods could promote skill-biased technical changes, which could boost firms' demand for skills in production. ==== reveal that skill demands for jobs rise with the introduction of computers. Using employer-employee linked data from Hungaria, ==== show that importing of capital goods is an important source of skill-biased technical change. ==== denotes that capital accumulation combined with capital-skill complementarity can explain around two-thirds of the gap in sectoral labor productivity growth. Most closely related to the current research, ==== show that input quality upgrading due to trade liberalization results in an increase in demand for skilled labor, which may jointly boost firms' output quality. Therefore, both the direct productivity channel and the indirect capital-skill complementarity channel predict that increased capital goods imports would improve export product quality. In what follows, we give an outline for our empirical analysis to test the above prediction.====We start our empirical analysis by constructing a matched dataset using China's Annual Survey of Industrial Firms, which contains firm-level financial information, and customs data that documents transaction-level imports and exports information. In particular, we focus on the post-WTO period from 2002 to 2013 to avoid changes brought about by WTO entrance. From official documents, we can obtain the harmonized system (HS) code list for the subsidized capital goods. Using this information, we employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy to compare firms' imports of subsidized and non-subsidized products in the pre- and post-policy periods. We find that in the post-policy years, the rise of subsidized goods import values is roughly 30% higher than that of non-subsidized goods. Especially, this effect is driven mainly by the increase in import quantity rather than import prices.====Second, we study responses in firms' export quality to the subsidy policy with export quality measures constructed following ==== and ====. We construct a time-invariant subsidy share measure that captures firms' share of imported subsidized capital goods over the total imported capital goods in the pre-policy period. This measure captures the degree to which a firm is affected by the policy in the post-policy period. Using this measure, we also implement a DiD strategy to study export quality responses at the firm-product-destination-year level. The empirical results reveal that firms more affected by the policy experience a larger increase in export quality. This result also holds when we include more controls and use alternative export quality measures.====The existence of endogeneity issues could potentially confound baseline findings. For instance, subsidized goods may differ systematically from non-subsidized goods, thus making the positive relationship between capital goods imports and export quality upgrading a spurious correlation, rather than the causal impact of the policy. Moreover, firms may anticipate the subsidy policy and adjust their import/export behaviors in the pre-policy periods. To test whether these factors confound the baseline results, we conduct an ====After establishing the causal link between the subsidy policy and import/export outcomes, we continue to examine heterogeneous responses to the policy in terms of firms', products', and export destinations' characteristics. Several interesting patterns emerge. First, firms with larger initial sizes and higher initial productivity tend to import more subsidized capital goods, but only high-productivity firms can effectively use advanced capital goods to upgrade their export quality. The R&D investment, on the other hand, serves as a substitute for capital goods imports. Second, export product quality upgrading is differentially stronger for products exported to larger and richer destination markets. Third, quality upgrading is more pronounced for firms' core products and differentiated products. The last two patterns suggest that firms strategically employ capital goods to enhance their competitive advantages.====In addition to export quality upgrading, we examine other aspects of firms' export performance. We find that firms more affected by the policy would experience an increase in their total exports, the number of HS-6d products exported, and the number of destination countries they export to. These findings provide additional evidence that increases in capital goods imports improve firms' overall production capacity. Moreover, export sales tend to be more concentrated in key destination markets and products, following the subsidy policy.====Finally, we empirically test whether the indirect capital-skill complementary channel contributes to export product quality upgrading. By exploiting cross-regional variations in skilled-labor abundance, we find that firms located in skilled-labor-abundant cities can benefit more from the import subsidy policy, which offers suggestive evidence for quality upgrading through the ==== channel. Additionally, such complementarity also exists between the imports of advanced capital goods and skilled managers. We also exclude the possibility that firms may realize product upgrading through relaxed financial constraints following the subsidy policy.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Studies at the firm level have confirmed the productivity-promoting effects of capital goods imports (====; ====; ====). However, few studies discuss the impact of capital goods imports on firms' export performance, in particular, export quality upgrading. We study this issue using China's import subsidy policy for capital goods imports as a quasi-natural experiment.====This paper also closely relates to the vast literature studying the determinants of export product quality. ==== classifies the determinants of firm-level upgrading into demand-side and supply-side factors. There exists literature confirming the strong link between the income levels of exporting destinations and firms' export quality (====; ====), which are demand-side determinants. On the supply side, ==== find that decreases in import tariffs could expand firms' volume and scope of exports. ==== show that an increase in imported intermediates would improve export quality, and ==== further find that the impact is especially pronounced for initially low-productivity firms. ==== emphasize the complementarity between high-quality imported inputs and skilled labor, which jointly improves output quality. However, most literature in this field ignores the different effects of intermediates imports and capital goods imports. ==== fill this gap by studying the distinctive productivity-improving effects of intermediate imports and capital goods imports, and they find a substantially larger productivity effect caused by capital goods imports. Our paper puts a new spin on the previous findings by establishing the causal link between capital goods imports and export quality upgrading.====; ====). There is also literature focusing on trade policies implemented by a specific country. For instance, ==== find the substantial export-promoting impact of Turkey's export subsidy loan program in 2012 using firm-level data. ==== estimate the positive impact of Nepal's Cash Incentive Scheme for Exports program on targeted product-destination cells' extensive margins using customs transaction data. ==== use China's value-added tax (VAT) reform in 2004 as a quasi-natural policy experiment and find that VAT rebates exert significant effects on firms' export volumes. Nonetheless, many country-specific trade policies aim to promote exports, since exports play a larger role in increasing firms' international market size and providing more domestic job opportunities. This paper contributes to this strand of the literature by investigating the consequences of the subsidy policy for capital goods imports.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== presents the background of the import subsidy policy. ==== introduces the measurement construction for the key variables and the empirical strategies. ==== describes the data used for empirical analysis. ==== presents and interprets our main results and ==== presents heterogeneous analysis. ==== further tests potential channels driving quality upgrading following the adoption of key capital goods and ==== concludes.",Imports of key capital goods and quality upgrading: Evidence from China's import subsidy policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000731,9-May-23,2023,Research Article,14

To address the ==== of family size, we use the indicator of twins at first birth as an ====. Our results suggest that in nuclear households, family size affects the labor market performance only of mothers, not of fathers, with the negative effects fading and gradually disappearing over time. More specifically, an increase in family size decreases female labor supply in the 1990 wave, leads to lower prestige scores among working mothers in the 2000 wave, and has no impact on labor supply or occupational prestige scores in the 2010 wave. Our subsample analysis indicates that the negative effects of family size are more severe for parents of households with all children under seven years old and for husbands or wives with lower education level than that of their partners. In addition, we find that the negative effects of family size on parental labor market outcomes are not observed in extended households, especially when no ==== are aged 65?years or older.","It has been widely observed that family size has negative effects on the labor market performance of parents, especially mothers. For example, an increase in the number of children reduces mothers¡¯ labor supply (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====) and wages (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====), and has almost no impact on fathers¡¯ labor market outcomes (====). One possible explanation for this is that mothers usually play a more important role in childbearing and childrearing in a household. Thus, when facing a trade-off between job life and home life, mothers are more likely to be the parent who chooses to quit a job or switch to a low-paying job that offers a more flexible schedule for childcare (====). However, we are not able to determine whether or not mothers change their jobs in response to an increase in family size by examining mothers¡¯ labor supply or earnings, as they may retain their position but receive different pay. Thus, in addition to labor supply, this paper studies the impact of family size on parents¡¯ occupational prestige scores (OPSs), which can reflect job mobility. Since job switching is easier in a better-developed and more vigorous labor market (====), this paper uses data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 waves of the Chinese population census to discuss whether the negative impact of family size on parents¡¯ labor market performance changes over time.====Occupational prestige reflects differential social evaluations of jobs or occupations. High-prestige jobs usually require more occupational skills, longer training times, higher education levels, and larger responsibilities (====, ====), and imply higher potential income and more social resources in return. Family size can affect parents¡¯ job prestige in both directions. On the one hand, parents may switch from high-prestige jobs that require a large amount of time and energy to less demanding jobs that give them more time for childrearing; this switching can be viewed as a child penalty on occupational prestige. On the other hand, parents may work harder and attempt to acquire high-prestige jobs either to set a good example for their children or to have greater social status and resources, both of which are essential and helpful for the future development of their children.====This paper is an extension of the work of ==== who analyze the effects of family size on parents¡¯ labor supply and OPSs using the 1990 census data of both Mainland China and Taiwan. Because Mainland China was less developed than Taiwan in 1990, there were fewer job options and less job mobility there. The above authors find that in 1990, parents in Mainland China were more likely to quit their jobs, while parents in Taiwan were more likely to switch to jobs with lower prestige scores in response to an increase in the number of children. Similarly to ====, this paper attempts to study how the relationship between family size and parents¡¯ labor market performance changes in society at different stages of development. Several features distinguish this paper from ====. First, ==== In the end, we conduct a separate analysis for rural-to-urban migrant households.====Our results indicate that a motherhood penalty, defined as a negative impact of family size on mothers¡¯ labor market performance, can be observed for 1990 but gradually declines over time for nuclear households with urban ====.==== In 1990, a larger family size was associated with a lower labor supply of mothers. In 2000, mothers were more likely to switch to jobs with lower prestige, instead of quitting their jobs, in response to an increase in the number of children. For 2010, we find no evidence of a motherhood penalty. This trend is consistent with our expectation, since from 1990 to 2000, a better-developed labor market with more jobs available and more job mobility allowed mothers to switch to family-friendly jobs, making it easier for them to balance their work life and home life. This finding is exactly consistent with the different situations in Taiwan and Mainland China in 1990 found in ====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section ==== introduces the related literature and background; Section ==== describes the data, sample, and statistics; Section ==== outlines the empirical strategy; Section ==== presents our empirical results; Section ==== presents our subsample analysis and studies the child penalty among extended households; Section ==== focuses on the situation of households with rural ====; and Section ==== concludes the paper.","Family size, labor supply, and job prestige: Evidence from three decennial censuses in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000718,8-May-23,2023,Research Article,15

This paper quantifies the wage income gap between only children and their peers (i.e. those with siblings), and uncovers the channels that underlie it. While only children receive higher wage income on average, we find that this only-child premium disappears completely once their superior schooling attainment and family background are accounted for. Moreover, we learn that the One-Child Policy resulted in a negative only-child effect on wage income, after conditioning on pre-determined characteristics; this may be due to only children lacking socio-emotional attributes that are valued in the labor market. Our results deliver important insights for China as only children continue to dominate its labor force at a rapid pace.","In 2015, China formally announced that fertility restrictions under the One-Child Policy (OCP) will be relaxed, putting an end to one of the largest social experiments in human history. The OCP was in effect for nearly four decades (1979¨C2015). During this time, China's birth rate plummeted significantly, which in turn brought about a wide range of socioeconomic consequences.====Proponents of the OCP often invoke Beckerian quantity-quality tradeoff (====; ====; ====), arguing that, among other things, population control will elevate investments in human capital and thereby raise living standards. While there is some evidence for this (====), the policy debate has hitherto ignored the impact of population control on other domains of early childhood development. In particular, studies have shown that only children are less likely to develop pro-social traits and other non-cognitive attributes due to the absence of sibling interaction (====). If these traits and attributes, alongside human capital, are important determinants of labor market success (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), then the net effect of the OCP on one's labor market outcome might be ambiguous. Few studies have examined this issue thus far.====In light of these concerns, our research quantifies the wage income gap between only children born under China's OCP and their peers (i.e. those with siblings), and uncovers the channels that underlie it. We first document that only children on average receive 21.7% more wage income than their peers, and three-quarter of that premium can be explained by their superior education background. Moreover, after accounting for differences in schooling attainment and family background, only children receive no higher wage income than their peers.====To address endogenous selection of family size due to parental heterogeneity, we then adopt an ====Finally, we make use of rich survey data on social capital, attitudinal, and health attributes to uncover mechanisms. We detect an indirect (and probably unintended) consequence of the OCP: that only children born under the OCP exhibit lower tendencies for involvement in social organizations, have lower ability to get along with other people, and are under-represented in managerial positions. These results suggest that only children are less likely to possess socio-emotional traits that are valued in the labor market, a pattern that ultimately proved detrimental to their wage income.====Notably, our findings are drawn from two large-scale nationally-representative household data sets that uniquely identify an individual's only-child status and his/her labour market outcome. Moreover, our conclusions are qualitatively robust to a battery of robustness tests that address issues such as selective rural-urban migration and cohort differences in life cycle earnings, among others.====Child development is a multifaceted process in which children make advancements across multiple domains, including but not limited to cognitive skills or knowledge that are acquired with financial resources. As such, the conventional policy position on population control that focuses on Beckerian quantity-quality tradeoff misses other critical socio-emotional attributes which may also be influenced by population policy. Based on census data, about 224 million only children were born in 1975¨C2015, which account for 43% of all births during this period. These birth cohorts will represent the majority of the Chinese labor force within a couple of decades. In this regard, the phenomenon that we uncover here delivers important insights that have massive consequences.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

This paper explores income responses to the payroll tax by evaluating the 2006 pension reform that subtracted 3 percentage points of employees' Defined Contribution account in China. First, our estimate of total income elasticity with respect to the pension rate is larger than 2, implying a lower optimal payroll tax rate than in rich countries. Second, we separate total income into labor and non-labor income, and show significant income shifting from labor to non-labor income. Third, we provide suggestive evidence that income responses to the pension reform are from evasion rather than real responses. We emphasize the necessity of administrative capacity for developing countries to extend the pension system. Remarkably, sharing the employer payroll tax with employees may be a self-enforcement mechanism, similar to the value-added tax, of the payroll tax.","; ====). In developing countries, however, ETIs are high for the sake of the informal sector, income shifting, tax avoidance, and evasion (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Another stylized fact in developing countries is that people are insufficiently covered by state or market-organized social security systems (====; ====; ====; ====), indicating a higher optimal payroll tax rate. It is puzzling why developing countries do not extend the social security system through higher payroll tax?====; ====).====Due to information and administrative capacities, both employer and employee payroll taxes are nominally collected through employers. After deducting the employee payroll tax from posted wages, employees get taxable income, which is similar to that in Greece (====). One significant characteristic of the labor market in developing countries is the high proportion of the informal sector that is not covered by the mandatory social security system. Therefore, employees in the informal sector are not affected by the 2006 pension reform, which can be regarded as the control group of the formal sector. We exploit a Difference-in-Difference (DD) approach to estimate the effects of the 2006 pension reform.====Our main findings are as follows. First, the income elasticity with respect to the pension rate is large. A 3 percentage points increase in payroll rate results in a 6% reduction in total income (including labor and non-labor income before tax, and the employee payroll tax; but excluding the employer payroll tax), which implies a large elasticity of total income with respect to the payroll tax. Second, employees shift labor income to non-labor income when the pension rate increases. After decomposing the effects on total income into effects on labor and non-labor income, we find that labor income decreases by about 13.4%, but non-labor income increases by about 60.9%. Labor income responses to the 2006 pension reform are even more fierce. Labor income is shifted to non-labor income that is unrelated to the payroll tax. Third, pension evasion is associated with the increase of the pension rate. Payroll taxes are collected by two agencies in China, that is, the Tax bureau or the Social security bureau in different provinces. It has been proven that the enforcement of the Tax bureau is higher than that of the Social security bureau. Compared to provinces where payroll taxes are collected by the Tax bureau, employees in provinces where payroll taxes are collected by the Social security bureau respond more to the 2006 pension reform. Finally, the employee pension rate decreases by 0.49¨C0.77 percentage point due to the 2006 pension reform. We attribute these results to payroll tax evasion when the payroll tax rate increases.====Our results suffer from several caveats. First, employees in the informal sector may not be an appropriate control group for employees in the formal sector. Reassuringly, we confirm that the two groups satisfied the parallel trend well in the years prior to the reform and then start to diverge precisely in 2006¡ªthe first post-reform year. The pension-reform effects build up gradually and materialize within two years. Second, our results may suffer from spurious problem if other confounding factors affect sector composition and income simultaneously. Since the retirement age is 55 for females and 60 for males in China, those above the retirement age are not affected by the pension reform. We conduct a placebo test among employees of retirement age and observe insignificant effects as expected.====This paper contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, we build on the literature estimating the elasticity of taxable income. According to the comprehensive literature reviewed by ====, cohort-based reform suffers from the mean reversion problem (====; ====; ====). We build on the literature by revealing that most employees, except the top-income class since there is a ceiling on the payroll tax as almost all countries do (====), respond to the payroll tax rate change.====Second, we build on the literature documenting responses to taxes in developing countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). While ETIs are relatively small (ranging from 0.12 to 0.40) in developed countries (====; ====), they suffer from selective reporting bias (====). Most papers find that income elasticities with respect to tax rates in developing countries are high, which are mainly resulted from evasion (====; ====) such as over-reporting deductions (====) and income shifting (====; ====, ====). Given the administrative capacity and labor market composition, developing countries tax so little and favor indirect taxes (====; ====; ====). Remarkably, this paper adds to the literature by highlighting that large income elasticity with respect to the pension rate is also a big challenge for the establishment of the social security system in developing countries.====Third, we contribute to the responses to the payroll tax. Employees may change their working hours in response to social security contributions (====). We demonstrate that employees shift labor income to non-labor income when the payroll tax increases, which is consistent with ==== who find that the behavioral responses are higher for taxable income than that of broader range of income.

In this paper, we focus on people's income, which directly affects their welfare. The determinants of workers' earnings have been widely discussed in the literature on labor and political economics, exploring topics such as firm size (====; ====), ownership types (====; ====; ====), and management system such as employee stock ownership (====), employees' individual characteristics such as skilled and education level (====; ====; ====), health status (====; ====), cognitive ability (====; ====), marriage and childbearing age (====; ====), and gender (====; ====), international market environment such as trade shock (====; ====) and exchange-rate shock (====; ====), labor market force such as labor supply (====) and labor spatial misallocation (====; ====), social and economic force such as minimum wage (====; ====), and the household registration system in China (====; ====).====However, little is known about how much air pollution, a non-economic factor that employees encounter during work, can influence their earnings. Therefore, we conduct a causality investigation of the relationship between air pollution and workers' yearly earnings to address this research gap. In the context of heightened climate risks and severely rising air pollution in several developing countries (====), policymakers and researchers are giving increasing attention to air quality since it can significantly affect citizens' well-being. Thus numerous studies have sought to investigate the causal effect of air pollution on citizens' welfare level indicators, including people's physical health (====; ====; ====), mental health (====; ====), infants and adults mortality (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), subjective well-being (====; ====; ====), avoidance behaviors (====; ====), and long-run earnings (====; ====).====China provides an ideal background for our research for two reasons. First, China has experienced severe environmental pollution problems. Statistical data compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 demonstrates that air pollution is a major risk for people with non-communicable diseases and leads to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality.==== In our sample, the annual average PM==== rose from 46.02?¦Ìg/m==== in 1998 to 67.29?¦Ìg/m==== in 2007 for nearly 46%. Second, according to gross domestic product (GDP) data reported by the National Bureau of Statistic (NBS) in China, China's GDP increased from 7.96 trillion CNY in 1998 to 24.66 trillion CNY in 2007, a threefold increase for 10?years, suggesting that people in China experienced a rapid earning increase from 1998 to 2007.==== Thus, China's significant differences in air pollution combined with the huge changes in income levels contributes to our understanding of the relationship between air pollution and employees' earnings.====Because we focus on employees' total labor income, we infer that air pollution can affect employees' earnings by lowering their unit wage (defined as labor productivity) (====, ====; ====; ====; ====) and reducing their labor supply (e.g., by taking leave for health reasons) because previous studies have found that air pollution can cause great harm to human physical and mental health. The increase in firms' labor costs caused by the resulting decline in employees' labor productivity and work time can further undermine firms' operating status. Therefore, we consider that the earnings reduction caused by air pollution may be even larger in the long term if firms encounter operating problems.====; ====; ====; ====). In our preferred IV specification, we find that a one ¦Ìg/m==== increase in yearly average PM==== decreases employees' annual earnings by around 175.4 CNY (14.6 CNY monthly), corresponding to 1.4% of the mean value, a strong negative influence. Based on this estimator, we further reveal that the total loss in earnings for all employees working for our sample firms amounts to about 268.59 million CNY. To strengthen our estimators' reliability, we conduct several robustness tests. Our baseline results remain intact.====, ownership types, pollution level and size to further demonstrate our underlying mechanisms.====Given the fact that the impact of air pollution on economic activities has been shown to be non-linear (====; ====; ====), we explore whether the non-linear effect exists in our paper. Not surprisingly, our paper also shows that air pollution has a negative impact on employees' annual earnings until it surpasses a specific threshold.====Our paper makes four primary contributions. First, this paper adds to the strand of literature studying the socioeconomic effect of air pollution, especially the stream investigating how air pollution affects human welfare. Previous studies investigating people's welfare give greater attention to health status (including physical and mental health), subjective well-being, mortality, and additional living expenditure for avoidance behaviors. Little is known about workers' earnings, the indicator most directly related to welfare level. Recently ==== finds that historical industrial pollution exerts a significant impact on the income distribution of residents in neighboring communities caused by high-skill workers' migration behaviors from poor air quality regions to better ones. ==== investigates whether being exposed to severe air pollution early in life can reduce income in adulthood, a potential long-run effect of air pollution. This paper differs from theirs by focusing on the immediate response of earnings to poor air quality, a relatively short-run response. Our paper also differs from ==== in that it estimates air pollution's effect on short-run productivity for China's manufacturing sector, but our paper focuses on the causal effect of air pollution on the employee's earnings reduction, an economic variable of the aggregate concept, which is determined with two parts: unit wage which can be regarded as the labor productivity and working time per year which can be regarded as labor supply. In addition, our paper explores the negative effect of air pollution on people's welfare level from the perspective of income since the employee's total earning is related to their welfare level much more directly compared to labor productivity.====; ====) if we lack a market price for air quality. Several studies have provided empirical estimators for the economic cost of air pollution from the viewpoints of reducing outdoor activities (====; ====), buying more facemasks (====) and air purifiers (====) and even migrating to clean air regions (====; ====). However, they can be considered from the perspective of living expenditure to study the economic cost of air pollution. There is relatively little evidence for quantitative analysis concerning people's earning loss, a perspective of income, suggesting that our paper provides an estimate of the direct economic costs of air pollution.====Third, our study also complements and extends the stream of research investigating the theory of determinants of employees' earnings. As noted above, previous studies have focused on economic perspectives such as firm characteristics, employees' characteristics, international market factors, and labor market forces. In this study, we show that air quality is also salient and is under-investigated when considering what factors affect employees' income.====Finally, our paper delivers strong policy implications and provides policymakers with an effective basis for cost-benefit analyses when drafting environmental regulations in the future.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and sample. Section 3 introduces the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents our empirical results along with robustness checks and heterogeneity analyses.

The digital economy has gradually become an important proposition for development research in various countries. Moreover, the financial crisis of 2008 had a huge impact on the global economy, resulting in trade growth and capital flows at levels far below those of the early 2000s. However, according to ====). For developing countries, the digital revolution presents a critical opportunity to achieve breakthrough development and integrate into the global economy (====; ====According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), China's digital trade scale has increased from $164.84 billion in 2011 to $359.69 billion in 2021, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.12%, with a high CAGR of 11.97% from 2018 to 2021. Global digital trade has become a significant source of support for the growth of international trade, especially after the emergence of COVID-19. The evolution of digital intelligence in the global economy has also boosted the innovation and application of digital products based on digital technologies. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), China is by far the fastest growing robotics market in the world. With the largest stock of robots operating every year since 2016, the industrial robot market of China has achieved strong growth, reaching 243,300 installations in 2021, a 44% increase compared to the previous year. Digital products such as radar, robots, and automation machines are widely used in manufacturing and have become increasingly irreplaceable due to their ability to operate precisely and work continuously in multiple threads (====), bringing profound impact to business operations and economic development (====; ====).====; ====). However, the dramatic changes worldwide raise substantial challenges for developing countries. On the one hand, as responses to the financial crisis in 2008, global economic growth has been sluggish in recent years, and developed countries have increased protection for their domestic enterprises and core technologies, resulting in the prevalence of trade protectionism and deglobalization trends. Given this global situation, it is more difficult for developing countries to participate in international trade and gain benefits with their original resource and population advantages. On the other hand, from the perspective of the global value chains, developed countries have long been dominant, whereas developing countries have been in a subordinate position of foundry production, producing low-quality products, earning profits that are extremely unequal to those of developed countries, and suffering severe environmental damage. Therefore, how to cultivate core competitiveness to improve the level of trade and upgrade global value chains is crucial for developing countries to be further involved in international trade.====This paper uses the ¡°====¡± released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) and the list of information and communications technology (ICT) products published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to construct a digital product catalog manually. This is a broad definition of digital products, highlighting their technical attributes, and mainly covers the latter two types of our classification, which means the research object in this paper is tangible digital product mainly including digital infrastructure.====; ====; ====; ====). However, not all capital-type products are based on binary codes or bit streams, which means that not all capital-type products are digitized (ordered online). As the infrastructure of digital empowerment, digital products can be regarded as capital-type products built on a higher technological foundation (digital information technology) to a certain extent. However, since digital products and capital-type goods are defined from different dimensions, there is a large overlap between the two, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish them.====On the basis of clarifying digital products, we provide empirical evidence for the impact of digital product imports on export product quality and the underlying mechanisms based on panel data of Chinese firms. To ensure the unbiasedness of the results, we adopt several ====, a difference-in-differences (DID) model and a more disaggregated quality estimation for endogeneity tests, and conduct a series of robustness tests. Finally, we carry out heterogeneity analysis in different product classes, firms' ownership, and capital intensity to shed light on causality under different circumstances. The results of the research show that 1) digital product imports have a significantly positive effect on the improvement of firm export product quality, 2) digital product imports can stimulate export product quality upgrades through three channels: promoting firm innovation, increasing productivity, and enhancing information search capabilities, and 3) the effect of digital product imports on export product quality is stronger for foreign-owned and high capital intensity firms, and the effect of digital intermediate imports is larger than that for digital non-intermediate imports.====The present study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, in contrast to existing studies, this paper examines the causality between digital trade and export quality in international trade from the perspective of digital product imports with highly disaggregated quality data, providing a complement to the research on the relationship between the digital economy and international trade. Second, in terms of mechanisms, this paper proposes and empirically demonstrates that technological innovation, enhanced productivity, and information search capability are the underlying mechanisms through which digital product imports increase the level of export product quality, thereby providing new research ideas for the impact of digital trade. Third, this paper explores the heterogeneity of the impact of digital product imports on export quality using different subsamples. Fourth, to obtain the Harmonized System (HS) code catalog of digital products, we use the Custom Codes corresponding to the China Industrial Classification (CIC) codes of digital product manufacturing industries defined by the NBSC to identify the codes under generalized definition manually, and then combine them with the ICT products catalog published by UNCTAD, which is a more feasible way to measure the import of digital products.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses previous literature on export quality and digital trade.

In this paper, four populations¡ªnon-left-behind children in rural areas, left-behind children in rural areas, migrant children in urban areas, and local children in urban areas¡ªwere recruited in a large-scale field experiment that included the dictator game, ultimatum game, trust game, public goods game, coin-tossing task, intertemporal choice task, a calculation contest task, and a gambling task. Both being left behind and migrating had a negative effect on the children's ==== (including fairness, trust, trustworthiness, cooperation, and honesty) and economic decision-making (including time and competition preferences). Moreover, the effect on migrant children was relatively greater, but this effect dissipated progressively as time since migration increased. Additionally, shorter migration distances were associated with a decreased effect of migration on migrant children, and having access to one parent had a positive effect on left-behind children.","Children who migrate face an unfamiliar environment and must adapt to various changes and integrate into a new life. Meanwhile, their parents do not have the same access as local urban residents in terms of their children's education, medical care, housing, and other social welfare guarantees. This causes many migrant children to lack a sense of security and belonging, leading to psychological imbalance and misbehaviour (====; ====; ====; ====).====A substantial share of the migrant population is unable to access social services for their children at their destination, such as enrolling their children in school in the city, and these parents have to leave their children in the countryside, creating left-behind children. Because the left-behind children are unable to live with their parents for a long time, changes occur in the internal family structure, the children may experience problems with education, psychological health, emotional life, and socialisation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Migrant and left-behind children are two special populations that have emerged since the rapid urbanisation of China. These two populations may encounter unique challenges due to their external environment or changes in family structure (====), along with their distribution behaviour (====) and trust behaviour (====). Other studies compared the differences between left-behind children in rural areas and urban children in terms of altruistic (====), honest (====), and cooperative (====) behaviour.====These studies provided strong evidence of differences in the preferences and behaviours of migrant or left-behind children separately compared to rural or urban local children, but we still lack evidence on differences between migrant and left-behind children's behaviours. This study investigated the effects of being left behind or migrating on children's prosocial behaviour and economic decision-making. We used field experiment methods to recruit more than 1000 participants and conducted eight behavioural games and individual decision-making experiments¡ªthe ultimatum game, dictator game, trust game, public goods game, honesty, time preference, competition preference, and risk preference experiments¡ªto measure ====, fairness, trust, cooperation, honesty, competition, risk, and time preferences among migrant children in urban areas and left-behind children in rural areas.====We also included local children in urban areas and non-left-behind children in rural areas to comprehensively investigate the effects of migration and being left behind on children's behaviour and preferences. In addition, we considered relevant factors, such as the migration distance of the migrant children (in a city or province, outside a province), time since migration, circumstances of left-behind children (neither parent remained at home, mother remained at home, father remained at home), frequency of seeing their parents face-to-face, and the amount of time spent with parents, in the empirical analysis to further explore the internal mechanisms underlying the effects of migrating and being left behind on children's behaviour and preferences.====The experimental results revealed that left-behind children in rural areas showed significantly less prosocial behaviour than non-left-behind children in rural areas in terms of trust behaviour, trustworthy behaviours, honesty, and competition preference. Migrant children also showed significantly less prosocial behaviours than non-left-behind children in rural areas in terms of sense of fairness, trust behaviour, trustworthy behaviour, cooperation, and honesty, but they showed a significantly higher preference for future benefits. Relative to local children in urban areas, migrant children in urban areas showed significantly less altruistic sharing behaviour and had significantly lower levels of fairness, trust, and trustworthiness while showing a significantly higher preference for future benefits. Living with their mother significantly increased the sense of fairness and honesty of left-behind children; living with their father significantly increased their honesty, competition preference, and risk preference. Compared with children who migrated in a city, children who migrated in a province showed significantly lower investment in trust games. Children who migrated outside a province showed significantly lower altruistic giving, trust behaviour, trustworthy behaviour, and cooperation.

Using Chinese Customs Database and Industrial Enterprise Database from 2000 to 2006, we measure the export quality at the firm-product-country level and examine the effect of the legal environment on the export quality. Our empirical study shows that the improvement in the legal environment can raise export quality, especially at firms with higher contract intensity. Further studies show that the legal environment and contract intensity affect the import decision of firms and thus have a significant impact on product quality of export firms.","It is well known that product quality has significant impact on the living standard of society. However, it not until ====¡¯s construction of the quality ladder model, academics start to pay attention on the relationship between product quality and economic development. Within their theoretical framework, the ability to upgrade product quality plays a central role for economic development, and product quality upgrading is closely related to economic growth of an economy. As a result, many scholars put the overall product quality as one of the most important indices measuring the level of development of an economy (====£»====£»====). Building on this theory, ==== conduct the relevant empirical analysis, and find that rich countries maintain a higher export price due to their product quality and level of development. ==== study the quality evolution process for 43 countries and find the significant relationship between product quality and per capita GDP. It is also found that there is strong convergence of product quality across countries.====Of course, China's overall economic growth also relies on vast domestic market, deepening market oriented reforms and policies that favor exports and FDIs. But as China's per capita GDP increases, the demand for high quality products also increases; the trade environment for export will also deteriorate, with more and more trade conflicts with foreign countries, the price competition ==== comes to a dead end. Therefore, improving product quality becomes a key factor to achieve long run sustainable growth for the economy. Then, what are the factors hindering the improvement of product quality especially in export quality? Are there any systemic and institutional constraints for the improvement of export quality? If there are, can we indentifying the channels and mechamism through which those factors affecting the export quality? The answers to those question require both theoretical and empirical investigation.====In recent years, an increasing number of scholars have emphasized the relationship between institutional quality and long-term economic growth (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ==== report Doing Business in China 2008 points out, ¡°The efficiency of the litigation system varies significantly across China. As with other indicators studied by Doing Business in China, coastal areas on average perform better than other areas. It takes an average of 230 days to enforce a contract in courts in the southeast. The same process takes 363 days in the northeast.¡± ====Based on the above stylized facts, we study the effects of legal environment and contract intensity on export quality. This has important significance about construction of quality institutions. First, China has enjoyed high-speed growth without too much emphasis on the quality of growth. Export quality is an important indicator of the overall quality and level of development thus of interest of research. Second, legal environment quality helps to improve contract execution and enhance economic cooperation thus has significance on the quality of development and growth. On the one hand, the division of labor becomes more specialized in the economy as it develops and it demands more and more smooth cooperation among different entities, this requires good institutions to provide quality services. On the other hand, as specialization deepens in an economy, contract intensity will also increase, thus the study of legal environment and contract intensity on export quality has implications on industry upgrading to move along the ladder of development. It should be noted that there have been some existing studies on legal environment and contract intensity on export quality.==== and ==== are the closest studies on this topic, they both studied the relationship of legal environment and contract intensity on export quality. Our study is different from theirs in the following two major variations:====First, we study the problem in the framework of incomplete contracts by employing the theoretical framework developed by ==== and constructed a game theoretical model to study the underlying mechanism of how legal environment can influence export quality. In our model, the final goods producer must purchase a specialized intermediate good to produce the final goods, the quality of the intermediate good is not publically verifiable by the court, and the contract is incomplete, thus the final good producer may be able to take advantage of this situation to hold up the intermediate good producer. With better legal environment, the intermediate input producer may be able to better protect itself. Hence, improving legal environment, intermediate good producers may have a stronger incentive to improve product quality thus improving the quality of the final goods. The more frequent usage of such intermediate goods, the bigger impact on the quality of the final goods.====Second, ==== and ==== both use industry-level data. But we combine micro-level data and regional-level data to give us some certain advantages. The use of firm-level data allows us to address heteroskedasticity of the relationship across different types of firms, for example, the difference across types of exports, ownership structures, and regions respectively. In addition, firms may use import inputs substitute for local intermediate goods, this behavior is shown up in the input import volume and quality of firms, thus providing the possibility of studying the relationship of legal environment, contract intensity on export quality at a much deeper level to get a better picture. Also, the regional level data has given us an advantage over country-level data analysis. It is well known that there are significant differences in the level of development of legal institutions across different regions in China. The eastern part of China have much better legal institutions than the central and western part, thus provide a good sample studying the impact of high-quality legal institution on the economy. Furthermore, by using different regional data within the same country relieves us from the difficulty of controlling the effects of cultures and politics that exist naturally on the country-level data. Finally, micro-level data avoid the endogenous problem because micro firms are takers of the institutional environments and is difficult to affect the legal environment. Overall speaking, macro-level data tends to have significant impact on micro-level data not the vice versa.====Our main contributions to the literature are as follows. First, by constructing a game model under perfect information, this paper proves that improvement in the legal environment can raise the quality of intermediate products and then that of final products. The higher the contract intensity is, the more that the product quality will be improved. Second, most previous studies focus on the impact of the legal environment on the export volume. ==== and ==== study the impact of the legal environment on the export quality of different contract-intensive industries using data on American industrial imports and global industrial exports respectively, but they reach different conclusions. This paper studies the impact of the legal environment on the export quality from the micro perspective of enterprises, finding that improvement in the legal environment can enhance the export quality of firms with higher contract intensity, thus enriching the existing research. From the firms' micro point of view, we find that the impacts differ significantly for firms in different regions and ownership structure, we also find that they can also influence firms' import behavior thus further affect export quality.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In ====, we summarize the literature, and ==== we describe the data, in ==== we analyze the regression results, ==== contains the study of the transition mechanisms of the influence of legal environment and contract intensity on import volume and quality and further on the export quality, with the conclusion in ====.","Legal environment, contract intensity, and export quality",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000615,11 April 2023,2023,Research Article,21

According to the statistics of the Shanghai-Hongkong Development Institute, by 2018, 27,466 VC institutions were established in China, and the VC-managed capital reached 11.2 trillion yuan in total (1.72 trillion USD). China's VC has taken up 1/3 of the world's and 75.4% of Asia Pacific's total amount.==== VC turns out to be the dominant source of finance for high-potential startups commercializing risky new ideas and technologies, and is considered to effectively boost innovative business (====; ====; ====; ====). Consistent with the United States, the VC amount managed by Chinese VC firms is small as compared with the national government investment.==== However, several studies confirmed that VC is critical to facilitating regional innovation and optimizing local investment structure in China (====).====). To be specific, institutions in the banking industry are encouraged to finance environmental-friendly and low-carbon projects. Firms exhibiting poor energy conservation and pollution reduction are restricted from achieving bank loans (====). New projects that do not pass the environmental assessment are prohibited from bank credit support, while ongoing projects that fail to meet certain environmental requirements are limited from receiving bank loans (====).====However, existing green finance policies in China do not impose explicit environmental guidance on VC, implying that VCs do not necessarily function as ¡°sustainable finance¡± and reduce pollution. In such background, discussion has emerged on whether VC would finance environment-friendly startups relying on cleaner inputs (e.g., renewable energy, pollution-free technology and new materials), which exhibit broad societal and environmental benefits (====). However, empirical evidence on the role of VC as a potential source of sustainable finance remains scarce. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the effects of VC on air pollution in China.====Based on the information acquired from Private Equity Database (PEDATA) built by Zero2IPO Group and the corresponding city-level air pollution data originating from 0.01¡ã?¡Á?0.01¡ã grid data of ground-level PM==== concentration and industrial SO====This study contributes to the literature on three fronts. First, this study provides insights into the environmental effects of VC activities. In general, existing studies have focused on the effects of VC on industrial and firm innovation (====; ====; ====), employment and income (====), as well as enterprise value and business creation (====; ====). ====Second, this study is broadly connected with the literature on the environmental effects of firm investment. Existing studies largely discussed the effect of firm investment on environmental pollution from two perspectives, i.e., the purchase of environmental protection facilities and the introduction of clean technology. Moreover, most studies reported that firm environmental investment and pollution emissions are strongly correlated with the government's environmental regulation. If the local government carries out rigorous environmental supervision, firms will be encouraged to increase environmental investment and reduce environmental pollution (====; ====). However, several studies indicated that environmental investment does not affect pollution. For instance, ==== showed that the effects of environmental investment on industrial SO==== emissions and dust emissions could be ignored. Inspired by the mentioned, this study provides novel evidence to the undetermined effect of firm investment on local environment.====Lastly, this study supplements the growing literature by highlighting the technological innovation and green investment effects of VC as influencing channels. Though the relationship between VC and innovation in the developed world has been extensively analyzed, the empirical evidence for China has not reached a consensus. According to ====, and ====, VC exerts a significant positive effect on innovation at the firm and region levels. As opposed to their studies, ==== found a non-linear relationship between VC and innovation performance. VC can bring higher innovation performance only when reaching a certain amount. ==== reported that VC does not impact early-stage innovation, but boosts innovation at the developing stage and hinders innovation at the expansion stage. Our findings support the general and green innovation effects of VC activities, and verify the investment preference of VC towards green industries.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. ==== introduces the institutional background and two possible channels through which VC affects air pollution. ==== describes the data and empirical strategy. ==== presents the main results, robustness tests and heterogeneous analyses. ==== investigates the potential mechanisms. ==== concludes the study.",The path towards sustainable finance: Venture capital and air pollution in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000640,8 April 2023,2023,Research Article,22

Focusing on a representative and large sample of private firms, the analysis finds evidence of an inferior performance of the companies run by entrepreneurs with past top management experience in state-owned companies, while the superior performance of the companies run by entrepreneurs with prior technical experience. The study investigates specific theory-driven mechanisms through which different experiences impact firm performance, including time allocation and R&D management strategy. Upper echelon theory and imprinting effects appear relevant, and local institutions, political and economic uncertainty, and entrepreneurs' self-perception act as moderating factors. We deal with potential endogeneity issues with ==== and two-stage least squares regression. These findings provide novel evidence on underexplored aspects of the ongoing privatization process in China and other economies in transition.","Examining the growth of private companies is of outmost importance to understand the transition of a country from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy. A crucial role in this process is played by private entrepreneurs, whose characteristics impact the performance of their companies. According to the literature, age (====; ====), managerial talent (====), prior work experience (====; ====; ====; ====), and political affiliation (====; ====) are some among the most relevant features of the entrepreneurs affecting the strategies and the growth of private firms.==== In transition countries, individual attributes of the entrepreneurs exert a particularly strong effect on firms, as shown by ====, who stress the positive correlation between firm productivity and the human capital of entrepreneurs and managers. In this work, we focus on how the entrepreneurs' past work experiences impact the performance of their firms during the transition towards a market-oriented economy.====Entrepreneurship research has already revealed that organizations can have an impact on the forma mentis of their members and their subsequent career (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This paper drew its arguments from upper echelon theory (====) and imprinting theory (====). Upper echelon theory links entrepreneurs' background characteristics to firms' outcomes. The theory suggests that entrepreneurs' past experience influence firms' strategy choice and implementation, which in turn affects firms' growth (====). At the same time, imprinting effects influence the behaviour of the individuals because the habits and the beliefs developed during formative periods in relevant business activities tend to exert a very long-lasting influence.==== Critical events and institutional reforms challenge the effectiveness of old habits, business practices and received wisdom (====; ====; ====; ====): in changing environments, thus, entrepreneurs with different backgrounds may perform in systematically different ways. We explore this possibility by focusing on China during the economic and cultural transformation that followed the privatization reform enacted in the early 2000s. More precisely, we assess empirically to what extent the previous work experiences of the Chinese entrepreneurs exerted an impact on the performance of their companies during the transformation, what are the mechanisms through which past work experiences influence entrepreneurs' decision-making in the newly founded private firms, and whether the external institution and uncertainty moderate the impacts of prior experience on firms' growth.====China represents a perfect laboratory to explore the research questions inspiring our analysis. When the reform of the economic system started (in the late 1970s and early 1980s), setting up a private firm in China was not allowed (====). In 1988, the Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises were enacted, providing a legal framework for private firms with more than eight employees. In 1997, the legal status of private enterprises was eventually recognized. This reform boosted the transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented economy (====; ====; ====) and it opened great opportunities for business: a vibrant entrepreneurship played an important role in the fast transition process observed in China (====; ====). The economic and cultural transformation was embraced by the authorities and, in 2002, the members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were encouraged to become entrepreneurs, while private entrepreneurs were invited to join the Party. In particular, several people started their own ventures, bringing with them the culture and the operation routines learned while working in state-owned enterprises (SOEs)/ Town and Village enterprises (TVEs). Our work explores, for the first time, how, and through what channels, the entrepreneurs' previous work experiences impacted the performance of the Chinese private firms during the transition.====Our analysis is conducted on four waves (2002, 2004, 2006, 2010) of the Chinese Private Enterprises Survey (CPES), one of the longest-running large-scale (nationwide and stratified) surveys of private enterprises in China, covering a representative sample of 6520 privately-owned firms. Among all working activities performed by entrepreneurs in the past, we posit that managerial experiences and technical experiences are particularly important. We find that different types of work experiences did have heterogeneous effects on the performance of Chinese private firms. In particular, those run by individuals with previous top managerial experience in either SOEs or TVEs expanded relatively less, whereas firms led by entrepreneurs with technical experience (gained as members of the technical staff of a company) grew more. Testing specific hypotheses on the mechanisms at play, we also show that the entrepreneurs with top managerial experiences in SOEs/TVEs allocated less working time to managerial activities and more time to networking activities: networking brings government-controlled resources to the firm, but too much networking makes the companies more exposed to expropriation from the authorities, such bias in time allocation reduced the growth performance of their firms. We also show that entrepreneurs with a technical background invested relatively more in R&D and generated more innovation outputs, a channel through which their companies grew more than the others.====¡¯s conclusion that entrepreneurial outcomes depend both on individual factors and on the environment in which the individuals act.==== It improves upon previous inconclusive analyses by showing that, as suggested by ==== and ====, distinguishing the types of experience is necessary to identify their impact on firm performance.==== Moreover, our analysis focuses on a country in transition where cultural imprinting effects were strong and it covers firms at any stage of development, thereby complementing those studies looking exclusively at start-ups. Finally, this work explores specific theory-driven mechanisms to explain how prior work experiences have influenced firm growth.====Second, due to its focus on China during the post-reform transition, this work contributes to the broader strand of the literature discussing the determinants of firm growth in China. ====, ==== and ==== and other studies analyse firm performances using balance sheet data concerning large private companies and SOEs. Besides the underrepresentation of small private firms in their samples, these works do not address the role of the entrepreneurs' traits and previous experiences for the lack of available information. Our study, instead, manages to show that, in the post-reform period, firm growth in China did depend on the long-lasting impact of the entrepreneurs' previous work experiences.====Third, this work contributes to the literature on development and transition economies as we focus on a period of a profound reform of the economic system in China. As suggested by ====, investigating the effects of the entrepreneurs' socialist imprinting during the transition to a market-oriented economy is of outmost importance to improve our understanding of the overall process of economic and cultural change in transition countries. Other scholars have addressed imprinting effects in China. ==== find that, because of this ideological legacy, Chinese entrepreneurs have selected more often than others the lucrative politically-driven business opportunities. ==== conclude that the entrepreneurs' past managerial experience in multinational companies operating in China is typically associated with better performances in their private firms, whereas ==== show that the top managers with previous governmental experience tend to give excessive emphasis to networking activities. ==== observe that the CEOs' supply chain experience in Chinese listed companies has an impact on corporate innovation. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work addresses the two types of experiences that we look at, namely previous top managerial experience in SOEs/TVEs and technical experience. Our findings, thus, add novel evidence to the limited research on how the entrepreneurs' work experiences in a central planned economy affect the performance of the private firms operating in a market-oriented economy (====; ====).====The remaining of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== discusses the theoretical underpinnings of the main and auxiliary hypotheses to test. ==== presents the data, the empirical specification and the variables of interest. ==== illustrates and discusses our empirical findings. ==== deals with potential endogeneity issues due to self-selection into treatment and omitted variables, and shows the robustness of the main results. ==== concludes the study.

Using a unique dataset from a large online medical crowdfunding platform based in China, this paper investigates the social support returns to college education. Our study finds that patients attaining college education would raise 88.1% more funds through medical crowdfunding. A variety of identification strategies suggest that the relationship is causal. By examining the potential mechanism, we conclude that college-educated patients have more detailed narratives and have more school-related social connections who are willing to verify and distribute the campaigns, attracting more supporters and ultimately raising more funds.","Previous research on returns to education has primarily focused on the pecuniary returns from the labor market. Recently, a strand of growing studies has begun to investigate the non-pecuniary returns to education, which represent a significant component of the private returns to education. These studies have assessed outcomes such as health (====; ====; ====), marriage (====; ====), parenting (====), and individual consumption behavior (====). Social support, including financial assistance for medical costs, is another essential aspect of returns to education. Yet, despite a burgeoning literature investigating the determinants of medical crowdfunding (MC),==== scant research has assessed the relationship between recipients' education and the amount of funds they raise. This study aims to fill this gap by addressing the following questions: What is the impact of the MC recipient's college education attainment on the funds raised? What are the potential mechanisms under it?====People who are suffering from severe illnesses face not only physical pain but also the financial strain of medical expenses. In many countries, conventional and experimental therapies are expensive and hard to access. According to ====). In China, many patients with severe illnesses cannot afford out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they have at least one type of medical insurance (====). Thus, many patients seek social support in the form of monetary assistance (====; ====). Some use medical crowdfunding campaigns (MCCs) on online platforms like GoFundMe and Watsi in the United States and Qschou and Waterdrop in China to solicit funding (====; ====; ====).====We compile a unique dataset of individual MCCs launched between January 2015 and July 2017 to assess how beneficiaries' education attainment affects their online crowdfunding. Our dataset contains detailed information on beneficiary characteristics, such as age, gender, educational attainment, city of registered residence, and type of disease, as well as other campaign-related characteristics, such as fundraising goal, the funds raised, and the number of supporters. We estimate the social support returns to college education by comparing campaign outcomes between beneficiaries who have attained at least some college education with those who have not.====We first examine the association between college education attainment and MC funds raised and then determine whether this relationship is causal using three strategies. The first strategy controls for three occupations, namely teachers, doctors/nurses, and military personnel, which are embedded in a larger social network relative to other occupations. We then calculate the bias-adjusted coefficients and the degree of selection on the unobservables, compared to the observables, that would be required to eliminate the association (====). In our study, the unobservable variables would have to be at least twice as important as the observable variables to completely explain away the positive relationship between recipients' college education and the funds raised. Our third strategy uses the college admission rate as an instrument variable (IV) for attaining a college education. The IV measures the chance of an individual obtaining a college education and is unlikely to affect the funds raised through factors other than attaining a college education. We find that compared to beneficiaries with no college educations, beneficiaries with some college education raise 88.1% more funds when the IV is applied.====To further address the concerns about violating exclusion restrictions, we perform a falsification test to examine the relationship between college admission rate and funds raised in a subsample of adult and teen patients, respectively. Assuming the college admission rate affects fundraising only through attainment of a college education, there should be a positive association between the college admission rate and fundraising for adult patients but no such relationship for teen patients who are not eligible to take the Chinese national college entrance exam. Indeed, the relationship is negative and statistically insignificant for teen patients. Moreover, our 2SLS estimates are robust to the violation of perfect exogeneity (====).====Furthermore, we explore two potential mechanisms to explain how a beneficiary's college education affects social support. The first is through the expansion of social networks. Enrollment in college embeds a person in a vast alumni network of classmates, professors, and staff. These social contacts can share MCCs to the broader alumni network and verify their authenticity. This group identity encourages ingroup favoritism and more other-regarding behavior towards an ingroup match (====; ====; ====). Therefore, alumni would be more inclined to support fellow alumni's MCCs than non-alumni's in terms of amount donated, online sharing of the MCC, endorsing and authenticating the patient, and so on. We believe the main forces driving ingroup favoritism are peer pressure and potential future direct or indirect reciprocity among group members. The second mechanism is the perceived worthiness of the recipient. A college education can enhance communication and other skills that enable patients to make compelling campaigns to demonstrate their need and deservingness (e.g., they can portray themselves as hardworking but unlucky persons). Indeed, we find that compared to campaigns of patients with no college education, those of patients with a college education attract more supporters and raise more funds. However, we find no evidence that a college education increases the generosity of supporters. These results are robust to various robustness tests.====This study adds to the literature in three ways. First, it fills a gap in the empirical literature on the private returns to education by demonstrating that a college education provides pecuniary benefits and increases social support, namely MC donations. The private returns to education have therefore been underestimated in previous research. Second, it contributes to the MC literature by identifying a causal relationship between educational attainment and the funds raised through MCCs, as well as examining the underlying mechanisms. Finally, using funds raised through MCCs as a proxy, we quantify the social support returns to education.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. ==== summarizes relevant literature on both returns to education and MC. ==== displays the results of regressions. ==== provides additional evidence to establish a causal relationship between college education attainment and MC fundraising. ==== investigates the mechanisms by which college education may influence fundraising outcomes. ==== concludes.",The social support returns to college education in China: Evidence from online medical crowdfunding,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000639,8 April 2023,2023,Research Article,24

China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a phase of high-quality development. The country faces many critical challenges, such as reshaping the development mode, optimizing the structure of the economy, and changing the driving force of growth. Promoting residents' entrepreneurship is a key to addressing the above challenges effectively, and it is also an important measure to encourage the construction of the ¡°dual circulation¡± development pattern.==== Notably, the ¡°Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation¡± strategy proposed by Premier Li Keqiang at the Davos Forum in 2014 provided momentum for individual entrepreneurship. As of 2020, the number of registered private enterprises in China accounted for 95.4% of all registered enterprises, providing an essential guarantee for the long-term stable and sound development of China's economy.====Since Chinese Premier Li Keqiang proposed ¡°mass entrepreneurship and innovation¡± at the opening of the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2014, the Chinese government has strived to remove obstacles to the market and ensure that the market plays a decisive role in resource allocation. China has risen from 84th in 2016 to 31st in 2020 in the ¡°Doing Business¡± report released by the World Bank. A sound business environment can reduce enterprises' costs of innovation and production activities, improve ====, and promote fair competition. Moreover, improvement of the business environment can effectively increase the market's capacity to attract and guide more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to engage in production activities. However, there is relatively thin literature on the impact of the business environment on individual entrepreneurship. Therefore, our paper investigates the effect of the business environment on individual entrepreneurship and seeks to answer the following questions. How does the business environment affect individual entrepreneurship? If the business environment can promote individual entrepreneurship, is it a structural adjustment of the employed people or an accumulative effect of expanding the number of employed people? What is the mechanism by which the business environment affects individual entrepreneurial decision making?====The following are our main findings. First, the business environment has a positive effect on individuals' entrepreneurship. The results remain significant after a variety of robustness checks. Second, various dimensions of the business environment have different effects on entrepreneurship, among which improvements in public services, the market environment, and the legal environment play a strong role in promoting entrepreneurship. Third, our results indicate that the business environment promotes entrepreneurship through four channels: (1) creating more entrepreneurial opportunities, (2) reducing operating costs, (3) reducing financing costs, and (4) improving contract enforcement. The business environment has also played an essential role in promoting the recovery of the industrial economy and improving individuals' willingness to start businesses. According to the heterogeneity analysis, because the business environment reduces the cost and difficulty of starting a business, it significantly promotes entrepreneurship for families with higher entrepreneurial costs, that is, poor and less educated families. Finally, the improvement of the business environment has promoted entrepreneurship in almost every aspect of the whole process. It can improve residents' entrepreneurial willingness and sense of identity, promote the succession of new entrepreneurs, and inject new vitality into the market.====Our work contributes to the literature in the following aspects. First, we examine the impact of the business environment on individual entrepreneurship. To the best of knowledge, we found that most of the existing literature on the business environment remains at the enterprise level (====; ====; ====). For example, ==== examined the relationship between the business environment and firm performances such as firm R&D, innovation and productivity. ==== investigated the effect of investment climate on production performance at the firm level based on the World Bank Enterprise Survey. Different from these researches, this paper focuses on the individuals and examines how business environment affect individual entrepreneurial behaviors. Starting from Schumpeter, it has been widely recognized that ¡°entrepreneurship¡± is essential in promoting technological innovation, increasing employment, and driving economic development (====; ====). Entrepreneurship is not only the external display of the entrepreneurial spirit, but more importantly the rational choice made by entrepreneurs within a certain market environment. Therefore, investigating the relationship between the business environment and residents' entrepreneurship from the individual perspective can deepen our understanding of the significance of the business environment to economic development.====Second, the data used to measure the regional business environment is comprehensive one. It consists of 18 indicators across seven dimensions, i.e., public services, human resources, market environment, innovation environment, ====, legal environment, and government environment. This data enables us to investigate the role of the regional business environment in promoting residents' entrepreneurship more precisely, and further helps us to identify which aspects of the business environment have a stronger impact on promoting residents' entrepreneurship. The empirical results of our paper reveal that public services, market environment, and legal environment have a more significant role in stimulating individual entrepreneurship.====Third, we examine the structural impact of the business environment on employment and conduct empirical tests of the structural and incremental effects of the business environment on entrepreneurship, lending support to the literature. Compared with the impact on the entry and exit of the whole entrepreneurial group, the existing literature pays more attention to the effects of the business environment on individual choices. For example, ==== find that the behavior of entrepreneurs is significantly affected by the institutional environment and the stability of government policies. When the business environment in a region is unstable, entrepreneurs will spend more energy and time on unproductive activities, which affects the performance of enterprises. ==== evaluate the impact of the institutional and business environments on the establishment of productive enterprises by using cross-sectional data from more than 100 countries. The results show that a better business system and environment can promote the production performance of enterprises. Furthermore, following the existing literature, we analyze the impact of the business environment on the entry and exit of the whole entrepreneur group, strengthening the results in the literature.====Finally, our work complements the existing literature (====; ====; ====) by pointing out the impact mechanism of the business environment on individual entrepreneurship through both theoretical and empirical analyses.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== presents the related literature and develops the research hypotheses. ==== describes the data and introduces the methods used in the empirical analysis.

Based on the dynamic model of ","In fact, as an inevitable policy, delaying retirement age has already been considered by the Chinese government. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other government agencies proposed to study the policy of flexibly delaying the pension age in 2012. Since then, the specific reform plan for delaying the legal retirement age has been under intensive investigation.==== In the 14th Five-year Plan for the Development of Human Resources and Social Security announced in June 2021, MOHRSS clearly claimed to ¡°implement gradual postponement of the legal retirement age steadily¡±. Meanwhile, an extensive literature also holds a positive attitude towards the impact of delayed retirement. It is believed that delaying retirement can not only reduce human capital waste but also significantly ease the payment pressure of pension funds, improve the pension replacement rate and effectively reduce the gap of pension funds, thereby enhancing the sustainability of the pension system (====; ====). Thus, there is no doubt that implementation of a gradual retirement policy in China has become a foregone conclusion. However, a lot of questions remain unanswered. For example, what impact will an increase in the retirement age have on the agent's==== economic activity? Does there exist an optimal delayed retirement age for population aging, and how to determine it? This paper intends to analyze these issues.==== find that the optimal working hours are 44.22?years when the leisure preference parameter and life expectancy are set as 0.643 and 77.84?years, respectively. ==== construct an optimal life cycle model including the perfect capital market and calibrate the parameters of the model by using American data, and find that with the increase of average life expectancy, the optimal delayed retirement ages of agents born in 1901, 1951, and 1996 are 65.1, 68.1, and 70.3?years, respectively. ==== add the trade-off choice between medical insurance and retirement to the life cycle model, and show that the optimal delayed retirement age is between 67 and 70?years. However, these conclusions are not practically relevant, due to a lack of social security system led by the government.====The other branch of literature includes the social security system in the models. For example, ==== maximizes mortality weighted income from Social Security and private saving, and claims that the optimal retirement age is 62. However, such a model suffers some drawbacks, as its objective function is to maximize output or income. The fundamental purpose of social and economic development is not only to pursue the maximization of economic interests, which is just one part of the residents' good life, but should also be well allied with the goal proposed by the Chinese government.==== point out that the optimal working time is between 35 and 48?years when the life expectancy is 70?years by studying a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system. ==== clarify the impact of delayed retirement in China through simultaneously deciding the optimal delayed retirement age and the pension insurance contribution rate to maximize the agent's life-time discounted utility, and claim that the agent's optimal delayed retirement age is between 53 and 59?years old. However, there is still room for improvement. First, the existing literature ignores the change in the age structure of labor force caused by delayed retirement, while ==== point out that different age structures of labor force have different labor productivity, which results in different labor supplies and wage incomes, and has a further series of effects on the agent's retirement benefits, consumption and saving decision. In addition, ====, ====, and ==== also provide empirical evidence that the deterioration of health status could significantly reduce the labor productivity and labor participation rate of the elderly. Studies on developed countries such as Europe and the United States have also reached similar conclusions (====; ====). While some prior studies have realized that labor productivity will decrease with the increase of workers' age, which has a significant impact on workers' retirement decisions, no prior research incorporates it into the model when determining the optimal retirement age. We have examined the difference between the agent's labor productivity in youth and old age, which is referred to simply as the agent's age difference in labor productivity.====Secondly, ====, ==== and other studies, when determining the leisure preference parameter in the agent's life-time discounted utility to study the problem of delayed retirement in China, mostly directly employ the value calibrated by studies on foreign countries, which may not be in line with Chinese reality. ==== point out that residents in different countries have their own ethnic characteristics that will be reflected in daily life and work behavior. Furthermore, trade-offs and preferences for work and leisure time vary widely with races (====; ====). Finally, although this class of the literature considers the adjustment and decision-making role of the social security system, the setting of the social security system is often simplified as much as possible due to the differences in domestic and foreign systems or model tractability. In fact, the endowment insurance system what China adopts is the combination of social account and individual accounts (====) which are respectively managed by the PAYG system and the fully-funded system. Despite the ¡°empty account¡± problem in individual accounts at one time (====) resulting from the imbalance between revenue and expenditure and the pension gap, China has been gradually consolidating the individual accounts since 2005.==== In fact, there is a close relationship between the delayed retirement policy and the pension system. On the one hand, the formulation of delayed retirement policy will necessarily involve the collection mode and amount of endowment insurance to improve the quality of residents' life. On the other hand, the delayed retirement policy will lead to changes in the structure of the working and retired population, affecting revenue and expenditure of the pension system. Therefore, if all features above of Chinese current pension insurance system are not included in the model or are just considered in a simplified fashion, or even the impact of endowment insurance system is ignored, then the results are not practically relevant and provide little implications for the Chinese delayed retirement policy.====In this paper, we establish a model to determine the optimal delayed retirement age conditional on deepening population aging. In order to be consistent with the policy objectives of ¡°comprehensively promoting consumption and enhancing the basic role of consumption in economic development¡± and ¡°satisfying people's good life¡±,==== our model maximizes the agent's life-time discounted utility, incorporating the impacts of changing labor productivity caused by the changing population age structure, social security system, enterprise production, and other factors affected by delayed retirement. Through the model, we analyze the impact of different delayed retirement ages on agent's youth and old-age consumption ang savings. Then, we calibrate the model parameters such as agent's leisure preference according to the requirements of the model and being closer to the reality in China. Based on numerical simulations, we estimate the optimal delayed retirement age adapted to China's practical reality and then analyze its influence on the main economic indicators including agent's youth and old-age consumption.====The contributions of this paper to prior literature are mainly as follows. First, this paper examines the effects of age difference in labor productivity on the optimal delayed retirement age. On the one hand, delaying retirement will increase the total labor supply. On the other hand, compared with youth, the agent's labor productivity will decline in the elderly, resulting in a substantial reduction in effective labor supply. The first effect acts as an incentive for a delayed retirement, while the second works in the opposite direction. This is in a sharp contrast with most previous studies with the assumption that labor productivity is homogeneous in youth and old age (====; ====).====Second, in the numerical analysis, this paper also examines the trend of Chinese population aging and labor productivity in the elderly from 2020 to 2100, and their influence on the optimal delayed retirement age. Our results first show that the optimal delayed retirement age in China presents a unique inverted U-shaped pattern under the foregoing influences. It will rise initially and then decline after reaching the peak in 2075.====Third, as noted, different ethnic characteristics will significantly affect residents' preference for work-leisure. Our numerical results also show that Chinese agent is more diligent and hard-working, and also has a higher preference for work. Therefore, this paper utilizes the historical data of Chinese population structure and economic variables to calibrate the parameters of agent's leisure preference, rather than imitating previous research nor directly applying the parameter values in literature. The optimal delayed retirement age obtained based on our model will be more applicable.====Fourth, different from the research of ====, this paper discusses China's delayed retirement policy and the impact of the following four factors will be considered comprehensively in determining the optimal delayed retirement age in China. The first is the full prediction and division of the aging degree of China's population. According to the ¡°World Population Prospects¡± issued by the United Nations, this paper calculates the degree of China's population aging from 2025 to 2100, and divides it into moderate aging (from 2025 to 2040) and severe aging (from 2040 to 2100). During the period of moderate aging in China, the proportion of the population aged 60 and above will increase by 10%, which is considered an accelerated phase of population aging, and then the degree of population aging will gradually slow down. The second is the full characterization of Chinese basic endowment insurance system. The third is the full description and embodiment of Chinese development goals of ¡°meeting people's aspirations to live a good life¡± and ¡°expanding domestic demand¡±. The fourth is to accurately estimate the labor productivity and work-leisure preference of Chinese people. Therefore, compared with prior research, this paper will be more reliable in the calculation of Chinese optimal delayed retirement age under the background of deepening population aging.====Fifth, according to the connotation of ¡°gradual delayed retirement¡± put forward by the Chinese government, this paper further provides detailed plans and implementation steps for gradual delayed retirement under different aging degrees to support the design of a reasonable delayed retirement policy. For more specific innovations and features in other aspects of this paper, please refer to notes ====, ==== and ====.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: ==== analyzes the influence of delayed retirement. ==== calibrates the model in the aspects of population aging, social security system, and agent's production and consumption activities. ==== presents the calculation and numerical simulation results of the optimal delayed retirement age and the impacts under different degrees of population aging. ==== concludes the paper.====Substitute Eqs. ====, ==== into Eq. ==== and recall the second formula in Eq. ==== to rearrange and obtain the following representation of the optimal youth consumption in the steady state:====in which ====?=?====?+?==== from Eq. ====.

Name length effects on income present gender, urban-rural, clan culture intensity, and age cohort heterogeneity. Further mechanism analyses indicate that name length may affect personal labor market performance by affecting evaluations by others, and formations of human and social capital. Recommendations toward neutralizing such effects and avoiding economic name-based discriminations are also discussed.","Names play an important role in personal life and affect life outcomes, such as academic achievement and labor market performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). To make it easier for the public to remember, numerous celebrities have adopted short stage names to replace their long names given at birth. For example, the internationally renowned Kung Fu superstar Jackie Chan (i.e., ==== Long, two Chinese characters)==== was originally named ==== Gangsheng (three Chinese characters), and Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta gets global attention under the stage name Lady Gaga. A few celebrities change their original short names to long names to increase their recognition. For example, the Chinese pop singer Faye Wong's original name is ==== Lin (two Chinese characters).

Similarly, ==== find that articles with short titles are easier to remember, tend to be published in better journals, and are more frequently cited. Although there are some studies on the lengths of academic paper titles and word symbolizing objects (e.g., furniture and pictures), few studies examine the lengths of people's names.====Our study contributes to the literature in multiple ways. First, it expands the research on discrimination theory. Existing literature has found evidence of gender and racial discrimination based on gender and race information embedded in names (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====); however, few studies have considered the length of names in this context. Our study addresses this research gap by exploring the relationship between name length and labor market performance; it shows that discrimination is not only based on the identity information contained in names and may be due to the name length as well. Second, we enrich the literature on the relationship between names and life outcomes against diverse cultural backgrounds and development status. Unlike English names made of letters (e.g., Ed, Tom, Addison, Jacquelyn), Chinese names are composed of characters and usually between 2 and 4 characters long (e.g., ==== Yi, ==== Yiyi, ==== Yiyi). Our innovative study is the first to examine the effects of name length on individuals' labor market performance. Third, we provide important clues to understanding why names can profoundly affect our lives. Previous studies have found relationships between racial and gender characteristics of names and evaluations of the name holder by others (e.g., people's preferences and employer discrimination) (====; ====). We not only provide empirical evidence on the economic effects of name length but also examine the mechanisms driving name effects by exploring the economic effects of name length on participants before and after entering the labor market.====Using datasets derived from the 2005 China census and the 2016 CCSLS, we obtain findings regarding the following: first, the relationships between individuals' full name (¡°fullname¡±) length and employment probability and income; second, the economic effects of name length by gender, Hukou type, clan culture intensity, and age cohort====; and third, the role of name length in evaluations by others, and formations of human and social capital.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the conceptual framework and hypotheses. ==== describes the data. ==== lays out the empirical analyses, and ==== concludes.",Name length and labor market performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000603,6 April 2023,2023,Research Article,27

Among privately-owned enterprises (POEs), ownership concentration has negative and positive effects on their debt and cash reserves, respectively, consistent with controlling shareholders' incentives to stave off business failures and ride out adverse future circumstances. These effects are more pronounced if POEs have high market-to-book, suggesting that growth opportunities heighten their controlling shareholders' desire to avoid debt and hoard cash. Although ownership concentration has similar effects on debt and cash in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), these effects in SOEs appear to reflect management discretion or conservatism. Our evidence suggests that ownership concentration is a key driver of corporate finance in an emerging market, but private and state ownership concentrations have seemingly similar but qualitatively different consequences.","). Indeed, we find that China's firms have high levels of ownership concentration, as the five-largest shareholders own 49.7% and 53.3% of the average POE and SOE, respectively, in our sample of listed firms for the period 2010¨C2019. This can imply that, unlike in the U.S., the interests of major shareholders are a key driver of corporate financial policies in China.====). Along the same lines, the precautionary motive for holding cash (e.g., ====) can figure prominently in POEs' financial policy because of their restricted access to external finance, coupled with high economic and regulatory uncertainties. Concentrated ownership heightens this motive, as top shareholders' loss from adverse financial circumstances is commensurate with the size of their ownership stakes. Thus, the precautionary motive can prompt POEs to stock up on cash when ownership concentration is high. We further posit that, compared to minority shareholders, top shareholders have a greater incentive to preserve investment opportunities and this incentive can steer POEs' financial policy further toward lower debt and higher cash.====), while they enjoy preferential access to debt financing. ==== posit that SOEs with high state ownership (i.e., concentrated ownership) are required to serve society at large or protect people's livelihood, compared to SOEs with low state ownership (i.e., diversified ownership). Accordingly, the state capitalism suggests that SOEs with high ownership concentration pursue growth or employment targets set by the state more vigorously, compared to SOEs with low ownership concentration. This pursuit could lead to suboptimal investment¡ªmore accurately, overinvestment¡ªwhich depletes cash resources, resulting in small cash balances along with large debt. Therefore, the state capitalism view predicts that ownership concentration is positively associated with debt but negatively with cash.====Meanwhile, the second view (¡°the management discretion view¡±) points to the potential that the separation of management and ownership in SOEs creates management discretion problems. In this view, high state ownership in SOEs yields the absence of other major shareholders that can restrain managers' self-serving decisions. Specifically, in SOEs with high state ownership, managers are quasi-government bureaucrats (====; ====; ====; ====) and conservatism (or risk-aversion) can be built into their character and decision making so it manifests in the form of avoiding debt and hoarding cash. Meanwhile, conservatism is likely to be less pronounced in SOEs with low state ownership, as those SOEs are expected to strive to preserve and increase the value of state assets, compared with SOEs with high state ownership (e.g., ====). Moreover, their managers have greater incentives to create shareholder value, as they are evaluated based more on economic performance than on political performance (e.g., ====). Thus, compared to their counterparts in SOEs with concentrated ownership, managers in SOEs with diversified ownership tolerate greater risk in managing financial policies, resulting in higher debt and lower cash reserves. In sum, the managerial discretion view predicts that ownership concentration is negatively associated with debt but positively with cash among SOEs.====Therefore, these two views yield contrasting predictions for SOEs. The state capitalism view (the management discretion view) predicts that high ownership concentration leads to high debt and low cash (low debt and high cash). In both views, however, investment opportunities are unlikely to factor into SOEs' debt and cash decisions because the social stability mandate and managerial conservatism are not conducive to preserving investment opportunities.====To test our predictions, we construct a sample of China's listed firms from the CSMAR database for the period 2010¨C2019. We measure ownership concentration by the top-five shareholders' equity ownership in each firm on the premise that their equity holdings reflect controlling shareholders' interests as well as their power. In the first part of our investigation, we analyze the effects of ownership concentration on POEs' debt and cash policies. In the second part, we extend our analysis to SOEs to explore the potential that private and state ownership concentration can have different consequences for corporate debt and cash policies.====We first conduct bivariate analysis on ownership concentration's relation with debt and cash by sorting POEs into quintiles based on ownership concentration (====). We find that the total debt ratio decreases as ownership concentration increases, with the median total debt ratio decreasing from the bottom (0.201) to the top ==== quintile (0.173). The short-term debt ratio displays a similar pattern, with its median decreasing from the bottom (0.138) to the top ==== quintile (0.107). However, the median long-term debt ratio of our sample POEs is close to zero, suggesting that the majority of POEs do not have access to long-term debt financing. Meanwhile, the cash ratio increases with an increase of ownership concentration, with the median cash ratio increasing from the bottom (0.136) to the top ==== quintile (0.157).====We then estimate ====Our results suggest that POEs' capital structure and cash policies are shaped by top shareholders' incentives to avoid bankruptcy/liquidation risk and scrutiny from creditors. To test whether these incentives are more pronounced if the firm has investment opportunities, we create a high market-to-book dummy (i.e., a proxy for investment opportunities) and then interact it with ownership concentration. Regression results suggest that the presence of investment opportunities reinforces both the negative and positive effects of ownership concentration on debt and cash, respectively. In addition, we address the concern that POEs with high ownership concentration may underinvest, given that such firms use debt financing sparingly and maintain large cash balances. We quantify underinvestment by taking deviations from expected investment (e.g., ====) and find that high ownership concentration does not lead to underinvestment.====We then turn our attention to SOEs. Our regression results show that ownership concentration also has negative and positive effects on the debt and cash of SOEs, respectively, suggesting that, like POEs, SOEs with high ownership concentration also shun debt and stockpile cash. Therefore, our evidence supports the management discretion view, rather than the state capitalism view. Meanwhile unlike in POEs, the presence of investment opportunities does not strengthen SOEs' propensities to avoid debt and hoard cash at high levels of ownership concentration, consistent with the idea that self-interested SOE managers have little incentive to protect growth opportunities in setting debt and cash policies. These findings continue to hold if we use state ownership in place of top five shareholdings as a proxy for ownership concentration. We further find that, unlike in POEs, management ownership in SOEs is close to zero. Therefore, our results fall in line with the idea that high ownership concentration in SOEs is associated with greater management discretion or conservatism, yielding those firms' penchant to avoid debt and hoard cash but with little intention of safeguarding investment opportunities.====The present study adds to the growing literature on Chinese firms' corporate finance by shining the spotlight on ownership concentration. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document that ownership concentration shapes Chinese firms' capital structure and cash policies. Despite the fact that firms outside the U.S. are typically under the control of families or the state with high ownership concentration (====), previous studies have paid little attention to the ramifications of ownership concentration for China's firms. Although ==== examine Chinese firms' ownership concentration, their study covers a period prior to the split-share reform in 2005 and does not consider capital structure and cash policies. ==== identify a list of firm characteristics that determine Chinese firms' capital structure, but they do not consider ownership concentration.====We present novel findings concerning the consequences of private and state ownership concentration. Although concentrated ownership has ostensibly identical effects on capital structure and cash reserves for both POEs and SOEs, those effects are underpinned by fundamentally different forces. In regard to private ownership concentration, our findings point to the primacy of controlling shareholders' desire to stave off credit events and other adverse circumstances as a way to preserve investment opportunities. We speculate ==== observation¡ªthat more productive firms hold more cash in China¡ªcould arise partly from a similar desire of POEs to preserve such opportunities. In contrast, with respect to state ownership concentration, our findings suggest that the management-ownership separation in SOEs creates management entrenchment (e.g., ====; ====), a problem that only intensifies at high levels of ownership concentration. In short, although high ownership concentration yields low debt and high cash in both POEs and SOEs, such effects reflect two disparate underlying forces: controlling shareholders' incentives to preserve investment opportunities in POEs vs. management discretion in SOEs.====This study complements prior international studies documenting that the type of ownership (i.e., private vs. state ownership) matters to corporate performance and behavior. For example, ==== find that state-owned firms are less efficiently run but use more debt than privately-owned firms. ==== show that private ownership concentration is positively associated with post-privatization performance and such positive association is stronger in countries with weak investor protection. Our evidence also relates to ==== finding that corporate risk taking is negatively associated with state ownership. Our study extends this strand of research by demonstrating that ownership concentration is a key driver of corporate finance in an emerging market, but private and state ownership concentrations have qualitatively different (albeit seemingly similar) consequences.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== develops our hypotheses and describes the sample and key variables, ==== presents empirical results, and ==== concludes.",Ownership concentration and financial policy of China's listed firms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000585,6 April 2023,2023,Research Article,28

In the digital economic age, this is a crucial issue. Using the 2011¨C2015 national tax survey database (NTSD) and the Peking University digital finance index, this paper examines the causal relationship between digital finance and small business tax compliance. Our baseline results show that each standard deviation increase in the digital finance index reduces the level of tax noncompliance by 7.5% for small businesses. We exclude the interference of contemporaneous policies, utilize a specification design based on neighboring cities across provincial borders, and employ instrumental variable estimation methods to jointly alleviate concerns about endogeneity. Furthermore, mechanism analysis shows that digital finance impacts small business tax noncompliance by easing corporate financing constraints and capturing tax-related ¡°digital information¡±. Finally, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of digital finance development. The effects on tax noncompliance are weaker for large firms (placebo group), small businesses supported by the government's industrial policy, and small businesses located in poor credit environment areas.","Digital finance, as an actual result of the digital transformation of the economy, is hastening the reconfiguration of the economic landscape in countries throughout the world. Numerous studies have found that the development of digital finance is conducive to encouraging corporate innovation (====; ====), promoting household consumption (====; ====; ====; ====), stimulating entrepreneurial enthusiasm (====; ====), and even facilitating liberalization in bank interest rates to some extent (====). However, few researchers have investigated the link between digital finance and corporate tax behavior within the same theoretical framework, ignoring the importance of digital finance in state tax governance. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by studying the effects of digital finance on small business tax compliance and provide a new understanding of the governance of corporate tax noncompliance in the digital economy era.====Small businesses' tax compliance and enforcement issues have plagued tax authorities worldwide, especially in developing countries (====; ====). Taking China as an example, although small businesses account for over 90% of all market entities, produce over 60% of GDP, and provide approximately 80% of jobs, relevant survey data indicate that over 90% of small businesses engage in tax noncompliance to varying degrees. In the current situation of an ongoing economic downturn and the sluggish growth of fiscal revenue, such widespread tax noncompliance by small businesses will undoubtedly affect budgetary sustainability.==== According to previous studies, improving a country's financial system is crucial to enhancing corporate tax compliance (====; ====; ====). This fact induces the following questions: In the age of the digital economy, can the development of digital finance help curb tax noncompliance by small businesses? If so, what is the mechanism behind it? Answering these questions has significant theoretical and practical implications.====Based on a systematic review of the literature, we clarify the theoretical logic of how digital finance affects small business tax compliance. First, digital finance may assist small businesses in relieving their financing constraints, which can help reduce the motivation for small businesses to avoid taxes. Small businesses often face a competitive disadvantage in the market, most notably in regard to the availability of external finance and financing costs (====). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) previously pointed out that credit-constrained small businesses may have a strong incentive to engage in tax noncompliance to finance their company operations (====; ====). In recent years, along with the deep integration of digital technology and finance, digital finance has played an essential role in serving small business financing. Unlike traditional finance, digital finance no longer relies on physical outlets. Using technologies such as big data, cloud computing, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI), digital finance establishes a bridge for direct communication between digital finance platforms and businesses. The rise of digital financial services such as P2P online lending and crowdfunding has enhanced access to credit for small businesses (====). In addition, digital finance reduces information friction between borrowers and lenders, which helps reduce the transaction costs of credit facilities (====). Consequently, the development of digital finance will effectively reduce financing constraints, affecting small business tax compliance.====Second, digital finance can record ¡°digital traces¡±, including third-party payment information, which tax authorities may use for tax audits. As we all know, small business operations are often non-standardized, making it difficult for tax authorities to obtain the accurate and effective tax-related information necessary for tax collection, which objectively provides a space for small businesses to avoid taxes (====). In the digital finance age, an increasing number of small businesses are being drawn into digital payment systems.==== According to ====, digital payment systems enable small businesses to receive and pay bills electronically, using a mobile phone, the internet, retail points of sale, and other broadly available access points instead of using cash or checks. The transaction traces left by small businesses in electronic payment systems are important tax-related information (====). In China, tax authorities are strengthening their cooperation with digital payment platforms. Using third-party tax-related information from digital payment platforms, tax authorities have identified and punished a variety of typical tax-evading enterprises.==== Thus, digital finance may reduce small business tax noncompliance by providing more third-party tax information.====To test our research hypotheses, we construct a novel dataset from different official sources. Firm-level data originate from the 2011¨C2015 national tax survey database (NTSD). NTSD is a nationwide random sample survey conducted by the State Administration of Taxation of China, and more than 400,000 firms are surveyed each year. Importantly, the sample from NTSD covers all regions and sectors in China and contains various forms of financial and tax information of firms, and approximately 87% of the sample are small businesses, which is particularly suited for the study issue of this paper (====).==== We use the Peking University digital financial inclusion index to measure a city's development in digital finance. This index is commonly utilized in recent research and is widely acknowledged. Based on the matched data,==== our paper examines the effects of the development of digital finance on small business tax compliance. We find that the higher the digital financial index (DFI) of a city is, the lower the level of tax noncompliance by small businesses. Our baseline results show that for every standard deviation increase in the city DFI, the level of tax noncompliance decreases by 7.5%.====We then conduct a series of tests to address potential endogeneity issues. First, we try to alleviate the impact of contemporaneous confounding policies on the benchmark results by controlling for additional city-level macro variables. Specifically, the basic conclusion of the paper still holds after considering the contemporaneous impacts of tax collecting technology advancement, tax system reform, and tax and fee reduction policies. Second, we follow the approach of ==== and ====, utilizing policy discontinuities at province borders to further identify the causal effect of digital finance on small business tax compliance. We compare all contiguous city pairs in China that are located on opposite sides of a province border. We still find that the development of digital finance can significantly reduce tax noncompliance by small businesses. Third, we draw on ==== and use the geographical distance from each city to Hangzhou, the origin of digital finance, as an instrumental variable for DFI.==== The results of the IV estimation still confirm the conclusions of this paper. Additionally, this paper performs extra tests for robustness. For example, the measurement method for corporate tax evasion is replaced; the benchmark regression results are revalidated using a county-level DFI; and a strongly balanced panel dataset is constructed to further control for firm fixed effects and exclude the interference of firm migration factors in the regressions.====After ensuring that the article's benchmark findings are reliable, this study further conducts a detailed test of mechanistic factors. Small business financing constraints and costs are shown to have a significant negative link with DFI. This verifies the article's first hypothesized mechanism, namely, that regional digital finance development reduces small business incentives to avoid taxes by reducing their funding difficulties. We then make full use of the firm tax data in NTSD to provide extensive empirical evidence of the tax-related information supply mechanism. We find that the development of digital finance has significantly increased the probability of small business tax noncompliance being detected. In addition, we see that the penetration of digital finance has led tax authorities to use the traditional simplified approach less to tax small businesses.==== More importantly, our article further finds that the significant negative relationship between digital finance and small business tax noncompliance is stronger in industries such as wholesale, retail, catering, and lodging,==== where tax-related information is harder to gather and monitor.====Finally, we study the heterogeneous effects across different types of firms. We first use large firms as the comparison sample for a placebo test. Large firms usually have easier access to external financing and are usually included in key tax source monitoring by tax authorities (====). Therefore, we do not observe a significant impact of digital finance on tax noncompliance by large firms. Similarly, small businesses that are supported by the government's industrial policy obtain not only policy guarantees in terms of financing but also financial subsidies and tax advantages (====; ====). Tax authorities will also pay close attention to small businesses that are eligible for government industrial policy support. Thus, digital finance has no significant effect on this sort of firm. We then also try to examine the impact of digital finance on small business tax compliance from the perspective of regional credit environments. We find that digital finance does not significantly inhibit business tax noncompliance in regions with worse credit environments. This finding demonstrates that even in the age of digital finance, credit remains the cornerstone of financial development. To maximize the positive effects of digital finance, a healthy regional credit environment is essential.====Our study extends the literature on the economic consequences of digital finance development. Whereas previous studies that have discussed the economic effects of digital financial development have primarily focused on corporate innovation, household consumption, and individual entrepreneurship (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====), little attention has been given to the impact on corporate tax compliance. To fill this gap, this paper examines in detail the relationship between digital finance and corporate tax noncompliance. Based on detailed tax administration data in China, this paper verifies the beneficial impact of digital finance in curbing small business tax noncompliance and delves into the underlying reasons why.====This paper also partially responds to the theoretical debate on the issue of tax administration in the digital economy era. A large body of literature highlights that the digital economy presents both challenges and opportunities for government tax administration (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Our study provides further supplementary evidence to a certain extent, showing that in the digital economy era, digital finance can effectively improve the tax compliance of small businesses and facilitate the government's tax management.====In addition, our paper also contributes to a growing literature on the impact of technology on tax enforcement. Technological improvement may provide tax authorities with greater capabilities to track transactions, facilitate third-party reporting and hence better collect taxes (====; ====; ====; ====). In essence, digital finance is also mainly driven by information technological improvement. Existing studies have emphasized the active application of information technology by tax authorities to obtain and supervise tax-related information. In contrast, our paper focuses on the supply side of tax-related information by digital finance, which differs from the literature by examining a previously overlooked dimension.====Finally, our paper relates to a set of studies that focuses on how to improve tax compliance for small businesses. In this type of literature, financing constraints and third-party tax-related information are identified as key factors affecting small business tax compliance (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). This paper further adds to the above literature. We find that alleviating corporate financing constraints and increasing the supply of tax-related information are the two main mechanisms through which digital finance affects small business tax compliance. This paper incorporates digital finance, financing constraints, tax-related information, and small business tax compliance into a unified analytical framework.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: ==== conducts the literature review and formulates the research hypotheses. Part 3 presents the data sources, variable construction, and identification strategies. The main empirical results are presented in ====. In ====, we examine the mechanism of this article. ==== discusses heterogeneous effects. ==== concludes.",How does the development of digital finance affect small business tax compliance?

Based on the Chinese institutional and cultural background, we introduce ==== as a mediating variable and CEO power as a moderating variable. We find that CEO narcissism is positively related to corporate performance based on 275 companies listed on the growth enterprise market (GEM) from 2012 to 2020. Furthermore, organizational innovation plays a partially mediating role in the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance, and the moderating role of CEO power is partially supported.","Numerous studies have shown that top managers play a key role in promoting corporate growth, entrepreneurial strategy decision-making, and corporate performance (====; ====; ====). Top managers, especially the chief executive officer (CEO) is the primary decision-maker in corporate strategic activities (====). According to the upper echelons theory, CEO's characteristics are related to corporate behaviors and subsequent performance (====; ====). At present, scholars focus on how CEO's demographic characteristics (age, tenure, professional background, and educational background) and personal characteristics (narcissism, humility, and arrogance) relate to corporate behavior and performance. Among them, CEO's narcissism, as a common and obvious personality characteristic, has attracted particular attention (====).====CEO narcissism is considered as an individual's stable and salient psychological characteristic (====; ====). Narcissism reflects a CEO's confidence in their abilities and charisma. Narcissistic CEOs desire admiration by deliberately displaying their abilities and talents (====). This unique characteristic is related to corporate behaviors and subsequent performance. Regrettably, previous studies have not reached a consensus on the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance (====). Some scholars suggest that CEO narcissism is positively related to corporate performance (====). Some scholars propose that CEO narcissism is negatively related to corporate performance (====). Some others also believe that CEO narcissism leads to more volatile corporate performance (====; ====). There are many reasons for the inconsistent conclusions of existing studies, such as different research objects, different measurement methods of variables, different selection of mediating mechanism and different research context. Therefore, we need to focus on research objects, enrich measures of CEO narcissism and corporate performance, and expand mediating mechanisms and research contexts.====Existing studies have confirmed that the impact of CEO narcissism on corporate performance is not a simple direct relationship (====; ====). ==== call for future studies to delve into the causal chain to understand the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance. Narcissistic CEOs need great breakthroughs and consistent improvements to maintain a positive self-image. Great breakthroughs and consistent improvements determine that narcissistic CEOs will pursue different kinds of innovation, such as exploratory and exploitative innovation, because they have different impacts on the CEO reputation and corporate performance. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the mediating role of organizational innovation in the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance. Especially in the era of digital economy, corporations face a high degree of uncertainty and competitive pressure, and need to constantly innovate to meet the changing needs of users (====). In such condition, the CEO's analysis and evaluation of external information is particularly important, which directly affects the innovation decisions and behaviors. Narcissistic CEOs may assess risk more optimistically and assertively, and be more likely to innovate (====), thus improving corporate performance. However, the existing studies have not focused on the mediating role of organizational innovation in the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance. Therefore, this study takes organizational innovation as an important path for the correlation between CEO narcissism and corporate performance, indicating that CEO narcissism may be indirectly related to corporate performance through organizational innovation.====Differences in the contexts of the studies may be another reason for the mixed results. Context is a major driver that explains the complexity, uniqueness, and richness of entrepreneurial research (====). Most existing studies on CEO narcissism are based on western situations. Different from western countries, institutional transformation shapes Chinese corporate culture, emphasizing obedience to authority and respect for power (====). Simultaneously, paternalistic leadership is more common in corporations in China's high-power distance culture (====). Corporate members also tend to follow the lead of top managers, making CEO power more effective. The unique institution and culture highlight the role of CEO power in corporate operations. As ==== viewed, the behavior of a narcissistic CEO is based on the combination of personality characteristics and situational characteristics. Therefore, we explore the contextual role of CEO power and reveal the moderating role of this variable in the relationship between CEO narcissism and organizational innovation.====Based on above, this study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance based on the companies listed on China's growth enterprise market (GEM). The study contributes to the existing literature in three main aspects. First, we examine the relationship between the narcissism of Chinese CEOs and corporate performance. Most existing research on CEO narcissism has focused on western countries, and no consensus has been reached on the relationship between CEO narcissism and performance (====). This paper further enriches the theoretical research on CEO narcissism and its relationship with corporate performance in emerging economies, such as China. Second, we find that CEO narcissism is indirectly related to corporate performance through different types of organizational innovation (exploratory and exploitative innovation). Previous studies show that the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance is not always direct (e.g., ====). We introduce organizational innovation as the mediating variable of the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate performance. Third, based on China's unique institution and culture, this study expands the contextual role of CEO power in Chinese corporations. We combine CEO narcissism and CEO power to reveal the relationship between their interaction terms and corporate innovation.====This paper is structured as follows. First, the existing literature is reviewed, and hypotheses are proposed. Second, variable measurements and data sources are explained, and empirical models are proposed; third, empirical results and robustness tests are presented.

A simple back-of-envelope calculation shows that the health shock induces a private cost of 34,966 RMB (US$ 5463) over 5?years for an average household, and incurs a social financial burden of 6066 RMB (US$ 948) in 5?years per household in medical reimbursement and social welfare transfers. At a national scale, the total social burden of health shocks from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases amounts to 1.1 trillion RMB (US$ 172.1 billion) over 5?years."," ==== find that the out-of-pocket medical spending of hospitalizations crowds out 26.4% of household education expenditure for an average working-age household in Vietnam. The long-term impacts of health shocks on health, labor productivity, human capital accumulation, and overall well-being in developing countries are understudied and deserve more investigation.====Being the largest developing country with a rapidly aging population, China faces a daunting quest of protecting its 500 million households from an increasing disease burden. By 2015, more than 28 million individuals had been impoverished due to severe illnesses, accounting for 40% of total registered poverty-stricken population.==== A much larger population is facing the threat of severe illnesses (====). In a nationally representative sample of Chinese households, we find that the average out-of-pocket medical spending accounts for 31% of annual household income, a proportion much higher than those in developed countries (e.g., 2.6% in the US, ====). This suggests a particularly high financial vulnerability of the average Chinese household to major illnesses. Based on a sample of elderly population (aged 50 to 59) in China, ==== find that the increase in direct out-of-pocket hospitalization costs after a hospital admission amounts to a staggering 93% of pre-hospitalization income, a share one order of magnitude higher than those in the US (2.9%) and European countries (1.5%). Considering the staggering immediate economic cost of health shocks, it is imperative to assess how Chinese households respond to an acute and unexpected health event.====We aim to quantify the causal effects of a sudden acute onset of severe diseases (hereafter referred to as a health shock) on households' health, income, and behavioral responses in China. We adopt two nationally representative longitudinal surveys in China¡ªChina Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS), both of which record detailed medical history of household members so that we can track the onset of a health shock for each individual and observe the resulting changes of a rich set of household socioeconomic and health outcomes. By analyzing a health shock on a representative sample of Chinese households, our results shed light on the causal effect of adverse health events on household behaviors and circumstances in China and other developing countries with similar health care systems.====We adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) design augmented with coarsened exact matching (CEM) method. Our empirical analyses follow three steps. First, we define a health shock as the first onset of an unexpected, acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular health event, such as a nonfatal stroke or a heart attack. These health events are the leading causes of disease burden in China (====) and for the world (====), and are recognized by the literature as acute emergency events whose particular timing is unpredictable (====; ====; ====, ====We find three sets of main results. First, the health shock leads to a large, persistent reduction in household income per capita for the average household in China. Although the effect on labor supply is temporary and dissipates quickly over time, the negative effect on income and assets lasts for years¡ªthe estimated reduction remains statistically significant after 5?years, the end of our observational window. The health shock causes a loss of annual household income per capita of 841 RMB in inflation-adjusteded 2020 price (US$ 118, or 6.6% of household annual income per capita) and a loss of household net asset per capita of 13,635 RMB (US$ 2130, or 9.7% of household net asset). It also statistically significantly increases the household's risk of falling under poverty line by 2.8 percentage points (====), or about 14% of baseline poverty rate during our sample period (19.6?====). Over time, an adverse health shock results in an increase of 16,943 RMB (US$ 2647) in direct, out-of-pocket medical expenditure and a reduction of 17,743 RMB (US$ 2772) in household income over five years for an average household in China. Most of the post-shock reduction in household income is not insured by income insurance, and about 6.3% is compensated by the increase in social welfare transfers.====). The health shock also induces a noticeable change in spouse's preventive care behaviors, shown by an increase in physical exercises and large expenditure on fitness and health supplements. We find a small and insignificant effect of the health shock on spouse labor supply. This may be due to a cancelling-out of a negative effect on spousal labor supply due to a higher demand for informal care and a positive effect to compensate the income loss.====), the estimated overall increase in public financial burden due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health shocks amounts to 120.1 billion RMB (=26.85?¡Á?(3863?+?1119)/1000) over five years, in terms of public expenditure on medical reimbursement and public welfare transfers.====Overall, we find a large and persistent negative impact of adverse health shocks on individual's health, income, household asset, and household members' well-being. The health shock also incurs large social cost due to higher financial burden on the social insurance and public welfare system. Our finding suggests that unexpected diseases pose an imminent threat to the health and financial well-being of Chinese households as well as the sustainability of China's public health insurance system and the safety net program.====There is a large economic literature documenting the economic consequences of health shocks in developed countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ==== finds a hospital admission leads to an 11-==== decline in the labor market participation and 20% reduction of pre-admission individual income among non-elderly US population. ==== find a smaller, 3.4% reduction in household income after a nonfatal health shock in Denmark.====However, much less is known about the economic consequences of health shocks in developing countries. Notable exceptions include ====, who find that worsened health status of the household head reduces labor supply and income in Indonesia, although the effect varies in sign and size for different health shock measures. ==== and ==== find evidence that health shocks lead to large reduction in consumption, income, and labor supply in Vietnam, in particular for uninsured households. ==== document an average 21.6% reduction in annual household income due to health reasons in India, particularly among the rural poor. For Chinese households, ==== find that worsened health status causes a 15% reduction of labor market participation and 6.2% reduction of household per capita income.====Due to data limitations, these prior studies in developing countries mostly rely on self-assessed health status, all-cause hospitalization, or extremely rare events such as death of a household member as measures of a health shock, and exploit cross-sectional variations to assess the relationship between health status and labor market outcomes. Our study contributes to this strand of literature by focusing on a set of acute and unexpected health shocks and identifying the first onset of health shocks as a change of health. We adopt CEM and DID methods with fixed effects to remove both observable and unobservable heterogeneities of patients and households. This helps us to separate the impact of the adverse health event on economic outcomes from other potential secular trends and from the potential endogeneity of reported health to economic circumstances. In addition, we investigate a wide range of household health and socioeconomic outcomes, in particular, measures of mental health and the household receipt of public poverty-alleviation allowance, and assess both the private and social cost of health shocks in a nationally representative sample of Chinese population.====Our study also contributes to the growing literature on quantifying the impact of health shocks on the entire household, particularly the intra-household spillover effects (====; ====, ====; ====; ====). When a family member falls ill, other members play the main role of financial support and informal care (====; ====; ====). Health shocks may also change the family health behaviors through learning about genetic and life-style-related health risks and the salience of health shocks itself (====). However, existing studies in developed countries have found mixed results on the magnitude and even the existence of a spillover effect on other household members. For example, ==== document that cancer diagnoses substantially ==== the labor supply of the spouse in Canada. However, in Denmark, health shocks significantly ==== the spouse's labor supply to compensate for the loss of household income (====). In Netherlands, parental health shocks lead to ==== significant change in their adult children's income and labor supply (====). This wide range of estimated intra-household spillover effects naturally reflects the institutional differences in the public and private health insurance system as well as the social support system across countries, such as the existence and functioning of long-term care (====).====; ====). Existing evidence in developing countries mostly focus on family's consumption and income-related outcomes (e.g., ====; ====; ====), with a lack of evaluation on mental health, time use, or health behaviors of family members. Our work contributes to filling this gap in knowledge by quantifying the impacts of adverse health shocks on mental health and health behaviors for both the respondent and the spouse. We find that the health shock worsens spousal mental health but leads to a notable improvement in spouse's health-promoting behaviors, including reducing smoking and drinking and increasing the spending on fitness and health supplements. These behavioral adjustments are long-lasting. These findings suggest that family members actively adjust their health behaviors to reduce their health risks after a health shock in the family. These findings based on Chinese households has broader implications on other developing countries.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background and discusses stylized facts on adverse health shocks in China. Section 3 describes the data and summary statistics. Section 4 discusses the empirical methodology. Sections 5 presents the main findings. Section 6 presents the heterogeneity analyses and Section 7 provides robustness checks.

They benefit in additional ways such as receiving more informal financing in trade credit (====), attracting migrating workers (====), conducting more R&D investments (====), and adjusting faster toward its target capital structure (====). Currently, the social trust literature encompasses the trust-based relationships among all stakeholders in the region. In its breadth, researchers have overlooked a key external stakeholder of firms, which is the large effect of government and the notion of political trust by the market participants.====), and societal decisions at large (====). Moreover, much of the literature focuses more on a public administration perspective by studying the contributing factors of government trust (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). We attribute the relative lack of studies on the subject of government trust on firm behavior to the relative unavailability of reliable government trust metrics.====In our paper, we argue that government trust is particularly effective in shaping a small or medium firm's long-term strategy, behavior, and practices. For these long-term business strategies, such as R&D investments, the firm must leverage or follow government policies to maximize their chance of success. For instance, ====). We draw from stakeholder theory (====) to show that the government is a pivotal stakeholder of SMEs. The government uses economic policies to provide innovation-friendly platforms, tax incentives, or subsidies to facilitate SMEs to engage in R&D investments and position themselves for long-term innovation success. Without government trust, SMEs may question the continuity of these policies and adopt a ¡°wait and see¡± approach that leads to fewer R&D investments. To better understand the context around government trust and SME investments, we test one main hypothesis and two related but supplemental hypotheses.====First, we find that an atmosphere of high government trust in the region where a firm is located translates into greater R&D investments for the SMEs. These results are economically significant: for a one ==== increase in the government trust index, an SME has 23.9% increase in the standard deviation of R&D investments. Our findings are robust after accounting for endogeneity and controlling for the impact of social trust. Second, the SME owner's desire to innovate mediates the effect of government trust on a SME's R&D investments. That is, when there is a high level of government trust, SME owners with greater desire to innovate make more R&D investments, as they feel that their future working environments will be stable and reliable. Finally, the effect of government trust on R&D investments is less salient when the region has aspects that encourage greater government trust (such as high marketization level). Collectively, government trust contributes to a SME's R&D investments even more than social trust.====We make two contributions. First, we advance the literature on how societal culture affects a firm's behavior and practices. Prior studies related to government trust focus on a public administration perspective without examining business decisions made by firms (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Specifically, we demonstrate how government trust has an economically significant impact on a firm's behavior and practices, finding that government trust has an even greater impact than social trust on an SME's R&D investments. Our exploratory findings confirm that the government is an essential stakeholder of SMEs and their business decisions; moreover, unlike other constituents, governments are uniquely able to influence the R&D behavior of these firms. Hence, our study also contributes to the broad literature of how local government impacts SME investments (====). Second, our findings have a public policy implication. Policies that aim to spark innovation through investments in R&D, such as regulations around tax incentives, are more effective if the local government is trusted by its constituents. Consequently, we contribute to the literature on the role of government in promoting SME development by suggesting that governments should strive to be viewed as trustworthy by SMEs, adopting practices that ultimately boost the economic development of a country. In addition to the tangible support such as tax or subsidies, the intangible support of a government in terms of a trustworthy business platform is critical.",What is the role of government trust in a firm's R&D investments?

This simultaneously results in both tax cuts and tax increases depending on the pre-reform tax rates of the firms. This tax reform gives us a unique opportunity to assess the behavioral difference across firms on both sides of the tax reform. The major advantage of this setting is that some firms experienced a tax cut while others faced a tax increase within the context of the same reform, thereby solving the problem of institutional heterogeneity that would be difficult to surmount if we instead compared two reforms occurring at different points in time or across geographic boundaries. We would like to study whether the tax compliance behaviors of firms experiencing a tax increase were the same as those of firms experiencing a tax cut, and why.====Prior to the tax reform, China's statutory corporate income tax rate was set at 33%. However, various preferential tax treatments were given to certain ==== and regions. So, the effective tax rates were lower for companies in these industries and regions. The 2008 corporate tax reform harmonized corporate tax rates to 25% and removed the preferential treatments. As a result, firms that previously received such preferential tax treatments with effective tax rates below 25% faced a tax increase due to the reform. Other firms whose tax rates were above 25% experienced a tax cut after the reform. This unique tax reform in China provides us with an ideal setting for examining tax compliance behaviors between firms that faced tax cuts and those that faced tax increases.====We calculate firms' effective tax rates (ETRs) following ====, ====, ====, and ====, as the average corporate tax payable divided by the pre-tax profit.==== To mitigate noise in a single year's estimate, we compute the pre-reform ETRs over 2005¨C07 and classify each firm into either a ==== group if its pre-reform ETR was higher than 27% or a ==== group if its pre-reform ETR was lower than 23%. If its pre-reform ETR was between 23 and 27% we classify the firms as the ==== group. Although some authors use the ETR as a measure of tax avoidance when studying the U.S. publicly traded firms, our practice is consistent with ==== who show that pre-reform ETRs are not typically manipulated by unlisted firms in China.==== Our sample is a panel data set of 14,557 unlisted domestic firms over the five years 2005¨C09.==== Of these, 4632 firms had pre-reform ETRs below 23% and experienced tax increases due to the reform, while 8323 firms experienced tax cuts, and the remaining 1602 are unaffected firms.====A large literature studying tax avoidance uses the semi-elasticity of reported pre-tax profit to tax rate differential (across jurisdictions or across time) to measure tax avoidance (e.g. ====; ====; ====We start with a difference-in-differences setting where firms unaffected by the tax reform are the reference group, we compare tax avoidance behaviors of firms facing tax cuts or tax increases with firms in the reference group. We find that, compared to unaffected firms, tax-increasing firms reported a 0.669%age points lower profit margin on average, equivalent to 9 percent of the average profit margin. Thus, firms facing tax increases began to under-report profits after 2008 to avoid paying more taxes. Changes in reported profits for firms facing tax cuts are very small and statistically insignificant. Importantly, we check for and find parallel trends for tax-increasing firms and tax-cut firms relative to the unaffected firms prior to the reform. Before the tax reform, we also find the characteristics of the firms facing tax increase/cut are very similar to the unaffected firms, which further validates our difference-in-differences setting.====The loss aversion literature is founded on the idea that losses are perceived much more strongly than gains (originally in ====; ====; ====; and extended in applications in ====; ====; ====). The reference point for assessing both losses and gains was the post-reform tax rate. In this view, firms with pre-reform ETRs below would be more averse to losses due to the tax increase they experienced and consequently would have a greater incentive to manipulate reports and avoid paying more taxes. In contrast, firms facing tax cuts would have a lower incentive to change their earnings report. Our findings are in line with this view.====Since the pre-reform effective tax rate is endogenous, one concern on the identification strategy is that the effect of some determinants of the pre-reform tax rate may change with other shocks in 2008. To address this concern, we first examine the determinants of firms' pre-reform tax rates. The estimates show that the most important determinants of the tax rates include regional (explaining 69% of the variation) and industrial (explaining 9% of the variation) differences due to preferential tax treatment and related firm characteristics (explaining 22% of the variation). As a result, we interact the post-reform dummy with these determinants in our regressions and find the results to be consistent. This could potentially rule out the concern that the effect of the tax increase and post dummy is driven by the interaction between cofounders and other shocks (such as the financial crisis in 2008).====We then separate the sample by ownership structures ¨C private firms versus state-owned firms ¨C and find the same pattern in the private firm sample. However, there is no such finding for state-owned firms. This is consistent with what has been written about state-owned firms. They pursue multiple goals as instruments of the state and need to satisfy policy goals beyond their profit maximization goals. As a result, they necessarily have softer budget constraints. Therefore, state-owned firms do not necessarily have a strategy for paying taxes, if they have one at all. Paying taxes does not take money out of the pockets of their managers and stakeholders.====Finally, we delve into the mechanics of how firms facing tax increases after the 2008 tax reform achieved tax avoidance. Two channels deserve consideration: the manipulation of the costs of goods sold and other expenses, and the manipulation of net receivables. We find that the costs of goods sold and other expenses exhibit the same asymmetric pattern while we find insignificant results on net receivables. As a result, it is likely that firms in China manipulate their expenses and costs to avoid paying more taxes when facing a tax increase.====The policy implication from our findings is that tax increases should be treated with caution because they incentivize tax avoidance behavior by firms, as the loss aversion theory would predict. Our findings about tax cuts should also be news to policymakers. The finding that firms facing tax cuts behave no differently than firms unaffected by the reform is a rejection of the belief many policymakers and economists have that lower corporate tax rates incentivize firms to reduce tax avoidance and therefore keep tax revenues from falling. The policy implication from our findings is that the idea that a tax cut raises tax revenue might be oversold.====Our paper is related to studies based on China's 2008 tax reform. Most of these studies focus on the consolidation of tax rates between domestic-owned firms and foreign-invested firms. ==== reveals that the consolidation of tax rates drove away foreign direct investment. From a different angle, ==== discuss the differential reactions between public and private firms facing tax cuts during the 2008 tax reform. They find that private firms reported higher accrued expenses in 2007 than in 2008 to reduce their tax burdens and were more tax-aggressive compared with publicly traded companies. ====Our paper also relates to studies examining the 1986 corporate tax reform in the U.S.. This reform reduced the federal corporate income tax rate by approximately 12%. ====, ====, and ==== reveal significant tax-induced earnings management by publicly traded companies. Our sample of unlisted firms provides us with a better opportunity to observe firms' reactions to tax changes. Compared to publicly traded firms, unlisted firms are less transparent and less subject to regulatory pressures. They are therefore more likely to participate in tax avoidance behaviors. ====, ====, and ==== suggest that compared to publicly traded firms, unlisted firms are more aggressive in tax reporting and are more likely to report conforming transactions that could reduce taxable incomes.====Last, this paper contributes to the literature on tax avoidance behavior in general. A strand of this literature investigates the magnitude of profit-shifting responses to tax rate differential across jurisdictions or over time (e.g. ====; ====; ====). Another strand studies the relationship between corporate governance and tax avoidance (====; ====, ====; ====; ====).====The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides a conceptual framework and the background of the 2008 China corporate tax reform. ==== describes the data and empirical strategy. ==== reports the empirical results, and ==== concludes.",Asymmetric corporate tax compliance: Evidence from a tax reform in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000524,25-Mar-23,2023,Research Article,33

In the case of centralized Chinese college admissions, students are matched based on their test scores in standardized tests, a noisy realization of their aptitudes due to measurement errors. We show that in this case any matching mechanism that is stable with respect to score is not stable with respect to aptitude. The resulting instability leads to colleges' incentive to participate in early admissions (zizhu zhaosheng), a form of market unraveling. However, a manipulable mechanism such as the Immediate Acceptance mechanism, combined with limited information about priorities, may succeed in mending this market failure. We then design and conduct a laboratory experiment where we compare the performance of two mechanisms (the Immediate Acceptance mechanism and the Deferred Acceptance mechanism), under two timing conditions of the submission of students' rank-ordered lists of colleges (before the exam and after the exam), using a two-stage matching market design with the possibility of early offers. In the experiment, a significant level of market unraveling occurred under mechanisms that are not stable with respect to aptitude, confirming theoretical predictions. We also find that the Immediate Acceptance mechanism under pre-exam submission condition significantly reduces such unraveling.","College admissions mechanisms affect the career choices and labor market outcomes of many young people in China and around the world (====; ====; ====). They belong to a broader class of matching problems that involve pairing members of one group of agents with one or more members of another disjointed group of agents. Other examples include matching medical school graduates to hospitals (====, ====), assigning students to public schools (; ====; ====), assigning students to on-campus housing and overseas trips (====; ====; ====), facilitating pairwise kidney exchanges (====). ==== are algorithms used to accomplish assignments in these cases.====For such matching problems, stable and strategy-proof matching mechanisms such as the Deferred Acceptance mechanism==== (====) are widely praised as a superior alternative to priority matching mechanisms, such as the Boston mechanism (also known as the Immediate Acceptance mechanism, or IA henceforth, in college admissions), which is manipulable and may thus lead to unstable outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====). This is because if a matching mechanism is stable, it produces matching outcomes in which no pair of agents would both prefer to be matched to each other than to their current partners. If a mechanism is strategy-proof, then participants do not have incentives to lie about their true preferences. A significant issue with unstable matchings is market ==== (====; ====). ==== shows that if a mechanism frequently yields unstable matchings, even if such market is centralized, it still causes market unraveling, and is no better than the decentralized market it tries to replace. Such unraveling is believed to be inefficient (====), and reduces market mobility (====). In addition to the cost of instability, ==== and ==== also suggest that strategic manipulation in the Boston mechanism leads to efficiency loss both in theory and in the laboratory.====Stability, however, does not ensure that market unraveling would not happen. One instance from two-sided matching comes from ====, which states that stability does not prevent manipulation through pre-arranged match. Even for centralized college admissions, which is a one-sided matching market, market unraveling still occurs under stable mechanisms. As an anecdotal example, the government of Shanghai in 2008 switched its college admissions mechanism from a variant of the Immediate Acceptance mechanism called the ¡°sequential mechanism¡± to a variant of the Deferred Acceptance mechanism, known in the matching literature as the ¡°Chinese Parallel Mechanism,¡± which is more stable and less manipulable (====).==== Yet, after the policy change, the top universities in Shanghai increased the number of their early admission offers from 893 to 1353,==== an almost 50% increase, which all happened months before the actual college entrance exam, circumventing the centralized matching process. While centralized Chinese college admissions are hailed as a very efficient process for matching students and colleges (====; ====, ====), the decentralized early admissions put significant additional burdens on college administrators and student families alike, as each participating colleges need to administer their own tests and employ hundreds of experts to interview students individually, and students need to prepare for different colleges' tests separately. Of course, there are many potential reasons for a large increase in the number of early admissions, and it is not the focus of this study to provide an empirical evaluation of the effect of such policy change. In this paper, we propose one explanation for the unraveling that arises from the ¡°side-effect¡± of stable matching mechanisms under the context of standardized test, and test such explanation experimentally, as it is difficult to collect data to test it empirically.====To explain why such unraveling happened, first we need to note that college admissions in China are organized as a centralized matching clearinghouse,==== where a central authority administers an annual standardized test (gaokao), and places students into colleges based on their test scores, with the aim of the test being to measure students' aptitudes. This standardized test-based college admissions problem differs from the school choice problem (Abdulkadiro?lu and S?nmez, 2003) in that although colleges, like public schools, follow priorities based on test scores, colleges themselves actually have strong preferences over students that may be different from priorities. It is understandable that colleges prefer better students with higher academic abilities (aptitudes) as better students are more likely to improve college reputations and may bring more future donations. It also differs from decentralized college admissions systems like those in the United States (====; ====), because colleges can not express their preferences (with respect to aptitudes) over students once the centralized matching process starts, since the matching is carried out by a computer program and colleges are bound to honor students' ranks in their test scores, which determine their admission priorities. Colleges' preferences and students' priorities are perfectly aligned only if standardized tests yield scores that do not distort the relative standings of students' aptitudes. In practice, however, this is unlikely, because even if a test is unbiased, that is, the ==== test scores always respect the relative standings of aptitudes, all tests have ====, defined as the lack of ¡°consistency with which the [test] results place students in the same relative position if the test is given repeatedly¡± (====). Therefore, if a test is taken only once, such as in centralized college admissions, the ranking of test scores may not reflect the ranking of aptitudes.====To see why measurement errors in tests can cause unstable matchings, which further lead to unraveling, let us look at an example. Suppose Students A and B are two top students in a college admission market with many students, and Colleges 1 and 2 are the two top colleges, and each has one available seat. Student A is better than B, and College 1 is better than 2. All students prefer better colleges, and colleges better students. Although Student A is better than Student B, she still has 30% of chance to score lower in the test than B, caused by measurement errors in the test. Under the Deferred Acceptance mechanism, since revealing one's true preference is the dominant strategy, both students list College 1 as their first choices, and College 2?s choices. Since priorities are given based on the test scores, therefore, there is a 30% chance that Student A goes to College 2 and Student B goes to College 1.==== In this case, both Student A and College 1 prefer each other to what they are currently matched with. So College 1 has an incentive to circumvent the centralized matching, and admits Student A early; and Student A certainly has the incentive to accept such offer.====The above example may naturally lead to the following question: what could possibly be the mechanism that led to the significant increase of early admissions in Chinese gaokao? The answer may lie in one policy detail: instead of submitting their rank-ordered lists of colleges after knowing their test scores and rankings, students report their preferences before taking the exam, therefore the only thing they know is the relative standings of their academic abilities. Let us go back to the example above. Now when Student B submits his list of colleges without knowing his realized test score, he knows that he has a 70% chance to score lower than A. Since under the Immediate Acceptance mechanism, emphasis is put on the first choice, and the cost of not getting into one's first choice is very high, Student B may not want to take the risk and rank College 1 first, and therefore he will rank College 2 as his first choice. In this case, Student A can go to College 1, and Student B to College 2, with certainty. The matching is therefore stable for the top two students and colleges. So in short, the manipulability of this mechanism, combined with limited information of the priorities (test scores) of the matching, actually helps better students go to better colleges, regardless of their test performances. This in turn reduces market unraveling.====) and experimentally (====). In terms of strategy, contrary to the Deferred Acceptance mechanism, the Immediate Acceptance mechanism is immune to manipulation by schools through misreporting enrollment capacity (====). In addition to the Boston (IA) mechanism, other manipulable mechanisms can also take the advantage of their manipulability and perform better than truthful mechanisms. For example, manipulable mechanisms that encourage reporting indifferences can outperform strategy-proof Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism in terms of efficiency (====). This paper also contributes theoretically to a strand of literature that looks at the side effects of strategy-proof and stable matchings (====; ====; ====; ====).====In addition to the properties of mechanisms, the context of this study - centralized college and high school admissions in China - has also been explored in the literature, both experimentally (====), and empirically (====; ====; ====; ====). This study is also closely related to a strand of studies for Chinese college admissions that focus on the timing of rank-ordered list submissions. In their empirical study, ==== look at students' academic performances after they were admitted to a college with different mechanisms across years and provinces to test the effect of submission timings. ==== use laboratory experiments to show that the Boston mechanism combined with pre-exam submission has advantages in ex-ante fairness (i.e. stability w.r.t. aptitude) compared to the Serial Dictatorship mechanism, while ==== provide a theoretical foundation for the experimental results, and show mixed results with the combination of Boston mechanism and pre-exam submission. ==== further expands by looking the effect of timing when information about students' academic aptitudes are uncertain and some students are overconfident. The main contribution of this paper compared to the existing literature is to study the consequences of instability (i.e. marketing unraveling) through a two-sided experimental design of the matching markets.====In this paper, motivated by the real world observation of unraveling of a college admissions matching market, we answer two questions: why the Deferred Acceptance mechanism can produce unstable matchings and cause market unraveling; and how the Immediate Acceptance mechanism can outperform the Deferred Acceptance mechanism in mending such market failure. To answer the question of ====, we formally model the game of college admissions with standardized tests, and show that without the possibility of early admissions (a form of market unraveling), a stable matching mechanism that respects test scores produces unstable matching outcomes in terms of student aptitude. This directly predicts market unraveling, as most cases of market unraveling are caused by perceived instability in matching outcomes. We then design and conduct a laboratory experiment to answer the question of ====. We combine the two mechanisms (the Immediate Acceptance mechanism and the Deferred Acceptance mechanism) with two timing conditions of the submission of students' rank-ordered lists of colleges. The environment is designed as a hybrid two-sided market, where there is a centralized, one-sided matching stage, and preceding it is a decentralized, two-sided stage where colleges can send early admission offers to students. The experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions, and show that the Immediate Acceptance mechanism combined with pre-exam submission performs best in terms of reducing market unraveling, yet it achieves that with little sacrifice on the stability of eventual matching outcomes.====The remainder of this paper is organized in the following way: ==== formally models the game of college admissions with standardized test as well as introducing the two mechanisms. ==== presents theoretical results. ==== describes the design of the experiment. ==== presents experimental results. ==== concludes.",When do stable matching mechanisms fail?

To do so, we take advantage of village-level variation in the Household Responsibility System (HRS) reform in China that transformed land property rights from a communal system into an individualized tenure system. We find that early-life exposure to land reform increases the probability of becoming an entrepreneur in adulthood. This positive association is mainly driven by exposure to the HRS increasing the propensity for solo and necessity entrepreneurship. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the long-run impact of early-life HRS reform exposure across subsamples. Females, individuals from low-income families, individuals with less-educated parents and individuals in the central region are more likely to become entreprenuers following early-life exposure to land reform. Overall, while previous research has found that land titling reform in China significantly increased business creation in rural areas, our findings imply that the positive impact of land reform on entrepreneurial ventures is likely to be understated if its long-run impact on those exposed to land reform early in life on the likelihood of their becoming entrepreneurs later in life is not considered.","; ====; ====), collateral constraints (====), institutional arrangements (====), gender (====), education (====), age (====) and risk aversion (====) in affecting entreprenuership. Much of the literature has focused on the role of favorable conditions in increasing the likelihood of entrepreneurship. Studies have shown that propensity for entrepreneurship is associated with better access to financial capital (====), higher levels of family wealth (====) and higher levels of training and formal education (====). However, more recently, the theory of underdog entrepreneurship proposed by ==== posits that adversity and challenges experienced in both childhood and adulthood could nurture favorable survival capabilities, including greater resilience, resourcefulness, self-determination and other personal qualities, that are essential ingredients for starting new business ventures.====A subset of this broader literature has examined the relationship between land property rights and entrepreneurial entry (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Previous research has shown that security of property rights helps to promote innovative behaviour and risk-taking that are beneficial for entrepreneurship (====; ====; ====). ==== find that large-scale land titling reform in China, that provides more stable and secure farmland property rights, significantly increased the number of rural enterprises. These authors find that better access to financial capital, increased land and labor availability and productivity, and improved social trust are potential mechanisms underlying the association between land property rights and rural enterprise growth.====All of these studies are concerned with the contemporary effect of property rights reform on entrepreneurship in adulthood. We lack evidence, though, on how exposure to property rights reform in childhood or adolescence might affect propensity for entreprenuership later in life. This is an important gap in understanding given that mounting evidence suggests that early-life experiences more generally could mould one's cognitive and non-cognitive abilities that influence their subsequent suitability for employment and propensity for entrepreneurship (====; ====; ====). We seek to address this gap in the literature. To do so, we use data from the China Labor-Dynamics Survey (CLDS) to examine whether, and to what extent, exposure to Household Responsibility System (HRS) reform, which assigned collective-owned farmland to a household with secure tenure, in childhood and adolescence, shapes one's propensity for entrepreneurship later in life. Specifically, we identify the long-term impact of land reform by exploiting exogenous temporal and geographical variations in the village-level rollout of the HRS reform between 1978 and 1985 in China.====We focus on the long-run effect of HRS reform experience in childhood and adolescence because these two stages are the most critical for an individual to recognise and understand the world, develop cognitive abilities and form their values, norms and personality traits (====; ====; ====; ====). A large body of literature shows that a broad range of early-life shocks during childhood and adolescence, including the HRS reform exposure early in life, can interact with generic endowments and production technologies to generate long-lasting impacts into adulthood (====; ====). Thus, we expect that the HRS reform experience during childhood and adolescence is likely to have a stronger impact on an individual's involvement in entrepreneurial activity later in life.====We find that exposure to land reform in childhood and adolescence significantly increases the probability of becoming an entrepreneur later in life. This finding implies that the positive impact of land reform on entrepreneurial ventures is likely to be understated without considering its long-run impact on later-life entrepreneurship. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the long-run impact of early-life exposure to the HRS reform across subsamples. Females, individuals from low-income families, individuals with less-educated parents and individuals in the central region are likely to benefit more from early-life exposure to the land reform. While exposure to land reform might reduce income inequality within rural areas and between genders, its positive impact might be mitigated by the fact that disadvantaged individuals are more likely to end up in low-income entrepreneurship in the informal sector.====We contribute to the literature in four ways. First, we add to relatively small literature on the impact of early-life experience on whether one becomes an entrepreneur later in life. Drawing on the underdog framework of entrepreneurship (====), existing studies that do examine early life experience on entreprenuership later in life, have focused solely on the effect of negative events, such as famines (====), wars (====) and political upheavals (====) on building resilience and underdog traits. The HRS potentially has a more nuanced effect on entrepreneurship later in life, where it could also help reinforce advantages in childhood.====Second, we provide new evidence of the causal effect of early-life experience on entrepreneurship. More generally, we contribute to the recent entrepreneurship literature that employs lab or natural experiments to make causal inference about why individuals become entrepreneurs (====; ====; ====; ====). However, necessity and solo entrepreneurship is prevalent in transition economies like China (====; ====). It has been well-documented that there are important differences between opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship and between solo and employer entrepreneurs in terms of motivation for starting a business, human capital endowment, survival rates, venture success and influence on socioeconomic development (====). This makes it important to explore the heterogeneous long-run effects of early-life HRS reform experience on different forms of entrepreneurship. This point is particularly relevant in light of the fact that nearly two-thirds of necessity-oriented entrepreneurs turn into more opportunity-oriented over time (====). We find evidence of heterogeneity across entrepreneurship types. Specifically, we find that longer exposure to the HRS reform in early life significantly increases the propensity for solo and necessity entrepreneurship, while its impact on the probability of becoming an employer or opportunity entrepreneur is not significant.====Finally, we extend the literature that has specifically considered the long-run consequences of land reform and titling programs on outcomes later in life (====; ====; ====). Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to land reform early in life leads to a significant improvement in health status and wages in adulthood, while it has a detrimental effect on educational attainment because land reform raises the opportunity cost of schooling due to the increased returns to child labor (====; ====). Although ==== has investigated the association between childhood exposure to the HRS reform and occupational prestige, there is a lack of evidence on how early-life land reform experience affects the propensity for entrepreneurship. We extend this strand of literature to examine the long-term effect of the HRS reform experience in childhood and adolescence on one's probability of entry into entrepreneurship in adulthood. Methodologically, existing studies have relied on the county or provincial level HRS rollout to identify the effect of HRS reform (====; ====; ====). However, the basic unit of the HRS reform was the production team, rather than a county or province.==== It took one or two years for most of the production teams in a county to adopt the HRS, and even longer for those in a province (====). Therefore, methodologically, we provide a more precise estimate of the effect of HRS reform by exploiting the village-level variation in the timing of the HRS reform.",Early-life experience of land reform and entrepreneurship,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000512,21-Mar-23,2023,Research Article,35

In terms of heterogeneity analysis, for entrepreneurs of rural migrant backgrounds (those with agricultural ==== and urban permanent residence), the impact of online social interaction is more significant than it is for others.

First, we propose and verify the potential complementary relationship between online and offline social interactions to foster household entrepreneurship.

Using data concerning the ,"How to price an academic work? This question relates to rewarding structure and incentive schemes for higher education institutions. It is generally agreed that economic incentives could motivate researchers' academic productivity and improve their efficiencies. Considerable research has analyzed different types of incentive schemes to promote efficient creation of academic research and concludes that competition conditions (====), tenure system (====), level of proration of authorship credit (====), resources allocation in research positions and lab expansion (====), and tolerance for early failure and reward for long-term success (====; ====; ====) will influence academic efficiency or creativity.====In present China, with a substantially increasing amount of funds flown to education and scientific research, the obstacle that impedes the development of higher education is the rewarding structure, that is, how to allocate funding to reward academic achievement to incentivize high-end research outputs. Over the past few decades, according to ====, China has dramatically increased its research and development spending, from 0.7% of GDP in 1991 to 2.05% of GDP in 2014. With such a significant amount of innovation effort, China has seen remarkable development in scientific research. China's total number of science and engineering articles increased by 20 times from 1990 to 2011, and over the same period, the China versus United States (U.S.) ratio of average citation counts rose from 26% to 55% (====). However, the quality of research lags, and the innovation gap between China and some advanced countries is still distant. A lack of a better incentive system could contribute to such a gap. ==== points out that building a high-quality faculty is the key to promoting research productivity in Chinese universities. Over the past decade, China's leading universities have been taking steps to enhance research productivity, but more fundamental reforms are needed. For example, as more Chinese research universities recruit high-profile overseas scholars at high salaries, local faculty feel overlooked.====To better establish an efficient incentive system, institutions must determine the monetary value of academic work, such as a published article or a book. Research outputs produced by universities provide a strong impetus for economic and social development. ====). Nevertheless, while National Research Foundation announced cutting the funding to the program, many criticized this decision, believing that the funding cut discouraged researchers from applying for the rating (====).====In this paper, we aim to estimate the monetary value of research outputs using data from a medium-ranked public university in China during 2011¨C2019. Such analysis will help us understand the current efforts to incentive research productivity in Chinese universities similar to the one studied in our case.====However, pricing research outputs is such an obscure thing. Just like we do not normally value a person's life, research outputs are not usually priced as they are not for sale in the market. Regardless of priceless life, ==== proposes the theory of ¡°Value of a Statistical Life (VSL)¡± in his article ¡°The Life You Save May Be Your Own.¡± VSL implies how much individuals are willing to pay to reduce the risk of death. As the example in ====, if the average individual is willing to pay $10,000 to avoid a 0.1% chance of death, the VSL will be $10 million per statistical life saved. In that vein, we are inspired to follow the theory of VSL to estimate a monetary value for academic work in this paper.====There are just a few studies in the literature that have explored economic values for research outputs. ==== estimate lifetime returns to selected article categories by academic rank for full-time male faculty in university economics departments during the academic year 1972¨C73. Based on a 5% discount rate, they find that returns to the first publication are $12,340, $10,256, and $6958 for an assistant professor, an associate professor, and a full professor, respectively. They also discover that marginal returns decrease rapidly as more publications are added, with such a decrease in returns for book publication being higher than for article publication. For faculty members without published articles, the monetary value for 1.37 books is equal to that for the first-time publishing article. Using the data on economists in the University of California system in 2010, ==== find that economists without having any articles in any of the Top 5 economics journals face a salary decrease of about 5%¨C7%. ==== document evidence that between 1996 and 2010, one more publication in top five economics journals could increase the probability of receiving tenure by as high as 19% in the top 35 economics departments in universities in the United States. Recently, ==== include the marginal impact of an academic publication on total citations to a scholar in their model and find that this variable is associated with a 2.8% to 8.9% increase in the salaries of college faculty.====, we first utilize an R.D. design to estimate the change in promotion probability, relying upon the fact that promotion is awarded based on observable research scores.==== Next, in line with VSL estimation, we calculate the economic value for the promotions to associate and full professors by dividing the salary differential for each type of promotion by the corresponding probability change. The threshold research score in the R.D. design is the exerted effort for the applicant to get the promotion, so the division of the economic value for the promotion by the threshold research score is the economic value per unit of research score. Then, this can be used to compute the monetary value for each type of research output while each type has been assigned a fixed amount of research points.====As ==== emphasize, the key to rewarding research is whether the university observes meaningful measures of research output. Generally, Chinese universities have a set of rules to compute research score for each promotion applicant. Thus, the research score is a good measure of research output and serves as the running variable in the R.D. model. The role that research score plays in the analysis is not only to serve to estimate the R.D. model but also to help compute the monetary value for each type of academic research. To our knowledge, apart from Chinese universities, some universities from other countries==== use a similar score as an evaluation indicator in the decision to promote.====Based on a sample from a Chinese university, hereafter called University A, our findings suggest that each unit of research score is worth $467==== to an associate professor and $515 to a full professor. Based on the rate for full professors, we compute the economic values for a publication in ordinary journals, famous journals, and top journals,==== which are around $1538, $5154, and $20,615, respectively. The economic value for a book publication is approximately $7723, and a project supported by the national government, the ministry of education, and the provincial government are worth $20,615, $7723, and $2569, respectively. These research outputs are significantly undervalued compared to the faculty's own total income, the income of peers in similar sectors, or the income of peers from other countries' higher education.====The paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, this analysis provides a novel approach to exploring the monetary evaluation of research work. Our identification strategy allows us to indirectly estimate economic value for different types of research outputs through promotion probability. In line with ==== finding that the number of academic publications is an important consideration for academic promotion across all types of university settings, research score plays a vital role in determining the promotion probability in our setting. Our proposed method is believed to be applicable to the universities that explicitly adopt a similar scoring system or implicitly set research standards in the faculty promotion process.====Second, the results of our paper imply that faculty promotion and merit system can serve as an essential pathway to increase economic value for research output and thus impel faculty to work more productively on academic work. According to the tournament model by ====, a more considerable salary increase due to promotion incentivizes faculty to make more significant efforts to gain a promotion. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to increase salaries for all ranks to recruit more outstanding young academics. We also suggest that the promotion and merit system emphasizes research quality rather than quantity. As ==== indicate, the competition among business schools with a large research productivity gap could drive them to do too much research, likely leading to the neglect of teaching quality and inefficient social outcomes. In light of this possibility, our proposal to more value research quality but not quantity will reduce these adverse effects. Further, it could increase the value of research work, which also corresponds to the policy guidelines introduced by the Chinese government in recent years.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides relevant information on the procedure for applying for promotion. The methodology and estimated results are presented in ====. In ====, we show the results for validity tests of the R.D. design.

Further, key laboratories foster innovation mainly by developing scientific research capacity, increasing human capital, and improving R&D subsidies. Our findings demonstrate that key laboratories can benefit firms, their stakeholders, and the public in an emerging market such as China.","Science and technology have long been recognized as crucial drivers of firms' growth and their ability to compete in the technology sector (====). Due to the importance and popularity of the topic of innovation in the scientific community, numerous theoretical and empirical studies have been conducted on the subject (====; ====, ====). These studies have conducted heterogeneous examinations; some examined the influence of micro-level variables on innovation, such as managerial R&D experience (====), CEOs' general managerial skills (====), top management team ability (====), managerial overconfidence (====), and corporate culture (====). Other studies have examined the drivers of innovation at the market level, such as competition in the product market (====), intellectual property (IP) protection (====), analyst coverage (====), institutional investors (====), and credit supply (====). Some have examined countries' institutional features that can spur innovation, including laws and regulations (====), local culture (====), financial development at the national level (====), national policy uncertainty (====), and religion (====). However, few scholars have systematically explored whether and how corporate key laboratories, defined as private-sector- and government-funded research facilities with the goal of developing new fundamental knowledge (====), spur innovation output.====Although basic scientific research has been the cornerstone of technological advancement in contemporary society (====), it often comes with high costs and low returns. Additionally, asset specificity remains a prominent concern in private-sector investment decision-making (====). Key laboratories' main outputs are characterized as public goods, which means that competitors can obtain the newly developed knowledge free of charge. Consequently, firms cannot obtain all the benefits of their scientific research. Furthermore, a firm conducting scientific research contradicts corporations' general goal, that is, to maximize profits. There is also the problem of agency. Private firms encourage their researchers to engage in basic scientific research, reduce their technological innovation and commercialization efforts, and participate more in academic activities outside the firm (====).====To encourage firms to participate in basic scientific research activities, become the main driving force of innovation, increase investment in R&D, and establish laboratories, the Chinese government issued the ¡°National Medium- and Long-Term Science and Technology Development Plan Outline¡± in 2005. The Plan put forward specific requirements for companies to construct scientific research laboratories. Corporate key laboratories at the state and provincial levels are crucial for China's innovation system. These laboratories are essential for basic scientific research on industrial applications, the gathering of talents, and the conduction of scientific and technological exchanges. Furthermore, their main task is to carry out innovative technology research for the national ====Our findings can be summarized as follows. By analyzing manually collected datasets of Chinese listed firms with corporate key laboratories at the state or provincial levels from 2013 to 2018, we found that firms with key laboratories generate more ==== and forward citations. Moreover, corporate key laboratories tend to adopt explanatory and original innovation strategies. These key laboratories' effects are more significant among high-tech firms, those with an inventor or scientist CEO, and those located in cities with better IP protection environments. Additionally, these laboratories facilitate innovation mainly through three channels: promoting scientific research, increasing human capital, and R&D subsidies.====This study fills the following three gaps in the literature. First, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine whether, how, and to what extent corporate key laboratories affect innovation performance (measured as firms' number of patents and citations). Our empirical analysis is based on data from Chinese publicly traded companies. China has been criticized in the international community for its technological shortcomings, specifically in basic scientific research. Further, national funding for fundamental research is primarily directed toward the public sector, including government-owned laboratories and universities. These public companies, in turn, produce a number of academic articles with which private firms can hardly compete. Consequently, the existing basic scientific research conducted in China stems mainly from governmental, university, and publicly-funded research institutions. Despite this concentration in specific institutions, few studies have examined corporate key laboratories' effects on innovation output at the state and provincial levels, and even fewer have explored the nexus between corporate key laboratories and innovation performance.==== (PSM) procedure.====Third, we have constructed proxy variables using manually collected data that have been overlooked in previous studies. These variables include lists of state and provincial key laboratories at the company level over the years; data on the company's scientific paper publications over time, and indicators of the company's innovation strategy. Currently, there is no literature that explores the economic effects of state and provincial key laboratories at the company level in China. Compared with existing studies on Chinese firms' innovation, the database we apply covers both forward-citation and backward-citation information of granted patents of Chinese listed firms, which helps us to better construct corporate innovation quality and innovation strategy metrics. Additionally, the publication of scientific papers by Chinese companies, which is an important reflection of their scientific research achievements has not received adequate attention. This study not only investigates the impact of key laboratories on the quantity and quality of patents but also delves further into their influence on corporate innovation strategies, which is a significant advancement in existing research.====This study is structured as follows: Section 2 examines the related literature and formulates the hypotheses.

We further estimate the potential mitigating effects of air conditioning on the relationship between temperature and mental health. We find that the identified relationship is mitigated by installing air conditioning. We also test some mechanisms through which temperature might impact mental health, including physical health status and sleep. We further discuss the overall health expenditure burden associated with climate change.","Mental health is an important component of human health. Mental health is a state of well-being in which a person can cope with stress, work productively, and contribute to the community (====). Mental illness causes significant economic and health losses. The ==== estimated that at least 300 million people suffer from mental disorders around the world. In 2010, mental illness costs reached USD 2.5 trillion, which was nearly 50% of the global health spending (====). People with severe mental illness could die 10¨C20?years earlier than the normal population (====).====This paper estimates the causal effects of temperature on mental health in the largest developing country, China. Mental health has become a major public health and social problem in China. The current prevalence of mental disorders among adults in China is 17.5%. However, the rate of diagnosis and treatment is relatively low, with an average treatment rate of 0.15% (====). The estimated health care expenditure for mental disorders in 2013 was $88.8 billion, which accounted for over 15% of the total health care expenditure in China. Given that millions of Chinese people suffer from untreated mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders, the potential economic costs could be much higher than the actual estimated mental health treatment costs (====).====Our primary analyses are based on self-reported mental health status data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), which is one of the most comprehensive surveys in China. Since 2010, the CFPS has interviewed approximately 16,000 households across 162 counties in China. The CFPS asked eight questions regarding mental health performance, including depression, effortlessness, poor sleep quality, unhappiness, loneliness, not enjoying life, sadness and the inability to get started on a task. All the eight questions form the total mental health score (CESD 8 scale), which is extensively used as a clinical screening tool for determining the presence of major depression.====This paper measured the linear and nonlinear effects of temperature on mental health. First, we tested the linear relationship between temperature and mental health. We used daily average temperature to explore the impacts of temperature on self-reported mental illness. Second, we utilized a semiparametric approach, which counts the number of days during the past week that falls into 3?¡ãC wide temperature bins (====; ====). We find that high temperature increases the CESD 8 scores and the probability of severe mental health problems using linear and nonlinear methods. Our results are both statistically significant and economically significant. Specifically, an additional day above 27?¡ãC during the past week would lead to individuals reporting 0.0783 higher scores of the total CESD 8 scores (1.5% to the mean) and 0.62%age points higher of reporting severe mental illness (6.2 percent to the mean), relative to a day in the reference temperature bin (18¨C21?¡ãC). Our results reveal adverse effects of high temperature on mental health, consistent with the existing studies such as ====.====We further estimate the factors that might mitigate the relationship between heat and mental health. We specifically use individual-level air conditioning as a means of adaptation. Our models include a temperature and time trend interaction term to allow air conditioning ownership to vary over time. Our results show that installing air conditioning could mediate the adverse effects of excess heat on mental health.====In addition, we explore the heterogeneous effects of excess heat on mental health by splitting our samples into different subgroups by gender, age, education, and living in urban/rural areas. Our results do not find dramatic heterogeneous impacts of temperature on mental health outcomes among different demographic groups. Finally, we further investigate the indirect channels that might affect the relationship between temperature and mental health status. We found that high temperature significantly affected mental health outcomes through general physical health status, sleep quality, and sleep hours. Our results remain the same for many robustness checks.====This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it adds to the limited literature on climate change and mental health by providing a study on a developing country, China. The existing limited studies that estimate extreme weather effects on mental health mainly focus on developed countries (====; ====; ====), while studies on developing countries are lacking. This question is crucial for developing countries. First, the developing world will experience disproportionately higher temperatures, and most residents work in climate-exposed environments (====). In addition, people in developing countries have difficulty smoothing their consumption across aggregate weather shocks (====; ====; ====).====Second, unlike ==== and ====, who use a randomly sampled, pooled cross-section of respondents, we use nationally representative panel data, which controls individual fixed effects. Identifying the causal effect of high temperature on mental health would not be accurate due to the failure to include unobservable attributes that could affect mental health outcomes, such as individuals' personalities and temperaments. Individual fixed effects can eliminate self-selection bias and significantly improve identification.====Third, we use individual-level air conditioning data to estimate the modifying effects of temperature on mental health. Earlier attempts to estimate adaptation assume that the relationship between temperature and health is the same for people with and without air conditioning and that the relationship is also constant over time in the absence of increasing air conditioning penetration (====; ====). We are the first study to relax the above assumptions by using individual-level air condition data from CFPS to provide evidence regarding adaptation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the direct and indirect channels through which high temperature might affect mental health. ==== analyses the empirical models, and ==== discusses our data. ==== shows our main results, and ==== discusses the policy and welfare implications and concludes the paper.",Effects of temperature on mental health: Evidence and mechanisms from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2300038X,12-Mar-23,2023,Research Article,39

Data shows that water pollution emissions are unevenly distributed across regions in China. Using China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the exogenous shock, we identify a negative causal effect of export liberalization on the agglomeration of water pollution across regions in China. It suggests that relatively more water pollution is discharged in those previously low-pollution regions after export liberalization. We confirm this with data on regional relative pollution emissions. Further decomposition shows that it is the intensive margin (average pollution emission) rather than the extensive margin (number of polluting firms) that drives the deglomeration of water pollution emissions within the liberalized industry.","Many developing countries face the tradeoff between economic development and environment protection. In China, this tradeoff is more complicated given its geographical size and regional disparity. It is well-documented that economic development is uneven across regions. This is also true for pollution emissions given different industry structures and development levels. Additionally, environmental regulations are heterogeneously enforced across different regions in China.==== Understanding the distribution of pollution emission is crucial for China's battle on pollution, as well as for the welfare across different regions.====Trade liberalization has been shown to promote economic development unevenly across regions. Its overall impact on pollution emission also has been studied quite well in the literature.==== However, how it changes the geographical distribution of pollution emission in China is unclear. On the intensive margin, export-side trade liberalization may scale up the level of output as well as pollution emission disproportionately, leading to geographically more concentrated pollution distribution. It may also induce large productive firms to adopt cleaner technology. This so-called ¡°technique effect¡± may decrease pollution emission of larger firms, attenuating the geographical concentration of pollution emissions. On the extensive margin, there may be disproportionately more new entries or less exits in those ==== low-pollution (high-pollution) regions, attenuating (strengthening) the agglomeration of pollution emissions. We investigate the relationship between trade liberalization and the geographical distribution of pollution empirically using firm-level data from China, the largest developing country and exporter in the world.====China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) at the end of 2001 and its total exports grew rapidly by 397.1% from 1999 to 2006. Plenty of studies have found a strong correlation between trade liberalization and pollution emission, for example, ==== show that the prefecture-level export expansion has led to more local air pollution emission in China. However, these studies only show that export liberalization increases local pollution emissions. Its impact on the geographical distribution of pollution emissions is still unknown. Given the significant distributional impact of trade liberalization on regional economic development in China, it is also worth investigating whether there is such distributional impact of trade liberalization on pollution emissions across regions. Additionally, knowing the distribution of pollution may also help to design optimal policies for pollution control. For instance, as discussed by ====, if more productive firms (or regions) invest more intensively in abatement, then it is efficient to maintain certain level of pollution concentration (or agglomeration). Given the significant heterogeneity in the enforcement of environmental regulations across regions in China, the geographical distribution of pollution emissions is of utter importance for the success of China's national battle against pollution.====This paper fills the gap by investigating the geographic concentration of water pollution around China's WTO accession using data on water pollution emissions.==== Water pollution has been strictly regulated since the 1980s in China. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (formerly known as the Ministry of Environmental Protection) has tracked a record of firm-level pollution emissions, known as the ==== (AESPF).==== Together with other firm-level information collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China in the ==== (ASIF), we are able to investigate the relationship between export liberalization and the geographic concentration of water pollution. We measure the geographic concentration of water pollution in each industry following ==== where they provide an indicator for production or employment agglomeration by controlling for differences in the size distribution of plants and differences in the size of the geographic areas. Analogously, we construct our indices that control for differences in the size distribution of firms and differences in the size of geographic areas.====In order to identify the causal effect, we rely on the exogenous shock of export liberalization upon China's WTO accession. Though the applied tariff rates for Chinese exporters were already the most-favored-nation (MFN) rates and they did not decrease much after China's WTO accession, there was a significant change in terms of policy uncertainty regarding these export tariffs which mainly concerns to the export to the United States (US). This is because the normal trade relations (NTR) with China was subject to annual renewal by the US government before 2001. Chinese exporters would face a much higher tariff schedule, i.e. the non-MFN tariff rates, if NTR was not renewed. Given the significant difference between the two tariff schedules, this uncertainty significantly discouraged Chinese exporters. It was until the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) between China and the US took effect upon China's accession to the WTO that this policy uncertainty was eliminated. A growing stream of studies have shown that this elimination of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) significantly boosted Chinese exports, e.g. ====, ====, ====, and ====, not only to the US market, but also to the rest of the world.==== Following this literature, we use the difference between the MFN tariffs and non-MFN tariffs to measure the pre-WTO TPU for each industry.==== These pre-WTO TPU levels vary across industries and were all eliminated upon China's WTO accession. Hence the heterogeneous TPU reductions across industries upon WTO accession provide an ideal setting for us to apply a generalized difference-in-differences (DID) framework to identify the causal effect of industry-level export liberalization on the geographical concentration of pollution.====Our DID estimation results reveal that water pollution in those industries with higher pre-WTO TPU levels, i.e. stronger export liberalization after the WTO accession, became less geographically agglomerated relative to other industries after China's WTO accession. It suggests that export liberalization in terms of TPU reduction significantly reduced the water pollution agglomeration in the liberalized industry. Based on our estimates the water pollution agglomeration index dropped by about 0.48, or 18.4% of the standard deviation for water pollution agglomeration indices, for industries with an average level pre-WTO TPU relative to industries with zero pre-WTO TPU upon China's WTO accession. This causal effect is robust to a number of industry-level control variables as well as a battery of robustness checks, including checks on the identifying assumptions of our DID estimation strategy, alternative measures for TPU and alternative regional levels in the construction of water pollution agglomeration indices. We also show that the deglomeration effect of export liberalization on the spatial distribution of water pollution is stronger for industries with lower capital intensities, lower average wage levels and higher pollution intensities. Additionally, the effect is also stronger for industries with more foreign firms or with larger state-owned-enterprise (SOE) shares.====To gain more insights into how the pollution distribution changes upon export liberalization, we utilize firm-level pollution emissions across regions. First, for each industry we divide all prefectures into two regions according to prefecture-level ==== pollution emissions before the WTO accession, a low-pollution region and another high-pollution region. Then we construct the aggregate water pollution emission in the high-pollution region relative to that in the low-pollution region for every year and each industry. Using the same DID estimation strategy we show that the relative water pollution emission in the high-pollution region decreases after export liberalization, suggesting relatively more water pollution emission in the ==== low-pollution regions. This is consistent with the deglomeration effect of export liberalization on pollution emissions within the liberalized industry. We further decompose the relative water pollution into the intensive margin and extensive margin. The intensive margin is the relative of average pollution emissions between two regions and the extensive margin is the relative number of polluting firms between two regions. It is then found that the intensive margin is playing a significant role whereas the extensive margin is not statistically significant. In other words, firms in the high-pollution region emit less pollution on average relative to firms in the low-pollution region after export liberalization.==== Our findings hence highlight the environmental distributional impact of trade liberalization.====Our paper relates to several strands of researches. First, it belongs to the branch of literature discussing the effect of trade on local environment and pollution.==== Early studies on pollution at the country, regional, or industry level include ====, ====, ====, ====, ==== and ====, etc. Recent studies on firm-level pollution include ====, ====, ====, ==== among others. With Chinese data, ==== show that the prefecture-level export expansion in China leads to more local pollution and higher mortality.==== ==== show that exporting reduces air pollution of Chinese manufacturing firms. In addition, ==== show that export liberalization actually brings down firm-level water pollution intensity. Instead of pollution level or intensity, this paper focuses on the impact of export liberalization on the geographical concentration of water pollution in China. Our study contributes to the studies on the distributional effect of trade liberalization.====Second, this paper also adds to studies on agglomeration and trade, which emphasizes the importance of trade linkages as causes of observed spatial concentration of economic activities. ==== provide for an excellent summary of relevant empirical studies. The spatial concentration of pollution is as important as the concentration of other economic activities studied in this literature due to the negative externality of pollution and the potential increasing return to scale in pollution abatement. The geographical distribution of pollution emission is generally overlooked in existing researches. However, it is of particular importance for the central government's allocation of pollution abatement targets across regional governments. It may also endogenously interact with local enforcement of environmental regulations. Our paper provides important reference by studying the influence of export liberalization on the geographic distribution of pollution emissions.====Third, our empirical identification strategy directly follows the recent literature on trade policy uncertainty. We use the TPU shock to identify the causal impact of export liberalization on firm-level water pollution. ====, ==== have done some pioneering work on the effects of policy uncertainty on trade, investment, and welfare. ==== argue that the decline in US manufacturing employment is related to the reduction in TPU after China's WTO accession. ==== show that the reduction in TPU leads to China's export expansion. On the domestic side, ==== find a positive effect of TPU on indigenous innovation, while ==== figure out a negative effect of TPU on export participation. Our paper adds to this part of literature by identifying the causal effects of the TPU shock on water pollution agglomeration.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces data sources and variable construction as well as the estimation specifications. ==== presents our main empirical findings, various robustness checks, heterogeneous effects along with discussions on the mechanisms.

For developing economies, the trade-off between economic growth and environmental improvement has been an important question in need of further investigation.====; ====). On the export side, China tends to undertake more production tasks with low value added and high carbon intensity in global production fragmentation. It has had to undertake massive carbon transfers in exports to meet downstream final demand. On the import side, developed economies have a comparative advantage in tech- and knowledge-intensive sectors, and they have advanced green technology. There is high dependence on foreign imports from developed economies to meet the domestic demand of production or consumption in China. Therefore, China tends to gain lower value added when undertaking one unit of carbon transfer in exports, and it pays higher value added when transferring one unit of carbon transfer in imports. This situation emphasizes the necessity of accelerating supply-side structural reform to improve the supply capacity and composition of exports.==== to decompose production activities into traditional trade and GVC activities. When domestic primary inputs are used to produce a final product and are then exported, we define this value chain as a pure domestic value chain, along which only domestic value added is involved. Additionally, such activities are defined as traditional trade activities. By contrast, when domestic primary inputs are used to produce intermediate products that are exported for final production or re-exports, we define these kinds of activities as GVC activities. On the other hand, we further study the heterogeneity of value added and embodied carbon emission flows at more detailed bilateral and sectoral levels. There will be interesting potential findings, considering the fact that the net exporting destinations of China have mainly been developed economies such as the USA and Europe (====; ====; ====; ====), while carbon leakages have shifted from China to other developing countries (====), such as Belt and Road Initiative countries (====).====We extend the current studies in three ways. First, we analyze the imbalance of the dual effects between imports and exports in China. We distinguish different value chain activities, trade partners and sectors to elaborate the imbalances. Second, with current studies frequently applying pollution or energy intensity (====; ====; ====; ====), we provide another perspective to interpret China's comprehensive economic and environmental benefits. We establish indices¡ªvalue added per embodied emission import (VPM) and value added per embodied emission export (VPX)¡ªto weight the unit carbon emission transfer in the magnitude of value added. The two indices describe the payoff of a country and its sectors when transferring unit carbon emissions through imports and the ability to gain value added when undertaking unit carbon emission transfers through exports. Third, we apply multiplicative SDA and the logarithmic mean Divisia index I (LMDI-I) approach to decompose the effects of driving factors on the increases in VPM and VPX at different levels to explore ways of narrowing the large gap between them. To provide more tailored policy implications, we reveal the bilateral-sectoral contributions of the driving factor effects on the change in VPM on backward linkages and the driving factor effects on the change in VPX on forward linkages. Therefore, we can analyze which type of final or intermediate imports lead to more value-added payoff or more carbon leakage and which type of inputs overproduce carbon emissions when producing for exports.====The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows. ==== discusses the literature review. ==== elaborates the measurement of value added and embodied emission flows and their relative magnitude and the modeling of multiplicative SDA.

Heterogeneity analysis results are consistent with parents reinforcing academic advantage of better-performing earlier-born children, but do not support resource dilution, son preference, or reputation concerns as primary mechanisms underlying birth order effects. Our findings are in contrast to positive birth order effects found among earlier generations of Chinese siblings reported in the literature.","Studies based on data from mostly developed countries show that earlier-born children outperform their younger siblings in academic achievement (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====), cognitive skill (====, ====), risky behavior (====, ====) earnings (====), and even intergenerational outcomes (====). Interestingly, studies based on developing countries tend to find later-born children outperforming earlier-born children (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====), although exceptions exist (====, ====, ====). In China, ==== found positive birth order effects on academic performance, consistent with the evidence from developing countries. In contrast, negative birth order effects are shown in ====, ==== on outcomes including subjective well-being and years of schooling, respectively, although these two studies did not account for household-level unobservables.====Proposed channels of birth order effects include household resource allocation (====, ====, ====, ====), parental investment (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====), and parental monitoring (====, ====, ====). These studies highlight the role of parents in generating birth order effects among siblings. Parental discipline, which recently emerged as another important dimension of parenting behavior that has long-run impact on child outcomes (====, ====), remains relatively unexplored in the literature.====What can be underlying mechanisms that motivate the parents to differentiate resource allocation and parenting behavior among siblings? One explanation is resource dilution, implying negative birth order effects. Firstborn child monopolizes parental attention and household resources during early childhood until siblings are born, while later-born children do not enjoy such focused attention during early childhood, a critical period for human development (====).====Studies on India found that son preference can generate negative birth order effects. For example, ==== showed that negative birth order effects in height among Indian children were primarily driven by households with characteristics predicting strong son preference based on Hindu culture and religion, and by households with earlier-born sons and later-born daughters. Similarly, ==== found that earlier-born daughters tend to receive less breastfeeding than sons or later-born daughters because parents in need of a son would soon get pregnant again, which hastens weaning of ongoing breastfeeding. These findings were replicated in Egypt and Pakistan (====, ====), also known for strong son preference. Son preference is a prominent feature of Chinese society, driven by patrilineal family system that emphasizes the role of the eldest son to carry on the family name and support the parents in old age (====). This led to serious gender imbalance in favor of more men, aided by fertility restriction policies such as One Child Policy (OCP) and the widespread availability of ultrasound technology that allows ==== sex determination (====, ====, ====). It is therefore possible that son preference and gender imbalance together generate birth order effects in Chinese population. The extent to which son preference explains birth order effects in China has not been examined in the literature.==== proposed a game-theoretic model of reputation building by the parents, implying negative birth order effects. As more children are born, parents wishing to promote good behavior have an incentive to build a reputation to younger children as a ¡°strict¡± type rather than a ¡°lenient¡± type parents. This is achieved by setting stricter discipline to earlier-born children, improving their outcomes. ====, ==== present empirical evidence consistent with the implications of this model.====Other explanations suggest that parents may gain parenting experience over time, implying positive birth order effects. Evidence of this mechanism is rarely found. An exception is ====, showing that Korean parents are more likely to optimize birth month beneficial for school schedule for later births. ==== proposed that later births are more likely to be unplanned, ¡°accidental¡± births compared to earlier births. Surprised with unplanned fertility, the parents are forced to improvise, providing less than optimal care to later-born children. Changes in unwanted fertility seem to be important determinants of fertility trends and child outcomes among low-SES mothers in the US (====).====A common explanation for positive birth order effects in developing countries is that parents having first children may be severely credit-constrained (====, ====, ====, ====). Similarly, ==== found that mother¡¯s improving health over time could generate positive birth order effects in India.",Birth order effects and parenting behaviors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000354,11-Mar-23,2023,Research Article,42

In 2012, the Chinese government implemented the drug price zero-markup policy (ZMP) to contend with these problems. This paper investigates the impact of the ZMP on the hospitalization expenses and health outcomes of inpatients, using administrative data from Beijing. The findings show that the ZMP reduces inpatients' medicine expenses by an average of 20.4%, while total hospitalization expenses do not change significantly. The findings also show that the average length of hospital stay increases by 0.588?days. The results jointly indicate that hospitals adopt substitution behavior to make up for the drug revenue loss. The paper finds no evidence that the ZMP has a negative impact on patients' probability of death or readmission.","In China, drug overuse has long been a major concern in the health care system. For example, the number of antibiotics used in China was twice the number recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (====), and the percentage of patients who were prescribed antibiotics in outpatient care during 2010¨C2012 was as high as 45.7% (====). Drug overuse also drives high expenditures. Spending on drugs accounts for nearly 40% of total health spending in China, while in most Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, this proportion is only 17% (====).==== cities and lower-level hospitals, such as primary and secondary hospitals, and then expanded to all public hospitals in China.====This paper investigates the impacts of the ZMP on inpatient expenses and health outcomes. Using an individual-level administrative data set, we employ a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to address the impact of the ZMP on inpatient expenses, including medicine expenses and different categories of non-medicine expenses. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneous effects of the ZMP along different dimensions, including severity level of disease, ==== type, gender and age. To investigate the impact of the ZMP on health outcomes, we use death and readmission as measurements of health outcomes.====We find that after the implementation of the ZMP, the medicine expenses of inpatients dropped by 20.4% on average. The result indicates that the ZMP has effectively reduced drug expenditures. The ZMP eliminates the 15% profit margin, hence generating a reduction in drug prices. If the quantity of drug consumption remains the same, it is expected that drug expenditures would decrease by about 15%. However, the actual reduction in drug expenditure reaches 20.4%, suggesting that the quantity of drug consumption may also have decreased or some prescriptions are switched to cheaper brands. Conditional on the decrease in drug price, the change in drug consumption is more likely driven by the providers, i.e., physicians and hospitals, rather than the patients. Before the reform, prescribing more drugs or more expensive ones could generate profit for the providers. However, when the financial incentive of drug sales is taken away, physicians react and prescribe drugs as deemed necessary.====Although the drug expenditures have decreased, we find that the total hospitalization expenses remain about the same, and non-medicine expenses actually increase. The finding suggests that providers adapt to the ZMP, and develop new strategies to generate revenue. The reduction in the medicine expenses is substituted by the increase in the expenditures on non-drug services. Combined together, the ZMP does not lessen the financial burden for the insurer or patients.====The results from heterogeneity analysis show that the decline in medicine expenses is higher for patients with severe conditions, patients not insured by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS), males and older patients. The results are reasonable. These kinds of patients may suffer from severe conditions or have used more (expensive) medicines, so the reduction in drug expenditures is more for them than for other patients. We also consider the ZMP's impact on the length of stay (LOS), and it turns out that the ZMP increases LOS by an average of 0.588?days. Extending LOS may be a way to increase non-medicine services, as staying longer in the hospitals would involve more services for the patients, such as nursing care and bed fees. Meanwhile, substitutional services induced by financial incentives, like lab tests and radiological examinations, would take time to produce the results, which also contributes to the increase in LOS. Furthermore, we investigate the impacts of the ZMP on patients' health outcomes. No negative impacts on death or readmission (10, 15, and 30?days) are found, suggesting that the structure change of drug and non-medicine services has not negatively affected patients' health outcomes.====Our study contributes to the literature on the physician agency problem and drug overuse. The physician agency problem has been raised in the past (====; ====), and several studies show that physicians respond to financial incentives in the medical market and drug prescription process (====; ====; ====; ====). There is also evidence suggesting that in China, physicians' prescribing behavior is affected by factors unrelated to patients' medical conditions (====; ====; ====). The reduced quantity of drugs prescribed or the reduced prescriptions for high-price drugs, indirectly derived from the finding of the 20.4% reduction in drug expenditures, suggests that physicians may have actively changed their drug prescriptions because of the elimination of the profit on drug sales.====This study also expands the literature on evaluating the impact of the ZMP. Previous studies mainly focused on the ZMP's impacts on hospital income and individual expenditures. From the perspective of hospitals, drug income decreases while total income remains at the origin level; thus, the ZMP brought unintended effects through supply-side-induced services (====; ====). At the individual level, medicine expenses are found to have decreased for both inpatient and outpatient care, while expenses for other medical services have increased (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our results are consistent with the results of previous studies in terms of the decrease in medicine expenses and unchanged total expenses. In addition, while these studies do not provide evidence on the ZMP's impacts on health outcomes, we provide direct evidence of the ZMP's impacts on patients' health outcomes. According to our analysis, no negative impacts were found in terms of probability of death and readmission.====This paper is one of only a few to study the impact of the ZMP in Beijing's general hospitals. As the capital city, Beijing attracts lots of patients from the rest of China, with its intensive and high-quality health care resources, providing a wide and unique field to study the policy impact. Some of the previous studies used hospital management data or community health center data (====; ====) and lacked control groups for comparison. The study that is most relevant to ours is by ====, who find that after implementation of the ZMP, total hospitalization expenses and medicine expenses per inpatient decrease in the short term in the pilot hospitals, but in the long term the difference vanishes. However, ==== do not provide evidence on the ZMP's impact on health outcomes. Furthermore, their sample is patients only covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance. Our sample includes patients with all types of insurance.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

Meanwhile, local collective culture plays important roles. The findings have important implications for the government to improve public health policies and promote healthy aging.","At present, China has entered into an aging society, and the degree of aging is deepening. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of elderly adults aged 65 and above was about 176 million at the end of 2019, accounting for 12.6% of the total population. The old-age dependency ratio reached 17.8% and even exceeded 20% in some areas.==== As life expectancy is increasing, how to achieve high-quality longevity is a major concern for the whole society. ====, first released in 2018, emphasizes the need to pay equal attention to the physical and mental health and good social adaptation of the old. It points out that achieving and promoting healthy aging are necessary paths for China to cope with the rapid growth of aging trend. Urban¨Crural population migration has further aggravated population aging in rural areas (====). Compared with urban areas, the health status of rural middle-aged and older adults is more worrying due to the relatively lagging economic development, inadequate social security system, and the lack of medical resources in rural areas (====).====). According to the estimation of ====Although the relationship between income and health is an important topic widely discussed in health economics, several studies have focused on the relationship between absolute income and individual health (====; ====). A paucity of research exploring the effect of relative income on health is observed. The income levels of individuals relative to their peers and other groups in society also play an essential role in health (====, ====). According to existing studies, literature has explored the impact of deteriorating income distribution on individual health from the perspective of group income inequality, and the findings mainly support a negative relationship between income disparity and health (====; ====). However, widely used indicators, such as the Gini coefficient, measure income inequality from a group perspective and thus cannot identify the relative income of different individuals, let alone identify the differences in the impact of income disparity on different individuals. Another related literature measures the relative income levels of people at the individual level by adopting relative deprivation theory (RDT) (====; ====). This theory assumes that individuals tend to compare themselves to a reference group of people with relatively high incomes. As a result, the differences in individuals' income rankings within-group cause the income deprivation to vary individually. This measure of relative deprivation captures additional information at the micro level and is helpful in identifying the health effects of individuals' relative income levels (====).====In this study, relative deprivation indicators are constructed using the village where the rural middle-aged adults are located as the reference group. It examines the effect of relative income on the health of rural middle-aged and older adults. Our results reveal the significantly negative impact of deterioration in relative deprivation on the health status of middle-aged and older adults. This finding is consistent when using different health measures and relative deprivation indicators, extending the reference group to the city level or adopting subjective relative deprivation measures. The finding is also robust with respect to first-difference and within estimators. Given the heterogeneity of rural residents, this study analyzes the sample of middle-aged and older adults according to the following elements: age, gender, household income level, and collectivist culture to examine the differences in the effect of relative deprivation on the health status of individuals with different characteristics.====The contributions of this study are as follows: first, on the basis of the closely-knit rural society, we explore the impact of relative deprivation on individual health; we also point out the comparison within the social network, in which the middle-aged and elderly groups are located, on their health. Hence, new ideas are provided for the formulation of public health policies. Second, we adopt a panel event study design to better capture the dynamics of the effects of relative deprivation on health outcomes, including both deterioration and improvement in relative deprivation. Using data from the four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we control for the multidimensional fixed effects to eliminate the potential effect of time-invariant unobserved individual heterogeneity. Specifically, the possible external shocks in rural areas are considered to further control for interactive fixed effects, to mitigate the effects of time-variant unobservable factors at the village level, and to improve the accuracy of the estimation results.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. ==== reviews relevant literature and composes the theoretical framework of the paper. ==== clarifies the data sources and further conducts descriptive statistical analysis. ==== presents the estimation results and discussion. ==== provides a brief conclusion.",Relative deprivation and health revisited: New evidence from middle-aged and older adults in rural China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000330,6-Mar-23,2023,Research Article,45

Using high-frequency, city-level insurance purchases data from the largest online insurance platform in China, we employ difference-in-differences strategies to quantify changes in insurance purchases before and after the COVID-19 outbreak relative to a corresponding period in 2019. We show that the pandemic induces a substantial increase in daily number of insurance purchase, with evident impact on both health and life insurance. We demonstrate that the increase mainly originates from an expanded number of consumers; and is not driven by compositional shifts. Particularly, we show that the observed increase is better explained by pandemic risk exposure than other mechanisms such as negative emotions and insurance awareness. Nevertheless, there is a notable discrepancy between changes in insurance purchases and COVID-19 risk exposure, which is driven by individuals' lack of information on pandemic. We find that the more direct and high-quality information people have, the more likely their decisions are to accord with the objective risk exposure. These findings reveal the key driving forces of the risk management responses under an unprecedented pandemic, and point to the importance and necessity of public information disclosure.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was reported in the city of Wuhan of Hubei province in China (====). With massive human mobility and person-to-person transmission, the virus spread rapidly throughout the world and quickly evolved into a global pandemic (====). By the end of 2021, totals of 282 million cases and 5.4 million deaths have been confirmed globally, covering 226 countries, areas, or territories (====).====The pandemic has triggered unprecedented spikes in risks and uncertainty, bringing great challenges to the society (====). A growing number of studies is being conducted to understand the impact of the pandemic on global economy (====; ====; ====), social well-being (====; ====; ====), and policy interventions (====; ====). Among them, one emerging strand of literature specifically focuses on economic behaviors under the pandemic, such as household spending (====), consumption (====), and labor market performance (====; ====). However, facing the massive risks and uncertainty, no study to date has examined how individuals insure themselves against the soaring risks and the extent to which their insurance decisions are rational. To fill the gap, this study explores the extent to which people employ insurance as a coping strategy for pandemic risk control. In particular, we attempt to answer two research questions: (a) Under the massive economic shock and the pandemic, can people actively respond to the soaring risks through the purchases of insurance? (b) If so, what are the driving forces of the insurance take-up decisions? Are the decisions rational in such unparalleled situation? Answers to these questions may have valuable implications for policies and practices.====Using pandemic and insurance purchases data in China, this study provides novel evidence on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on insurance purchases, revealing key determinants of risk management behaviors during a pandemic. As the first country to experience the pandemic and face the massive spikes in risks and uncertainty, China is a valuable setting to understand changes in economic behaviors in such situation. In particular, the emergence of COVID-19 is an especially strong and unpredictable shock for the people back then as they are the very first to face this unknown and deadly virus with almost no effective treatment. This provides an exogenous, natural experiment to quantify the relative changes of insurance purchases before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the rich temporal and geographic variations in the COVID-19 risk exposure allow us to further investigate the underlying driving forces of the responses, and examine whether the major changes in insurance purchases are mainly explained by the dynamic changes in the COVID-19 risk exposure or other mechanisms.====In this study, insurance data are obtained from the largest private online insurance platform in China, which had in total insured >100 million people by the end of 2019. The great accessibility and responsiveness of the online platform makes it an excellent source of data to investigate insurance purchases behaviors. We use every two-day insurance purchases data from Dec 01, 2019 to Mar 16, 2020 (2019¨C2020) and the corresponding period in 2018¨C2019 for 294 prefecture-level cities; and a difference-in-differences (DID) approach is employed to identify the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on insurance purchases. Following prior literature (====; ====; ====; ====), we consider 2019¨C2020 observations as a treatment group and 2018¨C2019 observations as a counterfactual control group.==== Using the emergence of first COVID-19 cases in each prefecture city as a proximate start date for the COVID-19 outbreak, we estimate the changes in insurance purchases before and after the outbreak in the treatment period relative to the control.==== Our results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic induces a substantial increase in the daily number of insurance purchases, with an average daily increase of 135% per city. The number of insurance purchases grows increasingly and dramatically in the initial few weeks, followed by a large but slightly shrinking percentage increase.====To further understand the market changes, we examine whether the increase in insurance purchases mainly reflects the changes at the extensive margin or the intensive margin. We show that the increases in insurance purchases is predominantly attributed to the sharp rise (169%) in the number of consumers (i.e., extensive margin) rather than insurance purchases per consumer (i.e., intensive margin), which implies an expanded number of people start to take up insurance during the pandemic. Moreover, we indicate that the increases are evident across a variety of consumer groups, though the magnitudes differ to some degrees. Females respond in a larger magnitude than males; and younger-aged and older-aged consumers reveal less of increases than do middle-aged consumers.====As for the underlying mechanisms, we first show that the pandemic effect is not driven by the compositional shifts from offline to online purchases related to lockdown and policy restrictions, and the effect is fairly large and evident even after accounting for such changes. Then, we test three important mechanisms suggested by prior literature that may potentially link the pandemic and insurance take-up decisions: ====, ==== and ==== First, as insurance decisions largely depend on individuals' risk perceptions (====; ====), the massive spike in risks and uncertainty induced by the pandemic (====) may drive up individuals' perceptions of risks and consequently affect their insurance take-up decisions. Second, during the pandemic an increased level of negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, and depression, may also affect individuals' insurance purchases by distorting their risk perceptions and decision-making (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Finally, insurance purchases may change as more people realize the important role of insurance and recognize it as a coping strategy under the pandemic (====). Focusing on the three suggested mechanisms, we show that the dynamic changes in objective risks of COVID-19 explain the largest portion of the baseline effect. Exposure to higher risks (i.e., more COVID-19 confirmed cases) lead to greater increases in the insurance purchases at the daily-city level. By contrast, people with higher levels of negative emotions are less likely to consider insurance as a coping strategy; and we find no evidence showing the impact of insurance awareness on insurance take-up decisions.====Nevertheless, the three suggested mechanisms only account for some proportion of variations in insurance purchase decisions. In particular, the changes in insurance take-up cannot be largely explained by the geographic and temporal changes or differences in objective COVID-19 risk exposure, which may suggest potential biases in risk perceptions and economic decisions. Given the essential role of information in individuals' risk assessment and decision-making (====; ====), we hypothesize that the insurance decision making is bounded by the amount of information or knowledge people have about the pandemic (====).==== In other words, information and experience may influence or moderate the relationship between objective risk exposure and insurance purchases. To assess the role of information, we stratify our sample by the magnitude and the quality of information people are exposed to at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, and calculate the relative proportion of pandemic effects that is explained by objective pandemic risks. We show that the insurance purchases or take-up decisions are far more likely to be explained by the objective risks among cities with more direct experience of the pandemic (i.e., cities in Hubei province) than others. Besides, we demonstrate that the quality of information is also important for the take-up decisions. People who are exposed to more direct and high-quality information of pandemic (i.e., COVID-19 statistics updates) tend to make the decisions more consistently with the risk exposure. Lastly, we test the influence of past pandemic experience and knowledge (e.g., 2003 SARS or 2009 H1N1 pandemic) on take-up decisions, where we find the exposure to the most recent pandemic of H1N1 can also lead to more rational decision-making during the current pandemic. These findings, overall, point to the importance of direct and high-quality information for insurance take-up decisions at the time of a pandemic.====This paper contributes to existing insights in three major ways. First of all, our study joins a growing body of studies on the economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, the most relevant work is on household spending and consumption. For instance, ====; ====). Our study thus provides initial evidence on the patterns of insurance purchases associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests the risk management responses individuals may have during a pandemic.====Additionally, this paper adds to an emerging set of research that link insurance purchase behaviors with natural disasters.====) or earthquake insurance (====). Besides, the exposure of environmental health risks, such as air pollution, may also affect the insurance take-up decisions for health insurance (====). In this study, we explore the insurance purchase decisions under the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a setting that is fundamentally different from other natural disasters. Particularly, while most of the natural disasters are infrequent, stochastic events, their origins and impacts are well-understood and the likelihood of an event is even predictable based on historical records (====). People usually have common knowledge on a certain natural disaster and can access detailed information on it whenever they want (e.g., flood). In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic is an event that encompasses unprecedented risks and uncertainty. The infectiousness, prevalence, lethality of virus was unknown to the general public, and the duration and size of the pandemic could be hardly predictable when the pandemic first occurred (====). The decisions made in such setting to a larger extent depend on real-time observation rather than prior belief. This study thus provides first evidence on how people respond to an unparalleled disaster. In particular, we indicate that, under such uncertainty, people's decisions are hardly consistent with the objective risks they are exposed to; and the quality and amount of information people have for the emerging risks may have big impact on the rationality of insurance purchase decisions, which speaks to the importance of information disclosure in a pandemic. In addition, this paper differs from previous studies in that it examines all types of insurance rather than a single type of disaster insurance (e.g., earthquake or flood insurance). We find that the COVID-19 pandemic can have positive effects on the demand of health and life insurances, advancing our knowledge on the impact of natural disaster on general insurance purchases.====Finally, this paper contributes to studies on the relationship between emotion and decision-making. Existing literature demonstrates that emotions often distort risk perceptions (====; ====) and induce irrational economic decisions (====; ====). Specifically, decision-making is often disturbed by fear (====), anxiety (====), depression (====), and other emotions (====; ====). In this study, we find that negative emotions can negatively affect the insurance take-up decisions during the pandemic. Although we are not able to draw conclusion on its welfare implications, the finding does suggest the real-world impact of negative emotions on risk perceptions and financial decisions.

Firstly, the effect of the CAA on labor demand was time-varying, as labor demand first decreased and then recovered from 2013 to 2019. Secondly, the CAA generated a greater job destruction in polluting industries and their downstream industries, and job creation in clean industries. Lastly, thanks to the CAA firms have increased the hiring of highly skilled workers, although equipment upgrades have reduced labor demand, especially in polluting firms.","Over the past few decades, air pollution has caused considerable economic losses and done harm to human health in China (====; ====; ====). To reduce the huge costs of air pollution, in September 2013, the Chinese government released the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) (2013¨C2017). The Clean Air Action (CAA) established a system of centrally-planned, regionally-decomposed, politically-incentivized, and multifaceted air regulations (====). However, it has also increased production costs in most industrial enterprises, forcing several enterprises to downsize or close, and the associated declines in employment.====Maintaining employment stability is key to reducing the negative impact of environmental regulation on economic growth and social stability (====). Recent studies have all revealed that China's environmental regulation on pollution emissions led to a significant decline in employment levels (====; ====; ====). The CAA is the largest, most stringent, and highest-stake air regulation in China's history (====; ====), entailing a reduction of their output and of their demand for inputs, including labor demand. As such, the output effect is generally negative (====). The substitution effect refers to the impact of enterprise equipment installation and upgrading on labor demand. ==== argued that equipment upgrade will reduce employment. When ¡°end-of-pipe¡± equipment is installed, it is necessary to have corresponding types of labor, which often increases labor demand. In addition, ==== claimed that if pollution and labor are substitutes in production, firms may hire more labor when the marginal cost of pollution increases. These considerations suggest that job destruction and job creation exist simultaneously within firms.====The scientific findings on the effect of environmental regulation on labor demand are mixed, as this depends on the net value of both job destruction and job creation. For example, ==== found that the 1990?U.S. Clean Air Action caused a 15% decline in manufacturing labor demand. ==== discovered that the sharp increase in air quality regulation in Los Angeles since 1979 substantially reduced NO====; ====), while capital-intensive and clean industries are less affected (====).====In addition, the effects of environmental regulations on polluting industries may be transmitted to other industries through capital markets and energy-intensive products, leading to labor reallocation across industries (====). ====; ====). As a result, there will be varying degrees of job creation and job destruction across industries, and labor flows will drive labor reallocation across industries.====In this study, we examined the dynamic impact of the CAA on labor demand and delved into the mechanisms of labor reallocation. The difference-in-differences (DID) method was used to perform analysis, as it is a relatively mature policy effects evaluation method. In order to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation results, the ==== (PSM) method was used to eliminate the bias between the treatment group and the control group, and a longer window before policy implementation was considered to test the common trend assumption. We used both city-level and listed firm-level data for analysis, and combined these two levels of data to increase the robustness and representativeness. This study analyzed the effect of dynamic changes over time; unlike existing studies, we executed a dynamic placebo test to fully demonstrate the robustness of the dynamic analysis results.====Our findings contribute to the literature on the topic of environmental regulation and labor reallocation in three ways. Firstly, while existing studies have paid more attention to the aggregate effect, this study analyzed the dynamic impact of environmental regulation on labor demand over time (====; ====Secondly, as few researches have been conducted on the labor reallocation effect of environmental regulation, this study analyzed the labor reallocation effect of the CAA at two levels: inter-industry and intra-firm. ==== argued that environmental regulation typically affects the distribution of labor, rather than the level of employment. Therefore, the estimation of the regulatory costs should focus more on the transitional costs of labor. By performing a comprehensive review of the existing literature, this paper analyzes the labor reallocation entailed by environmental regulations at both inter-industry and intra-firm level. We found that the CAA reduced labor demand in polluting industries and their downstream industries, and increased labor demand in clean industries. Moreover, the number of highly skilled workers within firms increased, although equipment upgrades reduced labor demand.====Finally, while existing studies focused more on developed countries such as the United States and the European Union (====; ====), this study provided evidence from China, i.e., the largest developing country. Driven by the demographic dividend, China has grown rapidly to become the second largest economy in the world. However, unlike developed countries, the majority of Chinese firms are currently labor-intensive and energy-intensive; therefore, the implementation of the CAA is expected to lead to structural changes in the Chinese labor market. The results of the present study can provide support to stabilize employment during the implementation of environmental regulations, and inform other countries in similar situations around the world about the experience of China.====This paper is structured as follows.

We find that big data pricing reduces the average ==== while the borrowers with delinquency or default histories are assigned higher interest rates. However, repeat borrowers are also faced with growing interest rates, even though they have been paying their debts on time. Further analysis shows that repeat borrowers have lower income and education levels. Moreover, investor returns become less dispersed after pricing with big data, which can be a result of homogeneous loans on the market. The implications of the above findings are discussed.","Since customer information was not as ubiquitous and available as it is today, the assessment of loan applicants mainly relied on credit scores, such as FICO. However, it is impossible for some loan applicants to be funded because they have unsatisfactory credit scores or they have no credit scores at all. Nowadays, with the development of financial technologies, modern loan providers can adopt big data to upgrade the risk management procedure and assess customer creditworthiness, by analyzing behavioral indicators and spending patterns. It is believed that big data can help to extract the value of data and it will be less risky for financial companies when predicting which clients will be successful in their payments. As a result, more people could have access to credit loans (====).====Promising as it may seem, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how these technologies affect creditors and debtors. The adoption of big data pricing by a marketplace lending (also known as peer-to-peer lending) platform in China offers us an opportunity to investigate what role big data plays. This marketplace lending platform changed the pricing rule from auction design in favor of posted prices to big data pricing on 14 October 2015 (====).====Since the essence of big data is to assess credit risk by analyzing recorded behavioral information, a natural thought is that borrowers with punctual repayment history should enjoy lower, or at least not higher, interest rates because they have exhibited creditworthiness. On the other hand, returning borrowers with delinquency or default records should face higher interest rates. However, it has been reported that some Internet enterprises utilize big data to price discriminate against existing users and this phenomenon has triggered many discussions in academic, legal, and government sections around the world (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). It is unclear which effect is true - risk identification or price discrimination. If both effects exist, it is ambiguous which effect dominates the other.====We observe the pricing mechanism change from auction-style to big data pricing on a major peer-to-peer lending market in China and we seize this opportunity to systematically investigate how borrowers and investors are respectively affected by big data pricing. We find that after pricing with big data, the platform only allows borrowers with favorable credit ratings to enter the market and therefore the loan applications are more likely to be successfully funded. Although first-degree price discrimination is unlikely to take place in the real world, big data has made personalized price discrimination possible. Loan interest rates become lower in general, but borrowers with delinquency or default history are required to pay higher interest rates. Meanwhile, returning borrowers are confronted with higher interest rates as well, providing supportive evidence of ¡°big data price discrimination against existing customers¡± or ¡°big data price discrimination¡±. As for investors, the adoption of big data pricing reduces the default possibility, possibly due to initial screening. Moreover, both the mean and the variance of portfolio return among investors are reduced. In other words, although risk takers and risk avoiders have different preferences, their portfolio returns become less divergent after big data pricing.====The rest of this manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of price discrimination in financial markets and price discrimination against repeat customers. Section 3 introduces data and variables. In Section 4, we provide empirical evidence that some repeated borrowers are charged with higher interest rates after controlling for a series of variables such as loan characteristics and repayment history. In section 5, we further evaluate the influence of big data pricing in two aspects - loan default and investor performance.

Because cadres (government officials) in China have a broad influence on resource allocation, their presence elicits responses from surrounding parents and students. Exploiting random classroom assignments in Chinese middle schools, we find that increased exposure to classmates' cadre parents raises parents' attention to their children's friendships and guidance over schoolwork. We also find evidence suggesting that parental changes raise the child's test scores. The findings highlight parental adjustments as a mediator of the external influence of peer parents on children.","Individuals who possess social and political capital attain advantages in resource allocation. Their influence on others is present within a household as well as affecting the economic agents in their networks. In an educational setting, the presence of influential parents¡ªsocially or politically¡ªin the networks may affect other parents' behaviors, and these parental adjustments influence the surrounding children.====This study probes the external influence of cadre parents on other parents and children in China. Cadres (====) are government officials who possess significant political power and authority (====; ====). Unlike average citizens, they are able to secure political, economic, and social resources for themselves and others close to them (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In China, the prestige of cadre parents is distinct from less visible parental attributes such as education and income (====; ====; ====). This presents a unique context for investigating the extent to which surrounding economic agents, such as other parents, adapt to the presence of influential parents in their networks. We posit that when a student is placed with classmates (peers) from a cadre family, this student's parents adjust their parenting practices, which affects the student's schoolwork accordingly.====Non-random sorting is the primary challenge for demonstrating a causal interpretation of the influence of peers' cadre parents on parents and students. At the macro level, parents' heterogeneous preferences affect neighborhood and school choices (====), while at the micro level, individual traits and tastes determine the formation of social networks (====). In this study, we exploit the unique context in the Chinese educational system that uses random classroom assignments in some middle schools, analyzing a nationally representative sample of such middle school students from the China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS 2013¨C2014). In addition to the criterion established in similar studies (such as in ==== and ====) examining whether a school implements random student assignments, we employ an additional check if schools have not experienced parental interference in class and teacher assignments to ensure that students are randomly assigned to a class. Given the randomization background in the refined school sample, we can effectively isolate the causal impact of classmates' parental background (the cadre status of peer parents) from endogenous peer group formation, which is a major challenge of empirical peer-effect studies (====).====Using unique randomized social networks, we evaluate whether increased exposure to cadre parents leads to adjustments of other parents and students in the same class. In the empirical specification, conditional on school-by-grade fixed effects, we leverage idiosyncratic within-grade variation in the proportion of classmates from a cadre family to estimate its effects on parental behaviors and student test scores.====We find evidence that parents pay more attention to ¡°relationship building¡± (====) and provide more schoolwork support when their children are exposed to more classmates from cadre families. In China's ====-oriented context, people make connections with higher social status members (in this case, cadres) to seek favors in the future, either for themselves or their children (====; ====; ====; ====). Such instrumental consideration increases parents' involvement in children's friendship networks (====). Meanwhile, as good academic performance is an important indicator of ¡°good¡± friends, parents must ensure that their child performs well to break into the ==== network with cadre children (====; ====).==== Empirically, with more cadre parents in a class, we find that parents are more involved in their children's friendship networks, increase their communication with children about what happened in school, and provide more supervision and guidance for children's homework. Our findings echo the growing consensus in economics that parenting responds to the surrounding environment (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====More parental involvement may contribute to children's educational success (====). Along with parental adjustments, we find that greater exposure to cadre parents leads to better academic performance for students in the same class. The addition of one more cadre parent to a class increases a student's standardized test score by 1.85%.====The parental adjustments are a plausible explanation that mediates the residual cadre-parent spillover effect on students. With the local influence of cadres and the deep-rooted culture of ¡°networking to seek favor¡± (====), parents react to the increased presence of cadres in their network in a way that benefits children's test scores. Changes in teacher practices may be an alternative theory that explains the external influences of cadre parents on students; however, we do not find strong evidence of pedagogical changes or favoritism toward students in classes with more cadre parents. Nevertheless, our study does not exhaust all possible mechanisms of cadre-parent spillover on students, and there may be alternative mechanisms worth investigating in future research.====This study contributes to the understanding of the economic significance of political ties. The political backgrounds of individuals/organizations affect a wide spectrum of economic activities in developed and developing countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Particularly in China, cadre members generate benefits for themselves and those close to them, including labor market and health outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====). This study goes beyond the traditional focus of within-household transmission (====; ====; ====), demonstrating that political status can have a far-reaching influence on the surrounding economic agents.====Second, our study enhances the economic literature regarding early-life development. One active strand of economic analysis focuses on within-household transmission, such as the correlation of income or education between parents and their children (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our discussion connects these two important perspectives from the angle of social networks. By generating the ¡°exposure effect,¡± the interaction between parents and the surrounding environment affects the human capital accumulation of their children, adding a novel dimension to our understanding of early-life development.==== Though receiving minimal attention from economists, the external influence of parents on surrounding parents and children has direct policy implications, such as the significance of better neighborhoods and schools on early-life outcomes (====, ====; ====, ====).====Finally, this study relates to the spillover generated by peer parental background with two important distinctions. First, regarding methodology, a common strategy for analyzing nationally representative surveys, such as the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) in the US, exploits cohort variations in grade-mate composition (====; ====; ====; ====). Our randomization background controls for selection in classes and allows us to leverage random variation at a finer level. Rather than grade-mates, using classmates to identify social effects also better justifies social interaction (e.g., norm and information spillover) as the underlying force that generates peer parental spillover. Second, in addition to documenting a causal interpretation, we demonstrate that the parental background of peers offers a far richer interpretation than a proxy of peer ability. They are also distinct economic agents who generate social influence (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). When parents adapt to the influence of cadre parents, changes in parenting practices affect the students accordingly.",Exposure to socially influential peer parents: Evidence from cadre parents in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000287,25-Feb-23,2023,Research Article,49

Using an original database including the information of listed firms' board members and parcel-level land transaction records, this paper documents how revolving-door recruitment makes firms stand out in China's land market. We show that firms with revolving-door recruitment receive special deals in land transactions, which are simultaneously reflected in the quantity and price of land. Specifically, connected firms buy more parcels and larger areas of land in the primary land market. Due to the particularity of industrial land, ==== are only identified for commercial and residential land, while not for industrial land. Measuring economic activity by night light intensity, we find no evidence that land transaction under the influence of political connections has a negative impact on economic activity on land. Our research advances the understanding that the state-business relationship is an essential factor in resource allocation in an emerging market with government intervention.","Revolving-door recruitment, in which firms recruit incumbent or retired officials, is a pervasive phenomenon around the world (====; ====; ====). Firms that establish political connections through revolving door recruitment tend to receive various benefits and advantages which their counterparts without connections do not have. A growing literature explores how revolving-door recruitment can provide firms with preferential access to government-controlled or government-influenced resources, such as bank credit, government subsidies, and government contracts (====; ====; ====). Political connections can even play a role in lowering firms' labor costs (====; ====). These advantages and privileged access to economic resources, in turn, lead to better firm performance and bring more superior returns in capital market (====; ====). However, while it is considered as one of the three most important production factors in classical economics, land is rarely discussed in literature on political connections. One reason for this omission might be that land is generally privately owned, and in most countries, individuals can trade land freely in the market (====; ====). Although waves of land marketization have been seen in China in recent years (====; ====), local governments can still select land buyers by setting exclusive restrictions to prevent all but those who are favored to participate in an auction or by manipulating the transaction process in favor of a bidding partner (====). Meanwhile, local officials, who face limited institutional constraints, have the final say on many public affairs under one-party rule, such as taxation, land development, and government procurement (====; ====; ====; ====). As such, firms that have ==== political connections due to their having recruited former officials, may receive preferential treatment in the primary land market.====By matching board members and high-level executives at publicly listed firms and land transaction data, we build an original database constituted by the firm-jurisdiction-year dyads to test the effect of jurisdiction-specified political connections. Using a specification that controls multi-dimensional fixed effects, our empirical results show that connected firms receive larger quantities of land than their unconnected counterparts. Preferential access to land resources is found for both industrial land and commercial/residential land. Although we also identify ====, we find that these discounts are only significant for commercial and residential land but not for industrial land. These results indicate that while firms with political connections receive special deals in land market, the favors received are heterogeneous, depending on land usage.====Furthermore, as noted in previous studies, economic resources, such as labor resources, land, and bank loans, are misallocated due to government intervention (====; ====). Therefore, we also discuss how the allocation of land resources under the influence of political connections affects economic activity on land, which is measured by a novel indicator, i.e., night light intensity. In opposition to the conventional wisdom, which holds that allocating resources in a non-market-oriented way inevitably leads to misallocation, our empirical results find no evidence that revolving-door recruitment has a negative impact on economic activity on land.====Our paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, we provide two main contributions to the body of literature on the influence of political connections in markets. On the one hand, previous studies usually measure the political connections by whether a firm has recruited incumbent or retired officials but overlook the precise working experience of these officials (====; ====; ====). However, the influence of local officials is usually jurisdiction-specified. This means that an official working in city A generally has little influence in the public affairs of city B. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the effect of the political connections on the firms-jurisdictions dyadic level. On the other hand, our work is one of a few studies that focus on the effect of political connections on land resource allocation. From this perspective, the research most related to ours is ====, who find local officials and listed firms are ¡°trading favors¡± in land market: Local officials provide price discounts for firms, and firms reward officials with future recruitment and high salaries. Unlike that work, we document that there are not only preferential treatments in land price but also in land quantity. We also document the heterogeneous effects on different types of land use and find that price discounts are not pervasive. Due to the already low price of industrial land and the institutional restrictions placed by the central government, local officials cannot provide significant price discounts on industrial land. This paper provides evidence that the price discounts from revolving-door recruitment in China are only significant on commercial and residential land.====The second contribution is that we bring a novel perspective to understand land development in China. In recent decades, most studies have investigated land governance and land development from the incentive and behavior of local governments (====; ====). Perspectives considering the development of land for economic growth and the development of land for fiscal revenue have received particular attention (====). While we agree that local governments and local officials are critical players in land development, it is worth noting that the land market could not function without the participation of enterprises. This means that bringing the enterprises back and revealing the interaction between enterprises and governments are essential for a complete portrait of the operation of land market. Using publicly listed firms and their board members as samples, our work seeks to disentangle the importance of government-business relations in an emerging and immature land market.====; ====; ====). However, other streams of literature argue that political connections could improve the economic efficiency of resources. For example, ==== find that the connections formed by bribery act like a lubricant, which greases the wheels of bank lending and improves the efficiency of credit allocation. To the best of our knowledge, no work has studied how political connections affect economic activity on land, partly due to the difficulty in choosing a proper measurement. Using the novel indicator of night light intensity to measure economic activity, our work fills this gap.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the background for revolving-door recruitment in the listed firms and gives an overall picture of China's land market. Following the theoretical analysis, research hypotheses are proposed. ==== presents the method and data we use to test the hypotheses. The empirical results are presented in ====. ==== discusses the results and concludes the paper.====This appendix provides an example from the Canal New City, Hangzhou, to illustrate how local land bureaus use zoning to determine land usage before land parcels are put into the primary market.

This paper contributes to this debate by employing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to uncover the CO==== emission typology based on the provincial emission data in China from 2000 to 2018 for a precise design of CO==== emission mitigation policy for heterogenous regional patterns. The results indicate that we can cluster the provinces into four CO==== emission patterns: the under-developed pattern, the coal-dominated pattern, the oil-dominated pattern, and the gas-dominated pattern. Notably, both the under-developed pattern and the coal-dominated pattern have a large amount of CO==== emission from fossil fuels, while the gas-dominated pattern could be regarded as the policy inclination as it relies more on low-carbon fuels. Moreover, we also reveal the transition routes of emission patterns from a dynamic perspective, which could help policymakers better understand the future trend of emission patterns in different regions. On the one hand, the CO==== emission mitigation policies could have specified priorities in different patterns, ensuring the feasibility during the process of policy implementation. On the other hand, establishing a national unified carbon trade market could facilitate efficient energy transition in China, and prevent carbon leakage cross different regions as well.","It is a consensus that human activities since the industrial revolution have led to a rapid increase in carbon dioxide (CO====) emission, aggravating global climate changes (====). China, a developing country with a population of over 1.4 billion, is facing enormous challenges in tackling climate change as an essential part of the global climate campaign. Specifically, with the continuation of urbanization and industrialization, it is undoubted that energy demand, particularly coal-dominated energy, will keep rising over a period of time (====; ====; ====). According to the report issued by Rhodium Group, China emitted 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019, which surpassed the entire developed world combined, although the per-person emissions in China are still far behind the U.S. In this scenario, the implementation of CO==== emission mitigation policies has drawn widespread attention (====).====Against this backdrop, the Chinese government attaches incredible importance to mitigating CO==== emissions. At the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2020, President Xi Jinping claimed that China would scale up the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), aiming to achieve the goals of carbon peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. To achieve such goals, the Chinese government has issued a wide range of policy documents, consisting of the ¡°Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030¡± and ¡°Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality¡±, as well as ¡°the 14==== Five Year Plan¡± (FYP),==== which provide a series of specified measures to serve for CO====However, implementing ¡°Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality¡± policies is undergoing several challenges. The most challenged one is the regional heterogeneity in CO==== emission patterns (====; ====), which indicates that a one-size-fits-all policy would not well serve the goal of ¡°Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality¡±, particularly in such a sheer size country. Undoubtedly, different regions in China have various energy sources, consumption structures, and economic development needs, requiring heterogeneous CO==== mitigation strategies for each area (====; ====; ====) and even for each firm (====). In particular, developed cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, which have transformed into energy structures with low-carbon dioxide emissions, would be more likely to meet emission mitigation targets. However, underdeveloped provinces such as Guizhou, Shanxi, and Qinghai still heavily rely on traditional fossil fuels and have a high level of CO==== emission. Implementing the same policies as the developed cities for those areas would be impractical. As such, revealing the CO==== emission patterns of different regions and then proposing heterogeneous CO==== mitigation strategies is a crucial issue in the context of ¡°Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality¡±.====Academically, most previous studies mainly focus on the growth of CO==== emissions and make great efforts to reveal the significant driving factors. On the whole, the growing CO==== emissions are driven by booming economics, household energy consumption, population growth, capital investment, and growth in exports (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Aside from driving factors of CO==== emission, recent literature has realized that the recognition of CO==== emission patterns is a crucial issue in the process of implementation of mitigation policies as a single mitigation strategy would not work well for all regions (====; ====; ====). For instance, the study of ==== discusses the CO==== emission patterns of shrinking and growing cities and categorizes the cities into six groups with a population index. Also, ==== present the seasonal and spatial patterns of CO==== emissions in China based on fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing emissions. Besides, considering the fact that the transport sector contributes most to global CO==== emission, a number of studies are devoted to analyzing the CO==== emission patterns in the transport sector (====; ====; ====). The general conclusions indicate significant regional CO==== emission differences in transport sectors (====; ====).====Furthermore, from the perspective of global supply chain networks, ==== distinguish 4756 CO==== emission clusters and offer some insights on climate policies. According to the existing literature, we can find that the CO==== emission patterns are often generated by some selected indexes or subjective judgments, which could not well mirror the underlying CO==== emission patterns. As a result, the conclusions cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of emission typology as the researchers' bias may exist in the identified typologies. Consequently, the information for supporting the policy design is somewhat limited.====In light of this, the overall aim of this study is to uncover the CO==== emission patterns based on the similarity of CO==== emission sources and then propose policy implications concerning regional heterogeneity with the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques, which have been widely used in pattern recognition (====; ====, ====; ====). This study could make two contributions to the existing literature. First of all, although previous studies have substantiated the potential of machine learning techniques in uncovering unlabeled patterns, little attention has been paid to the application of machine learning in CO==== emission patterns. Correspondingly, the first contribution of this paper is to employ unsupervised machine learning, the K-means clustering algorithm, to analyze the typologies of carbon dioxide emissions. Compared with traditional approaches, unsupervised machine learning could better recognize the underlying typologies as the algorithm could ensure the provinces within the same typologies have high similarity in CO==== emission patterns and do not rely on subjective judgments. Technically, the K-means algorithm provides an ideal approach to cluster multi-dimensional data (====). With this, we can recognize the CO==== emission patterns by comprising multi-dimensional metrics rather than a single indicator (====). Second, to the best of our knowledge, the transition route of CO==== emission typologies is so far absent in the existing literature, which limits the understanding of the emission typologies' transition dynamics and policy designs. To fill this research gap, we investigate the CO==== emission patterns transition based on the clustering results of machine learning from a dynamic perspective.

Utilizing data from China's High Spatial Resolution Emission Gridded Database (CHRED), this paper presents the measured CO==== emission inequality in China for the years 2005, 2012, 2015, and 2020. Results show that the ","Carbon inequality, on both international and household scales, has attracted increasing attention worldwide. Relatively equal distribution of emissions mitigation among countries is the first step in addressing global climate change, however, the allocation of carbon quota on the national level is far more critical, especially for the world's largest-emitting countries. Carbon inequality increases the difficulty of allocating a carbon budget. However, there has been limited inspection of carbon disparities among countries and individuals and thus there is little guidance regarding the assignment of mitigation tasks for specific countries. The assignment on the national level should also follow the global principle of ¡°common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities¡± proposed in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Hence, intra-national quota allocation requires a transparent domestic geographical distribution of ====, which has great potential to shape future carbon policies.====In this paper, we examine carbon inequality on an intra-national scale in China. As China is the world's largest emitter, the Chinese government has enacted a raft of policies to support global cooperation on climate action. It has already shown impressive achievements in diversifying the energy mix, curbing CO==== emissions, and lowering carbon intensity (====; ====). To confront severe climate change, the Chinese government proposed the ¡°Double Carbon¡± goal (i.e., China will hit peak emissions before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality by 2060) to accelerate the process of carbon reduction. Achieving this goal faces unprecedented difficulty and thus an effective action plan for carbon reduction is urgently needed. As provinces and cities are the true implementors of emission mitigation, it is essential to ascertain a regional profile. The geographic distribution of carbon emissions reflects social and agroeconomic vulnerability levels and resembles an uneven distribution of wealth and well-being (====; ====). However, the regional allocation of abatement remains a daunting challenge.====Existing research has analyzed the schemes of allocation abatement quotas based on the objectives of minimizing marginal abatement costs (====; ====). Unique to preexisting research, this article aims to provide a profile of the spatial and temporal distribution of carbon emissions in place of designing an allocation scheme. Numerous studies have emphasized the trade-off between equity and efficiency when allocating emission quotas (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). As emissions are a byproduct of economic activity, emission inequality is closely associated with income inequality. The distribution and the disparity of CO==== emissions are quite relevant to the welfare and the design of climate policies, as rich and poor areas have varying interests and capability for mitigation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Unlike previous research that exploits provincial or household data, the current study conducted an inequality analysis by examining city-level CO==== emissions. The cause of city-scale inequality being more suitable for allocation design can be explained twofold. At first, there is a growing impetus of cities' roles in mitigating climate change (====), and the potential for cities to reduce carbon emissions should be high (====; ====; ====).====Second, carbon inequality at the city level can be more comprehensive in measuring geographical disproportionality. For household emission inequality, input-output data and survey data are normally utilized (====; ====). Household-level data from surveys is at a micro-level and cannot cover emissions from other sectors (e.g., industrial and transportation). Thus, it is not applicable for analyzing overall emissions in China, and it is more suitable for measuring individual well-being. Although the indirect household emissions estimated by input-output data can supplement the drawback, individuals are not the driving force in emission abatement. Furthermore, measurement bias by household data exists due to carbon leakage (====). Some households tend to purchase commercial services (e.g., dining out or buses and taxi services) instead of performing such services themselves (e.g., cooking or driving on their own), which distorts the actual measurement of emissions and results in an inaccurate estimation of inequality. However, city-level data helps to internalize indirect household emissions. Provincial-level data ignores intra-province disparities and limits variation to no more than 40 observations, leading to an underestimation of inequality. In contrast, the sample of data at the city level is larger than that at the provincial level, which helps improve the precision of measuring inequality. Issues are also present about ignoring intra-cities' inequality for city-level data; however, this is not as severe as provincial data, as it covers intra-provincial inequality.====This paper investigates two issues. The first is regarding the extent of the carbon inequality existing in China and how this inequality has changed in recent years as China has experienced dramatic changes. The second issue is to distinguish between the pure carbon inequality and carbon-economic inequality and to discern what causes inequality, owing to rich and poor areas having different varying interests and capabilities for mitigation. Revealing carbon inequality at the subnational level can provide increasingly specific information about the distribution of emissions, and the identification of the source of inequality offers policy implications on the assignment of the mitigation tasks.====The present study contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, unique from previous studies that have used household-level or provincial-level data in China, this study utilizes data at the city level, providing a more comprehensive description of the CO==== emissions in China. While other research has used data at the city level (====), their emission data is modeled using DMSP/OLS nighttime light imagery. This study uses data from CHRED 1.0 and 2.0, which is based on a bottom-up approach and is more reliable after cross-validation. In addition, the previous study only focused on the inequality index and lacked an in-depth analysis. Second, this study is not limited to the measurement of the inequality degree. We conduct further analysis into the causes of the changes in the inequality degree from multi-dimensions, including emissions sources, subgroups, and economic and social determinants. Previous studies have focused more on depicting the profile of the emission inequality or investigating the driving forces of CO==== emissions instead of emission inequality (====).",Carbon inequality in China: Evidence from city-level data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000251,16-Feb-23,2023,Research Article,52

Exploiting exogenous turnovers of city-level party secretaries in China, I find that city secretaries with early-life poverty experiences are more likely to increase the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions. I further find that the effect of city secretaries' poverty experiences on the income of the poor is more pronounced in the counties that are not officially categorized as impoverished by the central government and among the families living above the poverty line set by the Chinese government but below the international poverty line proposed by the World Bank. It is suggested that local political leaders affect poverty reduction outcomes by instilling their personal preferences, which can be shaped by their early experiences, into their economic decisions.","Poverty reduction has long been an important issue in economic and social studies. In the past three decades, China has achieved great success in the fight against poverty through a series of nationwide anti-poverty policies. However, the outcomes of these nationwide policies have varied substantially across regions. In this paper, I study the role of local political leaders in poverty reduction in China, finding that local political leaders born in poverty are more likely to increase the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions. It is further suggested that the early-life poverty experiences of local leaders increase their willingness, rather than ability, to participate in the anti-poverty campaign. By incorporating imprinting theory into a political¨Ceconomic framework, this paper provides an alternative explanation for the subnational variations in policy outcomes besides the career incentives of local leaders.====It has been well documented in previous literature that national political leaders have distinct ways of thinking and acting, which exert significant impacts on economic and social outcomes such as GDP growth (====), economic reforms (====), fiscal performance (====), military decisions (====), and national security (==== The literature is relatively thin in using non-political factors of local leaders to explain the subnational variations in policy outcomes.====The heterogeneity in the policy preferences of local leaders can exist even in countries with a low level of local political autonomy. China provides such an example. Under the system of political centralization, the central government of China adopts a target-based scheme to manage local governments. Promotions for local politicians are often linked to measurable economic indicators such as GDP growth rate (====; ====; ====) and increase in fiscal revenues (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In non-contractable fields in the absence of political pressure imposed by the central government, local leaders have a great deal of discretion and are allowed to make economic decisions via individual preference.====Although the importance of poverty reduction has been repeatedly emphasized by China's central government for decades, local political leaders may not have the same degree of incentives to fight poverty. To identify this issue, I exploit the fact that the Chinese government and the World Bank do not use the same standard to measure poverty.==== For some reasons, Chinese poverty line is lower than the international poverty line proposed by the World Bank. While the World Bank poverty line is more likely to reflect the costs of basic necessities, local leaders pursuing promotions should care more about the official standard set by the central government. For local leaders, lowering the poverty rate defined by the Chinese government is a compulsory task, while reducing the population living below the World Bank poverty line is an option. The gap between the two poverty lines provides a unique opportunity to study the role of local political leaders in poverty reduction.====This paper studies the experiences of local political leaders as a potential determinant of their incentives to participate in the anti-poverty campaign. Previous literature shows that individuals with similar backgrounds tend to be more concerned about each other's wellbeing. For example, using a quasi-natural experiment in India, ==== find that female policy-makers invest more in infrastructure that is directly relevant to the needs of women; and ==== finds that male legislators with daughters are more likely to vote on reproductive rights issues.==== In this paper, I focus on the early-life poverty experiences of local leaders and incorporate imprinting theory into a political¨Ceconomic framework. Imprinting theory was developed in the biological literature and originally referred to the observation that some species of animal develop a permanent attachment to the first moving object they perceive after birth. A revised version of this theory is used in the social sciences and argues that people's beliefs and values cultivated by their early experiences tend to persist throughout their whole life, regardless of changes in external environment (see, e.g., ====; ====; ====).==== Despite their improved living standards in adulthood, local political leaders born in poverty may still show more sympathy toward the poor and thus have stronger willingness to fight poverty.====Based on imprinting theory, I conjecture that local political leaders with early-life poverty experiences are more likely to increase the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions. I test for this hypothesis using the political context in China. I primarily focus on the role of city secretaries rather than mayors, because city secretaries have more political power than mayors despite the same political rank they share. Chinese cities provide an appropriate setting to examine the imprint effect of local leaders' early experiences on poverty reduction for three reasons. First, as the ruling party, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) applies the one-level-down appointment system to manage local cadres. For households that do not vote for their governors, the replacement of city secretaries can be viewed as a series of exogenous shocks. Second, as city secretaries rarely serve in their hometowns,==== the imprint effect formed in their cities of birth can be distinguished from the effect of the external environment in their current cities of appointment. Third, China's economic decentralization allows local leaders to choose different economic growth patterns in their jurisdictions, so city secretaries are able to adopt policies that exert heterogenous effects on households with different income levels. Thus, the poverty reduction outcomes in a given city should partially depend on the city secretary's willingness to help the poor.====To study the imprint effect of city secretaries' early experiences on the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions, I draw the data on household income from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) surveys during 2009¨C2017 and measure the poverty imprints of city secretaries using the GDP information from their cities of birth. Poor families are identified through the international poverty line proposed by the World Bank in 2015. Using the sample consisting of the poor families in the CFPS surveys, I regress the income of the poor against the measure of poverty imprint and a battery of control variables through the OLS method. The OLS results suggest that the poverty imprints of city secretaries significantly increase the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions. Then, several additional tests are conducted to confirm that the relationship between the poverty imprints of city secretaries and the incomes of poor families is a causality instead of a mere correlation.====Furthermore, I examine the mechanisms by testing the heterogeneity of the imprint effect of city secretaries' early experiences. I find that the imprint effect diminishes in the counties that are officially categorized as impoverished by the Chinese government and among the families living below Chinese poverty line. In both cases, the political pressure of poverty reduction imposed by the central government offsets the role of local leaders' willingness to fight poverty. The varying imprint effects suggest that the early-life poverty experiences of local leaders increase their willingness, rather than ability, to participate in the anti-poverty campaign.====This paper makes contributions in three ways. First, it adds to a large body of literature on poverty reduction and political economy. Previous studies have examined various determinants of poverty reduction from the perspectives of education (e.g., ====; ====), government policies (e.g., ====, ====; ====; ====), and others. By incorporating imprinting theory into a political¨Ceconomic framework, this paper uncovers a new determinant of poverty reduction (i.e., the early-life poverty experiences of local political leaders) and provides an alternative explanation for the variations in the policy enforcement by local governments besides the career concerns of local leaders.====Second, this paper adds to a long-standing discussion on the extent to which political leaders can affect economic outcomes. Determinism theory in sociological studies claims that political leaders are irrelevant to societal development paths because individuals make similar choices when presented with the same structural conditions. Despite their great power, political leaders must make decisions by choosing between a predetermined set of choices (====; ====; ====; ====; La ====, ====; ====). However, not all studies support the decisive role of institutions in economic outcomes (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Recent empirical studies find significant leader effects on economic growth in autonomous settings (e.g., ====; ====). Unlike the majority of studies, which primarily focus on GDP per capita or GDP growth rate, this paper investigates the leader effect on poverty reduction.====Third, this paper contributes to a growing body of literature that investigates how people's behaviors are shaped by their experiences. Some studies focus on the early experiences of firm managers (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), whereas others focus on their adulthood experiences, such as military experience (====) and piloting experience (====; ====). On a more related point, using the General Social Survey data, ==== find that individuals growing up in a recession tend to support more government redistribution. However, few studies consider the experiences of local political leaders. Due to the incompleteness of the political contracts between the central and local governments, local leaders should be viewed as heterogeneous agents that can instill their personal preferences into their economic decisions. Given that political leaders have far more influence than firm managers, the imprint effect exerted by them should receive considerable attention in both academic studies and policy research.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the institutional background in China. In ====, I present data and variables. In ====, I investigate the imprint effect of local political leaders' early-life poverty experiences on the income of the poor. In ====, I examine the mechanisms through which the imprinted local leaders increase the incomes of poor families in their jurisdictions. ==== concludes the paper.",Born to be different: The role of local political leaders in poverty reduction in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2300024X,15-Feb-23,2023,Research Article,53

Assortative matching between workers and firms could be the complements or substitutes in production (====). However, few existing studies have explored the relationship between different types of signals, nor have they determined the threshold required for such signals to work. In this paper, by conducting a field experiment, we investigate the relationship between the signal of student leadership experience, and other signals that represent personal qualities on resumes, and those that reflect vacancy-related qualities on job advertisements. We also explore the threshold value of student leadership experience that affects results in the job market.====The annual election of student leaders is an important event on campus, especially for students. Moreover, student leadership experience is probably one of the most valuable college experiences (e.g., internship and volunteering experience) for students¡ªsecond only to learning activities. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the role of student leadership experience in job matching can help students better prepare for a highly competitive job market. Leadership activities may have a positive impact on academic performance, resource access, and psychological qualities, such as risk-taking, auto-excitation, and emotional-management (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Furthermore, leaders can have an important influence on the performance of organizations, local communities, and even entire countries, such as in investment, financing, and innovation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Additionally, studies have documented that individuals with leadership experience have higher incomes than those without such experience in developed countries, such as the U.S. and Sweden (====; ====).====This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, we extend the research on student leadership experience in four aspects: We are the first to investigate the causal effect of leadership experience on the labor market performance through field experiments. Second, by examining the different effects of various types of leadership positions (e.g., class monitor and student-union minister) on job accessibility, we explore the threshold for student leaders to obtain a premium in the labor market. Third, by comparing the impact of student leadership experiences in different majors (e.g., economics and management vs. science and engineering) on job matching, we provide guidance on leader training in different majors. Finally, compared with previous literature, which mainly considered the correlation between student leadership experience and income in Western culture and developed countries, such as the U.S., we investigate the relationship between student leadership experience and the job accessibility in Eastern culture and developing countries, such as China.====Second, our study enriches the literature on job matching, especially in the entry-level labor market. Although there is a substantial body of literature on how personal qualities influence job matching (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), few studies have discussed how to effectively combine the different types of information on a resume to improve the efficiency of matching. Our study addresses this research gap by showing that student leadership experience is a key complement or substitute with respect to other signals reflecting personal qualities on resumes or vacancy-related qualities on job advertisements.====Using a field experiment,==== in which we randomly distribute realistic graduate resumes of applicants with the same qualities but differentiated by student leadership experiences (¡°identical triplet CVs¡±) to real vacancies through recruiting websites, we thoroughly investigate the effect of student leadership experience on job accessibility in China. We obtained the following findings. First, in terms of signals on resumes, there is no statistically significant causal effect of student leadership experience in college on job accessibility for economics and management majors; student leadership experience complements personal qualities for individuals majoring in science and engineering. Second, in terms of signals on job advertisements, student leadership experience is a complementary factor in small firms. Third, individuals with high-level student leadership experiences (e.g., student-union minister) are more likely to achieve a premium in the labor market than those with low-level student leadership experiences (e.g., class monitor), and school-level student leader positions seem to be the threshold level for achieving leadership experience premiums in the labor market. Finally, the leadership experience premium correlates with variance in pay (i.e., the ratio of upper bound to lower bound), not the pay level (i.e., the lower bound, upper bound, and median of monthly salary and non-salary benefits).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The impact of income inequality on out-of-school expenditures is significant at intensive and extensive margins, especially for study-related tutoring participation. Furthermore, we find some empirical evidence suggesting that in response to rising inequality, mothers spend more time on children¡¯s education and there exists a substitution effect between time and money. Further analysis suggests two potential reasons for the rising education spending: (1) a higher income inequality resulting from rising skill premium strengthens parents¡¯ long-lasting cultural attitude towards education to higher levels, inducing them to spend more on educational investment, and (2) a higher income inequality increases the value of higher education, leading to a stronger demand for better educational opportunities, and then, more intense education competition, forcing parents to invest more in education.","In recent decades, household expenditures on children¡¯s education have increased dramatically in China. From 2010 to 2018, the total educational expenditures per child increased by around 30 percent from 2,900 to 3,710 RMB, with most of the rise being accounted for by out-of-school expenditures, increasing from 280 to 1,050 RMB (====). This rapid rise in family educational expenditures has drawn widespread attention in Chinese society. Excessive tutoring activities after school impose a burden on students, both physically and psychologically. Meanwhile, off-campus tutoring translates into heavy financial burdens for parents. In response to the nationwide concern about this issue, China¡¯s Ministry of Education launched a set of ¡°double reduction¡± policies in July 2021, which imposed a ban on off-campus tutoring, mainly for children at the compulsory education stage or younger.==== Although there is an ongoing debate concerning the effectiveness of the policies, it is important to investigate the underlying reasons for the mounting family educational expenditures.==== One may expect there to be a relationship between income inequality and household educational expenditures. ====, ====). Evidence has also been found for increasing wage premium for skilled workers, which establishes the importance of SBTC in deriving income inequality in China via the lens of China¡¯s success in attracting foreign direct investment (====, ====) and capital-biased technological changes (====). That said, parents are likely to take income inequality as a proxy of skill premium, and one may expect that rising income inequality might induce parents to value education attainment more, and thus, invest more in their children¡¯s education in the hope of improving their educational opportunities and boosting competitiveness in the future labor market.====We investigate our research questions using a biannual household dataset from the China Family Panel Studies (==== CFPS) from 2010 to 2018. The children¡¯s module in the CFPS data contains rich information on family expenditures on in-school and out-of-school education for each child aged between 1 and 15?years old. In addition, the CFPS data provides non-pecuniary information regarding children¡¯s education, such as parents¡¯ expectations about their children¡¯s educational attainment, and parents¡¯ and children¡¯s time spent on tutoring activities. The detailed information enables us to conduct rigorous empirical analyses that provide novel and interesting insights into the effect of income inequality on educational expenditures.====Our estimation results derived from the CFPS data suggest that income inequality has a significant and positive effect on children¡¯s educational expenditures. In the baseline specification, income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient of the annual family net income per capita within a reference province-cohort group (i.e., families in the same province and with household heads in the same cohort), as defined in ====, ====. We find that a one-percentage-point rise in the Gini, on average, increases a family¡¯s expenditure on a child¡¯s education by 5.4 percent. Given that households¡¯ annual educational expenditure per child averages approximately 3,426 RMB, our result indicates an increase in the educational expenditure by approximately 184?RMB.==== and ==== margins. In particular, a one-percentage-point rise in the Gini coefficient significantly increases the out-of-school spending by 4.1 percent (around 38?RMB); at the ==== margin, while the same change in the Gini increases the likelihood of engaging in study-related tutoring programs by 2.1 percentage points. In sharp contrast, the effect on talent-related tutoring programs is insignificant and smaller in magnitude.====Our main results are robust to different measures of income inequality and alternative model specifications used to address the omitted variable biases. Specifically, we use city-year fixed effects and county-year fixed effects models to control for local market condition, employ family and child fixed effects to capture time-invariant features, and apply Emily Oster¡¯s method to address the issue of selection on unobservables. In addition, by using different measures of income inequality, we find that parents are not sensitive to the tails of the income distribution but rather care more about the inequality of mid-income distribution. More importantly, parents seem to be more concerned about their children falling into the poor class as opposed to climbing up to the top class.====We also explore how income inequality affects the allocation of household monetary and non-monetary resources. Our results suggest that rising inequality induces households to allocate more family pecuniary resources to education as opposed to other expenditure categories (i.e., clothes and social activities), leading to a compositional shift towards education spending in family expenditures and income. With respect to impacts on time allocation, we find that mothers spend more time on tutoring children in reaction to an increase in the income inequality, while such an effect is muted for fathers, indicating that mothers seem to play a leading role in educational childcare, which squares well with the findings in some recent studies (====, ====, ====). In addition, some evidence is found in support of a possible substitution effect between time and money. In the face of a higher income inequality, although all families value education more, the adjustment of education-related behavior differs greatly across income groups; that is, the families from the high-income class tend to purchase tutoring services available on the market, while the low-income families rely more on increasing the mother¡¯s own time on tutoring children.====Further analysis explores two potential explanations for the positive effect of income inequality on household educational expenditures. The first is related to the long-lasting cultural attitude towards education. Intuitively, a higher income inequality resulting from rising skill premium likely strengthens parents¡¯ cultural view of education to even higher levels, inducing them to invest voluntarily more in children¡¯s education. The second explanation is the intense education competition observed in China. A rising income inequality also likely increases the value of higher education, giving rise to a stronger demand for better educational opportunities among parents, and thus, fiercer education competition. Hence, parents are pressured to invest more in children¡¯s education. We find empirical evidences supporting these explanations. The results show that the impacts of rising income inequality on household educational expenditures are higher in areas where Confucian philosophy takes a deeper root, and higher among families where mothers are well educated. Meanwhile, the impacts are more pronounced among families living in areas with higher competition of college enrollment and among children who are close to entrance examinations at different education stages.====In our view, these findings make interesting and important contributions to the literature. ====, we contribute to the set of studies on the determinants of household educational expenditures. Most existing studies focus on the micro-level determinants of education spending, such as household and parental characteristics. Our paper attempts to examine the link between macro-level income distribution and household educational expenditures for young children. This connection is largely missing in the literature, and especially in the Chinese context, which features rapidly increasing income inequality in the past two decades.====, different from some recent works that focus on some particular part of inequality, such as inequality of opportunities in ====, gender inequality in ====, we consider all determinants of income inequality, and examine the impacts of overall inequality of income. This allows us to explore the different mechanisms underlying the rising household education spending. The two channels discussed in this paper, cultural attitude towards education and education competition, are particularly relevant for China, ¡°a transition economy that emphasizes the economic incentives, but lack of market means for allocating resources, and redistribution function for the government¡± (====). In addition, our finding are consistent with the seminal paper of ====, which explores the underlying reason of helicopter parenting style.==== Our work echoes their results by exploring parents¡¯ behavior in terms of educational investment, which serves as an important way to increase children¡¯s prospects.==== our work also provides a rich picture of how income inequality shapes overall educational expenditures, its various components, and the time spent on educational tutoring. The empirical evidence suggests that income inequality plays an important role in driving the rising trend of out-of-school expenditures at both the ==== and ==== margins, which advances our understanding of the mounting household educational expenditures observed in China.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section ==== proposes two possible hypotheses based on related theoretical predictions. In particular, a brief description of the cultural norms concerning education and the key features of the Chinese education system is provided. Section ==== reviews the literature on educational expenditures. Section ==== lays out the empirical model and Section ==== describes the data.

This study assesses the impact of the Chinese agricultural training program on farmers' productivity and income using ex-post non-experimental data from Ogun State, Nigeria. Our empirical approach is based on marginal ====. We find that the returns for individuals who participated in Chinese agricultural technology training indicated a 68.5% increase in yield and a 45.3% increase in agricultural income. Furthermore, we show that the program targets farmers from advantaged backgrounds, who may benefit less from attending the program than disadvantaged farmers, who experience a lower incentive to participate. Finally, we suggest sufficient awareness and incentives to encourage highly resistant farmers to participate in such programmes.","Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries face the enormous challenge of persistently low yields in agricultural productivity indices compared with other regions of the world. Technological differences in agricultural technology adoption account for this major divergence in agricultural productivity (====; ====; ====; ====). Thus, agricultural technology development is generally considered an effective means to close this gap. To this end, international development partners have initiated several agricultural technologies and investment programs geared toward improving agricultural productivity in SSA. Statistics for 2020 show that five major traditional donors (the USA, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan) have invested $1.29 billion in African agriculture (====). Similarly, by the end of 2020, one of the emerging donors, China, has invested 1.11 billion in the agricultural sector in 35 African countries (====). Thus, the scale and scope of Chinese agricultural investment in Africa rank highest among donors globally (====; ====; ====; ====). Most international interventions focus on extension services, including training programs, to facilitate the adoption of technologies that would improve agricultural productivity.====Previous studies have demonstrated that international interventions have significantly increased crop yields and farmers' welfare in recipient African countries. For example, ==== reported that the USA training program increased crop yield by 20%. Similarly, ==== found that the Japanese agricultural technology training program positively affected farming household yields and income in Africa. Similarly, German agricultural technical and vocational education and training for farmers and other stakeholders in the agri-food value chain have increased African agricultural productivity (====; ====; ====).====The current debate in contemporary literature on Chinese agricultural technical assistance in Africa has drawn increased attention to whether Africa benefits from such assistance. Several researchers claimed that China uses development programs to obtain political benefits, such as creating alliances with the leaders of African countries to secure undemocratic regimes to gain access to their natural resources, rather than economic development (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== critiqued earlier viewpoints, claiming that the argument is biased in interpreting China-Africa cooperation. Unfortunately, few attempts have been made to empirically document the impact of China's agricultural technical assistance or investment in Africa. Implementers often question what, where, and how Chinese agricultural assistance in Africa should be applied. We agree that fundamental research is vital to answering these questions.====This study uses household survey data to address two important questions. First, does Chinese agricultural technology increase SSA's crop yield and farmers' income? Chinese agricultural technology training programmes may be similar to other development partners. That is, it might increase crop yield and farmers' income. However, if the major objective of Chinese programmes is political, their impact may be trivial or insignificant.====Second, we investigate whether Chinese agricultural technology training programs targeted the farmers who benefited the most. Unlike previous studies on the average treatment effect (====; ====), we aimed to understand which farmers benefit more from the Chinese agricultural technology transfer program. Specifically, we use the marginal treatment effect (MTE) methodology developed by ==== and generalized by ====, ====, ====. This methodology links treatment effect heterogeneity to both observed and unobserved characteristics in the propensity for the program. This framework provides a more comprehensive picture of the heterogeneity effect than the conventional instrumental variable (IV) analysis, which is typically adopted in the literature.====Similar to other traditional donors, we find that the return for individuals who participate in Chinese agricultural technology training indicates a 68.5% increase in yield and a 45.3% increase in income. However, we also find substantial heterogeneity in returns to training with respect to both observed and unobserved characteristics. In addition, it should be noted that the program targets farmers from advantaged backgrounds, who may benefit less from attending the program than disadvantaged farmers who experience a lower incentive to participate.====This study focuses on Nigeria for several reasons. First, Nigeria's agricultural development has stagnated since it discovered oil in the 1970s. The effect of this dependence on oil resources has been the crowding out of the non-oil sector, particularly in agriculture, which saw its share of gross domestic product (GDP) falling from 41% to 21% from 1970 to 2018 (====; ====; ====). China is the world's largest producer of rice (====). Therefore, adopting Chinese agricultural technologies may improve rice production in Nigeria, where rice self-sufficiency is a priority. Nigeria is the most populous African country. As of 2021, the country has >200 million individuals, accounting for 20% of the African population (====). Lastly, the country has abundant land and water resources ideal for further agricultural exploitation (====; ====).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== outlines the empirical framework and methods for estimating the marginal returns to yield and agricultural income. ==== presents and discusses the results. Finally, ==== concludes the paper.====In supporting Nigeria to overcome the challenges facing its agricultural sector, the Chinese government provides support under the FAO-Nigeria-China South-South Cooperation project (====; ====). This project was in line with the principal focus of the China-Africa agricultural modernization plan ¨C one of China's ten major cooperation plans with Africa. This training project aims to support Nigeria's National Food Security Program and strengthen farmers' capacity by introducing sustainable agricultural practices that have been widely adopted in China (====). The programme was implemented in several phases. The previous phase was nationwide, supporting forestry, aquaculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, and crop intensification (====). As a result of the success of the previous phase of the program, the project established regional multiservice extension centers (REMSECs). REMSECs are designed to reach more beneficiaries in a particular region using specific technologies (====). For example, REMSEC in the southwestern zone of the country focuses on rice production, cage-fish production, and improving water management in rice fields.====The project training sites were local government area (LGA) secretariats very close to the Ogun-Guangdong Free Trade Zone, where the extension agents from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Cooperatives regularly have meetings. The training site selection was motivated to integrate the farmers into the industrial zone because there is an agricultural section of the trade zone; this will facilitate their access to inputs and ease of selling their produce (====; ====). The LGA secretariats were an easy place for farmers to converge.====The training lasted for six months during agricultural activities in 2017. The training was conducted fortnightly, with the extension agent and subject matter specialists (Chinese experts) providing technical support to farmers. During the training, farmers were taught agricultural practices related to irrigation, planting, and soil improvement, which are widely adopted in China.==== The contents taught in each session were simplified, and training was provided just before the cultivation practices were implemented in the field, which allowed for optional learning and effective application (====). In addition, training modules, charts, and reading aids are provided to facilitate farmers' understanding (====). The project did not provide any input support to the farmers; it was basically technical training on adopting Chinese agricultural technologies in the country. The training was characterized as on-the-job training in the field, and since it did not require much time, training participation was highly intense (====). The contents taught in each session were simplified, and training was provided just before the cultivation practices were implemented in the field, which allowed for optional learning and effective application (====).====To encourage farmers to participate in the training program, a transport allowance ($3 equivalent) and launch meals were provided to trainees.==== Considering these few incentives, some farmers who live far away from the training centers may not participate in the training because of unobservable characteristics, such as the barrier of the training distance to households. The training distance barrier, such as bad road networks, can act as a disincentive for farmers who cannot easily travel to the training center (====). However, some farmers without such barriers who live close to the training centers could take advantage of these few incentives to participate in the training (====).",Marginal returns on Chinese agricultural technology transfer in Nigeria: Who benefits more?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000202,6-Feb-23,2023,Research Article,56

The results show that an additional year of schooling lowered the number of children a woman would have by approximately 0.09 children, postponed the age of first childbirth by 0.7?years, and reduced the probability of having a second child or more children by 0.18 among those mothers whose first child was a girl. In addition to the income effect, these results are also partly explained by more educated women preferring quality to quantity of children, placing a greater value on leisure and no longer perceiving children as the sole focus in their lives.","China has experienced a dramatic and consistent fertility decline since the beginning of the 1970s, which was noted as China's demographic transition (====), and this trend was accelerated by the country's family planning policy.==== According to the World Bank, the total fertility rate (TFR) dropped from more than six in the 1960s to approximately 2.5 in the late 1970s, then fell below the replacement rate in the early 1990s, and has remained at approximately 1.6 since the 2000s.====There are two strands of literature on the explanation of the fertility decline in China. One attributes the decline of the fertility rate to the intervention of family planning policy (see ==== for a review). Another emphasizes the essential role of socioeconomic factors, such as education improvement and urbanization (====; ====).====This paper is closely related to the second strand of research, and we are interested in estimating the causal effect of women's education on their fertility behavior, such as fertility number, the timing of childbirth and marriage, using the exposure to the CELC as an ====.====We find that an additional year of schooling lowered the number of children a woman would have by approximately 0.09 children, postponed the age of first childbirth by 0.7?years, and reduced the probability of having a second child or more children by 0.18 among those mothers whose first child was a girl.====Then we explore channels from increased women's education to the decline of the fertility rate. We go beyond the existing literature which mainly attributed the fertility decline to the rising opportunity costs associated with the improved educational level, and show that in addition to the income channel, education-induced value shift, ==== more educated women preferring quality to quantity of children, placing a greater value on leisure, and no longer perceiving children as the sole focus in their lives, has also played an important role.====First, we investigate women's income and labor market participation as channels driving fertility decline. In a recent review paper (====), they concluded that the focus on traditional negative relationships between income and fertility as well as labor supply and fertility has changed. Theoretical models (====; ====) and empirical evidence (====) show that the relationship between income and fertility rate does not necessarily always negative.====Indeed, we find a U shape of women's income on the fertility rate, which suggests that the impact of the income channel could be either positive or negative depending on the quantile of income.====Second, we investigate the role of social norms, such as preference for children (====, ====; ====), on fertility rate, as highlighted by ==== that social norms are among the key determinants of fertility behavior. We are among the first ones to empirically examine whether more education leads to different preferences on the quality and quantity of children and the implication of this preference shift on fertility.====Our results suggest that women with more education prefer the quality to the quantity of children: better-educated women spend more on children's education, and care more about children's education, ====. Moreover, women with more education tend to report a smaller ideal number of children and are less likely to regard children as the sole focus of their lives. The role of preference shifts on the fertility rate could partly explain why an increase in the total fertility rate is not observed even after the Chinese two- and three-child policy.====Our study complements the existing literature in several ways. The previous studies using compulsory schooling laws as instrumental variables are mostly on developed countries; our study is among the few to focus on a developing country.====One study which is also on China and worth noting is ====, which found a positive relationship between women's education and fertility rate using the college expansion in the 1990s in China. Our study mainly differs from ==== in the source of exogenous variation in education and the results. In China throughout the 1990s, only 1% to 3.5% of the population has a higher education. In contrast, our exogenous shock is the CELC, which requires a 9-year compulsory schooling for school-age children, including 6?years of primary school and 3?years of junior high school. The CELC was enacted in 1986 but implemented between 1986 and 1991 in different provinces, which allows us to exploit both within birth cohort and within birth region variations in years of schooling. In the 1980s, >70% of the Chinese population did not complete junior high school. Using CELC as an exogenous shock, we reach different conclusions, and our results apply to the broader population.====This paper also enriches the policy evaluation literature on the CELC in China. Previous studies have exploited the CELC to examine the effect of education on health and cognition (====), the outcomes of the next generation (====), and the effect on parents (====). The dimension of fertility behavior is still unexplored.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses theories and channels on education and fertility, and introduces the institutional background. ==== presents the data set, describes variables, and outlines the empirical strategy. ==== reports the main empirical findings. ==== is on channels and mechanisms. ==== concludes the paper.",Women's education and fertility in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000214,3-Feb-23,2023,Research Article,57

As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, extensive and effective green transformation is necessary (====).====While enterprise development is still important, China must find a way to balance economic concerns with environmental protections (====; ====; ====). Green technology innovation helps enterprises to reduce emissions while enhancing their social reputation at the same time (====; ====). Though this may seem like a win-win situation, green technology innovation requires enormous capital and patience for a long investment cycle. These factors often result in enterprises losing the motivation to forge through with their green technology innovations. Therefore, more incentives are needed to promote enterprise green technology innovation (====; ====).====Institutional innovation based on incentives can stimulate the innovation potential of enterprises (====; ====). Most scholars believe that environmental regulation can promote enterprises' green technology innovation. Reasonable environmental regulation can enhance enterprises' innovation ability by creating a compensation effect. Pareto improvement occurs with both environmental and economic effects (====; ====).====). When the carbon trading market is more active, the CTS plays a more significant role in promoting enterprises' green technology innovation (====). Because of the complexity of China's emissions reduction system, coordination difficulties exist in different government departments and enterprises. Therefore, CTS is difficult to form an innovation compensation effect (====). The ¡°signal-expectation¡± mechanism of the CTS for green technology innovation exists. However, the policy effects in each pilot area are different (====).====Due to the difficulty of data acquisition and the limitations of methods, it is hard to extract the net impact of CTS. Therefore, there are few studies on the interactions between CTS, stakeholder concerns of ==== and innovation incentive policies. For the first time, this study investigates the combined effects of CTS, stakeholder concerns and innovation incentive policies on enterprises' green technology innovation.====CTS rarely works alone. The opinions and attitudes of stakeholders toward environmental issues could influence the impact of CTS on an enterprise's green technology innovation. Government sectors and enterprises are the two main stakeholders. In order to represent government concerns, this study counts the words related to carbon in the annual government reports. Using text mining, this study calculates the word frequency of carbon. Also, we calculate ==== cost per unit of industrial added value to represent the intensity of the government concerns. Environmental Information Disclosure (EID) is used to represent enterprise concerns. Paralleled to stakeholder concerns, innovation policies are universally used in concert with the CTS. Stakeholder concerns about the environment and policies' implementation should be both efficient and equitable to enterprises' green technology innovation. How should the stakeholder concerns and innovation incentive policies cooperate with the CTS to better stimulate the green technology innovation of enterprises? To answer this critical question, we research the optimization of the different concerns and mixed policies under China's carbon trading.====Three main findings of the study are as follows: First, the primary thing this study will do is investigate a three-dimensional system of green technology innovation (green output level, green output proportion and green total factor productivity). It clarifies the ¡°black box¡± of green innovation of enterprises under the CTS. The impacts of carbon trading are various for different dimensions of green technology innovation.====Second, this study further investigates the combined effects of CTS and stakeholder concerns. It suggests that different government concerns of decarbonization with CTS have uncertain impacts on the green technology innovation output, green output proportion and green total factor productivity. However, enterprises' high-level concerns with CTS have positive effects on green technology output and the proportion of green innovation output.====Third, we find that when the three innovation incentive policies are combined with CTS, there is a positive effect on the enterprises' green technology innovation. Tax return works better than fiscal subsidy and R&D funding. Fiscal subsidy and R&D funding mainly improve enterprises' green technology output, while ==== return, a post-tax incentive policy, positively affects all three dimensions of green technology innovation.

We find that the competition from Big Tech worsens the performance of branches facing stronger Big Tech competition by reducing the number of borrowers and the amount of loans.

Our results document novel changes in and responses of the non-bank traditional lending business in the Big Tech era.","). One important group of major FinTech lenders is large technology companies, dubbed ¡°Big Techs¡±, with their credit businesses estimated to exceed one trillion dollars in 2023 (====In this paper, we focus on the impact of Big Tech on non-bank traditional lenders, using loan-level data from a car equity loan company with national branches in China. Unlike banks, non-bank lenders do not take deposits, thus facing higher funding costs and finding their niche in serving a riskier clientele that may have been rejected by banks. Thus, these non-bank traditional lenders often serve borrowers with higher credit risks than those served by banks and therefore face more direct competition from Big Tech lending.====Our empirical methodology exploits geographical differences in the penetration ratios of Big Tech lending and the opening time differences of the loan company's branches. To account for the learning-by-doing effect after a branch's opening, we construct a relative month measure to convert calendar months into branch-specific months relative to each branch's opening month. We evaluate each branch's dynamic performance since its opening month and compare the differences between branches in cities with high penetration ratios of Big Tech credit and those in cities with low penetration ratios. Our estimates thus capture the differences between branches at the same development stage but with different intensities of Big Tech competition.====We expect borrowers in cities with higher penetration ratios of Big Tech credit to be more likely to borrow from Big Techs, which reduces the attractiveness of traditional loans. Interestingly, our ordinary least squares (OLS) results show that branches in cities with higher Big Tech credit penetration originate more loans in terms of the number of transactions and the total loan amount in a given relative month, indicating a positive correlation between Big Tech lending and traditional lending. One major caveat is that our OLS estimates are subject to endogeneity; for instance, we may omit variables that affect both the Big Tech credit penetration and the performance of local branches of the traditional lending company, such as the time-varying ==== of different cities.====To address potential endogeneity, we use two ==== (IVs): the great- circle distance to Hangzhou city, the Big Tech's headquarter, and the penetration ratios of Big Tech payment services, which serve as a basis for Big Tech's lending businesses but do not directly compete with traditional lenders. Our IV estimates show that larger Big Tech credit penetration reduces the number of loans originated by the traditional lender, consistent with our hypothesis that Big Tech credit relaxes households' borrowing constraints and weakens traditional lenders' competitiveness in the lending market. While we do not find evidence that Big Tech competition induces local branches to lower the collateral requirement (measured by the average price of collateral per loan), we do find a reduction in the total collateral values, corroborating our argument that branches facing more intense Big Tech competition experience a reduction in the number of loans originated.====Furthermore, the non-bank traditional lender responds to Big Tech competition by holding higher lending standards. Specifically, branches in cities highly penetrated by Big Tech credit approve fewer amount loans per unit collateral value (defined as the loan-to-value ratios), implying a more prudent attitude towards qualified borrowers. We argue that this cautiousness in lending reflects traditional lenders' concern about ¡°cream-skimming¡± in the loan market by Big Techs, which may use more advanced FinTech to screen borrowers and ¡°cherry pick¡± from the shared application pools. We also find that the increase in the lending standards pays off: branches facing fiercer Big Tech competition do not experience higher default rates, indicating the success of risk-control measures through lower LTV ratios.====Our paper contributes to several strands of the literature. First, our paper enriches the Big Tech credit literature by providing novel evidence of its impact on small- and medium- sized traditional lenders. Recently, there has been a burgeoning literature on Big Tech credit (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For instance, ==== examines two advantages of Big Techs compared to traditional banks: better information and better enforcement of credit repayment. ==== shows that Big Tech credit does not correlate with local housing prices but reacts strongly to changes in firm characteristics, thus reducing the importance of the collateral channel while introducing new volatilities. ==== also holds similar opinions that Big Tech firms appear to have an edge over banks in both information-related and communication-related functions, especially for retail banking, with may lead to vertical disintegration of financial value chains. ====Second, we expand the research scope of FinTech and Big Tech lending by examining the impact on non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), whose clientele is more exposed to FinTech lending than is the clientele of banks. An abundant literature has documented FinTech lenders' disruptive impact on traditional banks (====; ====). Several papers also provide evidence that FinTech may complement traditional lending by targeting riskier borrowers and smaller-sized loans and through regulatory arbitrage (====; ====; ====). In addition, ==== finds that FinTech lenders may improve SMEs' credit access to banks by alleviating their collateral constraints, through their provision of unsecured lending. While previous studies focus on the relationship between FinTech lenders and traditional banks, we investigate the impact of FinTech and Big Tech lending on non-bank lenders, which do not take deposits and hence face higher funding costs and less strict regulations than those faced by banks. As a result, their clientele is of higher risk than that of banks and therefore is more exposed to FinTech competition, as FinTech lenders usually start by lending to unbanked borrowers. Adding to the existing literature, we show that non-bank traditional lenders experience a decline in the lending business. Our analysis of non-bank traditional lenders thus complements existing literature on the disruptive impact of FinTech lending on banks.====, where lenders find it optimal to not raise interest rates due to adverse selection and moral hazard concerns under asymmetric information.====Our paper proceeds as follows: ==== summarizes the institutional background of traditional and FinTech lending in China and describes the business details of the loan company in our sample. ==== details the data and presents our empirical methodology.

There is an average gap of 94?k tonnes in CO====Our research is connected to a large body of literature. Numerous studies have examined the economic effects of the Belt and Road Initiative, with the majority considering that trade and investment are its two primary economic objectives (====; ====). The method of difference-in-differences (DID) estimation is widely used in studies on the effect of the Belt and Road Initiative on exports, and the conclusions vary depending on the selected control groups (====; ====; ====). These scholars regard the Belt and Road Initiative as a quasi-experiment, and usually estimate the impact of the Initiative on the volume of trade, while the direct impact on the structural change of the trade remains unclear. For example, ==== find that the BRI policy have no significant effect on the volume of trade at the aggregate level, and the net growth of China's exports to the BRI countries was concentrated in pollution-intensive and resource-intensive industries. In their study, 58 BRI countries and 116 non-BRI countries are involved, and the method of DID is used. Different from ====, ==== only selects the world's top 30 trading countries as control group in their DID model, finding that China's export potential to the Belt and Road countries rose significantly after the initiative began, especially for exports of products in capital intensive industries. Other related studies include ==== and ====.====With respect to investment, the literature focuses on the influence of the Belt and Road Initiative on China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI), with empirical analyses using different types of data (country-level data: ====; sector-level data: ====; firm-level data: ====; ====; ====). The literature focuses on two types of OFDI¡ªgreenfield investment (====) and mergers & acquisitions (M&A, ====With environmental issues receiving increased attention, the environmental effect of the Belt and Road Initiative also has been widely discussed. As trade connection is an important element of the Belt and Road Initiative, there is an important body of literature that focuses on the embodied carbon emissions of trade in Belt and Road countries, most of them are usually based on multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis (====). The MRIO method relies heavily on the input-output (I-O) tables, and the results are usually sensitive to the structure and precision of I-O tables. Among the frequently used worldwide I-O tables dataset, the Eora dataset provides the most complete I-O tables so far.==== The Eora dataset provides a time series (1991¨C2015) of disaggregated I-O tables with environmental accounts for 190 countries, but there are a large number of missing values in year 2015. Due to the limitations with I-O tables, the existing studies using the MRIO method are often based on one single year's data (====; ====), or only focus on the BRI countries without any comparisons between the BRI countries and the others (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====In addition to the aforementioned studies of the embodied carbon emissions of trade, some other scholars are concerned about the effect of changes in investment on carbon emissions in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative. These studies focus on green infrastructure investment (====), renewable energy investment (====), and Chinese OFDI in the energy sector (====), concluding that the increase in green investment in the context of the Belt and Road has decreased the carbon emissions of the host country. With a few exceptions, ==== find that foreign direct investment led to the increase in carbon emissions based on panel data of 65 countries from 1985 to 2017. Owing to the different types of investment, the changes in investment under the Belt and Road and its impact on the climate and environment need to be further examined.====In summary, most studies focus on the effect of BRI on exports, despite the heterogeneous across sectors are mentioned, there is rare research directly discuss the structural change of exports caused by the BRI policy. Moreover, these studies usually regard the proposal of the Belt and Road Initiative as a quasi-experiment, omitting the obvious selection bias of the BRI countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This becomes a concern as it is highly unlikely that the formation of the BRI partnership was random. In fact, the Chinese government may have selected the BRI countries based on its political and economic agenda. Without addressing this potential threat to the estimation, the usual DID estimates are likely to be biased. ====Meanwhile, with respect to the environmental effect of the BRI policy, due to method and data limitations, the gap in carbon missions between BRI and non-BRI countries is rarely discussed, which deserves further discussion. Additionally, most of the existing studies have focused on the environmental impact of the BRI policy on the BRI countries other than China (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Our research contributes to the existing literature in several aspects. First, we focus on the economic and environmental impact of the Initiative on China itself. Specifically, we not only assess the impact of the Belt and Road Initiative on the scale of exports, but also emphasize its impact on the structure of China's exports from the climate change perspective. In addition, we analyze the mechanisms (CIPC and OFDI) behind the policy effect of the BRI on China's export structure, offering new findings to the literature.====Second, we estimate the CO==== emissions induced by China's exports to the BRI countries and NBRI countries for the extended period between 2009 and 2016. Unlike the studies based on MRIO analysis, this study uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index model to decompose the change of CO==== emissions into three effects, and quantify the contributions of each factor in two periods (before and after the Belt and Road Initiative) separately. Moreover, the sources of the gap between the two groups are discussed.====Third, we propose a novel instrumental variable to deal with the endogeneity problem. Specifically, we construct a dummy variable based on whether a country had any trade post along the historical ancient Silk Road routes to instrument the current BRI partner status. The rationale for this strategy is based on the notion that the instrument is correlated with the BRI membership but is also largely different from the latter and is pre-determined by a host of historical factors that are no longer relevant today. Thus, this strategy to some extent mitigates the selection concern.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. ==== presents the framework of the decomposition analysis, the data sources, and the decomposition results. ==== concludes and provides policy implications.","The Belt, the Road, and the carbon emissions in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000135,16-Jan-23,2023,Research Article,61

An additional analysis shows that the full text of MPRs can help predict future monetary policies on a longer time horizon.,"). In this context, the People's Bank of China (PBC) is no exception. Monetary policy communication has gradually developed as an important policy tool in China.====The mechanism and effectiveness of central bank communication have attracted great attention among researchers and policymakers.==== Consistency in words and deeds can ensure the credibility of the central bank's communication and thereby strengthen the policy effect. However, there are two empirical challenges in studying the PBC's behavior. The first concerns China's monetary policy framework. During the process of transforming from quantitative monetary policy to price-based policy, the PBC has a number of policy instruments, several intermediate targets, and multiple policy objectives. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively measure the PBC's interventions. Second, the PBC's communication is in Chinese, and there is no available scheme for measuring the sentiments in the PBC's communication text.====Therefore, we first apply the supervised learning procedure proposed by ====Our study relates to four strands of the literature on central bank communication. First, the impacts of central bank communication on the macroeconomy and financial markets have been widely considered and demonstrated by scholars (====; ====; ====; ====). Through effective communication, the central banks can adjust the public's expectations by making monetary policy, such as nominal interest rates, more predictable (====; ====). In this way, central banks can promote the stability of output and inflation. In addition, many empirical studies consider the impacts of central bank communication on financial markets. Not only forward guidance (====) and the tone of central bank communication (====; ====) but also other factors such as semantic similarity (====Second, it is necessary to study whether the words and deeds of the central bank are consistent, which is an important prerequisite for ensuring its own authority and credibility (====). Accurate and credible information has a greater impact on public expectations (====; ====). ==== verify the impact of central bank credibility on monetary policy effectiveness under an adaptive learning framework, and ====; ====; ====; ====) the U.S. (====; ====) and other developing countries, such as Turkey (====), Brazil (====), and Chile (====). For China, the diversity of monetary policy tools has increased the difficulty for the public to understand actual policy intentions, which has become a potential problem affecting the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore, consistency in the PBC's words and deeds is even more crucial for expectation management.====Third, our paper links to studies on how to measure central bank communication. Early research manually coded central bank communication with discrete values (====), but it neglected subtle and continuous changes in policy tendencies and suffered from a lack of replicability (====). With the introduction of the bag-of-words method (====), keyword-counting methods based on existing dictionaries, such as the Harvard Social Psychology Dictionary or the LM financial dictionary (====), have been widely used. However, as ==== point out, the dictionary method fails to capture all the dimensions and subtlety of central bank communication because these general dictionaries do not include concepts specific to central bank behavior. The supervised learning procedure proposed by ==== substantially enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information extraction by taking n-grams phrases into consideration. Meanwhile, the LDA model, one of the most popular unsupervised learning models, has been applied to measure the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) attitude toward economic situations (====) and information transparency (====). The supervised learning and unsupervised LDA model are applicable to different scenarios according to the text features. We discuss the choice of text analysis methodology later in the paper.====Fourth, the PBC's communication has attracted increasing attention due to the development of the Chinese economy. Similar to the central banks of developed countries, the PBC has increased its transparency and effectiveness through communication. As a result, the PBC's communication has a great impact on the financial market and real economic variables, such as market volatility, GDP and inflation. (====; ====; ====). However, as ====; ====). Therefore, to better manage the public's expectations, it is important for the PBC to release accurate information about the future policy path to the public, thereby improving monetary policy transparency.====In studying the consistency of the PBC's words and deeds, it is challenging to measure the ¡°words¡± scientifically and objectively. First, it is important to ensure that words precede deeds. Hence, we retain only the last section in each MPR titled ¡°Monetary Policy Outlook¡± (hereafter, the outlook section) as our dataset, see ==== for details. We adopt the supervised learning method of ==== to construct communication indices for its advantages, which determine the tone of each phrase by the term frequency summary statistics; see ==== for more details. This procedure takes the context of the phrases into consideration when determining their topics and tones. For example, the word ¡°low¡± indicates a dovish stance in the sentences about interest rate, while it implies a hawkish stance when it comes to money supply. We determine the tone of ¡°low¡± by the statistical method from ==== to avoid overly subjective determinations. Second, the supervised learning method allows us to construct communication indices of both monetary policy and economic outlook. Empirical studies have shown that while information about the monetary policy stance has significant effects, communication on the economic situation or other nonmonetary issues can have different effects (====; ====; ====). In addition, we also show that we can predict the PBC's policy better by analyzing the full text of MPRs, for which the LDA model works well.====This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, with the help of the supervised learning method, we construct monetary policy (MP) and economic outlook (EC) communication indices. The measurements are significantly correlated to actual policy intervention and economic indicators, showing that our work is successful in extracting information from the PBC communication on the two essential topics.====Second, we systematically study the PBC's consistency of words and deeds with the communication indices measured. In sum, we find that the outlook section of the MPRs has significant explanatory power for policy intervention in the next quarter. The PBC tends to adjust its policy intervention based on the guidance released in the previous quarterly MPRs. However, the communication indices from supervised learning do not have strong predictive power for policy intervention over a longer time horizon. With the help of the LDA topic model, we can substantially enhance the predictive power when we take the full text of MPRs into account.====Third, we find evidence for the progress of monetary policy communication in China by a time-varying regression model, and the PBC has the incentive to be more consistent in words and deeds under higher uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that consistency in the words and deeds of the PBC indeed effectively decreases the public's disagreement about inflation expectations. These works provide a novel supplement to the literature regarding the influencing factors and macroeconomic effects of central bank communication in China.====This paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the measurement in detail. ==== discusses the consistency of the words and deeds of the PBC via empirical studies. ==== presents further discussions, and ==== concludes.",Is the People's Bank of China consistent in words and deeds?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000044,9-Jan-23,2023,Research Article,62

By exploiting the unique situation in China that patenting firms for the first time obtained short-term patent-backed loans (PBLs), we find that the ==== access negatively influences firms' propensities of producing high-quality innovation. Consistent with the R&D resource reallocation hypothesis, we find that this negative effect exists only among firms initially having invention patents; it is more pronounced when the PBL covers a larger portion of firm investment and when these firms expand more aggressively. We confirm the scale expansion effect by finding that the PBL access positively influences firms' subsequent size.","Investment in innovation tends to fall below the optimal level as R&D firms are generally credit constrained (====; ====), such a practice of pledging patents is so far scarce in emerging economies and its potential consequences are yet to be explored. Taking advantage of the recent surge of patent pledge in China, one of the largest emerging economies, this paper is among the first to investigate how the ==== access to patent-backed loans (hereafter PBLs) influences innovative firms' subsequent investment decisions.====As an innovative firm becomes less financially constrained once getting access to PBLs, it seems reasonable to expect that the firm would invest more in R&D. However, the above argument ignores an important determinant¡ªthe loans' term to maturity (i.e., short-term or long-term loans). Theoretically, a firm is subject to refinancing risks when using short-term loans to fund long-term investment while such risks can be largely avoided when using long-term loans (====; ====). It is particularly so for R&D investment as banks are reluctant to renew the loan when firms invest in risky projects. Consequently, firms' propensity to invest in innovation tends to decrease and their propensity to expand the scale tends to increase when only short-term loans are available. However, it does not necessarily imply that R&D expenditures would decrease in value as total available funds have increased.====When running R&D projects, especially those targeting high-quality innovation, firms are faced with additional constraints, such as innovation capacity (e.g., managerial capacity and R&D personnel). When obtaining short-term PBLs, a firm's financial constraints are alleviated while its innovation capacity likely remains unchanged, at least in the short run. Scale expansion after obtaining short-term PBLs tends to divert a firm's innovation capacity away from high-quality innovation. Therefore, from the perspective of R&D-related resource reallocation, the output of high-quality innovation would decrease after firms obtain short-term PBLs. Nevertheless, it is ultimately an empirical question how the access to short-term PBLs influences a firm's high-quality innovation.====; ====). Our data confirm this regarding PBLs: there is an instant rise in only short-term debt but not long-term debt in the first year of a firm's access to PBLs. Consequently, the term of PBLs can be regarded as exogenous to individual firms other than being chosen according to firms' investment needs.====We employ a DID (difference-in-differences) approach to investigate how the ==== access to short-term PBLs influences firms' subsequent investment decisions. Our firm-level data come from the Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises (ASIE) conducted by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). We restrict our investigation to the period 2009¨C2013. Since firms with the PBL access are supposed to be substantially different from firms without, we employ a PSM-DID approach. Specifically, we analyze how firms' propensity to produce any high-quality innovation changes surrounding their PBL access by taking those firms without such an access but having similar access likelihood as the control group. To measure a firm's propensity to produce any high-quality innovation, we generate a dummy indicating whether the firm applies for (later being granted) any ==== in a given year or not. We count only invention patents because this type of patents is the most novel compared to the other two types of patents (i.e., utility-model and external-design) granted by the SIPO (State Intellectual Property Office of China). Additionally, we follow the literature (e.g., ====; ====) and generate another high-quality innovation dummy. In this case, among all invention patents in the same one-digit technology class that are filed in the same year, we only count a firm's invention patents that belong to the top 20% of the forward citation distribution.====The parallel pre-trends assumption is essential to the validity of the DID approach, which requires that there is no specific pre-trend in the treatment group compared to the control group. Our diagnostic tests show that this assumption is satisfied. By using a ==== framework, we find a negative and causal effect of the PBL access on the likelihood of a firm producing any high-quality innovation. Specifically, our regression results indicate that the PBL access leads to a 9.2% decrease in the probability of a firm having any invention patents and a 5.6% decrease in the probability of having any invention patents with top citations. It suggests that with the access to short-term PBLs, innovative firms become less likely to produce high-quality innovation.====To further mitigate the concern on reverse causality, we follow the approach of ==== and examine the dynamics of firms' innovation propensity surrounding the PBL access. We do not find a significant trend in either high-quality innovation dummy prior to the PBL access but a significant decrease after, indicating that it is the PBL access that caused firms' high-quality innovation propensity to reduce and not vice versa. Additionally, our placebo test suggests that our major result is unlikely driven by pure luck. We also use two dummies of having any low-quality innovation or not (i.e., having any utility-model patents or external-design patents) as the dependent variable and find the PBL access effect insignificant. Last, when the count of high-quality innovation is examined, the PBL access effect is also insignificant, indicating that the PBL access negatively influences firm innovation mainly at the extensive margin and not at the intensive margin.====We then attempt to identify two potential mechanisms through which the PBL access retards firms' high-quality innovation propensity, firm's innovation capacity and their financial constraints. Specifically, we examine how initially having any invention patents and firm size (a commonly used proxy for financial constraints) affect our results, respectively. Consistent with the R&D resource reallocation story, we find that the negative effect only exists among firms initially having innovation patents, which are supposed to have innovation capacity to reallocate in the first place. We also find that the negative effect exists both among small and large firms, suggesting that financial constraints exist in both types of firms. We further find that among firms initially having invention patents, the negative effect is more pronounced when the PBL can cover a larger portion of firm investment and when firms are expanding more aggressively. Our findings also suggest that firms in high-tech ====, faced with severe innovation competition, reallocate R&D resources strategically.====We have assumed that with the access to short-term PBLs, financially constrained innovative firms would expand their scale. Consistently, we find a positive effect of the PBL access on firms' subsequent size measured by either total assets or total sales. Such an expansion effect exists among both small and large firms, suggesting that both types are financially constrained. However, the PBL access effect is insignificant when firms' profitability is examined, indicating that the term restriction on PBLs may restrain firms from investing more efficiently. Overall, our findings suggest that R&D resource reallocation and having financial constraints are two underlying mechanisms.====This paper is closely related to the literature on patents as collateral, which is still limited due to the lack of reliable data; it is particularly so in developing countries. Related studies are largely from legal researchers (e.g., ====; ====). Scholars recently started to study on patents as collateral by exploiting the USPTO Patent Assignment data (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Among them, ==== show the importance of similar lending among innovative start-ups.==== As far as we know, our paper is among the first on this topic in developing countries. Our paper also contributes to the literature by investigating, for the first time, how the initial access to PBLs influences innovative firms' subsequent investment decisions. Different from the literature, our study documents an adverse effect on firm innovation in China where refinancing risks are substantial.====Studies have documented that innovation relies more on equity than debt financing (e.g., ====; ====, ====) as innovative firms are credit constrained, lack of collateral being one reason. However, a growing strand of literature has revealed that debt financing acts as an important source of capital not only for non-innovative but also for innovative firms (====). Our study enriches the understanding on the relationship between debt financing and firm innovation: even with access to bank loans, patenting firms' incentive to do high-quality innovation may be retarded when only short-term loans are issued. In this aspect, our study also complements the literature on how debt maturity influences firms' investment strategies, which has been rarely investigated (see ==== for a notable exception).====This paper also contributes to the literature on how within-firm resource reallocation influences firm innovation.==== As a firm cannot easily adjust its input, to deal with exogenous shocks, it reallocates within-firm resources from one business unit to another. The important implication of within-firm resource reallocation on firm innovation has not been explicitly discussed until ====. ==== argue that employees (e.g., R&D personnel) may be trapped in a firm as some of their human capital is firm-specific. The negative shock from China's exports reduced the price of goods that a US firm was producing, resulting in a lower opportunity cost for its R&D input. The firm then produced more innovation not because the price of new products was higher but because the opportunity cost of using its R&D input to produce new products dropped. Our paper echoes ==== by documenting that R&D input may flow in the opposite direction when its opportunity cost increases. Specifically, the scale expansion trigged by short-term PBLs competes for the use of R&D input in a firm. The firm subsequently does less high-quality innovation because the opportunity cost of using R&D input to do so increases. Our paper highlights the importance of R&D resource reallocation when the relationship between alleviated financial constraints and firm innovation is investigated.",Short-term loans and Firms' high-quality innovation: Evidence from the access to patent-backed loans in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000032,6-Jan-23,2023,Research Article,63

The residential sector worldwide consumed around 27% of the total final electricity demand in 2018 (==== emissions caused by electricity generation.====Previous studies have made great efforts in residential electricity demand analysis by utilizing sectoral statistics data in certain regions or nations. For instance, ==== estimated the short-run and long-run income and price elasticities of the residential energy demand over the period 1968¨C2005 in Turkey; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), to assess how residents respond to demand side management policies (====; ====; ====), and to help scholars better understand how different socioeconomic variables, dwelling characteristics, and climatic conditions affect electricity use (====; ====; ====). However, specific demand patterns of electrical services within the household have not been explored. In addition, the household level data may mask the heterogeneity in consumption behaviors, as the implicit assumption has been that socioeconomic factors have the same effect on all end uses of electricity.====Therefore, it is important to switch from household-based analysis to service-oriented study for the following reasons. ====, the composition of household electricity consumption constitutes an important dimension to measure family welfare and becomes a key indicator to represent service flows and monitor welfare changes (====). Unlike aggregate household electricity consumption, the detailed composition of electrical services can reflect a change in family welfare even though the aggregate consumption does not change (====; ====). ====, ignoring the heterogeneous effects of socioeconomic variables on demand for different electrical services may seriously misguide policy formulation. China is experiencing a long-term process of aging, shrinking family size, fewer children, improvement of education level and family income (====; ====). Revealing the heterogeneous impacts of these socioeconomic variables on different electrical services can guide policies to focus on the end uses that are experiencing significant changes in power demand, and to formulate precise responses in a more cost-effective policy mix. For instance, existing studies have estimated income elasticity of total electricity consumption. However, they tend to ignore the potential heterogeneous impacts of the income variable on different electrical services (e.g., space cooling/heating has larger income elasticity than lighting). Accordingly, policy makers should focus on policies to change electricity consumption in specific services (say, space heating), such as implementing replacement subsidies to improve energy efficiency for specific services (say, adopting new heating modes) instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to improve the energy efficiency of all electrical appliances. The existing studies are unable to tackle this issue by using total electrical demand.====Our study echoes the call for research into electricity demand at the end-use level, to better understand residential consumption habits and behavior patterns (====), to assist utilities in designing better demand response of energy generation to improve the security of the power grid (====), and to guide policymakers in targeting instrument design for demand side management (====). We present the demand pattern covering eight types of electrical services by using a unique nation-wide household survey data in China. Furthermore, we quantify the heterogeneous impacts of socioeconomic variables on different service-specific electricity demand. The results indicate that household electricity demand from entertainment and food refrigeration services makes up around half of the total annual consumption. The services of laundry, lighting, space cooling, and hot water constitute smaller shares. About 7.2% of total electricity is used for cooking purposes by rural households, with urban counterparts hardly using electricity to cook. Negligible electricity is used for space heating by both urban and rural households. The heterogeneity in socioeconomic determinants is unveiled not only among different electrical services but also between urban and rural households. Individual characteristics of household heads have significant impacts in rural areas, while family composition shows significant impacts in urban areas. Household income level is associated with differential electricity-consuming behaviors in multiple services, with differences between urban and rural households.====Our paper contributes to the existing literature in three aspects. ====, to the best our knowledge, the paper is the first one that disaggregates household total electricity consumption into the service-specific level in China.

In the real world, one country often shoulders the blame for polluting the environment of its closest neighbors. For example, Singapore frequently puts the blame on Indonesia for worsening the air quality in the region due to its forest fires (====). Transboundary pollution spillovers are also found along the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada borders.====This study investigates the transboundary pollution between China and South Korea. The two countries have been at odds over which country is the ¡°source of evil¡± and responsible for their air pollution. In 2017, South Korea made public accusations against the economic activity in China as the source of domestic pollution in Korea. China refuted the accusations by pointing to the lack of scientific evidence in support of their claim. In January 2019, the origins of air pollution in the region once again stirred controversy between China and South Korea. Therefore, research work on this bilateral pollution problem is timely, with important implications for a future solution.====Our paper addresses the knowledge gap and examines air pollution spillovers due to economic activities by exploiting different holiday arrangements. Manufacturing operations in the source country are suspended during public holidays, which in turn, greatly reduces the emission of air pollutants. If externalities exist, the air quality could be improved in the receiving country during the suspension period. In other words, public holidays could improve the air quality of both the sending and receiving countries. Using air visibility data from 100 weather stations located in 9 administrative divisions in China and 120 weather stations in South Korea, we find significant bilateral externalities of air pollution between China and South Korea. Specifically, the results show that the air quality in South Korea is improved by 5.5% during holidays in China. Meanwhile, the air quality in China is improved by 1.6% during holidays in South Korea.====In addition, this paper contributes to the literature with a novel empirical strategy to shed light on this bilateral environmental externality. First, bilateral spillover of air pollution could be addressed by using the differences in public holiday arrangements. This complements the literature that only examines one direction==== by examining the possible impacts of air pollution spillover from China to South Korea and vice versa. Second, air visibility==== data used in this paper has seldom been exploited in the literature as a proxy for air quality. ==== use Asian dust as the identification instrument to analyze the pollution spillover effects of China on the mortality rate in South Korea.

Our strategy is relatively easy to implement whenever there are holiday differences between any two countries.

Our research findings would help to improve policymakers' understanding of the interaction between carbon pricing and electricity market reforms. This would then assist them in coordinating an effective design of both the carbon and electricity markets, in addition to supporting China's carbon neutrality target.","As the world's current largest carbon emitter, China has announced its goal of achieving a carbon emission peak before 2030 and then carbon neutrality by 2060. To help in these endeavors, a national ==== market was launched in 2021. This market covers >2000 thermal generators that are responsible for about half of China's carbon emissions, as well as about 10¨C14% of the world's total.====Carbon pricing is expected to encourage fuel switching within the electricity sector and, thus, reduce overall carbon emission; however, its effectiveness depends crucially on the existence of a well-functioning electricity market in order to pass through the carbon costs and to achieve equalized marginal abatement costs across both generators and regions. However, China's electricity sector had long been structured as a planning system, in which both the price and production were organized by the government and not determined by the merit order of generation costs. Even though China's electricity sector has experienced several rounds of restructurings and reforms since 1985 (====; ====), a market-based resource allocation system is still in progress. Up to the end of 2020, the share of market-based electricity generation only accounted for 42% of the total generation.====The progress and characteristics of these electricity sector reforms will interact with and impact the effectiveness of the carbon market. One notable feature of China's electricity market reform is its provincial segmentation. Until now >80% of electricity trade was transacted within the provincial markets, and cross-provincial electricity trading were limited and administratively implemented.====This market segmentation not only affects the efficiency of the electricity sector, but also weakens that of carbon pricing by restricting generation substitution across various provinces. While integrating electricity markets would help to improve the effectiveness of carbon pricing, it could also have certain distributional impacts across provinces, thereby raising equity concerns. As such, these impacts need to be quantitatively evaluated to improve both academic and policy understanding of the interaction between the electricity and carbon markets.====In this study, we adopted scenario simulations and the partial equilibrium model to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of carbon pricing on emission reduction efforts, as well as the distributional impacts between a regional versus a provincial electricity market scenario. Through using the unique high-frequency datasets of the five provinces in China Southern Electricity Grid in 2018, we simulated the emission reductions and abatement costs caused by the carbon pricing of the electricity sector under different scenarios, and then discuss the potential equity issues that may then arise.====This study's results can be summarized as follows. First, the carbon market cannot achieve any carbon emission until the carbon price increases to 200 yuan/ton in the regional electricity market scenario and 400 yuan/ton in the provincial market scenario, respectively, which is far higher than the current price. Second, the regional market is much more cost-effective in reducing carbon emissions compared with the provincial market. Given the same emission reduction targets, the abatement costs are reduced by around 60% more in the regional market than in the provincial market. This is because market integration amplifies the substitution effect of carbon pricing by allowing for the cross-provincial replacement of high-emission-efficiency units for low-emission-efficiency ones. Finally, the regional market also raises potential equity issues as electricity production and carbon emissions are then redistributed across various provinces. Compared with the provincial market scenario, emission reductions are more concentrated in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces within a regional market model. It is accompanied with the massive withdrawal of coal power in these provinces, which then indicates the occurrence of an inequitable impact of market integration on the ==== and economic development in each province.====Our study aimed to make two contributions to the existing literature and policy debates. First, we perform a detailed ==== assessment of the potential impacts of China's newly launched carbon market on both its carbon reduction and electricity sectors, including its electricity generation structure, inter-provincial trading, and the resulting distributional impacts across provinces. Because the carbon market only covers the electricity sector, we analyzed how electricity market reforms and carbon market pricing interact with one another. Our results then illustrate how the electricity market's design affects the abatement potential and cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing.====Although there are many studies that have investigated the design and impact of carbon pricing in Europe and the US, there have been relatively few that have focused on China's carbon market specifically. In the Chinese context specifically, the studies by ==== and ==== both conducted an ====; ====; ====).====In contrast with these prior studies, we adopted the partial equilibrium model as it provides a detailed depiction of the electricity sector characteristics as well as the unique features of China's carbon market using the high-frequency electricity load, production, and trade data. The use of this model would then help to improve the accuracy of assessments on the potential effects of carbon reduction and their overall cost-effectiveness. In addition, the scenario simulation considers electricity sector reform progress, as well as possible future directions. The results would then help improve policy makers' understanding of the interactions between the electricity and carbon markets, which would then allow them to coordinate the design of these two markets to help achieve China's carbon neutrality target.====Second, by simulating the heterogeneous impacts of carbon pricing on emissions across different provinces, we also addressed the CO==== emission efficiency-equity trade-off between different electricity market reform designs. China is characterized by its diversity of resource endowments, electricity generation sources (and their associated carbon emission), and economic development by virtue of its large territory. Hence, a national carbon market can only achieve cost-effectiveness if it is able to equalize the resulting marginal abatement costs across regions, which would then require an integrated electricity market that encourages fuel-switching within a larger market through cross-province electricity trading and decreased carbon leakage across provinces. However, an equity-efficiency trade-off arises when provincial markets are integrated. Some provinces may be concerned with the negative economic and environmental impacts of these reforms. In this context, a quantitative assessment of these distributional impacts is a prerequisite in the formation of policy measures that are aimed at easing these concerns.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. ==== analyzes the links between the carbon and electricity markets. ==== then introduces the scenarios and simulation methods used in this study and summarizes its datasets. ==== presents the simulation results of the carbon emission conditions at different carbon prices in different scenarios, as well as discussing the efficiency and equity of emission reduction. ==== then concludes this paper.",Efficiency vs. equity as China's national carbon market meets provincial electricity markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001730,29-Dec-22,2022,Research Article,66

These health adversities can be transmitted to their children and affect children's education and labor market performance. On the other hand, early-life experience of nutritional adversities may alter parents' socioeconomic status as well as their behaviors of nurturing children. These non-biological pathways can affect human capital and labor market outcomes of the next generation in ambiguous directions (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, etc.).====The majority of studies on the long-term or intergenerational impact of nutritional adversities exploit variations in exposure across regions and cohorts (e.g., famine cohort, regional death rate) to extreme nutritional shocks, such as famines or wars (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====An emerging strand of literature investigates the long-term effect of nutritional deprivation by exploiting individual-level retrospective data on hunger experience (====; ====). In the Chinese context, ==== first exploits the self-reported hunger variable from the life history survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). They provide reliable evidence for negative long-term effects of hunger experience between ages 0 and 17 on physical health, mental health and cognitive ability in old age. Using the same retrospective information on hunger experience as ====, our paper extends their study by investigating the long-term and intergenerational effects on educational outcomes and labor market outcomes.====We contribute to the literature in the following ways. First of all, we focus on the link of individual hunger experience to completed educational attainment and labor market outcomes, which is different from recent studies with retrospective data primarily focusing on later-life health (====; ====; ====). Our finding is that even with our more general measure than famine exposure, nutritional deprivation still has a significant negative impact on human capital and job quality, which echoes the findings of ====.====Second, we add to the relatively scarce literature on the intergenerational effects of parental hunger experience on children's human capital, and provide the first evidence using individual retrospective hunger information. Most studies on the intergenerational effects of nutritional adversities focus on children's health, while only a few study children's educational attainment and labor market outcomes. For instance, ==== and ==== study how parental exposure to the Great Chinese Famine affects young children's cognitive development and possibility of entering middle school. ==== study how parental exposure to severe famines influences children's human capital and labor market outcomes in adulthood. With the individual-level hunger measure, we find that the adverse effects of hunger on human capital and labor market outcomes attenuate over generations.==== and ==== instrument hunger experience by famine exposure dummies or famine intensity measures, whereas our IV is the aggregate hunger rate in the birth ==== within the 5-year birth cohort, which captures systematic factors influencing local food shortages in both famine time and non-famine time.==== The main assumption is that the hunger rate of the reference group affects later-life individual outcomes only through individual hunger incidence. Our IV passes the over-identification test when we introduce famine intensity as a second IV. And our results are insensitive to city specific time-varying confounders and household-level confounders around birth years. With the IV approach, we can identify a local average treatment effect of early-life hunger experience on human capital and labor market outcomes of one's own and their children.====Lastly, we contribute to understanding the potential pathways of the attenuating hunger effect over two generations. The attenuating intergenerational effects on human capital can be related to parental compensatory behaviors of education investment (====; ====) and extra attention to disadvantaged children, implying that compensatory behaviors in the nurturing process may help to bridge the education gap of children caused by parental nutritional deprivation.====To preview our results, early-life hunger experience reduces the first generation's own years of education and the probability of completing middle school or above, and increases the probability of being illiterate. It also lowers job quality, that is, the probability of working in the non-agricultural sector, government or public sector, and firms. For the second generation, the effect of parental hunger experience on human capital is not significantly different from zero. Moreover, heterogeneity analysis shows that the adverse hunger effect on the first generation's human capital is rather universal, though subgroups with higher educational potential (male and the high-SES group) and with severe hunger experience are slightly more affected. The negative impact of parental hunger does not transmit to the second generation for most groups, and the illiteracy rate is even reduced for the low-SES group. In addition, our results are robust to potential sample selection due to marriage, fertility, or mortality.====Our OLS estimates on the first generation's educational attainment are comparable to ==== which also uses individual-level retrospective hunger measures. Our findings are smaller in size than most previous literature exploiting exposure to the Great Chinese Famine by the difference-in-differences approach, and our main estimates on the second generation are not even significantly different from zero. This is possibly because we investigate more general and non-extreme cases of food shortages instead of an extreme case such as the Great Famine.====Exploring the potential mechanisms, we find that parents with early hunger experience have lower health capital, possibly impeding human capital accumulation and labor market performance. Furthermore, parents with hunger experience tend to invest more in children's health and education. They also have more interactions with children, for example, receiving more monetary transfers and providing more care to grandchildren. Compensatory behaviors in human capital investment and extra attention to children might explain the attenuating effects of food shortages over generations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data.

Theoretically, high-risk firms benefit from using bank loans for banks' better capacity to evaluate and for firms' higher reputation acquisition, lower renegotiation cost, and lower disclosure; low-risk firms, however, favor public debt for avoiding intermediation cost, monitoring cost, and bank's control over firms' investment project (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Specifically, the findings of ==== suggest that firms in financial difficulties favor bank debt over bonds because banks are better able to assess their financial situation. ==== and ==== assume that firms that benefit from the screening and monitoring skills of banks could acquire a reputation by taking on costly bank debt. When confronted with insolvent firms, ==== believe that banks will renegotiate rather than liquidate, which is advantageous to insolvent firms. On top of that, borrowing from private lenders is optimal when public disclosure is costly for some firms, such as those in poor information environments (====), and those with fear of the leakages of proprietary information (====). However, low-risk firms assign less value than high-risk firms to the bank loan's evaluation skills and monitoring role, since they have already owned good reputations and are less likely to run into inefficient liquidation. What's more, the cost of bank loan is higher than public debt, owing to the intermediation cost involved (====) and the premium paid for the bank's monitoring role (====). Alternatively, public lenders have less oversight and control over a firm's investments than bank lenders, so low-risk firms prefer bond financing over bank loans (====; ====).====However, this traditional financing framework can be broken into certain scenarios. As summarized in ==== also find that the financial crisis will prompt firms reliant on bank loans to replace bank debt with non-bank debt. ==== argue that since the cost of bank loan relative to bond increases during the crisis, some firms shift from bank loan to bonds and they suffer less in output, investment, and employment than others. In this paper, we observe that the 2013 deregulation adversely affects the willingness of the bank to lend to high-risk firms. Building on these studies, we cast new light on the relationship between the interest rate deregulation shock and the high-risk firm's financing choice.====Lenders' earnings are mainly embodied in interest. In a perfect loan contract, the borrower's risk is proportional to the interest rate, which indicates that high-risk borrowers have to pay a higher interest rate in equilibrium, while low-risk borrowers could take advantage of lower loan interest. However, in an economy where the adjustment of interest rate is limited, this equilibrium may be broken. Imaginably, when there is a lower limit for interest rate, low-risk firms have less propensity to choose bank loan since banks can't reduce the interest rate at will and low-risk firms can't get the loans at an extremely low cost. After the 2013 deregulation, the optimal equilibrium can be achieved in the credit market, where banks compete for low-risk firms at a lower interest rate. Remarkably, it will lead to the situation that the low-risk firms get more bank loans, while the high-risk firms get less. To raise new financing, high-risk firms may turn to other financing channels. In this paper, we empirically examine the influence of China's 2013 interest rate floor deregulation on high-risk firms' financing choice between bank debt and public debt.====It's worth mentioning that, on one hand, the interest rate deregulation is exogenous to firms' financing behaviors, since it's independent of any firm idiosyncrasy or specific problem. In effect, it's put forward for the building of a market-oriented interest rate formation mechanism and is regarded as a significant component of China's financial reform. As ==== and ==== point out, the implementation of this reform is not triggered by any specific problems and it is implemented during a period of stable economic growth and there was no obvious credit demand shock around the event.====On the other hand, the interest rate deregulation would have a huge impact on firms' financing behaviors since bank credit is the most significant financing resource in China. Although this reform does not officially identify which firm would be affected, we regard firms with high default risk as most impacted by this reform. This is because banks usually treat a firm's default risk as the most important indicator to make their lending decisions.====Based on these, we classify the sample into a treatment group and a control group according to the firms' risk level. Using a DID design, we compare the change in public debt between the treatment group and the control group. We focus on A-share listed firms between 2009 and 2016, using 2009¨C2012 as the pre-period and 2013¨C2016 as the post-period. Our findings indicate that firms with higher default risk have fewer bank loans, and they significantly increase their use of public debt financing after the 2013 deregulation and this result holds up to a variety of robustness checks. However, this substitution to public debt is limited, leading to a dramatic decline in the debt ratio. We also find that the ==== deregulation on firms' bond financing is more pronounced for those with better information environments, suggesting that a good information environment is an important prerequisite for making the switch.====Just as mentioned before, some adjustments around credit supply will result in non-optimal financing choices. Specifically, high-risk firms should have preferred bank loans over bonds, however, they move away from bank loan financing and toward public debt, which can be regarded as a non-optimal financing choice (====; ====Our research contributes to the existing literature in the following respects. Firstly, a rising number of studies are exploring the factors that influence a firm's decision to borrow from banks or issue public debt. The internal factors shown to influence this choice include size, cash available (====), leverage (====), age (====), state ownership (====), the amount issued (====), credit quality (====; ====; Bharath., Sunder, & Sunder, 2008), internal control quality (====), collateral value (====), managerial incentives (====) and ownership structure (====), etc. Regarding the external factors, the information environment (====; ====; ====), tough lending standards, contractionary monetary policy (====), economic crisis (====), and market competition for products (====) are important drivers of the switch between bank loans and public debt. In this study, we extend this research by giving unique evidence that this reform, through affecting the availability of bank loans, alters a firm's financing choice between bank debt and public debt.====Secondly, this research prompts new thinking for the matching of firm risk and financing choice. Theoretically, high-risk firms prefer bank loans over bonds, however, an unexpected shock in credit supply might distort this matching relation and result in a non-optimal financing choice. Our results show that when the interest rate floor deregulation breaks the original credit supply equilibrium, high-risk firms move away from bank loans and toward public debt. This choice obviously shifts away from the optimal financing choice suggested by prior literature (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), and therefore, those high-risk firms incur a higher cost. Accounting for the direct and indirect costs of public debt financing, such as higher spread and stricter nonprice contract terms, supports our inference and suggests that this switching is quite costly.====Thirdly, our paper also adds to the studies on the real outcome affected by financial exogenous shocks. The majority of research finds that financial exogenous shocks have influences on the firms' performance. The financial crisis, according to ====, has a negative impact on business profitability. ==== document that notwithstanding higher debt costs incur during economic recessions, firms that transition from loans to bonds have no major reductions in output, investment, and employment when compared to firms that issued bonds or loans predominantly. However, there are also some different conclusions, for example, ==== and ==== show that during the downturn in bank credit supply, firms that have access to bond issuance see a drop in valuation, capital expenditure, and employment. We give a supplement to the understanding of the consequence of financial exogenous shock.

To do that, we build an experimental Chinese labor market in which employers evaluate the productivity of workers who perform a real-effort task. Before evaluation, the employer observes the worker¡¯s personal and group information. The personal information contains gender identity and a signal of productivity. The group information reveals the productivity distributions of some other male and female workers who do not differ in average productivity. However, it shows more male workers at the very top productivity levels and more female workers at the very bottom productivity levels in one treatment than in the other. According to the belief-based theory, there will be a greater degree of discrimination against female workers in the former. We find that, however, only male employers¡¯ evaluations are well predicted by this approach. Female employers behave oppositely: their degree of gender discrimination is smaller in the treatment emphasizing men¡¯s advantage in the tails of the productivity distributions. To explain female employers¡¯ evaluations, we adopt the preference-based approach. Our findings suggest that employers of different genders can have different motivations for gender discrimination, and thus call attention to the theoretical foundation of gender discrimination and policy measures aimed at reducing gender discrimination.","Gender discrimination may be driven by three forces. According to the preference-based literature, gender discrimination is caused by a preference against rewarding or interacting with women (====). The statistical approach argues that people judge individual women based on gender differences in abilities (====, ====, ====). The inaccurate belief theory, which has recently been developed, proposes that people judge women based on systematic biases in beliefs (====, ====).====In most of the exising studies, men and women are not separately discussed, and the underlying assumption is that they form gender discrimination for the same reason. However, men and women diverge in a wide range of preferences (====, ====), despite that they are alike in most cognitive abilities (====, ====). Taking such divergence as point of departure, our research question is: If gender discrimination exists, what are the underlying motives for men and women, respectively? To explore this question, we employ a series of laboratory experiments in the setting of the Chinese labor market as a worker¡¯s gender is commonly observable in job applications in China. We find that the sources of male and female employers¡¯ gender discrimination could be fundamentally different and, more importantly, context dependent. Our findings demonstrate that it is critical to consider the interaction between employer characteristics and embedding environments in order to learn about the precise reason for gender discrimination.====The experiment proceeds as follows. Participants play roles as workers and employers. The workers are asked to solve a real-effort task, and the employers are incentivized to evaluate worker productivity based on individual characteristics and other information. Employer evaluations determine workers¡¯ earnings, and gender discrimination is measured by the evaluation differentials between male and female workers with identical productivity.====Before employers evaluate workers, we provide each employer with workers¡¯ individual and group information. The individual information contains a signal of productivity and gender identity, and the group information reveals the productivity distributions of some other male and female workers. The employers are partitioned into two treatments. In both treatments, the group information ¨C on average ¨C shows no gender difference in ability. However, it differs in the tails: there are more men than women at the very highest performance levels, and more women than men at the very lowest performance levels in one treatment than in the other treatment.====The purpose of varying group information between treatments is to test the inaccurate belief theory by ====. The theory states that even if there are no gender differences in average productivity, discrimination can still arise. The reason is that when the tails of the productivity distributions become highly representative and are overweighted in employers¡¯ assessment of the average productivity, a belief that women are aggregately less productive than men will be wrongly formed. For example, women have made great progress in school performance and today are comparable to men in average school grades and overall school performance, including mathematic grades (====, ====). However, the belief that women are worse than men at mathematics still persists (====, ====, ====). Such belief is explained by the fact that in some exams men appear more frequently than women at the very highest performance levels, leading one to mistakenly use the extreme performers as the representative types for each gender and overstate the size of the average differences (====).====According to the above mechanism of inaccurate belief, there will be a greater degree of discrimination against female workers in the treatment where the group information shows more men at the very top and more women at the very bottom. We find that, however, only male employers¡¯ evaluations follow such a pattern. Female employers¡¯ behavior goes to the opposite direction: their degree of discrimination against female workers is actually smaller in the treatment emphasizing men¡¯s advantage in the tails.====To explain female employers¡¯ behavior, we adopt the preference-based approach in addition to the belief-based one. That is, female employers associate the underrepresentation of women at the top performance levels with real life experiences, like glass ceiling and lack of women at the elite positions in workplaces. Such associations lead female employers to feel a threat to self-esteem and/or develop sympathy toward female peers. As a response, they activate a positive preference toward other women to boost self-esteem and/or to protect female peers. This positive preference translates to higher evaluations for female workers, and its effect is large enough to not only neutralize the ==== on belief, but also mitigate the original gender discrimination of female employers.====Studying the motivation of discrimination is challenging as different motivations ¨C preferences, statistical discrimination, and inaccurate beliefs ¨C generate similar patterns of observable behavior (====). Our current paper further finds that these different motivations of discrimination are interactive. That is, while male employers¡¯ behavior is explained by the belief-based approach, female employers¡¯ behavior cannot be completely explained by their beliefs as we disturb the information structure they face. Since one¡¯s gender has little or no bearing on cognitive skills (====, ====), it follows that some other factors must vary with information. Therefore, our findings suggest that employer gender is key to disentangle different motivations for gender discrimination.====Based on these findings, our study contributes to the literature that investigates the reasons behind gender discrimination by separately addressing the motives of males and females. The existing works mostly focus on identifying an overall, single motive for discriminatory behavior. If analyzing employer behavior at the overall level, however, we would have failed to identify the exact reason of gender discrimination which depends on the interaction between employer gender and information environment. By considering employer gender, we observe that male and female employers respond differently to the variation of information. This observation highlights the complexity of gender discrimination: the reasons for men and women¡¯s gender discrimination are not only different but also context dependent. It is therefore crucial for future works, both theoretic and empiric, to pay attention to the interaction between the gender of the discriminating agents and the environments the agents are embedded in.====Empirically, our study has three implications for the reduction of gender discrimination. First, although women¡¯s status has improved remarkably in the 21st century, the gender hierarchy is still significant worldwide and has been documented in a large scope of contexts, including the labor market context (====, ====, ====, ====), the bargaining context (====, ====), and the academics context (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our study provides an explanation for why gender discrimination persists even though considerable resources have been devoted to solve this problem. Many public policy measures deployed to reduce gender discrimination do not distinguish males and females for the target population. We demonstrate, however, one measure that attenuates discrimination against females for one gender actually exacerbates discrimination for the other gender. This is a caveat for policy interventions in the future, that it is crucial to implement different strategies for each gender. Second, several works have studied how females treat female peers. The evidence, however, is mixed. While some works demonstrate that females are nice to female peers (====, ====, ====), some argue for the opposite (====, ====, ====). Our study offers an explanation for why the evidence has been mixed. That is, the context matters. In the current work, females become nice to female peers when observing that males occupy the majority of top-level positions. Finally, our study proposes a solution for policy interventions via information. In a male dominant environment, the bias against women would be mitigated when information puts less emphasis on men¡¯s advantage over women at elite positions. In a female dominant environment, however, information triggering positive preferences toward female peers would be useful.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

We use random class assignments in the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) to deal with ability sorting and self-selection into classroom when estimating class peer effects. To identify close friend peer effects, we include initial human capital to control for time-invariant unobservables, as stable friendship implies that unobserved preference based on which students make friends is likely to stay unchanged, especially within the one-year frame of the data. We find significant positive peer effects on students' cognitive ability formation at both levels. Peer effects are heterogeneous across student ability. Peer effects work through two channels ¨C peer conformity and peer complementarity. We find both channels generate positive peer effects and jointly determine the size of overall estimated peer effects.","A famous proverb says, ¡°One takes on the color of one's company.¡± In the real world, one's behaviors are indeed affected to some extent by their interactions or relationships with others around them. Peer effects represent how an individual's decision-making or performance is directly influenced by their peers' outcomes or characteristics. These effects are commonly observed in schools (====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and workplaces (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Researchers have been studying what peer effects are, how to measure them, how impactful they are, and how they work (====; ====; ====). Understanding peer effects can provide useful policy implications for improving education outcomes. It is a meaningful and informative way to help improve schooling quality from a new perspective and accelerate human capital accumulation at the early stages of life.====In this paper, we study the context of middle school education in China, to test how peer effects impact students' cognitive ability formation at two different levels, globally via class peers and locally via close friends. There exists related literature looking into peer effects from more than one group at the same time, for example, from one's study group and roommates (====) or from short-term peers and long-term peers (====). Our peer clusters are different not only in size, but also in the intimacy of peer relationships. Peer effects are not always positive, they can be disruptive (====; ====; ====). Following this set of literature, we consider both positive and disruptive close friend peer effects.==== and adopt the linear-in-means model to measure the class peer effects. Some researchers employ network properties to measure peer effects (====; ====; ====; ====). Because we do not have detailed information on network links or pairwise interactions, we use behavioral variables to measure close friend peer effects.====Moreover, there is a broad consensus that it is difficult to identify peer effects because of endogeneity issues. Some researchers separate peer effects from many confounding factors by controlling for student and school-by-grade fixed effects (====; ====), while others explore random peer group assignments as a treatment for self-selection (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ==== points out 2SLS estimates of peer effects could suffer from the weak IV problem. We propose potentially useable IVs to address remaining concerns about the self-selection into the close friend network. However, good IVs are hard to find within the data, and we encounter weak IV problems like the literature. Nevertheless, our inclusion of initial human capital can help identify the close friend peer effects by controlling for the time-invariant unobservables based on which students make friends. As one's close friends likely change little within the one-year frame of the data, the initial human capital correlating with the close friend peer effects through unobserved heterogeneity can partial out a significant amount of the omitted variables from the error term. Therefore, we focus on the random assignment identification strategy with initial human capital controlled for. As a robustness check, we propose potential IVs and panel data fixed effect models to mitigate the remaining concerns on endogeneity.====Peer effects are found to be asymmetric between the short and long runs (====), as well as over the ability distribution (==== also discuss social conformity and peer complementarity as two channels that generate identical peer effects. Our work differs from ==== in two major ways. First, we incorporate peer complementarity and peer conformity in one single model, while ==== model them separately. Second, we respectively test the channels in empirical models, while ==== cannot distinguish them. Inspired by ==== and ====, we use peer relationship variables to proxy the complementarity channel and student effort variables to proxy the conformity channel. We find that both generate positive peer effects. Overall, the magnitude of estimated peer effects is jointly determined by the two channels. The results also suggest that peer effect heterogeneity by quantiles is driven by the fact that higher competition generates a higher level of social conformity for highest-achieving students, whereas knowledge spillover creates larger complementarity effects for lower-achieving students. This finding implies from a social standpoint that it is optimal to maximize both conformity and complementarity effects to generate the largest peer effects. To do so, schools and parents can encourage students to learn from their classmates and close friends, and to form a healthy competitive relationship with them.====Our contributions to the literature are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework on ====, in which peer effects play roles at two different levels, globally via class peers and locally via close friends.

However, the two asset types can be interdependent because the operational efficiency of movable assets, such as farm machinery, typically depends on field conditions, such as land fragmentation. Thus, investment in attached assets may affect investment in movable assets via farm infrastructure. I develop a conceptual model to explain why tenure insecurity may lead a farm to under-invest in attached assets and over-invest in low-efficiency movable assets relative to the secure-land-right scenario. To quantify the economic significance of investment inefficiency, I collect unique survey data on large-scale farms, for which machinery is of particular importance in production, in Southwest China where land tenure remained insecure in 2016. Simulations based on the large-farm survey data suggest that the suboptimal investment occurs given fairly small probabilities of losing some farmland and results in considerable economic losses. The findings have important policy implications regarding land reforms and farm infrastructure in developing economies.","Enhancing property rights in farmland has long been considered central to increasing agricultural productivity and the long-term economic growth of developing economies (====) and impedes the efficient allocation of farmland (====).====Capital allocation within farms depends on the rights over expected returns to investments and, thus, also depends on the nature of land rights (====; ====; ====). In the economic literature, capital investment is typically classified into two types. The first type is investment in movable (i.e., non-sunk) assets that can be moved at a trivial cost and used in different locations. Tractors, harvesters, and livestock are examples. The other is investment in assets that are attached to the land (i.e., sunk assets), meaning that the assets cannot be moved without incurring substantial costs or would become useless once relocated. Trees, roads, and pipelines are examples. Except that the two types of investment may compete for a fixed budget (====), they are assumed to be independent in existing theoretical models. The general and intuitive conclusion is that insecure land rights only affect the investment in attached assets.====; ====; ====). Logically, if insecure land tenure distorts the investment in attached assets, it can also lead to suboptimal investment in movable assets.====Considering the potential interdependence between investments in attached and movable assets, it is natural to ask to what extent the insecure land rights affects both types of farm investment, and what the magnitude of efficiency loss is caused by the suboptimal allocation of capital. In this article, I build a novel model to address two questions regarding relatively large farms facing insecure land rights: 1) how are investment decisions in attached and movable assets affected by insecure land rights, when the two types of investment are interdependent, and 2) what is the magnitude of efficiency loss due to suboptimal investments?====After reviewing the literature on farm investment in ====, I develop the conceptual model in ====. To characterize investment returns from attached and movable assets under insecure land rights, a two-period real-option model is built. In the model, the efficiency of movable assets depends on the quality of farm infrastructure. The farm chooses between two investment options: investing in farm infrastructure and using high-efficiency movable assets, or not investing in infrastructure and using low-efficiency movable assets. I show that the farm investment tends to be suboptimal under insecure land rights ¨C under-investing in attached assets and over-investing in low-efficiency movable assets ¨C compared with the investment under secure land rights.====To quantify the efficiency loss due to suboptimal investment decisions, I calibrate the model by employing primary 2016 survey data of large farms in a southwestern province of China. These farms provide an appropriate economic setting for calibrating the model because of two main reasons. First, large farms in China suffer from nontrivial insecurity in land rights due to land reallocation and expropriation by local governments during the period surveyed (====). Second, infrastructure of the farmland is typically too poor to support high-efficiency machinery (====) and public investment is limited (====), making private investment in infrastructure particularly important for large farms. I employ actual operational parameters of grain harvesters to measure the efficiency difference between low- and high-efficiency machines. Harvesters are chosen as the example, because they are widely used by large grain farms in China and have operational parameters available to researchers.====Simulation outcomes in ==== suggest that, though large farms tend to find investing in infrastructure and high-efficiency machinery optimal under secure land rights, they may switch to investing in low-efficiency machinery given a relatively small probability of losing some leased land. Potential net production value of farms may be 10¨C40% higher if insecurity in land rights were eliminated. The increase in net production value would be even larger if the high-efficiency machinery is cheaper or more efficient, the required investment in improving infrastructure is lower, the land size is larger, or farm wages are lower.====The contribution of this article is twofold. First, it provides an improved theoretical framework for studying farm investment in attached and movable assets under insecure land rights. It is the first to consider the interdependence between investments in the two types of assets, which is typically overlooked but critical for many developing regions with poor farm infrastructure and insufficient public investment (====; ====). Second, it uses a calibrated model to quantify the efficiency loss due to suboptimal investment and the sensitivity of farm investment to insecurity in land tenure. Outcomes confirm the economic importance of considering the interdependence between the two types of investment. The survey data are also valuable, because detailed data of large farms in developing economies are scant to non-existent, despite an increasingly important role of those farms in Asia and Africa (====; ====; ====; ====).====The findings highlight another source of efficiency gains from eliminating insecurity in land tenure, the efficiency improvement of large-farm investments in movable assets. Besides growing adoption of planters and harvesters on large farms (====), new trends of precision farming and increasing requirements on quality control imply rising investment in advanced movable assets like wireless sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles that rely critically on farm infrastructure. By reducing tenure insecurity, large farms can invest more in infrastructure and high-efficiency machinery, be more productive, and obtain more land from smallholders, creating a virtuous cycle of investment, productivity, and land consolidation. The virtuous cycle pushes the transformation from smallholder farming to a commercialized farming system, along with the tranformation of agri-food supply chains (====). Though public investments could help reduce investment inefficiency due to insecure land rights, I argue in ==== that the state-led investment in farm infrastructure alone may not be effective, sustainable, or efficient, given many unsuccessful land consolidation programs in developing countries (====). Land reforms still seem critical.",Interdependent investments in attached and movable assets under insecure land rights,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001675,19-Dec-22,2022,Research Article,72

What is the relationship between mobile payment and access to traditional bank services? By using representative survey data in rural China, we apply a hurdle model with 2SLS and find that consumers with better access to bank services are more likely to adopt mobile payment. However, after adoption, the less often the consumers visit banks because of distance or social constraints, the more they use mobile payment to complement bank services. Younger, better educated households with higher income and more smart phones are more likely to adopt and use mobile payment. Among these characteristics, age has the largest marginal effect while income has the least. Households in the agricultural sector are least likely to adopt and use mobile payment. We also find that awareness of neighbors' use of non-cash payment has a substantial positive effect.","Mobile payment has gained popularity in recent years for making in-person or online payments and money transfers. It lowers transaction costs, boosts business activities, and extends ==== to the under-served consumers and communities. This study conducts empirical research to answer two crucial questions: What determines mobile payment adoption and usage? What is the relationship between mobile payment and bank service access?====Due to a lack of data, most related research had to conduct small-scale online or phone surveys==== with an average of 500 responses. These surveys have technical shortcomings. First, the sample size of these surveys is too small, and the response rate is often too low, which raises doubts over their representativeness. Second, these surveys were conducted online or by phone, limiting the length of questionnaires and constraining the scope of studies. Third, the answers collected online or by phone might be vulnerable to errors and bias.====This study analyzes a large-scale survey of >4000 representative households in rural China. We use the well-designed ¡°Qian Ren Bai Cun¡± survey conducted by students and faculties of Renmin University of China in summer 2019. It covered 128 villages in 31 provinces in China. Most importantly, the novelty of data is the information about the adoption and perception of mobile payment and access to bank services. Contrary to the existing studies on the adoption of mobile payment, we analyzed a full set of financial and demographic information of households, rather than focusing only on consumer behaviors.====This paper provides two sets of major findings. First, it investigates who are more likely to adopt and use mobile payment. Given abundant zeros in the responses to mobile payment usage, we apply a hurdle model in probit and OLS settings. In this two-part model, first, we treat positive responses as 1 and examine what affects a household's adoption decision.====Subsequently, we focus on positive responses and check the factors that contribute to how much they use it. As expected, we find that when the head of household is younger, better educated, earns higher income, or owns more smart phones, the household is more likely to adopt and use mobile payment. Age plays the largest role: if a head of household is 20?years younger, the probability of adoption and the share of expenditure paid by smart phones would on average increase 18.7 and 8 percentage points respectively. Surprisingly, the marginal effect of increasing family income is modest. For a ¡°typical¡± household with median values of all characteristics, the effect on adoption of owning one more smart phone is equivalent to that of doubling the household income. After considering occupation, we find that people from several sectors, such as manufacturing and transportation, seem to be more likely to adopt mobile payment, but this effect disappears after controlled for household characteristics, especially family income. One exception is people working in the agricultural sector who are less likely to adopt and use mobile payment, even after including controls. In addition, we hypothesize that people immigrating to urban areas for work (but with ====Second, the study finds a both promoting and complementary relationship between mobile payment and bank services. To deal with the endogeneity between the adoption of mobile payment and the frequency of visiting banks (which is a proxy for the access to bank services), we apply two instruments: the distance to the nearest bank branch or ATM and the village average of bank visit frequency (except for the household ====). We find that the more often people visit banks, the more likely they are to adopt mobile payment. However, for those who have already adopted mobile payment, their usage would increase if they visit banks less often. A complementary effect could explain this: when people visit banks less often due to distance (the average in our sample is 3¨C10?km) or social reasons, they tend to switch ¡ªusing mobile payment to shop, transfer money, or pay bills.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, ==== indicated that the credit boom by P2P lenders occurs among those who already have access to bank credit. Our study finds a similar complementary pattern in payment services.====Second, this study is among the pioneers to investigate socio-demographic determinants of mobile payment adoption and use. Previous studies on payment choice have focused on traditional payment methods. A series of Federal Reserve papers investigated customers' choice of payment among cash, check, credit card, and debit card and found that age, education, income, race, and other socio-demographic attributes explained most of the variation (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). In particular, they found that disadvantaged groups rely more on cash, which is consistent with our results that older, poorer, and less educated people are left behind when adopting new payment technology.====Much of the emerging literature on socio-demographic determinants of mobile payment adoption relied on small survey samples and applied relatively simple analyses. ==== to switch from a bank to a FinTech, not ==== adoption or usage, and they did not distinguish among the types of FinTech services. ====For factors contributing to the mobile payment adoption, most studies (e.g., ====; ====; ====) focus on consumer intentions, not socio-demographic factors. The most commonly applied models are the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), the technology acceptance model (TAM) (====), and diffusion theory (====). They focus on user-related factors, such as personal innovativeness, related knowledge, perceived risk and trust, and product-related factors, such as convenience, cost, compatibility, network externalities, and reachability. This paper also extends the results of related studies (e.g., ====; ====; ====) by examining the effect of awareness of neighbors' non-cash payment adoption and use, an intersection of customers' awareness and network externalities.====Third, while most research on smart phone technology-enabled money transfer has focused on low-income countries (e.g., ====; ====; ====), such as Kenya, this study investigates the case in less developed areas in China, a middle income country. Unlike low-income countries that have a large portion of population unbanked, households in rural China have a high rate of bank account ownership. However, their financial needs, especially payment and transfer, remain underserved, partly due to geographic and cultural reasons.

Using a nationally representative survey of families and individuals, this paper is among the first to explore these effects in a causal sense in the Chinese context and understand the underlying mechanisms. We use a regression discontinuity (RD) design that employs the threshold date for primary school entry set by the 1986 Compulsory Education Law of China as a source of exogenous variation in the timing of school entry. We first document a salient and robust compliance rate of school entry requirement.

We also observe remarkable heterogeneous effects on labor market performance by gender. Being born right after the cutoff increases the probability of being in the labor force for men, but decreases that for women. We find that the decline in female labor force participation is mainly driven by women who come from economically and socially disadvantaged families. Further evidence suggests that this decline can be explained by supply-side factors including fertility decision and childcare provisions.","; ====; ====). Quite the contrary, in China, many parents believe the old saying that ¡°the early bird catches the worm¡±, and thus have been increasingly seeking to advance the enrollment year for their children. An early transition to school is preferred by these parents because they hold the view that children would benefit from the transition. If it is not rewarding, they would still have more time to adjust and recover (====). Moreover, enrollment at a younger age means earlier entry to the labor market given the same years of schooling completed. Therefore, these individuals can accumulate more work experience by the same age and have more time to explore alternative lifestyles and career options. They can also collect the returns from their human capital investments over a longer period of time. In a nutshell, parents that value early school enrollment treat it as a critical starting line for children's greater academic achievement and better labor market performance.====There is an extensive literature on the impact of school entry age on in-school performance====. However, the effects on educational attainment and long-run labor market outcomes are underexplored and the few existing studies reach different conclusions.==== Even fewer studies are conducted in the context of developing countries where distinct social and cultural environments may lead to different implications.==== This paper fills this gap in the literature by studying the long-term effects of school entry requirement in China and examining the possible mechanisms through which labor market performance is affected. China had never established formal regulations on primary school entry age until the passage of the Compulsory Education Law (CEL) in 1986. This national law requires that any children who have reached the age of six by August 31st of a calendar year should enter primary school in that year. This implies that children born after this threshold date in a calendar year are normally kept out of primary school until the next September.====We use the exogenous variation generated by the threshold date for primary school entry to examine the causal effect of school entry requirement on educational attainment and labor market outcomes including labor force participation (or LFP henceforth), employment status and personal annual earnings for non-agricultural jobs. Specifically, we employ a regression discontinuity (or RD henceforth) framework which enables us to identify the reduced-form impact of school entry requirement by comparing individuals who were born right before and after the cutoff date, as long as individuals cannot precisely control the birth month (the running variable in our setting) near the threshold. The comparison of outcome variables among individuals around the cutoff will distinguish the effect of school entry requirement from unobserved confounding factors such as parental preference.====We use data from wave 2012 of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative survey of Chinese families and individuals. CFPS successfully interviewed about 13,000 families and around 35,000 individuals within these families in 2012. The data are apt for examining the research question addressed in this paper. The first advantage applies to the Chinese context and data on the whole. The CEL in China required all school-age children to receive universal nine-year education, regardless of their birth month. Unlike the United States where compulsory schooling laws specify minimum school leaving ages, children in China must complete a certain number of grades (that is, from 1st grade to 9th grade, or primary education and junior secondary education). This feature facilitates the identification of the school entry age effect.====We begin our analysis by descriptively documenting an association of early primary school entry with higher levels of education completed. This is consistent with the motivation many Chinese parents maintain that children need to start school as early as possible so that they will ¡°not lose at the starting line.¡± However, OLS estimates are biased due to omitted variables and attenuation bias caused by parental preferences and measurement error in school entry age. We next consider the causal effects of school entry requirement. Our RD estimates indicate a salient and robust increase in primary school entry age for individuals born just after the cutoff date compared to their earlier-born counterparts due to the school entry requirement. Regarding educational attainment, we document that being born right after the cutoff results in a half-year increase of schooling completed on average. This impact is not only statistically but also economically significant. The education effect is more pronounced for males than females.====When examining labor market performance, we document statistically significant impacts on log annual earnings for non-agricultural jobs for the full sample. In addition, we observe remarkable heterogeneous effects by gender. To be specific, being born right after the cutoff increases the probability of being in the labor force for men, but decreases that for women. Moreover, males born right after the cutoff have better labor market performance for non-agricultural jobs compared to their earlier-born male counterparts. There is also a sizable earnings impact for non-agricultural jobs for later-born females. We argue that human capital accumulation serves as the main channel through which school entry requirement improves labor market performance. The finding that school entry requirement negatively affects LFP for women given the increased female educational attainment presents a puzzle. We first present that the significant decline in female LFP rate is mainly driven by women who come from economically and socially disadvantaged families. We further investigate the potential mechanisms between school entry requirement and female LFP, and find supportive evidence that labor supply-side factors account for the decline in female LFP. In terms of female labor supply, delayed school enrollment and increased education may postpone women's fertility decisions. Conditional on the same age, women with younger children need to spend more time on childcare, and therefore are less likely to enter the labor force. Consistent with our expectations, we observe that women born right after the cutoff are older at the first childbirth and more likely to raise younger child.====This paper contributes to two distinct strands of literature. First, we contribute to a growing body of research on the long-run effect of school entry age. It is an important policy-relevant question on how the short-run effects on academic achievement and non-cognitive performance translate into meaningful differences in adulthood outcomes, such as educational attainment, employment status, or earnings. However, current evidence on these topics is limited and inconclusive.==== Furthermore, previous research on the long-term impact of school entry age largely focuses on developed countries.==== There is limited understanding of the impact in developing countries.==== This paper is among the first to examine the causal effect of primary school entry age on educational attainment and long-run labor market outcomes in the Chinese context.====Second, our work extends a line of research studying the mechanisms through which school entry age affects labor market outcomes. Current studies argue that school entry age affects labor market performance in adulthood through academic performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), human capital accumulation (====; ====; ====; ====), types of education (====; ====), or educational attainment (====; ====). Delayed school entry also implies less work experience at a given age, and this contributes to lower earnings in the early career (====; ====; ====). This paper explores the mechanism from a different angle by investigating the supply-side determinants of labor force participation. To do so, we make full use of the demographic characteristics for both individuals and their family members from the nationally representative survey data. Our results provide supportive evidence that supply-side factors, including fertility and childcare, could explain the decline in female labor supply caused by the school entry requirement.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: ==== describes the institutional background about the educational system, school entry requirements, and ==== system in China. ==== includes a description of the data and presents summary statistics for the analytical sample. ==== discusses our identification strategy, while ==== describes the regression discontinuity analysis of the effect of school entry age on educational attainment and labor market outcomes, in comparison with the OLS results. ==== provides a discussion on gender differences in labor market performance and explains the potential mechanisms between school entry requirement and female LFP. ==== concludes.",Does the early bird catch the worm?

We address the endogeneity of working hours utilizing an instrumental variable-based two-stage residual inclusion approach. The threshold model shows that the effects are indeed different. Working more than 9?h reduces workers' job satisfaction, and these reductions are even greater among those working more than 12?h. Heterogeneous analysis reveals that working long hours reduces the job satisfaction of female employees more than that of their male counterparts; the job satisfaction of unmarried individuals is unaffected by how long they work, whereas that of married workers declines when they work longer hours. Also, although the job satisfaction of wage-employed workers falls with an increase in the number of hours worked regardless of how long they work, that of self-employed workers falls only when they work more than 12 h. Poor physical health mediates the adverse effects of long working hours on job satisfaction. Finally, working long hours reduces individuals' short-run hedonic well-being but does not affect their perceptions and feelings towards various facets of life in the long run.","According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Labor Organization (ILO), about 36.1% of the global workforce spends more than 48?h/week working (====). In Europe, this number was 16% in 2015 (====). Overwork is endemic in many Asian countries (====; ====); there is a growing backlash against this draconian ¡°996 working system¡±. In Japan, the term ==== referring to overwork-related death, reflects Japan's culture that exalts overwork. Working long hours is a universal concern with far-reaching implications for society.====Extended working hours are associated with increased fatigue and less productivity (====; ====; ====; ====). According to the WHO and ILO, long working hours (¡Ý55?h/week) led to more than 0.74 million deaths from stroke and ischemic heart disease in 2016, with a sharp increase of 29% since 2000 (====; ====). The adverse physical health consequences of long working hours, such as headaches and weight gain, have been documented in countries like Japan and Australia (====; ====; ====). Excessively long working hours are also linked to adverse psychological health outcomes: stress, somnipathy, fatigue, dissatisfaction with jobs, and low happiness and enjoyment levels (====; ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== reported that the longer employees in the United Kingdom worked on a specific day, the less enjoyment they experienced.====Although previous studies have highlighted that long working hours are critical occupational hazards, most have considered a linear association between how long people work and their physical and psychological health (e.g., ====; ====; ====). This view is simplistic and potentially misleading. Excessively long hours beyond specific thresholds may compromise physical and mental health (====), giving rise to a nonlinear association between the number of hours worked and job satisfaction (====; ====).====A prerequisite for evaluating the impacts of working hours is distinguishing between ==== and ====l working time. Previous studies have defined long working hours based on government regulations (====; ====) or subjectively (====; ====). These ad-hoc and a priori classifications of working time capture only the general linear or nonlinear trends; also, subjective definitions may lead to potential biases. In contrast, the threshold model uses a bootstrapping estimation procedure to identify specific threshold values, obviating the need to a priori characterize long or normal working time (====; ====).====Long working hours have contributed to China's rapid economic growth (====). How much people work affects their financial security, productivity, health, and well-being, and thus their quality of life; it affects the socioeconomic tapestry of nations. Yet, the empirical evidence on the psychological effects of long working hours in China remains sparse. Accordingly, the primary objective of this study is to analyze how the number of hours worked affects job satisfaction, which is integral to living a fulfilling life. Specifically, we ask the following questions: Does job satisfaction decrease progressively with increases in the number of hours worked? If yes, what are the specific thresholds, and how much does job satisfaction change once a threshold is crossed? Do respondents' sex, marital status, employment type, and sectors in which they work have heterogeneous effects on the potential nonlinear relationship? We answer these questions using the open-access 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data. In doing so, we contribute to the literature in five important ways.====First, we analyze the nonlinear association between working hours and workers' job satisfaction. More specifically, our focus is on estimating thresholds of the number of hours worked that delineate different levels of job satisfaction. Second, we utilize the instrument-variable-based two-stage residual inclusion approach to address the endogeneity of working hours. Previous studies have revealed that how long one works is endogenous (====; ====). Ignoring this endogeneity would generate biased results and misleading policy implications. Third, we investigate whether the nonlinear relationship between the number of hours worked and job satisfaction has heterogeneous effects on workers of different sex, marital status, having different employment types, and working in different sectors. Fourth, we conduct a mediation analysis to explore the potential mechanisms through which working hours affect job satisfaction. In particular, we consider physical health, sleep duration, and time allocated to leisure as mediators. Because individuals allocate their time to different activities, a mediation analysis would help improve our understanding of the nexus between working hours and job satisfaction. Last, we examine how working hours affect individuals' happiness and life satisfaction, two indicators of subjective well-being.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

This paper systematically investigates the impact of labor price distortion on the markups of export products by using the combined data of Chinese industrial enterprise database and customs database from 2000 to 2013. The results show that labor price distortion significantly inhibits the increase of export product markups of China's manufacturing enterprises, and the above conclusion is still robust after using various methods for robustness test, but this effect is heterogeneous due to different factor intensity, export destination, trade mode, region and ownership. The mechanism tests demonstrate that labor price distortion inhibits the increase of markups through inhibiting R&D innovation, reducing factor allocation efficiency and causing low efficiency of enterprise scale, among which R&D innovation is the most important channel. In addition, this paper examines the impact of labor price distortion on the change of ==== aggregated markups, and finds that intra-enterprise effect and entry effect are the main channels for labor price distortion to inhibit industry aggregated markups, while inter-enterprise effect and exit effect have little impact on industry aggregated markups. Our findings provide a new perspective for reinterpreting the mystery of low markups of Chinese export product, and provides an important decision-making basis for the improvement of China's export product markups.","Over the past four decades of reform and opening up, China's economy has achieved rapid growth, and the low price has always been an important advantage to maintain the long-term sustainable export of Chinese enterprises. However, it might also inhibit the improvement of the markups of China's export product (====). In the context of high-quality development of China, the increase of markups plays an important role in enhancing enterprises' pricing power, strengthening market power and adding trade profits (====), so how to improve the markups of China's export product is one of the considerable issues to be solved urgently. With the increasing availability of micro data, the study on the determinants of enterprises' markups has become one of the hot topics in recent years.====; ====). On the one hand, the negative distortion of labor price can reduce the marginal cost of products; on the other hand, it can also affect the price of products. Then a natural problem would be: Could labor price distortion affect enterprises' markups? And what are the influential mechanisms of labor price distortion on markups? The research on this issue would provide a new perspective to solve the mystery of China's low export markups. Meanwhile, it could also provide an important practical guidance for the market-oriented reform of labor price under the current background of the profound adjustment of Chinese labor supply pattern.====There are two strands of literature which are closely related to this paper. One focuses on the economic effect of factor market distortion, and the other focuses on the determinants of markups. The research perspectives on the economic effect of factor market distortion are relatively broad, such as some studies found that factor market distortion could significantly promote the export of Chinese enterprises(e.g., ====; ====; ====). Other documents showed that factor price distortion could reduce factor allocation efficiency(e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). And there are also few documents focused on the wealth effect of factor price distortion, and found that the more serious the factor price distortion was, the more polarized distribution of wealth would become(e.g., ====; ====). ==== and ==== demonstrated the R&D effect of factor price distortion, and found that factor price distortion would inhibit enterprises' R&D enthusiasm. In addition, there are other literatures focused the influence of factor market distortion on export technology complexity (====), enterprises' innovative performance (====), export domestic added value (====), and the research conclusions are relatively consistent. It should be pointed out that most of the above representative studies measure factor market distortion as a whole, without distinguishing the influence mechanism and effect degree differences of each factor price distortion, and examine factor market distortions mostly from the region level. Different from most existing literatures, this paper measures the price distortion of labor factors from the micro enterprise level. Compared with the factor market distortion at the regional level, measuring the labor price distortion at the enterprise level is easier to find micro mechanisms that affect the growth of China's export markups, which may be more meaningful.====; ====; ====; ====). Some other literatures analyzed from the perspective of import competition, but their conclusions were inconsistent: ==== found that import competition increased China's export markups, while ==== argued that import competition has a remarkable negative impact on the markups of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. There are also some literatures that carry out multi-dimensional empirical investigation on the mystery of Chinese enterprises' low markups. For example, ==== discovered that the degree of ¡°competition effect¡± of export enterprises was greater than that of the ¡°selection effect¡±, which was an important reason for the low markups of Chinese enterprises with high export intensity; ====, ==== pointed out that Chinese export enterprises' markups came from the comprehensive effect of ¡°selection effect¡± and ¡°competition effect¡±, and excessive export incentive was an important reason for the mystery of low markups of Chinese export enterprises; ==== made an in-depth study of the impact of minimum wage on the export markups of multi-product enterprises, and found that the minimum wage policy reduced the markups of multi-product export enterprises on the whole, but the minimum wage policy could adjust enterprises' internal resources to core products, so as to promote the increase of their core product markups. Furthermore, there are also some studies examined the main influencing factors of enterprises' (products) markups respectively from export (====), innovation (====), demand heterogeneity (====), zombie companies (====), subsidies (====) and other multi-dimensional perspectives.====Through sorting out the existing major relevant literature, it is easy to find that the current research perspective on enterprises' markups has been quite broad, and has also obtained some valuable and robust research conclusions. These studies obviously provide a broad theoretical basis for this paper and have important reference significance. In fact, Chinese export enterprises have experienced long-term rapid growth, but their product market pricing power has been weak and export product markups has been low (e.g., ====; ====). Although some scholars have conducted in-depth studies on this issue from multi-dimensions, this paper believes that there is still room for further expansion of the research perspective on this issue, such as few literatures attempt to analyze the mystery of low export product markups of Chinese manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of labor price distortion. It is an indisputable fact that China, as a large country with rich labor resources, has been long-term relying on the production and export of labor-intensive products. However, labor price distortion is a typical fact that has been associated with China's economic development for a long time, and most Chinese enterprises have different degrees of labor price distortions.==== As one of the key factors in product production, the effect of labor price distortion on product markups is of great significance. In addition, multi-product export is a common phenomenon of Chinese export enterprises. From 2000 to 2013, the proportion of China's multi-product export enterprises in quantity and export volume was 72.54% and 90.56% respectively, and it shows an upward trend generally (====). In this context, this paper attempts to deeply analyze the mystery of low export product markups of Chinese multi-product manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of labor price distortion, which can not only provide a valuable supplement to relevant researches on markups theoretically, but also offer a decision-making basis for solving the mystery of China's low export product markups in practice.====Based on the merged data of Chinese industrial enterprise database and customs database from 2000 to 2013, this paper systematically investigates the impact of labor price distortion on export product markups.==== Compared with the existing literatures, the main marginal contributions of this paper are shown in the following: First, based on the fact that most Chinese industrial enterprises have labor price distortion, this paper investigates the determinants of export product markups of Chinese manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of labor price distortion, which provides a new research perspective for a more comprehensive interpretation of the mystery of Chinese manufacturing low markups. Second, this paper systematically examines the impact mechanism of labor price distortion on export product markups from the two levels of enterprise and industry. In the aspect of enterprise, we find that labor price distortion inhibits the increase of Chinese manufacturing export markups through R&D, resource allocation and scale efficiencies; and in the aspect of industry, based on the decomposition of dynamic OP model, we find that intra-enterprise effect and entry effect are the main channels for labor price distortion to inhibit the increase of industry aggregated markups, inter-enterprise effect and exit effect can promote industry aggregated markups to a certain extent, but the degree of their promoting effect is far less than that of the inhibitory effect of the former two, so the labor price distortion would inhibit the improvement of industry aggregated markups in whole. The investigation of the above two impact mechanisms provides a path support and theoretical basis for the improvement of China's export product markups and industry aggregated markups. Third, the existing measurement methods of enterprises' labor price distortion and export product markups are moderately improved respectively in this paper, which, to a large extent, increases the accuracy of the key indicators' measurement results and thus enhances the credibility of the conclusions of this paper.====The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: section 2 presents the causes and characteristic facts of labor price distortion and research hypotheses; section 3 introduces the empirical strategy and data sources; section 4 is empirical results and corresponding analysis; section 5 is the transmission mechanisms of labor price distortion to export product markups; section 6 is the extended analysis which focuses on the impact of labor price distortion on industry aggregated markups; and the last section provides the conclusions and policy implications.====Fit ====, with using the fitting result ==== of export product output, factor variables and the fitting value of factor elasticity estimation coefficient, the product productivity shock can be expressed as:====Based on ====, ==== can be rewritten as:====Where ==== can be calculated on the basis of ====, the enterprise productivity ==== can be obtained after estimating enterprise production function, ====(====,?====,?====) can be approximated by a second-order polynomial (====?+?====) ====.

Moreover, even if the ==== expectations (beliefs) need not be exactly the same as ==== outcomes realized years later, expectations (beliefs) may be more important than realized outcomes in later periods to understand individuals¡¯ choices, as argued by ====.==== Despite the importance of expectations, little is known about how individuals form expectations. Individuals¡¯ expectations may be affected by many factors such as their parents, family socioeconomic status, teachers, and own ability and personality.==== Moreover, because there are intensive social interactions among school peers, school peers may play an important role in shaping individuals¡¯ educational and occupational expectations.====To date the literature on peer effects in education has mainly focused on academic performance (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).==== But there is little evidence on how gender peers affect students¡¯ educational and occupational expectations. In this paper, we investigate how gender peers (having a higher proportion of female classmates) affect students¡¯ educational and occupational expectations, using a representative sample of middle school students from China.==== Chinese middle schools are ideal places to examine the peer effects, since in the schools students interact with their classmates intensively: they not only attend the same courses every day but also participate in extracurricular activities together frequently. Also, our study may have important policy implications, since understanding gender peer effects is important for evaluating the consequences of imbalanced sex ratios in coeducational schools, for an optimal grouping of students in schools and classrooms, and for an efficient allocation of resources across and within schools.====To identify the peer effects on students¡¯ outcomes, we need to address two major problems: the selection and the reflection problems (e.g., ====, ====, ====). The selection problem states that individuals usually self-select into peer groups, i.e., individuals with similar characteristics are more likely to enter the same peer group, so it is difficult to distinguish between peer effects and selection effects. The reflection problem states that if the effect of peers on the individual and the effect of the individual on peers are determined simultaneously, then it is difficult to distinguish between the two effects.==== To address the selection problem, two methods are widely used in the literature. The first method uses variation in the composition of students across grades within the same school to estimate compositional peer effects for same-grade schoolmates (e.g., ====, ====). The second method exploits institutional random assignment of peers (e.g., ====, ====). We use the second method to overcome the selection problem. Specifically, we choose a sample of students who were randomly assigned to classes upon their entry to middle schools and had stayed in the same classes from then on. Also, we control for school and grade fixed effects in all estimations. That is to say, our strategy relies on comparison of students in a grade-school unit who are randomly assigned to classes with different proportions of girls, so our strategy is unlikely to suffer from the selection problem. In addition, the proportion of girls is predetermined in our setting, so our strategy is unlikely to suffer from the reflection problem.====We use two methods to test whether the students in our sample were really assigned to classes randomly. First, if students were assigned to classes randomly, we should observe no correlation between the proportion of girls in a class and students¡¯ background characteristics. Indeed, we find that the correlation between the proportion of girls and the students¡¯ characteristics is generally insignificant. Second, using ====, we show that the within grade-school variation in the proportion of girls resembles the variation that we would get by a random process. These results suggest that the students in our sample were really assigned to classrooms randomly, lending support that our empirical strategy is valid.====We estimate the effects of classroom gender peers on students¡¯ educational and occupational expectations.==== For educational expectations, we find that a higher proportion of female peers reduces students¡¯ probability of expecting to achieve a low level of education (middle school) and increases their probability of expecting to achieve a high level of education (university or graduate school). Using expected years of education as an alternative measure, we find that a 10-percentage-points increase in the proportion of female peers increases girls¡¯ and boys¡¯ expected years of schooling by about 0.13 and 0.35?years, respectively. For occupational expectations, we find that a higher proportion of female peers increases students¡¯ probability of expecting to pursue a career as a manager, and reduces their probability of expecting to pursue a career as a teacher, doctor, or lawyer. Also, we find that a higher proportion of female peers increases students¡¯ probability of expecting to pursue a career as an athlete, but the effects are significant for only boys. Besides, we find little evidence of peer effects on students¡¯ probability of expecting to pursue a career in the other occupations.====In addition, we explore whether exposure to more female peers increases students¡¯ gender segregation in occupational choice. We classify the occupations into two broad groups according to the share of females: prevalently female (PF) group which consists of occupations (art performer, teacher/doctor/lawyer, and designer) with the highest share of girls, prevalently male (PM) group which consists of occupations (corporate manager, civil servant, athlete, scientist/engineer, and technician) with the smallest share of girls. We find that a higher proportion of female peers significantly increases both girls¡¯ and boys¡¯ probabilities of expecting to pursue PM occupations, but has negative (statistically insignificant) effects on their probabilities of expecting to pursue PF occupations. One may think it is a little counter-intuitive that exposure to more female peers increases girls¡¯ probability of pursuing prevalently male occupations. One possible explanation is that girls establish a higher degree of self-confidence and are less restrained by gender stereotypes when they are exposed to a higher proportion of female peers in classes. As a result, girls will invest more human capital in male-dominated subjects (e.g., math and science) and make a less restrained occupational choice, i.e., girls are less likely to choose a traditionally female dominated occupation and are more likely to choose a traditionally male dominated occupation (e.g., ====, ====).====, who find that the proportion of female peers can affect students¡¯ study efforts and teachers¡¯ responsibility and patience, but are in contrast to ====, who find that gender composition has insignificant effects on either students¡¯ or teachers¡¯ behavior.====We use several methods to check the robustness of the results. First, we show that teachers are also randomly assigned to classrooms, indicating that our estimates are unlikely to be biased due to non-random assignment of teachers. Second, we show that our estimates do not change significantly when we randomly drop some schools, implying that our baseline estimates are unlikely to be biased due to possible inclusion of some schools that actually did not assign students randomly. Third, we show that our results are unlikely to be biased due to sample attrition. Fourth, we provide evidence that our estimates are robust to an alternative specification. Fifth, we find evidence that peer effects are also significant for the students in the first grade of middle school, suggesting that our results are not entirely driven by students who have a longer period of exposure to their classmates. Sixth, our results remain consistent when we add additional controls for students¡¯ socio-economic status. Lastly, we adopt multiple choice models and find our estimates remain similar.====This study is related to the literature that investigates the effects of gender peers on students¡¯ major choice and labor market outcomes.==== But to date the literature is still mixed regarding the influence of gender peers. First, some studies find that gender peers have little effects. For instance, utilizing initial random assignment of high school students to different classes within school-cohorts in Milan, Italy, ==== find that the proportion of own-gender peers generally has little effects on students¡¯ major choice and earnings. Second, some other studies find that exposure to more female peers may increase students¡¯ gender segregation in major choice. For instance, using data from 525 public four-year colleges in the US, ==== find that women exposed to a higher proportion of female peers become less likely to choose a male-dominated major (STEM) and more likely to choose a female-dominated major (health-related studies), whereas men exposed to more female peers are more likely to choose a male-dominated major and less likely to choose a female-dominated major. Also, using data from a Dutch business school, ==== get results that are similar to those of ====. In contrast, some studies find that exposure to more female peers may reduce students¡¯ gender segregation in major or school choice. For instance, using a sample of students from Austria, ==== find that exposure to a higher share of girls in previous grades reduces girls¡¯ probability of choosing a traditionally female dominated school type and increases their probability of choosing a male dominated school type. Using data from Greece, ==== find that having more female peers in a school or a neighborhood increases girls¡¯ probability of enrolling in a STEM post-secondary degree, but it has small and insignificant effects on boys¡¯ decision to study STEM.====To sum up, previous studies find that exposure to more female peers may have little effects on students¡¯ major choice and future incomes (e.g., ====), may increase students¡¯ gender segregation in major choice (e.g., ====, ====, ====), or may reduce students¡¯ gender segregation in major or school choice (====, ====). By contrast, we find that both girls¡¯ and boys¡¯ probability of choosing prevalently male (PM) occupations increases when they are exposed to a higher proportion of girls. The findings imply that exposure to more female peers may have ambiguous effects on students¡¯ gender segregation in occupational choice. The differences in findings may result from different outcome variables: the literature mainly uses ==== measures of choices (realized outcomes), whereas we use ==== measures of choices (expectations); also, previous studies mainly look into major choices, whereas we investigate occupational choices. Besides, the differences may also result from different definitions of peer groups (e.g., classmates versus school mates) or different study environment (e.g., middle school versus college).====This study contributes to the literature as follows. First, this study helps to understand how individuals form their educational and occupational expectations.==== Our findings imply that classroom gender composition is an important factor that can shape individuals¡¯ educational and occupational expectations, which helps to understand the variations in individuals¡¯ educational and occupational choices. Second, although many studies have examined the peer effects on academic performance and other non-cognitive outcomes, few studies have explored the peer effects on educational and occupational expectations. Thus, this study expands the literature on peer effects in education.====More generally, by documenting that individuals¡¯ educational and occupational expectations can be affected by their peers, this study adds to empirical analysis of social interactions. According to ====, agents can interact with each other through three channels: constraints, expectations, and preferences, which are given formal expressions through choice sets, subjective probability distributions, and utility functions, respectively. In our setting, students can learn about the earning potential associated with an academic degree or an occupation from their peers. Besides, students¡¯ preferences towards an academic degree or an occupation could also be affected by their peers. Hence, what we estimate here is likely related to both expectation and preference interactions (====).====Lastly, this study provides new evidence on the mechanisms. Although many studies investigate gender peer effects, there is limited evidence on the mechanisms. To explore the mechanisms, a few studies have examined the gender peer effects on students¡¯ study efforts, classroom environment, teachers¡¯ teaching style and effort, and the quality of teacher-student relations (e.g., ====, ====), but few studies examine the effects on students¡¯ course evaluation and extracurricular activities. We find that classroom gender peers can affect students¡¯ course satisfaction and extracurricular activities, which are novel in the literature.====This paper progresses as follows.

These results are robust to alternative IU measures and a series of estimation approaches that control for endogeneity. IU participation affects the number of children born through decreased marital satisfaction, changed attitudes toward traditional gender roles, a reduction in the importance placed on ancestral lines, deteriorated health and reduced fertility preferences.","China outstripped the US and became the country with the largest population of internet users globally in 2008 (====), with 1.032 billion Chinese ¡°netizens¡± in 2021 (====). The internet penetration rate (the ratio of internet users to the total population) increased substantially from 8.5% in 2005 to 73.0% in 2021 (====). It is thus not surprising that such rapid growth of internet use (IU) in China ¨C combined with the use of other information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as personal computers and mobile devices ¨C has fundamentally transformed lifestyles and well-being (====). It has plummeted below the replacement level (2.1), from 6.11 in 1950 to 1.66 in 2015 (====) and to 1.3 in 2020 (====). Furthermore, with the popularization of the internet, most childbearing women are increasingly accessing the online environment, particularly social media groups, to connect with other childbearing women as an important source of childbearing information and interpersonal communication (====), thereby affecting women's childbearing decisions (====).====The effects of IU on individual behaviors and outcomes have been amply documented in the contexts of crime (====; ====), employment (====; ====) and unemployment (====), sleep duration and satisfaction (====), marriage (====), happiness (====; ====), social capital (====; ====) and electoral outcomes (====; ====; ====). However, the relatively small body of extant literature focuses exclusively on the effect of IU on fertility behavior in Western countries, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in developing and transitional economies, such as China. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to narrow this gap in the literature by investigating how IU affects the fertility behaviors of reproductive-age Chinese women using data from the 2014¨C2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Our study contributes to the literature on the IU¨Cfertility nexus in several ways. First, by focusing on China, we extend the limited number of nationally representative studies beyond the Western setting. China's dramatically declining fertility during the past few decades reflects its citizens' low-fertility culture and intentions in the current socioeconomic context rather than governmental fertility policies (====; ====). This expansion is also important because the different attitudes toward and perceptions of IU among those from different sociocultural backgrounds (====; ====) make it difficult to generalize the results from developed countries. Additionally, IU is more prevalent among reproductive-age Chinese women than among members of other age groups (====). Second, because the mixed results from prior research are often attributable to various definitions of IU, we adopt two different measures of IU, including IU participation (the first-level digital divide) and IU intensity (the second-level digital divide).==== Especially with regard to the second-level digital divide, we further employ two methods: a macro approach that assesses IU as a whole and a micro approach that focuses on specific online activities (====). Thus, our study provides a more differentiated picture of the IU¨Cfertility nexus. Third, using the sociodemographic characteristics of education, gender of the first child and region to explore the heterogeneous effects of IU on fertility offers useful guidance for policies intended to boost (below-replacement) fertility rates. Last, by including several major fertility-related outcomes (i.e., marital satisfaction, importance placed on the ancestral line, gender role attitudes, health, and fertility intentions), this study goes beyond a sole focus on IU's impact on fertility to examine the underlying pathways through which this effect occurs. In doing so, it provides useful insights into the linkage between IU and fertility in China and other economies, especially East and Southeast Asia, which have experienced a precipitous transition to ultralow fertility.====The fixed-effects (FE) ==== results show that IU participation generates substantial fertility-decreasing effects by 28.6 percentage points (20.8% of the average fertility rate). We also find interesting heterogeneity in the effects, which is more pronounced among women with a moderate level of education, those aged 16¨C19, rural residents, and those who are married. The effects of IU may operate through multiple channels. We provide suggestive evidence that IU participation affects the number of children born (NCB) through decreased marital satisfaction and changed attitudes toward traditional gender roles. Moreover, the importance placed on ancestral lines has declined. Deteriorated health and decreased fertility preferences are also important mechanisms behind the drop in the NCB. In particular, the purpose of entertainment online enhances the negative impact of IU intensity on fertility.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== documents the institutional background on the dynamics of China's TFR over the period 1950¨C2020 and the related literature on the effect of IU on fertility, and ==== documents the possible heuristic mechanisms underlying the impact of IU on fertility in China. ==== describes the data and empirical strategy, and ==== reports the results. ==== discusses the possible underlying mechanisms linking IU participation with fertility, followed by ====, which provides concluding remarks.",Internet use and fertility behavior among reproductive-age women in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001614,9-Dec-22,2022,Research Article,78

The findings have implications for higher education and China's economy, because earthquake exposure lowers a student's probability of being accepted to an elite college, pursuing a major in a high-salary field, and moving to a highly developed urban area for education or employment.","Large-scale and unpredictable natural disasters, like other exogenous shocks such as famines and conflicts, can devastate communities. A handful of researchers have recently tried to quantify the impact of natural shocks on both individual and societal well-being. Studies have focused on earthquakes (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), tsunamis (e.g. ====; ====; ====), and hurricanes (====; ====; ====; ====). Economic research on disasters and their consequences, however, is still limited. This study makes a critical contribution by examining the causal effect of a large natural disaster on students' educational achievement, and the associated implications for a major global economy.====The Wenchuan earthquake occurred in May of 2008, about one month before China's National College Entrance Exam (NCEE), commonly known as the ==== in Chinese. The NCEE, usually held each year on June 7th and 8th, is a prerequisite for Chinese students to enter university. In 2008, China's Ministry of Education postponed the NCEE until early July in 40 earthquake-affected counties in Sichuan province to relieve stress on students and families. >100,000 students took the delayed exam with a separate admission process. The NCEE returned to its previous format the following year, meaning that younger students who were affected by the earthquake competed with their counterparts from non-affected regions in Sichuan. This study explores whether those students who experienced the earthquake scored lower than their unaffected peers on the NCEE, to assess whether exposure to a large-scale natural disaster is associated with performance in a high-stakes exam and the resulting eligibility for postsecondary education.====Two unique datasets are analyzed in this study: geographical data on the intensity distribution of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and a national administrative dataset on China's college entrance examinations. The first contains detailed information on different exposure levels to the earthquake in China. The second provides the county identifier and the total test score for all students who were admitted to Chinese four-year colleges between 2005 and 2011.====By matching these two datasets, we estimate how natural disasters affect students' academic achievement in a high-stakes setting. Our baseline results show that in this sample, on average, students affected by the earthquake experienced a 55% ==== decrease in the NCEE standard score. The results are robust to a rich set of robustness checks and placebo tests. Moreover, heterogeneity tests reveal that the negative impacts of earthquake exposure were stronger for students in the liberal arts tracks and students with relatively low performance on the exam.====We further explore the implications of these findings by investigating the relevant educational and economic consequences of a performance decline in a high-stakes exam. We first confirm that earthquake exposure caused a significant decrease in enrollment in elite colleges, such as Project 211 colleges, for the students in this study. We then demonstrate that for the subgroup of students admitted to elite colleges, quake-affected students were squeezed out of majors in high-salary fields such as economics and ====. Finally, we match geographical data to show that earthquake-affected students were less likely to go to prosperous cities in China's highly developed regions for their higher education.====This paper builds on a small body of literature that examines the impacts of natural disasters on society and individuals.==== Interestingly, recent work in this area describes how natural disasters can, under certain conditions, increase long-term economic output (====), decrease income inequality (====), reduce crime (====), and improve girls' educational attainment (====).==== Also, existing studies that link natural disasters to negative effects on educational attainment for the affected (====; ====) or subsequent generations (====; ====; ====) generally measure impact in years of schooling.==== Our main contributions beyond the extant work are that (1) we explore a more recent seismic event and the worst natural disaster recorded in China since 1976, and (2) we not only examine changes in academic performance but also investigate related outcomes such as college acceptance, choice of major, and the location of the higher education institution attended.====In addition, this paper enriches the existing body of knowledge on high-stakes exam performance. In many countries, high-stakes testing is used to rank students for college admission, and students who score lower than expected on their college entrance examinations often have to wait an entire year before taking them again, potentially creating high opportunity or stigma costs of retaking the exam (====). There exists a burgeoning economic literature estimating how random disturbance can impede cognitive performance during high-stakes exams. Yet cognitive burden created by heat waves (====; ====), air pollution (====; ====), or pollen inhalation (====) tend to be relatively low and short-lived.

The ====) and employment (====) effects of energy efficiency improvement. Therefore, energy efficiency enhancements have taken a central role in national energy and environmental policies, as countries around the world continue to inculcate energy efficiency strategies and targets into their national plans (====). Part of these strategies have involved promoting technological progress and the diffusion of cost-effective energy-saving technologies (====). In this regard, globalization has emerged as one of the effective instruments that can expedite the process of technological process and diffusion (====). Economic globalization makes technological exchanges between and among countries extremely easy (====; ====).====Economic globalization¡ªa process by which companies, governments, and other institutions from all around the globe increasingly interact¡ªis believed to promote global trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), industrial efficiency, capital circulation, and innovations. ====). For example, a growth in FDI can help transmit industrialized countries' production efficiency to developing ones (====). Furthermore, due to globalization, the growing notion of global information and shared knowledge has proven to raise awareness of energy and environmental-related issues across the globe, thereby improving energy efficiency (====). Motivated by this, the current study aims to examine the effect of economic globalization on technical energy efficiency for a global sample of 141 countries.====The empirical literature presents a number of challenges that may affect the causal influence of economic globalization on energy efficiency. First, one daunting issue prevalent in the current literature relates to measurement issues of economic globalization. Existing studies have used various measures of economic globalization that have been described as either inappropriate or inadequate (====; ====; ====) or FDI (====; ====; ====) or both (====; ====) to assess the degree of economic globalization on energy outcomes. Indeed, linking trade (or FDI) to energy efficiency is essential from a policy perspective (====). However, according to ====; ====; ====; ====) use trade liberalization and FDI as measures of economic globalization. These studies show that trade liberalization or FDI reduces energy consumption through imported energy-saving technologies. ====, for 36 countries, find that trade and FDI (being a measure of globalization) significantly improve energy efficiency.====In contrast, other studies report that economic globalization as measured by trade and FDI does not enhance energy efficiency improvements. In Bangladesh, ==== observe that trade openness fosters energy intensity. ==== finds that increasing trade (as in exports and imports) increases short-term and long-term energy intensity in the Middle East. ==== finds that, in 32 countries, trade liberalization increases their per capita usage of energy. ==== observe that FDI might allow developed countries to transfer their energy-consuming technology into undeveloped and developing countries, increasing their energy intensity.====Other studies have used the multidimensional measure of economic globalization developed by ==== (also known as the KOF index). The KOF index covers three dimensions of economic globalization ¨C economic, social and political. ==== reveals that increased economic globalization improves economic performance and transforms the way people use energy. ==== examine the effect of KOF index of economic globalization on energy use in India and find that economic globalization increases energy consumption. ==== also examine the effect of KOF index of economic globalization in developed countries and find that economic globalization increases energy consumption. Similarly, ==== have re-examined ==== classic economic globalization index and updated it to include additional indicators such as trade partners diversity, foreign debt, investment restrictions, international reserves, and trading rules.====Another empirical issue relates to the measurement of energy efficiency. Largely, studies have used energy consumption or intensity as a benchmark of energy efficiency to appraise the effect of economic globalization on energy efficiency. But, according to the ====, employing energy consumption or intensity as a measurement of energy efficiency might be misleading because energy intensity may not accurately capture factors that would have been considered in energy efficiency. For example, if the fuel mix or weather differs between countries, energy intensity will not accurately capture the difference in energy efficiency among countries (====). Other studies such as ==== and ==== have shown that energy intensity is weakly associated with energy efficiency. To solve this problem, studies have relied on more reliable measurable techniques of energy efficiency such as the stochastic frontier analytic and data envelope analytic techniques (====; ====; ====; ====). However, it is largely assumed in these studies that technical energy efficiency exhibits very rapid changes across countries. This might not be the case for at least some countries because of the difficulty to switch from one technology to another and for the reason that different energy users may use different discounting factors. Thus, failing to address the possibility of persistent movement in computed energy efficiency can also influence the causal ability of economic globalization. Lastly, the context dependent nature of the empirical results suggest that the literature may be suffering from heterogeneity bias. For example, while it is expected that there may be little or no ¡®low-hanging fruit¡¯ existing in developed economies as related to energy efficiency improvements, it might not be the case in developing economies. Moreover, the difference in environmental regulations and technology absorptive capacity of countries imply that the impact of economic globalization may be driven by context unobserved heterogeneities.====Based on the identified gaps in the prevailing literature, this study makes a number of significant contributions to the current literature. First, in addition to using KOF index of economic globalization, this study also used the updated version of Dreher's measure of economic globalization developed by ====The remainder of the research is well-thought-out as follows. Given that the research aims to estimate energy efficiency to draw a link between economic globalization and energy efficiency, section two provides a quick summary of the literature on energy efficiency measurement.

To preserve consistency with the measures obtained from the Penn World Table version 9.0 (PWT), the data on public and private capital stock by ==== are constructed so that the sum of the two types of capital stock match the total capital stock reported in the PWT.====We rely on two approaches to investigate the relationship between financial reforms and capital formation. First, we use graphic analysis based on a structural break test to investigate the association between regime changes in capital growth and financial sector reforms.

This study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive and direct analysis of the association between domestic and external financial reforms and capital accumulation in the private and public sectors, focusing on developing economies.

Our results show that exposure to more classmates with a longer preschool duration significantly improves students' cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, whereas exposure to more classmates with a shorter preschool duration does not have such significantly positive effects, offering evidence of the dosage effects of attending a preschool program from the perspective of externalities. We further demonstrate three possible mechanisms through which the effects operate and quantify the explanatory power of each mechanism in driving the effects.","Since the pioneered work by ==== prior studies have at least two shortcomings. On the one hand, existing studies provide limited evidence of the social benefits of these programs. Children's valuable skills acquired in early preschool programs may also directly and indirectly benefit their peers in later life via social interactions, thus generating spill-over effects of these programs. ==== and ==== are two exceptions that provide some evidence of the external effects of preschool programs in the context of the US.==== On the other hand, most studies look at the effects of attending an early education program, but say little about the dosage effects of early education programs (====).====Given the differential returns to life-cycle skill investments as reflected in the Heckman Curve (====), a full understanding of the effects of preschool programs may help policy makers to allocate educational resources efficiently. If attending a preschool program also generates positive effects on other peers in society, ignoring such effects may underestimate the value of preschool programs. This could be quite important for both developed countries like the US, where the share of four-year-olds enrolled in state-funded preschools is only approximately 34% in 2019 (====), and developing countries like China, where early childhood education remains less invested. Furthermore, given the limited early childhood education resources, it is attractive to understand the trade-off between expanding preschool enrollments and prolonging preschool duration.====In this paper, we attempt to enrich this literature by investigating the external effects of attending a preschool program on children's middle school classmates. In particular, we offer the first piece of evidence on the dosage effects of attending a preschool program from the perspective of preschool externalities in middle school period. As will be described in ====, there are two kinds of preschool programs in China, kindergartens that offer a three-year preschool education and pre-primary classes that are typically one-year programs. In 2009, 74.0% of children were enrolled in one-year preschool programs and only 50.9% of them were enrolled in three-year preschool programs (====). The difference in preschool program length provides us an opportunity to examine the external effects of classmates with different preschool experiences.====Given that preschool programs may have long-lasting effects on the formation of attendees' personality traits (e.g., perseverance, self-confidence, conscientiousness, self-discipline and agreeableness) and behaviors, as found in previous studies, exposure to more classmates with a preschool experience may affect middle school students' outcomes via at least three channels. First, classes with more preschool attendees may have a more suitable atmosphere for learning, thus helping foster positive inter-student interactions. Second, teachers may teach more effectively in classes with more well-behaved and self-disciplined students, thereby generating positive teacher-student interactions.==== In contrast, teachers may be disturbed more frequently in classes with more unruly children, hence hindering the learning effectiveness of their classmates. Third, parents may respond to the characteristics of their children's classmates. For example, parents may devote more effort and time to parenting as a response to the rising competition in classes with more preschool attendees, generating positive family-class interactions. Therefore, one would expect to observe a positive relationship between the share of classmates with a preschool experience and the outcomes of middle school students in the class.====We use data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), a nationally representative sample of Chinese middle school students, to examine whether and how exposure to more classmates with a preschool experience affects students' cognitive and noncognitive outcomes. The estimation of such effects is subject to two major threats that may confront causal identification (====, ====).==== One is selection bias. This kind of bias could arise if parents choose a middle school for their children based on their preferences. For example, wealthy/educated parents may have a stronger motivation to invest in their children via transferring them to better schools as well as sending them to a preschool. To address this kind of school sorting, we include school fixed effects in the regressions, as in the literature (e.g., ====; ====). Selection bias could also arise if students within a school are grouped based on certain observable or unobservable characteristics such as ability and family socioeconomic background. Middle school students, who are in the second stage of compulsory education, are required by law to be randomly assigned to classes at the beginning of grade 7. Once assigned, students are usually not allowed to transfer to other classes throughout the subsequent middle school years. Thus, students in the same class take the same courses and participate in other activities together. Utilizing this random class assignment rule, we can mitigate the bias from potential class sorting.====The other is reflection problem, which could occur when a student's and his/her classmates' outcomes are simultaneously determined. Although a distinction between endogenous and contextual peer effects is valuable because of their different policy implications, it is often difficult to disentangle the two effects.==== One strategy to address the reflection problem is to use preexisting variables as measures of peer outcomes (====). In the context of the present study, a student's preschool experience is largely exogenous to the peers' outcomes as long as the peers' outcomes do not cause the student's enrollment in a preschool program. This assumption may be reasonable because a student's enrollment in a preschool program is predetermined several years ago, therefore, the reflection problem is less likely to be a concern.==== Nevertheless, we also follow the strategy used in the literature (e.g., ====; ====) to mitigate potential reflection problem. We include a set of average characteristics of classmates and/or preschool attendees to control for the contextual effects.====It is worth noting that a recent study of ==== conducted a work similar to ours. Using the same CEPS data, ==== finds significant effects of peers' enrollment in preschool on students' cognitive and noncognitive outcomes. Nevertheless, our work rather differs from that of ==== in at least three aspects. First, we explicitly distinguish the differences in preschool program duration among children in our specifications and quantify separately the external effects of classmates with different preschool experiences, while ==== does not. Our evidence indicates that ignoring this distinction may underestimate the external effects of preschool programs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to shed light on the dosage effects of attending a preschool program from the perspective of externalities.====Second, we offer two possible mechanisms that may drive the external effects besides the inter-student interactions emphasized in ====, and quantify the relative explanatory power of each mechanism, enriching our understanding of how children develop. Instead of looking at the relationship between class environment and preschool attendees, we provide direct evidence on the effects of exposure to preschool attendees on the behaviors of students, teachers and parents. We show that the external effects may be driven via teachers' positive responses to high-quality students in their classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that family-class interactions play an important role in education production. Based on the decomposition approach proposed by ==== and ====, we show that at least 7% of the explanatory power can be attributed to the latter two mechanisms.====Finally, we impose one more sample restriction than ==== to ensure the validity of the random class assignment setting. Specifically, we utilize the information from the head teacher questionnaire, and exclude the grades if the head teacher reports that students are grouped according to their test scores. In the comparison analyses, we follow ==== sample restriction procedures to generate replication samples which are nearly equivalent to that used in ====. The statistical tests indicate that ignoring this condition may lead to a violation of the random class assignment assumption.====Our estimation results demonstrate that students with a three-year preschool experience have sizable and positive external effects on cognitive outcomes of their fellow middle school classmates. On average, a 10% increase in the share of preschool attendees raises students' academic achievement and cognitive score by 0.049 and 0.067 ====, respectively. Exposure to classmates with a three-year preschool experience is also conducive to improving middle school students' mental health. These results are robust to a series of sensitivity tests. However, we do not find evidence that exposure to classmates with a shorter preschool duration has statistically significant positive effects on middle school students' outcomes. The findings suggest that it may be more efficient to prioritize prolonging preschool duration given the limited early education resources.====We provide evidence of three potential mechanisms driving the external effects. Students in a class with more preschool attendees are more likely to benefit from the improved interactions among students, between teachers and students, and between family and class. We also show that the external effects vary across groups. Girls tend to benefit more in the achievement of cognitive outcomes than boys, and boys benefit more in the relief of mental stress. Students with educated parents and preschool attendees also benefit more than their counterparts.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the early childhood education system in China. ==== describes the data and variables. ==== discusses the specifications and identification strategy. ==== reports the results of random assignment tests, baseline estimations and robustness checks. ==== discusses the possible mechanisms. ==== reports the heterogeneous effects. ==== concludes.",The externalities of preschool attendees in middle school classes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001547,29-Nov-22,2022,Research Article,82

Our study highlights a growing, but previously neglected, burden stemming from climate change.","). China also has a large and growing aging population who are prone to chronic diseases, many of whom require specialized treatments that are not covered by public healthcare. Many chronic diseases, especially those associated with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, are particularly sensitive to extreme temperatures (see e.g. ====; ====; ====).====Understanding the causal effect of extreme temperatures on out-of-pocket medical expenditure is crucial for at least three reasons. First, existing studies have consistently shown that exposure to extreme temperatures, particularly heat stress, can lead to higher rates of morbidity (====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and mortality (====; ====; ====; ====), both of which can be expected to significantly increase healthcare expenditure.==== The health impacts of climate change are arguably difficult to avoid. Unlike ambient air pollution, which can be avoided through simply wearing facemasks, the cost of shielding from ambient heat stress is potentially much higher; for instance, the use of air-conditioned transportation, such as private cars, which remain expensive and less prevalent in developing countries.====Second, out-of-pocket medical expenses are closely related to people's wellbeing. Large out-of-pocket medical expenditure impedes consumption (====) and is widely regarded as a major cause of impoverishment among patients, especially those suffering from chronic disease (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Third, when out-of-pocket medical expenditure exceeds what patients reasonably expect it should be, this can be a source of distrust and even conflict with physicians, both of which are growing concerns in China (====; ====). Healthcare providers in China are allowed to recover their cost by charging for services and the margins are higher for specialized treatments that are typically not covered by public healthcare. This also provides health providers with incentives to generate profits through, for example, over prescription or overtreatment, which impose heavy financial burdens on patients.====We link data on individual-level medical expenditure by respondents across three waves of the China Family Panel Study (CFPS), which is a nationally representative longitudinal survey administered between 2014 and 2018, to daily weather records from 820 weather stations situated across China. To capture potential nonlinear effects, we adopt a semi-parametric approach that divides the distribution of daily mean temperatures into a set of temperature bins and estimates their impact on out-of-pocket medical expenditure. We control for individual fixed effects, which enables us to identify the causal effect of daily temperature on medical expenditure using the plausibly exogeneous variation in the temperature distribution to which each respondent was exposed over time. Note that, our sample covers the record-breaking 2017 heatwave that occurred from the 21st to the 25th of July and saliently affected half of the national population (====). It significantly increases the observations of extreme warm days, and therefore, improves the identification of the temperature effect on medical expenditure at the high end of the temperature distribution (====).====We find that temperature exerts a nonlinear effect on out-of-pocket medical expenditure, but the effect is strongest at hotter temperatures. Extreme cold temperature, defined as daily mean temperature below ?7 degrees Celsius (¡ãC), increases out-of-pocket medical expenditure. Moderately warm temperature, in the range 16?¡ãC¨C21?¡ãC, increases out-of-pocket medical expenditure by 0.85%, relative to a day in the reference range 10?¡ãC¨C16?¡ãC. This effect grows progressively for higher temperatures and more than triples to 2.80% when the mean temperature is above 32?¡ãC. These baseline results are robust to a variety of ways to measure temperature and other sensitivity checks.====The baseline nonlinear pattern is heterogeneous across different cohorts. We find that both cold and heat stress impose a larger medical burden on males, possibly because they are more likely to work outdoors. Consistent with the results from epidemiological studies, we find that cold stress imposes a larger medical burden on elderly cohorts. We find that those who report being in poor health are less responsive to ambient stress, possibly because they have intentionally avoided being exposed to extreme temperatures. We also find that heat stress imposes a larger medical burden on rural and poor cohorts, implying that global warming may exacerbate income and rural-urban ====. Estimates across different public healthcare schemes provide consistent results that temperature effects are much larger among those enrolled in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), which is a scheme exclusively for the rural population. Finally, we uncover suggestive evidence of acclimatization, in which respondents in southern China are more tolerant to heat stress while northern respondents are more tolerant to cold stress.====We examine the mechanisms underpinning these results and find suggestive evidence that extreme temperatures increase the medical burden on households through impairing both physical and mental health. By exploiting detailed records on a set of daily activities of respondents in CFPS, we show that the established temperature¨Chealth relationship is mediated through sedentary activities and sleep disruption. We also find that extreme temperatures are positively related with proclivity to be in ==== and that energy poverty, in turn, is associated with adverse health impacts.====Combining our baseline estimates with daily temperature projections from eight very recent climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), used in the latest IPCC sixth assessment report, we simulate changes in future out-of-pocket medical expenditure due to climate change. We find that medical expenditure would increase by 2.290¨C6.149% in the medium term between 2041 and 2060, depending on policy interventions to curb ====. Given that both extreme heat and cold increases out-of-pocket medical expenditure, the moderate increase in out-of-pocket medical expenditure can be attributed to there being fewer extreme cold days in the future, which somewhat offset the effects of hotter days.====We contribute to the literature on the environment and medical expenses in three ways. First, we distinguish between the effect of temperature on public and private medical expenditure. Most existing studies that have examined the relationship between ambient temperature and medical expenses have focused on ==== medical expenditure and done so within the context of developed countries. For instance, ==== and ==== estimate total medical expenditure by multiplying average cost per each hospital visit by the number of visits predicted from their estimated temperature-morbidity relationship. Estimates using this approach, though, are subject to potentially large errors. More crucially, this approach does not differentiate between public and private medical expenditures, for which the underlying incentives are different for both patients and healthcare providers (====; ====). To the best of our knowledge, ==== is the only related study that makes a distinction between public and private medical expenditures. We differ from that study in other ways, which we detail below.====As the second contribution, we provide the estimates of projected out-of-pocket medical expenditure by the middle of this century due to global warming, using simulated daily temperatures from the latest climate models. These estimates are important because projections of the healthcare burden due to global warming is imperative to healthcare planning and lays the foundations for future healthcare reforms.====Finally, we also complement the studies that explore the effect of ambient air pollution on medical expenditure (see e.g. ====; ====; ====). While weather variables, including temperatures, are routinely controlled in these studies, none of them discuss and even report the estimated effects on medical expenditure. In our analysis, we incorporate air quality index (AQI) at the same spatial scale and instrument it with the strength of thermal inversions occurred in the same exposure window. While our horse race regression results demonstrate that air pollution exerts a larger effect than that of extreme temperatures, the aggregate burden stemming from climate change is arguably larger because of its global nature.====The closest study in the literature to ours is ====, who provide estimates of the aggregated effects of extreme temperatures on out-of-pocket medical expenditure, using inpatient visit claims from 47 Chinese cities.====We differ from ==== in important ways. The first is ==== focus exclusively on urban patients who arguably have access to more generous public healthcare. Our paper explores a nationally representative panel; in which, nearly two-thirds of respondents are from more vulnerable, rural households, who used to cover the much of medical burden themselves Second, ==== only consider individuals who have been charged and, therefore, recorded by healthcare providers, which may induce selection bias along health status. This issue is mitigated in our paper as we study a sample of randomly selected individuals and their reported out-of-pocket medical expenditure are not necessarily paid to healthcare provider (e.g. private pharmacy). Third, we use an individual-level panel which enables us to control for individual fixed effects. ==== employ cross-sectional administrative data, which cannot control for time-invariant individual attributes (====; ====). These individual attributes, however, are crucial in that they are strongly related to one's innate health and, therefore, susceptibility to temperature shocks. Fourth, unlike ====, we examine the channels through which temperature influences out-of-pocket medical expenditure and find that temperature changes contribute to increases in time engaged in sedentary activities, sleep disruption and energy poverty, which adversely affect physical and mental health. Fifth, ==== do not we provide estimates of the projected out-of-pocket medical expenditure due to global warming.====Our main findings are different than ==== in terms of both the focus and magnitude of the estimates. They find that an additional warm day would generate two billion RMB additional medical expenditure nationwide; of which, 0.2 billion RMB would be borne by patients themselves. By contrast, we provide individual-level estimates, suggesting that patients and their families have to pay at least 181.89 RMB for each extreme warm day.",Extreme temperatures and out-of-pocket medical expenditure: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001523,28-Nov-22,2022,Research Article,83

We propose a new approach to identify China's monetary policy shocks using high-frequency surprises based on treasury futures around monetary policy announcements as external instruments. We then estimate the dynamic effect of monetary policy shocks on corporate real investment using a rich firm-level data of all listed non-financial firms in China. We find that an unexpected monetary policy easing boosts firms' investment expenditures with heterogeneous dynamic responses across firms: small-sized firms have quicker responses than large-sized firms, especially for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). We show that sales revenue response could be the channel through which monetary policy shock transmits to non-SOEs' investment expenditures in China."," However, we still have relatively limited understanding of monetary policy transmission in emerging economies like China. There exist substantial institutional differences between advanced and emerging economies which pose challenges to the investigation on monetary policy transmission.====Recently, there is a growing body of literature on how China's monetary policy influences the world's second largest economy and credit (mis)allocation (====; ====; ====; ====). On the one hand, institutional changes in China¡¯ monetary framework, i.e., a shift from quantity-based to price-based monetary policy in recent decades, might have led the monetary policy transmission mechanism to become more similar to the U.S. and other developed economies (====). On the other hand, China's monetary policy could have complex, heterogeneous effects on firm's capital expenditures due to the presence of (more) less financially-constrained (non) state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Yet, there has been much debate about the transmission of China's monetary policy shocks to corporate real investment and firm-level evidence remains elusive.====We use recent firm-level panel data to evaluate the effect of monetary policy shocks on corporate real investment across heterogeneous Chinese firms. A first challenge is to estimate the surprise component in China's monetary policy. We propose a new approach to identify the exogenous monetary policy surprises by adapting the high-frequency approach in ==== This approach introduces high-frequency financial market information to capture exogenous disturbances from monetary policy announcements. Compared to other methods (e.g., ====), our approach accommodates institutional features of China's monetary policy arrangements by bridging the gap between China's (irregular) monetary policy announcements and continuous monetary policy indicator (7-day repo rate), and generating a continuous and comprehensive time series of monetary policy shocks.====Then, we use the local projection approach (====) to investigate dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks, that is, to non-parametrically estimate impulse response functions of real investments based on a rich firm-level dataset of all listed non-financial firms from 2007 to 2021. By real investment, we mean firms' capital expenditures. Compared to the panel vector autoregression, the local projection approach is more flexible with a large dataset and more robust for complex situations. The combination of the proxy-VAR and the instrumental variable local projection (LP-IV) method==== allows us to address the potential endogeneity and estimate dynamic effects.====We establish four main empirical findings. First, firms' investment expenditures are boosted after an unexpected monetary policy expansion. This is consistent with the previous literature (e.g., ====; ====). It also demonstrates that market-based monetary policy has become more effective in China, consistent with ====. More importantly, there are two peak effects in the impulse response (in the second and fourth years). Specifically, the real investment rate of all listed non-financial firms increases significantly by at most 0.13% in the first two years following a 1% unexpected increase in the M2 growth rate. Another peak of a statistically significant increase of 0.08% in the real investment rate is observed about four years after the shock.====Second, we divide firms into groups according to their size, which is a proxy for financial constraint as in ====. We find that small-sized firms increase the investment rate by 0.17% in the second year of the shock and the influence of monetary policy gradually fades, while the first significant response of investment of larger firms emerges in the fourth year. This dynamic pattern is new to the literature and robust if we use firm age as the proxy for financial constraints as in ====.====Third, we examine the ownership of firms. We find that SOEs bring forward real investment decisions in the first year of the monetary policy shock, and the effect dies out in subsequent periods. The immediate impact on SOEs is consistent and comparable with the empirical findings in ==== and ====. However, impulse response functions of non-SOEs present an interesting bimodal pattern: the investment rate of non-SOEs increases by 0.18% on average following a 1% unexpected increase of the M2 growth rate in the first year of the monetary shock, and non-SOEs present a second peak with a 0.23% increase of investment rate in the later period.====Fourth, we further examine different groups of non-SOE firms. We find that small-sized non-SOEs have the largest response in the first two years of the monetary policy changes, while the larger non-SOEs respond dramatically four years after the shock with no significantly positive response in the first three years. These results demonstrate that financially constrained small-sized firms, especially non-SOEs, would present quicker responses while less financially constrained firms follow in later periods. While previous studies focus on the behavior of SOE firms, our empirical results about non-SOE firms are new to the literature.====, credit, and asset price channels. The empirical results show that none of these channels could explain the empirical pattern. We then check the (indirect) channel of sales revenue, and find that non-SOEs invest more due to the effect of boosting market demand and improving operation status during monetary expansion. Moreover, the differences between the responses in sales revenue of smaller non-SOEs and larger non-SOEs drives the impulse response pattern of non-SOEs. In the Appendix B, we develop a stylized heterogeneous firm model to simultaneously explain these empirical findings.====This paper contributes to the estimation of China's monetary policy shocks. A traditional measure for China's monetary policy in empirical studies is the growth rate of broad money supply (M2).==== Some of recent studies estimate a Markov regime-switching M2 rule and use the residuals as the shocks (====; ====). However, this method utilizes a small information set and is vulnerable to model misspecification of monetary policy rule. Few recent papers use high-frequency identification such as ==== and ====, and tend to directly use price changes as monetary policy shocks.==== Our identification strategy provides a new attempt to capture the sudden change of market expectation around the monetary policy announcements, and contributes to the methods of extracting China's monetary policy shocks. Moreover, our approach provides a complete series of monetary policy surprises when monetary policy announcements are irregular, and therefore, can supplement to the application of high-frequency identification method (====; ====; ====) in China.====Second, our study provides a nice complement to the literature on the monetary policy's impact on the real economy in China. In the past two decades, there has been considerable macro-level empirical research on the effectiveness of, and the transmission mechanisms for, China's monetary policy on aggregate corporate investment.==== However, most of the research with a macroeconomic perspective uses relatively small dataset and conventional time-series analysis methods, which are not suitable for distinguishing the effects between firms with different characteristics. Given the importance of firm heterogeneity,==== a new branch of micro-level empirical literature has emerged and provided some evidence on how China's monetary policy influences the corporate investment of firms with different characteristics. According to the literature, firms' cash holdings, inventory levels, asset¨Cliability ratios, and political connections can influence the sensitivities of corporate investment to changes in monetary policy (====; ====; ====). While existing works focus overwhelmingly on the monetary policy's impact on SOE firms (e.g., ====; ====; ====), we add to the literature by examining the monetary policy transmission on the capital expenditures of non-SOE firms.====Third, our study is related to the broad literature on the high-frequency identification of monetary policy shocks and its applications. The recent studies utilizing high-frequency identification provide new empirical results on monetary policy transmission (====; ====; ====; ====), and re-examine the conventional theories of monetary policy transmission. They also investigate how monetary policy shocks influence corporate investments and study the role of financial frictions and firm heterogeneity (====; ====; ====). Our empirical results in China complement to this strand of literature by examining the monetary policy transmission of the second largest economy.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. ==== describes the institutional background and the empirical framework including the proxy-VAR and LP-IV methods. ==== provides the main empirical results and systematic analysis on the firm's heterogeneous response to monetary policy easing. ==== contains further analysis to investigate the monetary policy transmission mechanism. ==== concludes the paper.====Note: Responses of the CPI, IP, and time spread to an unexpected 1% increase in China's 7-day repo rate.

However, as other ==== join the carbon market in China, the uncertainty and impact of it on the power industry are still under explored. Here, we define the industry-wide scenarios which power industry might confront in the carbon market. Then, we compare its economic output, market activity and environmental impact under initial carbon quota allocation principles based on efficiency and grandfather methods by the comprehensive evaluation model of energy and carbon markets combined with inverse DEA method. Our results show that when the power industry is in an advantageous position, the efficiency method is fairer and more efficient than the grandfather method. The potential economic output rate has more than doubled compared to that of the grandfather method. Market activity and emission reduction potential are 7% and 25% more than that in the grandfather principle, respectively. Nevertheless, when the power industry is in a disadvantageous position, the efficiency method leads to an imbalance between power supply and demand in the market and power shortages in 19 regions. Then the trading activity of the power market drops by 12%, resulting in serious economic loss, especially in China's eastern region (?7.29%). The economic risk caused by the grandfather method has been significantly reduced than that of the efficiency method. And there may be greater potential risks under the efficiency method. This study identifies the potential challenges and obstacles of future carbon market and addresses the urgency of policy to tackle this issue to facilitate a carbon market that operates robustly under uncertainty.","In 2020, General Secretary Xi solemnly announced at the general debate of the 75th United Nations General Assembly that China will increase its nationally determined contributions (NDC) and adopt stronger policies and measures to achieve carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 (====). CO====, in the power industry, accounts for a large proportion of total carbon emissions in China (====). Achieving the ¡°dual carbon¡± goal is an uphill battle and an unprecedented challenge in major carbon reduction technologies and management. It is necessary to promote the optimal allocation and efficient utilization of green and low-carbon electricity resources and comprehensively promote the exchange and sharing of new green and low-carbon experiences, technologies, methods, and business forms in the power industry.====; ====Currently, the different allocation methods have been discussed (====; ====; ====; ====), in which the comparison between the efficiency method and grandfather method is widely investigated (====; ====; ====). However, their conclusions obtained are basically based on the discussion of results without considering uncertainty risks. Subjects have different positions in the market, the advantage of bidding and the disadvantage of bidding, which will bring different results, thus causing risks. Uncertainty analysis is extremely important in assessing risk (====; ====), and different principles of CO==== quota allocation will have varied consequences in uncertain markets. According to the previous studies (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), the CO==== marginal abatement cost of the power industry is low, and the electricity price is low (set by the government). Therefore, we cannot take the advantage position of power market for granted. When the power industry is at a disadvantage position in the carbon market, some plant may not to be able to buy enough carbon quotas to supply the demand of power, resulting in an overall loss of social welfare. Under uncertainties, potential risks of different allocation principles on economic development and the environmental impact on each region have not been sufficiently studied. It is necessary to consider the potential risks brought by different allocation principles under different uncertainty scenarios for future policy reference.====Meanwhile, the existing literature mainly discusses the impact of different distribution principles on fairness and efficiency. We take fairness and efficiency as the criteria to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of CO==== quota distribution. (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The criteria may not fully cover the impact of carbon quota allocation on economy, market activity and environment. Which are vital in the transition towards carbon neutrality. Under uncertainty, will there be any deviation in the evaluation indicators of fairness and efficiency? Further investigation is in urgent need. This paper focuses on the uncertainty of the future electricity market in the carbon market, and we define this uncertainty from the perspective of its competitiveness. We define advantages and disadvantages position of the future electricity market in the carbon market, and investigate the potential economic, electricity market and environmental risks of different allocation principles under uncertainty scenarios.====Here, we first define the advantage and disadvantage of the power industry in the carbon market. To determine the position of the power industry in the carbon market transaction, that is, the power with bidding and the power without bidding, this paper employs the carbon shadow price in economics to measure the bidding ability. Meanwhile, we also infer the advantage position and the disadvantaged position in the carbon market. Subsequently, to evaluate different distribution principles, we compare the differences between the grandfather and efficiency methods in quota allocation, equity, and efficiency. Further, to explore the impact of different distribution principles on regional trading behavior in the carbon market and electricity market, considering the uncertainty scenario analysis of the energy and carbon markets, we compare the differences in potential economic growth, electricity market activity, and emission reduction space of different allocation principles.====The contributions of this study are as follows. First, theoretically, we define the advantage and disadvantage of the power industry based on the marginal abatement cost and employ it as the basis for future national carbon market uncertainty projection. Second, methodically, we put forward a comprehensive evaluation model of energy and carbon markets combined with inverse DEA method to analyze the power industry in the future carbon market. Moreover, the impact of the grandfather and efficiency methods on equity, efficiency, potential economic growth, market activity, and emission reduction potential have been measured under the advantage position. Meanwhile, the gap between power supply and demand and carbon reduction potential are compared and the economic losses caused by power shortage are analyzed through the inverse DEA model under the disadvantaged position. Third, empirically, we measure the impact of initial carbon quota allocation principles over 30 provinces in China under the uncertainty of the electricity market and projections regarding transaction risks and economic losses have been made; then, the policy implications have been put forward.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

However, due to limited data about PLAs, this issue is rarely investigated and thus the negative impact is hardly measured. In this paper we introduce a new proxy for measuring the approximate level of PLA related business in a specific city, PLA hospital score, to identify cities that are more affected by PLA related business closure. We then employ a difference-in-differences (DID) framework and show that PLA related business closure does bring positive effects to China¡¯s local economy, about a 2% increase in GDP growth per year. We also find that this effect is more significant in cities with median economic size and cities that rely more on secondary and tertiary sectors. We finally provide a possible channel of this effect, which mainly works through providing a more efficient and competitive market to local private firms as well as an investment-friendly environment that attracts foreign investments.","The rapid economic growth in China after the Reform and Opening Up has been discussed extensively for so long. While we are amazed at China¡¯s economic boom, some serious problems also arose during that period, which dampened the economic development in some areas. From the point of view of ====While we are investigating whether PLA related business closure brings positive effects to the local economy, we find it difficult to acquire all the relevant information about PLA related business, which remains secret now for some reason. Therefore we propose one novel and intuitive proxy: the proportion of PLA hospitals in one specific city. The basic intuition is that a higher proportion of PLA hospitals might indicate that more troops are stationed in this city, and more PLA related activities as well. Hence there is a higher probability for PLA related enterprises to locate there and influence the local economy.====Following this logic, we begin by collecting city-level hospital data in China and other relevant city-level data. We then use our built weighted proportion of PLA hospitals to distinguish between cities in the treated and control group and use a difference-in-differences (DID) framework to analyze the effect of PLA related business closure.====Our empirical results show that, after PLA related business closure in 1998, cities in the treated group exhibited higher GDP and real GDP growth compared to cities in the control group, about 2% per year. Our main results are still robust when we use different measures to build up treated and control groups, use another economic indicator instead of GDP growth, and use subsamples to exclude some other potential biases. We also perform parallel trend tests and placebo tests, and they support the validity of our DID strategy. These tests together provide evidence that PLA related business had negative effects on the local economy, and thus the closure is rather beneficial.====One might be cautious whether our results are caused by sample selection bias and other unobserved factors that raise the issue of endogeneity. We thus also employ a ==== (PSM) method, along with an instrument variable (IV) method. These tests further indicate that our results are insensitive to endogeneity.====We also attempt to investigate deeper to see which cities will be affected more. Our heterogeneity tests indicate a larger effect on cities with median economic size and cities that rely more on secondary and tertiary sectors. We argue that large cities already built a relatively complete economic structure, while small cities are too small to attract much PLA related business. Hence cities with median economic size are more prone to this negative effect. What is more, PLA enterprises are mainly in secondary and tertiary sectors, so cities that rely more on these sectors are more influenced.====We finally attempt to exploit potential channels that link PLA related business closure with better development of the local economy. We find that (1) cities in the treated group show a higher number of signed foreign investment contracts, as well as the investment amount after the closure; (2) cities in the treated group have higher growth in the number of local industrial enterprises, as well as the total EBITs of these firms. These results together indicate that after PLA related business closure, the local economy gradually transforms into a more efficient, competitive market, which benefits other local firms, as well as an investment-friendly environment that attracts foreign investments. They together promote the development of the local economy.==== and ==== who study the determinants of military spending and its impact on income inequality. ==== theoretically analyzes the emergence and the impact of military dictatorships.

They enjoy privileged access to capital, a lower interest, and a monopolistic position so these SOEs distort market competition, and bring a negative impact on China¡¯s economic growth. ==== empirically finds that inefficient SOEs absorb more than 50% fixed investments, and this misallocation impedes the growth of private firms, as well as the whole of China¡¯s economy. ==== further measures the TFP losses due to this misallocation, and finds that it also leads to an increase in capital market distortions. ==== provides another explanation that SOEs enjoy a soft budget constraint (SBC), where they receive government subsidies that are indeed from other private firms. This SBC not only results in inefficiency but also hinders other private firms. Our research provides a more specific example where, as we mention later, PLA related business can be regarded as a special kind of SOE. They indeed enjoy more privileges than typical SOEs, thus creating a larger market distortion. Our empirical results coincide with previous research that this special kind of SOEs does harm the local economy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ==== introduces the whole history of PLA related business. Section ==== detailedly explains our designed proxy for PLA related business.

Sharply different attitudes toward the proposed extradition law by the Hong Kong SAR Government in 2019 and related issues were observed among some residents in mainland China and Hong Kong. While firms such as Cathay Pacific Airways expressed support of the government, it was perceived by some of its customers in mainland China that the firm was hostile to them due to the views expressed by some of its staff based in Hong Kong. In this paper, we estimate the impact of such perceived divergent staff political attitudes on consumer demand. Using a triple differences design that controls for changes in market demand and supply conditions, we find that passenger volumes from mainland China were adversely affected for Cathay Pacific, leading to a monthly decrease of approximately 20%, after contentious political views of some of its staff were widely reported in mainland China. However, the negative effects subside within a quarter. Further analysis reveals heterogeneity in consumer responses by regions, with passengers from South East Asia or countries having closer migration or trade ties with mainland China behaving similarly with those from mainland China.","). As geopolitical tensions are rising, multinational firms face special challenges. Stakeholders of firms include owners, managers, employees, customers, the public, the government, etc. For firms that operate in multiple markets, their stakeholders may have divergent views on some contentious issues. The economic incentives of various stakeholders and their impacts on firm performance have received much attention in the literature (====). However, less is known when the stakeholders have divergent beliefs on social or political issues, or whether consumers¡¯ heterogeneous perceptions about the event shape their responses. The possibility that employee behavior or value may not be aligned with those of the company represents a new challenge to multinational firms and few studies have examined its impact.====In this paper, we examine the impact of divergent staff and customer values on consumer demand for multinational firms by focusing on the impacts of the events surrounding the proposed extradition law by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government in 2019 on companies, specifically, Cathay Pacific Airways which is an airline based in Hong Kong with a wide domestic and international flight network. The protests and civil unrest in Hong Kong in 2019 were initially sparked by an extradition law proposed by the Hong Kong SAR government but quickly grew in size and more political demands were raised. While it was reported that millions of people participated in the protests in Hong Kong, the protests were received mostly negatively in mainland China. During the events, Cathay Pacific Airways expressed strong support of the government, but some of its staff including flight attendants and ==== were perceived to be sympathetic to the protesters. We use the flight travel data of Cathay Pacific Airways to examine the impact of perceived divergent staff political attitudes that are contrary to the stance of the company on consumer demand.====One unique feature of the data is that we observe for each route and airline, where the flight tickets were sold, which allows us to use a triple differences model to cleanly identify the effects of ==== against Cathay Pacific when the flight travel market were also affected by the events in Hong Kong. Controlling for the changing conditions in the travel market as a result of the protests is important because the protests also caused significant disruptions in the travel sector, resulting in a substantial number of flight cancellations, among others. The observation on the location of sale of the tickets also allows us to analyze how consumer responses to the political event vary between countries, which is important, because consumer responses in regions outside mainland China are less likely to be confounded by the effects of government directives.====We find evidence of consumer boycotts against Cathay Pacific by travelers from mainland China. Fewer flight passengers from mainland China chose Cathay Pacific after it was widely reported in mainland China in 2019 August that some Cathay Pacific staff were sympathetic to the protesters, with decreases in passenger volume reaching around 35%. Among 19 passenger source regions around the world used in the analysis, only South East Asia displayed similar declines. The boycotts were stronger for business travelers and passengers traveling away from Hong Kong. However, the negative effects were temporary and became insignificant by 2020 January. Longer-term analysis could not be performed due to the large disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions.====We contribute to the literature in three main ways. First, we examine boycotts against actions of the employees. Most boycotts against products of a country or company are for the actions taken by the country or company, and these have received most attention in the literature. We examine the impact on consumer demand when the values of its employees do not align with those of its customers, even if the official stance of the company aligns with the customer. The results hold lessons for multinational firms in the current geopolitical environment. Second, we provide timely analysis on one aspect of the economic consequences of the 2019 Hong Kong unrest. We use micro level travel data and a triple differences empirical strategy to cleanly identify consumer boycotts against Cathay Pacific controlling for the effects of the unrest on the travel market. Third, we show that the same political event can elicit heterogeneous consumer responses in different countries and we examine factors such as migration and trade that can explain the differences, which add to the literature on the effects of social and economic activities on public opinions (====, ====, ====).====Boycott is a kind of trade disruptions which can be voluntary (====, ====) or state directed. Boycotts include instrumental boycotts organized by activists advancing certain demands (====, ====, ====), and expressive boycotts by individuals that express emotions and advocate based on personal values (====). Consumer boycotts refer to the boycott of a certain product or service by consumers, which can be the result of domestic or international political conflicts (====, ====). Researches on political conflicts and associated consumer boycotts have been extensive. Some examples include Chinese consumers boycotting Japanese products during the Japanese aggression in the 1930s (====), Chinese consumers boycotting Japanese products due to the Sino-Japanese disputes (====, ====), Chinese consumers boycotting French cars during the 2008 Olympic Games (====), US Consumers boycotting French products (especially wine) (====, ====, ====) and Arab countries boycotting US goods (====) due to the Iraq war.====Political tensions can also affect the trading decisions of firms. ==== studies the effects of several boycotts which includes the boycott of Danish goods in Muslim countries due to the Muhammad Comic Crisis and Turkey¡¯s boycott of Israel over the Gaza conflict in 2014. ==== show that the intensive margins of imports respond more to political tensions between China and its trade partners surrounding the official meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama, and there are heterogeneities by trade modes and firm ownership types. ==== examine multiple instances of bilateral conflicts on Chinese imports and highlight the role of firm ownership and goods characteristics. ==== use Japanese tourism data to show that the boycotts of Korean consumers due to Japanese restrictions on exports of semiconductors and display panels to South Korea have impact on the Japanese tourism market. Besides boycotts, other types of trade disruptions can have more explicit state involvement, such as tariffs and export bans (====, ====, ====). An extreme form of political conflicts is war which not only disrupts trade in the short term, but can have long term negative effects on trade between the parties involved even several generations later (====).====To date, many instances of boycott were caused by offending behaviors of countries or firms, and much research has focused on the motivations and the effectiveness of consumer boycotts. Boycotts can damage the image of the targeted firm to a certain extent (====, ====) and have a negative impact on their financial performance (====). Some studies have found that consumer boycotts have caused a significant decline in company stock prices (====, ====). In terms of the effectiveness of boycotts, ==== points out that economic pressure, image pressure and policy commitment are the determinants of whether a boycott is effective. Consumer boycotts are considered as an agency problem whose effectiveness depends on the majority of participants, but every individual¡¯s motivation to participate and influence is very low (====, ====). These theoretical studies suggest that consumer boycotts may only be effective in the short term. ==== and ==== empirically illustrate the short-run nature of consumer boycotts.====The paper is organized as follows: Section ==== provides background information about the Hong Kong protests in 2019 and describes the data. Section ==== describes the empirical strategy in identifying the effects of consumer boycotts. Section ==== reports the empirical results.

Traditional explanations suggest that setting experimental zones is for loss-control or resistance-minimization. In this paper, we provide an alternative rationale that emphasizes the ¡°screening effect¡± of experimental zones: when proposals¡ªwhose qualities are unknown to the central government (principal)¡ªare proposed by informed local officials (agents), providing support gradually over time rather than all at once reduces the local governments' incentives to propose low-quality projects, resulting in a higher proportion of high-quality projects in equilibrium. The main tradeoff facing the central government is between better screening and delayed implementation of good projects. We show that when the central government is more patient, or good projects exhibit a larger positive externality, the reform speed, measured by initial support level, decreases while the reform scale, measured by the number of approved projects, increases. As the negative consequence of bad projects becomes higher, however, both reform speed and scale decrease, implying a steady but stagnant reform. By contrast, in a benchmark case without ==== between the central and local governments, the optimal initial support is either minimal or full and does not depend on the externality.","Experimental zones are widespread across economies. Nearly three-quarters of all countries have such zones (====), and they are common in developing as well as developed countries (====). Moreover, many researchers attribute China's huge economic success to the experience of setting experimental zones (e.g., ====). Understanding the rationale behind the success of experimental zones is thus essential.====Traditional literature focuses on the benefits of experimental zones as cost-saving (by trial and error) and policy laboratories. In this paper, we propose an alternative theory from the incentive perspective based on two features of experimental zones that are essential in China's experience. First, while local authorities have vital information of potential projects, they also need support from the central authority. The combination of bottom-up proposal and top-down support is a feature that is largely missing in the literature.==== Second, the support is provided gradually over time: even in one local area, the support is provided partially at the beginning, with small fractions rather than all at once.==== received further approval/support from the central government to be implemented citywide in Chengdu in 2009¨C10, and then expanded to the rest 164 counties in Sichuan province in 2016.==== In other words, even within an experiment zone, a reform still proceeds in stages. Then, with the successful experience of piloting regions, the land reform expands to 2828 counties country-wide in another five years (from 2013 to 2018).====The bottom-up approach naturally brings up an agency-issue, i.e., local governments may not have the incentives to propose the ¡°right¡± projects. We emphasize in this paper that the second feature, i.e., support given gradually rather than all at once, may help the central government solve the agency issue at least partially.====Specifically, we build a principal-agent model in which each agent (local government) has a project and chooses whether to propose it. The friction is asymmetric information: the quality of a projects is privately known by the local government. While the central government concerns the quality of a project, the local governments only care about the amount of supports that they can get.====A key equilibrium feature of this model is ====: supports to each approved project is provided gradually in multiple periods, rather than all at once. In particular, besides from choosing the ==== (i.e., how many proposals to approve), the central government also chooses the ==== (i.e., how much support to provide in an initial, ¡°experimenting,¡± period). After an experiment is carried out, the quality of the corresponding project will be revealed, and the central government may continue to support good projects.====The central government, when choosing the initial supporting level, faces the tradeoff between better screening and delayed implementation of projects. A smaller initial support lowers the incentives of the local governments to propose bad projects, which leads to better screening. However, it also means that a larger portion of the (good) projects have to be delayed.====We show that when the central government is more patient or the good projects have larger externality, the equilibrium reform speed decreases and the reform scale increases, resulting in a better screening and larger-scale reform. However, when central authority suffers more from a bad project, both the reform speed and scale decrease, implying a steady but relatively stagnant reform.====The previous literature already noticed the important role played by the central government in shaping local officials' incentives (e.g., ====). Our paper complements the literature by assuming that the central government has limited reward and punishment ability. Our mechanism also echoes what ==== described the Chinese system as a ¡°regionally decentralized authoritarian regime.¡± Relatedly, ==== compare M-form and U-form organization and examine their impact on experimentation. We take the organizational form as given, and focus on the potential impact of choosing experimentation policy on local officials' incentives. We also add to the more recent literature that tries to unravel the economic success of autocracies (====).====This paper is also related with a large literature on decentralization (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Different from that literature, our focus is not on setting the optimal degree of decentralization, but on the optimal mechanism that a central government can use to elicit information when its punishment power is limited.====We will apply the techniques of monotone comparative statics (e.g. ====). To do so, we first introduce some useful definition and lemma.====Now we are prepared to prove the comparative statics results presented in the main text:",A screening perspective on experimental zones,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001390,12-Nov-22,2022,Research Article,88

This article studies how different types of industrial agglomeration contribute to haze pollution. Based on a panel data of 264 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2016, a spatial ==== was adopted to analyze the related variety and unrelated variety impact on haze pollution and further investigate the moderating effect of technological innovation. The results show that: (1) There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between related variety and haze pollution, however, the overall variety aggravates haze pollution. (2) Technological innovation can significantly alleviate haze pollution, and the level of technological innovation can strengthen the inverted U-shaped relationship between variety and haze pollution.","Haze pollution has been a serious environmental issue with China's economic development in the past four decades (====). In 2013, the average number of haze days in China was 30?days. The frequent haze weather involved more than 100 large and medium-sized cities in 25 provinces. The 2016 Global Urban Pollution Database (from the World Health Organization) displays that 30 of the world's top 100 cities with the worst air quality (PM====).====Although the existing literature has drawn the conclusion that adjusting the industrial structure is an effective way to reduce pollution on the premise of ensuring a certain amount of economic growth (====; ==== pointed out, most of the studies only consider adjusting the inter-industrial structure while ignoring the spatial structure of industry. Given that industrial agglomeration is an important identification method of industrial spatial structure (====), this paper studies the direct relationship between industrial agglomeration and haze pollution.====Further, the existing literature shows ambiguous results regarding the impact of industrial agglomeration on pollution. Some scholars believe that industrial agglomeration aggravates environmental pollution (====; ====; ====). Others find that industrial agglomeration can alleviate air pollution (====; ====; ====). Moreover, some studies have shown that the relationship between agglomeration and pollution is nonlinear (====; ====; ====; ====; and ====). A closely related paper ==== further finds that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between agglomeration and haze pollution. The possible reason for these inconclusive results is that existing studies have not considered the heterogeneity of industrial agglomeration.====). In contrast to this, enterprises in areas with less inter-industry correlation (unrelated variety) do not have such advantages (====). Therefore, ignoring the heterogeneity of industrial agglomeration will make its impact on pollution unclear.====This paper decomposes the internal structure of industrial agglomeration into related and unrelated varieties, and examines their impact on haze pollution. Following ====Therefore, the main contribution can be summarized in the following three aspects. First, it decomposes the industrial agglomeration into related and unrelated types, and finds different patterns of haze pollution between these two types of agglomeration. Specifically, the related type of industrial agglomeration shows an inverted U-shaped relationship between related variety and haze pollution. This is not the case for the unrelated type. This helps us understand the ambiguous results found in previous studies: the externalities produced by different types of agglomeration are different (====), and thus the impact on the environment will also be different (====; ====). Second, this paper takes the level of technological innovation as an exogenous factor, and analyzes how the related effects of agglomeration and technological innovation affect air pollution. Literature indicates that technological innovation is one of the important mechanisms affecting production efficiency and air quality, and that technological innovation has an important impact on the relationship between industrial agglomeration and air quality (====; ====). Compared with other research (====; ====), this paper finds that the level of technological innovation plays a moderating role in the relationship between related variety and air pollution. Finally, although previous studies have explored the relationship between agglomeration and air pollution, air pollution indicators usually chosen include SO==== CO====, and nitrogen oxides (====; ====). When these harmful gases are discharged into the air, they will further undergo chemical reactions and eventually form haze pollution. Therefore, the study of the relationship between industrial agglomeration and haze pollution adds a more comprehensive study to the existing literature (Li et al.,2021; ====).====The remainder of this paper proceeds according to the following structure. ==== discusses the impact mechanism of industrial agglomeration on haze pollution.

As such, we conduct a systematic literature review to consolidate existing evidence, and examine which factors are most important in driving individuals' and households' climate adaptation and mitigation behaviors in developing countries. A comprehensive literature search yields 58 empirical studies, and 158 usable analyses with which we conduct a vote-counting exercise. We first find evidence of climate ==== as adoption of adaptation behaviors are strongly driven by income. Furthermore, this inequality is likely to exacerbate as most adaptation behaviors (e.g., air-conditioners) emit high levels of GHG. A second major observation is that education and environmental knowledge (rather than income) are more important drivers for climate mitigation behaviors. The two findings mean that in order to reduce climate inequality, policymakers should target and assist vulnerable population according to their ability to adapt, and also implement more intensive educational outreach and information campaigns to encourage individuals and households to adopt GHG mitigation activities.","; ====; ====; ====). As skillfully summarized by ====, failure to mitigate is mostly due to vested interests that exist within governments and corporations.====In turn, there are now increasing calls to re-focus efforts toward the grassroot level (i.e., on individuals and households) to pursue a less carbon-intensive lifestyle (====; ====). Such an approach makes intuitive sense as individuals and households are responsible for 17% of carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions worldwide (====). Being the final consumer, the public is also indirectly responsible for emissions in the transportation and industrial sectors (====). In this regard, effective reduction in GHG emissions depends crucially on inducing behavioral changes in the public to reduce their carbon footprint (====).====However, shifting the responsibility of GHG mitigation to the public does not mean that earlier dilemmas will dissipate.====; ====).==== This is especially true as GHG emissions are typically highly correlated with income and socioeconomic status even at the individual level (====; ====). Similarly, in the manner that richer countries can better insulate themselves from climate change, climate inequality is also manifested through impacts for individuals as there are conclusive evidence showing that wealthier residents can better adapt to climate change through costly investments in protective or defensive expenditures, e.g., air-conditioners, water, heating, migration, etc. (====; ====; ====; ====).====Second, just as countries have a battery of policy options with respect to climate change (e.g., reduce greenhouse gases emissions, strengthen coastlines, etc.), there are also many ways in which individuals or households can react toward climate change. For instance, they can choose to engage in climate mitigation behaviors by adopting carbon-friendly behaviors such as switching to public transport or electric vehicles, consuming more plant-based food, recycling and reducing overall consumption. ==== found that German households that were previously exposed to floods showed more interest in purchasing electricity from renewable sources. On the other hand, individuals can also elect for climate adaptation actions to better protect themselves from adverse impacts of climate change or extreme weather events. For example, ==== showed using aggregated data that ownership of air conditioners increases in Chinese cities that had abnormally hot summer in the preceding year.====Toward this end, individuals protecting the environment (mitigation) or protecting themselves from the environmental harms (adaptation) is not a new phenomenon as many disciplines and fields (most notably, environmental economics) have introduced frameworks to examine such behaviors in the context of issues such as pollution and forest conservation (e.g., see ==== for an overview of such methods and framework). Even though there are many insights from existing literature into the interaction between individuals' behaviors and their environment, an important point of departure is that threats from climate change are different from other environmental harms in several ways.====First, unlike air pollution and most other environmental problems that pose health threats, the harms from climate change are not as direct and immediate (====). As such, the decision-making process of individuals may deviate from conventional models predicting adoption of protective measures. Second and related, there are many controversies behind the science of climate change, ranging from causes to the extent of impacts (====; ====; ====; ====). Taken together with the first point, this means that the motivation behind individuals' responses to climate change may largely depend on one's inherent knowledge and preferences. Third and importantly, a distinction between climate change and other environmental problems is that individuals can choose to either lessen their impacts via reducing carbon footprint or alleviate the impact on climate change on themselves.====As both sets of behaviors are resource intensive and have diametrically opposite outcomes on climate change, it thus becomes an important policy question to understand the drivers or motivations behind them.====In this regard, the purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the motivations behind individuals' and households' climate mitigation and adaptation behaviors toward to climate change, with a specific focus on developing countries. There are several reasons why such a study is sorely needed.====First and most importantly, climate inequality is fast emerging as an important consideration as it becomes increasingly clear that the impacts of climate change are distributed unevenly across the socioeconomic spectrum (====). Put differently, individuals and households that have the economic means and knowhow to adapt to extreme weather and changing climate are less impacted by climate change. As such, uncovering the broad population factors and trends behind adoption of climate adaptations can help governments better identify and assist citizens vulnerable to climate change.====Second and related, our dual focus on adaptation and mitigation behaviors introduces a previously unconsidered dimension to climate inequality. That is, to the extent that climate adaptation helps insulate one from the adverse impacts of climate change, they also emit considerable GHG emissions to exacerbate the problem (====; ====). Conversely, while climate mitigation behaviors do not offer direct protection, they help reduce the likelihood of severe climate change. This situation depicts moral hazard where individuals and households are skewed toward behaviors and actions that increase risk for others. Policymakers can design interventions and program to help channel more people toward climate mitigation if they have clearer understanding of the driving factors behind these behaviors.====Third, we gather and summarize evidence from developing countries because even though the effects of climate change are projected to be worst in these parts of the world, there are relatively fewer studies focusing on them (====; ====). According to latest available data, there were over 9000 and 10,000 publications on climate change specific to North America and Europe for the period of 2000 to 2010. On the other hand, Asia with around 60% of the world's population has around 8000 publications for the corresponding period (====).==== In this regard, a review of research from lower- and middle-income countries will help consolidate the current thin and scattered evidence, and redirect future research efforts toward noticeable knowledge gaps.====Lastly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, even though there are two existing reviews of research on climate adaptation, our focus differs from theirs'. A systematic review conducted by ==== examined factors motivating climate adaptation behaviors. In that review, the authors summarized 106 set of results (from 90 papers) across 23 different countries to examine how 13 motivational factors relate to various adaptation behaviors. However, the authors define adaptation as any behavior or intention that reduces the impacts of climate-related hazards, when it is well-known that there is a large behavior-intention gaps in pro-environmental behaviors (==== instead summarizes factors motivating individual flooding adaptation from 25 countries, and more than 50 publications. Although that review focused on actual household behaviors, it only considered flood adaptation. A central point of differentiation from this study is that they paid more attention on the effects of locational-culture characteristics, and rarely discussed individual characteristics. In summary, this review fills a void in the literature as we systematically summarize rapidly accumulating evidence on factors behind adoption of climate mitigation and adaptations behaviors in developing countries settings.====Following an extensive search, and careful curating of unrelated studies, we end up with 28 and 30 studies (72 and 86 analyses respectively) for adaptation and mitigation behaviors respectively. We apply separate vote counting exercise to each set of literature, and arrived at the following main findings.====First, across both sets of literatures, the most widely included variables are socioeconomic factors (e.g., education, income, age, and gender). While these variables generally affect adoption of climate adaptation and mitigation in expected ways, there are important dichotomies between them. We observe that climate adaptation behaviors are more readily affected by income whereas climate mitigation behaviors are more responsive toward education. The implication of the former is that climate adaptation is not only an outcome of climate inequality (since only those with the necessary economic means to adapt can lessen their impacts to climate change), it can potentially exacerbate current uneven distribution of impacts as many adaptation behaviors (e.g., air-conditioners) have high carbon footprint. On the other hand, the latter confirms that more intensive information campaigns and interventions can lead to more adoption of climate mitigation behaviors by individuals and households.====Second, even though there are relatively fewer studies that included environmental-related variables, we can still discern its overall trend. Our observation corroborates the first finding as variables representing knowledge of climate change and past experiences of extreme weather matters more for adoption of climate mitigation behaviors. However, given their importance in driving behaviors, it is still concerning environmental-related variables are mostly ignored. As such, it is useful for future research to standardize data collection method to objectively assess individuals' environmental knowledge and perception. Moreover, there already exist ¡°big data¡± sources (e.g., historical weather data from satellite sources) that can readily attribute past experiences of climate change.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes our search process, and the vote-counting procedure. The third section contains results, and its corresponding discussion. Lastly, we conclude with research and policy implications in section four.====For exposition sake, we begin with a univariate regression model:====Next, we subtract the mean of the dependent variable (Y) from both sides, and substitute ==== using the identity ==== to yield:====Following rearrangement, and multiplying and dividing the R.H.S. by its corresponding standard deviation, we get:====where ==== is the standardized transformation of ====.====Lastly, we divide both sides by standard deviation of ==== to get:====By comparing Eq. ====, ====, we can see that the coefficient for standardized covariate, ====, is equivalent to the multiplication of ==== with ratio of the standard deviation of variable X to the dependent variable Y.",Individuals' and households' climate adaptation and mitigation behaviors: A systematic review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001377,5-Nov-22,2022,Research Article,90

These findings call attention to inequity issues during the household energy transition.","). Regarding carbon emissions, China emitted 9.83 billion tons in 2019, accounting for 28.8% of the world's emissions (====). The large scale and rapid growth of China's carbon emissions have made China a global hot spot for carbon reduction and low-carbon development. Given the urgency of the issue, China has promised to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and one of the important strategies is energy transition to reduce the use of coal in the energy system (e.g. ====; ====; ====).====A massive household heating energy transition (HET) policy is implemented in northern China, aiming to reduce household coal consumption by mandatorily replacing household heating coal with natural gas (====) or electricity (====), or clean coal (==== as a transitionary program). The benefit of the programs, including fewer emissions of air pollutants and carbon dioxide, is jointly enjoyed by the participating households, and also the local environment. In contrast, the transition cost, including equipment upgrade expenditure and higher heating costs, is mainly burdened by household participants. Therefore, although the programs rolled out quickly with a high subsidy, it raised many complaints among the participants and put large challenges on governments' fiscal and administrative capacity. To address this issue and figure out the programs' efficiency and impact on household satisfaction, this paper provides a systematic cost====benefit analysis of the three HET programs from both the public and the household private perspectives, and proposes relevant policy suggestions.====There is a large body of literature evaluating government-led household energy transition programs. ==== studied Indonesia's megaproject of converting cooking fuel from kerosene to LPG. The program is evaluated as a success since it alleviated the fiscal burden of kerosene subsidies, benefited the business community and the end-users, and reduced the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. In contrast, many researchers demonstrated similar programs in other countries as less successful. For example, the ==== and ==== explored the household cooking energy transition from wood and dung to kerosene and LPG in India, and found that price subsidies for kerosene and LPG were fiscally unsustainable and seriously mistargeted. ==== analyzed the transition of fossil fuel heating systems to appliances based on renewable energy sources in Germany, and suggested that the perceived difficulty of getting used to the system and misunderstandings about its principal function made the transition difficult. ==== used national household survey data in Vietnam, and concluded that the transition from traditional energy to modern energy led to an energy price increase and imposed a larger burden on the poor.====). Second, given the requirement of delivering two alternative energy sources ¨C electricity and natural gas ¨C the programs involve a large scale of infrastructure construction and are therefore very costly. Third, the programs put a large burden on government fiscal expenditures and household heating costs, because coal is abundant and cheap in China, while electricity and natural gas are expensive (e.g., ====). Given the characteristics of the HET policy, the conclusions from previous studies may not apply.====The household heating energy transition in China has aroused attention with the evaluation of the health and environmental effects. ==== evaluated the effects of the ==== found that household satisfaction with the ==== program is at a medium level based on survey data of Hebei Province. ==== employed posts from Sina Weibo to evaluate the ==== policy, and suggested that the public complaints are mainly from poor policy design, a shortage of energy, increased cost and safety. ====benefit analysis, ==== investigated the ==== program and found that the benefit of the program exceeds the cost in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces. Although the HET program can realize positive net benefits for society, the program still leads to dissatisfaction in some households, as suggested above.====In the existing literature, however, the comparison of the benefit and cost directly associated with households and the distributional equity of cost burden among households have not been paid enough discussion. Energy transition programs need to address the energy equity among different groups to inform a more equitable distribution of environmental and economic costs and benefits, in order to reduce the disparities and complaints of households (====; ====). In most cases, however, the poorest bear a disproportionate share of the costs of household energy transition (====), which would aggravate energy inequity and bring about complaints (====; ====; ====This study contributes to the existing literature in three folds. First, based on large-scale household survey data in Beijing, we develop a cost====benefit analysis for all three main programs of the HET policy, including ====, ====, and ==== in Beijing, and compare the differences. Second, we distinguish between the social and private benefits and costs. Third, our paper considers energy equity based on a quadrant analysis applied to HET policy assessment, concerned with the distribution of the benefits and the cost burden.====Our estimations of three HET programs all exhibit positive net social benefits, which is consistent with positive net social benefits of most mandatory policies in China as suggested by ==== and ====. Regarding the private effects, private benefits due to the improvement of indoor air quality are approximately two times higher than the cost borne by these households at the average level, which is lower than the social benefit-to-cost ratio of six. The positive net private benefits are based on households with relatively larger subsidies and higher income in Beijing. In contrast, households in the provinces with lower per capita income and lower subsidies, such as Hebei Province, households with lower income tend to benefit less while suffering more from the higher participant costs, and thus positive net private benefit would not hold for households in Hebei. These findings highlight the issue of energy inequity among households. We further find that household satisfaction with the programs is largely positively related to private benefit-to-cost ratios brought from the programs, while not decided by social benefits and costs. This finding shed light on the policy improvement that aims to increase public acceptance and satisfaction.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the background, implementation, and subsidy scheme of the programs. ==== describes the methodology, and ==== presents the data. ==== estimates the social and private benefits and costs of ====, ====, and ==== programs at the aggregate level, and ==== provides the relationship between benefit-to-cost ratios and subjective perceptions of the programs at the household level. ==== concludes.",Who benefits from household energy transition?

The pandemic also resulted in substantial damage to the mental health and well-being of the Chinese population, with a disproportionate impact on minorities, including the female and the illiterate. We also examined the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of China's policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggested that China's zero-Covid policy succeeded in stabilizing its economy and maintaining a safe environment in earlier phases of the pandemic, but hardly achieved a balance between disease control and economic growth in the later stage when less fatal but more transmissive coronavirus variants emerged. Lastly, we discussed policy options that China may take to protect the health of its people and avoid a potentially substantial loss of lives during the transition toward the post-pandemic new normal, which include prioritizing the timely administration of effective vaccines among the elderly and vulnerable populations, improving public communications regarding when and how to seek medical help, and strengthening the surge capacity of the healthcare systems, especially in less developed regions.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been considered the greatest threat to human society since the Second World War.==== Since its outbreak, there have been 651 million confirmed cases and 6.6 million deaths reported by the WHO.==== As pointed out in the ==== Commission on lessons for the future from the COVID-19 pandemic, the catastrophic situation was largely due to massive global failures at the institutional, societal, and individual levels, including slow response to the pandemic, neglect toward the most vulnerable populations, low public trust, widespread misinformation and disinformation, and unequal access to preventive medicine and treatments, particularly vaccines (====).====Sources: ==== and ====.====However, the full impact of COVID-19 should not be overlooked; thus, as we approach the turning point of the post-pandemic new normal, the timing is right to ask what we have learned from the pandemic and what we should learn for the future.

Based on a city-year level capital outflows dataset constructed from the ==== database, we obtain three main findings: (1) environmental regulation significantly stimulates outward FDI flows; (2) this promoting effect centers on polluting ====; and (3) these ER-induced FDI outflows are mainly directed toward countries with weaker environmental protection and with a closer geographic and cultural distance to the home country. These results together provide a snapshot confirming the classical ¡°pollution haven hypothesis¡±.","Environmental regulation (hereafter, ER) policies are prevalent in both industrialized countries and developing economies (====; ====). According to the prediction of the classical PHH, raising domestic environmental regulation may induce more outward foreign direct investment (hereafter, FDI) flows. Numerous studies examined the impact of ER on FDI outflows, but both positive effects (====; ====) and non-robust effects (====; ====) were detected. In particular, ==== found that heavily regulated firms did not disproportionately increase their foreign investment, which demonstrated that the mechanism behind the ER-¨Coutward FDI nexus is still unclear. In addition, existing studies mainly focused on developed economies' experiences by using data from the 1970s and after, but these countries began implementing environmental regulations in the 1950s. If environmental regulation indeed promotes capital outflows, using data from an already regulated period may underestimate the effect. This paper tries to examine the pollution haven hypothesis by studying developing countries.====We pay special attention to the impact of ER on outward FDI flows in China. First, China declared war on pollution. As one of the most polluted countries around the world, China has suffered significant welfare losses from pollution (====; ====). To meet stricter ER requirements, polluting firms may make a greater environmental investment (Q. ====; ====) or move to sub-national jurisdictions with weaker environmental regulations within mainland China (Z. ====; ====). China's environmental protection is still in its infancy stage, which offers us an ideal setting to analyze how ER affects outward FDI flows.====Second, China is experiencing phenomenal FDI outflows. The National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that China contributed $136.9 billion in FDI globally in 2019, which accounted for 10% of global FDI flows. China's outward FDI stock in 2019 reached $2.2 trillion, and its share in global FDI stock remained 6%.==== As the largest developing country, China still needs substantial capitals to achieve domestic industrial upgrading and sustained economic growth, and understanding the force driving outward FDI flows may help the government build a better local business environment to preclude capital outflows or even attract domestic and foreign capitals.==== (====); such measurement error may lead to endogeneity bias. On the other hand, the stringency of environmental standards may be endogenously determined. Unobservable regional characteristics may be correlated with both regulatory compliance costs and firm investment decisions (====); this omitted variable issue may also cause endogeneity bias.====This paper addresses these empirical challenges by utilizing one unique policy shock to establish our research design. In late 2012, China's central government introduced a nationwide automatic air quality monitoring system that required real-time disclosure of pollution information across the country. This automated program mitigated the potential for data manipulation on officially reported air quality indexes by local governments (====) and thus exogenously strengthened regional environmental regulation. During the period from 2013 to 2015, all cities sequentially joined the automatic monitoring system in three waves. According to the featured staggered adoption to reach full coverage of the experiment, this paper follows Shuo ==== and ==== and applies an event study approach to identify the causal impact of environmental regulation on FDI outflows.====Based on the ==== database, we build a city-year level greenfield foreign direct investment dataset for China. Event study results suggest that environmental regulation significantly promotes outward FDI flows. We also find that environmental regulation mainly motivates highly polluting industries to invest abroad, and these ER-induced FDI outflows are mostly directed toward countries with weaker environmental regulation. These findings together provide a snapshot of the classical ¡°pollution haven hypothesis¡±, which predicts that countries with weak environmental regulations will attract polluting industries relocating from countries with more stringent regulations (====).====We then examine the heterogeneous impact of environmental regulation on outward FDI flows. We notice that ER-induced FDI outflows prefer host countries with a smaller geographic and cultural distance to China. These findings are consistent with the proposition of ¡°the law of distance¡±, which argues that distance dampens international business activities (====).====One concern about previous findings is the empirical identification strategy. Given the featured full coverage of the experiment, this paper leverages the conventional event study approach to identify the dynamic effects of the policy shock on FDI outflows. As one robustness check, we use one staggered difference-in-differences estimator developed by ==== to re-estimate the dynamic effects. To ensure all treated observations have some comparable untreated counterparts, we restrict the sample to the period before 2015, the year all cities joined the automatic air quality monitoring system. Based on the new dataset and the emerging empirical approach, we still find that environmental regulation can promote outward FDI flows.====One threat to the creditability of previous empirical results is the implementation of ¡°The Belt and Road Initiative¡± (BRI). In late 2013, China's government proposed the BRI, a policy that aims to strengthen cooperation in emerging industries among countries along the Belt and Road. In advancing the BRI, China's central government required local governments to leverage their strength to pursue the greater opening-up of their economies.==== Some studies demonstrate that the BRI significantly affects FDI outflows (J. ====Our research is related to three strands of literature. First, this paper extends research on the relationship between environmental regulation and foreign direct investment. Following the birth of the PHH, numerous studies examined the impact of ER on FDI in several ways. Some papers discussed the impact of ER on inbound FDI, but the identified effects were negative (====; ====; ====) or positive (====) or even not robust (====). More importantly, the basic logic of the PHH is that domestic environmental regulation causes capital outflows, so identifying the relationship between ER and inbound FDI can only provide indirect evidence about the PHH. Other papers directly explored the impact of ER on outward FDI, as illustrated in the motivation part, mixed conclusions were produced by those researches, and the findings were not comprehensively tested in developing countries. This paper leverages the environmental regulation practice of China to rigorously explore the underlying logic of the pollution haven hypothesis.====Second, this paper sheds light on the impact of environmental regulation on the allocation of production factors. With the emergence of China's environmental regulations, some papers have investigated how ER affects the allocation of production factors, but most have focused on the allocation of labor (M. ====; ====; ====). Few studies have discussed the impact of ER on the allocation of capital, but these have mainly examined the spatial distribution of capital within China's territory (Z. Chen, et al., 2018; ====). This paper instead analyzes the impact of environmental regulation on FDI outflows.====; ====). Since the seminal work of ====, a burgeoning body of literature has documented that geographic and cultural factors (Y. ====) and the political environment (J. ====; ====), more studies then shifted focus to the impact of the local business environment on FDI outflows, finding that home country supportiveness/ unfavorableness (====), domestic market distortions (====; C. ====; ====) and labor costs (====) will significantly affect a firm's decision to invest abroad. This paper also discusses the role of the local business environment in driving capital outflows but concentrates on the impact of environmental regulation, one specific factor raising local firms' environmental compliance costs.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. ==== introduces the institutional background. ==== discusses the empirical model and the corresponding data. ==== reports the empirical results, and ==== offers a brief conclusion to the paper.",Environmental regulation and outward foreign direct investment: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001353,4-Nov-22,2022,Research Article,98

We use data from new venture competitions organized by Shanghai municipal government that are open to innovative small ventures. Using a ====, we show that winning leads to a higher level of entrepreneurial explorations in the year following the competition. However, this effect is reduced for female entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs whose affiliated ventures have a shorter time of operation. Our findings are consistent with existing theories about entrepreneurship and behavioral economics, including entrepreneurial experimentation and ¡°house money¡± effect.","Entrepreneurship is one of the key engines for economic growth and development. Venture competitions are widely organized to spur growth of entrepreneurship, in developed and developing countries alike (====). These competitions reduce information opacity regarding quality of entrepreneurial projects. Winners of a competition receive certification that increases likelihoods of subsequent external equity funding and also positively affects firms' productivity and revenues, especially for small and medium-sized firms that are usually financially constrained (====; ====). While the existing literature documents certification effect by examining firms' performances, winning venture competitions also likely affects the course of entrepreneurial explorations (====; ====). Few attempts have been devoted to investigating impacts from venture competition on the process of experimentation of entrepreneurial ideas.====In this paper, we define entrepreneurial exploration as entrepreneurs' actions of exploring new opportunities by undertaking activities such as searching, risk-taking, discovery, experimentation, prototyping and innovation (====; ====). We investigate whether and how winning a major venture competition organized by the municipal government in Shanghai, ¡°Startup in Shanghai,¡± affects the extent to which an entrepreneur explores new entrepreneurial opportunities different from their existing ones. The participants of this annual venture competition are small and medium technology-based firms with no more than 30 million RMB incomes and less than 300 employees in the year preceding the competition. The contestant projects are scored by two technical experts who evaluate the technology potentials by reading the venture's profiles as well as by three venture capital (VC) judges who assess the business aspects through attending pitch presentations. The two components of evaluations are taken into account to generate a weighted average score for all the participants. Winners receive a grant of 200,000 RMB from the local government though such amount is small in relation to the mean income level of participating ventures in the sample (i.e., 3.7 million RMB). To track entrepreneurial explorations, we focus on entrepreneurs that participated in the competition in two consecutive years in the period from 2017 to 2019, which account for about 34% of all participating entrepreneurs in the sample period.====, ====, ====).====We find that winning the venture competition in the current year significantly increases the likelihood of an entrepreneur presenting more different business projects in the following year. Such finding is consistent with the ¡°house money¡± effect documented in the literature of behavior economics, where a prior gain increases agents' willingness to take more risks (====). After a gain, potential losses in future are treated as reduction in prior gain instead of losing gamblers' own money, which mitigates the impact of loss aversion and encourages risk-seeking behaviors. In the context of our study (i.e., venture competition), a prior gain in the competition consists of both grant and certification received from winning in the current year competition (====, ====). In the meantime, presenting a very new business initiative in the following year reflects the level of risk-taking by an entrepreneur. As suggested in the literature (====), the nature of entrepreneurship, especially in high-growth fields as featured by most venture competitions, entails a series of experimentation carried out by small firms. Yet, entrepreneurial experimentation involves risks. The likely ¡°house money¡± effect of winning discounts some of these risks, encouraging the escalation of experimentation taken by an entrepreneur.====We then explore the heterogeneity in the effects of winning by characteristics of entrepreneurs and their affiliated ventures. First, we explore gender difference in those effects. There is consequential interest in female entrepreneurship, and the gender gap in high-growth entrepreneurship remains salient (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our finding shows that winning venture competition causes opposite effects to female and male entrepreneurs: while female entrepreneurs are engaged in less entrepreneurial explorations following winning a competition, male entrepreneurs take on more entrepreneurial explorations. Second, we examine whether effects of winning differ if an entrepreneur has prior experience of founding ventures. The results suggest that prior entrepreneurial experience of founding ventures has little effect on the impact of winning on entrepreneurial exploration. Last, the degree to which a winner entrepreneur engaged in entrepreneurial exploration is also influenced by firm age (====). We find that positive effects of winning on entrepreneurial exploration are more potent for founders of companies with longer operating history.====One possible explanation for the gender difference is that women, on average, are more risk-averse than men in decision-making (====; ====; ====; ====). Compared with their male peers, female entrepreneurs might hold more risk-averse attitudes after winning the competition and prefer to present relatively similar business projects in the next competition. The other possible mechanism is that men may be more overconfident than women (====; ====; ====; ====). Winning the current year's venture competition certainly boosts confidence for all entrepreneurs. However, male entrepreneurs might have more willingness to try other new business projects next year if winning makes them overconfident or overoptimistic for future success. The gender difference in risk aversion and level of overconfidence could drive the heterogeneous effects of winning by gender, though one interpretation could not rule out the other mechanism (====).====Entrepreneurs also behave in the organizational context. Firm age is generally found to have a negative impact on the risk-taking behaviors by established firms (====). However, recent research suggests that firm age is associated with higher adaptive capability in the context of new ventures (====). This adaptive capability might enable a winning entrepreneur to have more access to market resources, helping the entrepreneur better discover new entrepreneurial opportunities.====Our paper contributes to the literature by shedding light on a new mechanism through which winning venture competition encourages entrepreneurs' exploration. Prior literature has established that winning a contest leads to legitimation,==== which helps firms acquire reputation and resource. However, this literature has mainly focused on how legitimation affects firms' outcome variables, such as performance and survival (====; ====; ====), but largely ignored its likely influences on firms and entrepreneurs' risk-taking and experimentation behaviors. We fill this gap in the literature by suggesting that the legitimacy and resources obtained through winning a venture competition might act like ¡°house money¡± for entrepreneurs, which enables them to undertake more entrepreneurial experimentations (====).====Our paper also adds to the literature by investigating venture competition in China. Due to a lack of access to administrative data, very little research relies on casual analysis to discuss effects of entrepreneurial venture competition in China. ==== use data from an entrepreneurial funding competition in Beijing to examine similarity between venture team and their evaluators on top university affiliations, and how such similarity affects the evaluation. The evaluators that do not share the similarity with a top-university venture team would bias their judgment and favor the venture project. Both papers do not discuss the exploration of new business ideas among Chinese entrepreneurs, which in our view can be an important and novel channel through which venture competition influences development of entrepreneurship. Our paper uses administrative data to exploit whether winning the venture competition increases the degree of entrepreneurial explorations by entrepreneurs in innovation-based areas in Shanghai.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

Mechanism analysis reveals that the improved teacher¨Cstudent and student¨Cstudent interactions contribute to the enhancement of noncognitive outcomes."," and ====, suggests that the presence of a single low-achieving student can negatively affect the outcomes of all other students in a classroom. While a vast literature has consistently documented the negative impacts of having low-achieving peers on academic outcomes,==== much fewer studies have investigated the impacts on noncognitive outcomes and the evidence is mixed.==== As noncognitive skills are important determinants of individuals' future success (e.g., ====, ====), exploring the impacts on noncognitive outcomes could advance our knowledge of the long-term peer effect. Moreover, although enormous studies have detected heterogeneity in the classroom peer effects by students' characteristics, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear.==== A careful investigation of the mechanisms underlying heterogeneous peer effects could help to unpack the black box of peer effects.====In this study, we examine the effect of exposure to low-achieving classmates on noncognitive outcomes of regular students in junior high school, and also investigate heterogeneity in the effects and the potential channels through which these effects operate.==== Using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), we exploit random assignments of students and teachers to classes within a grade at junior high school. We define classmates who had repeated a grade in primary school (repeaters) as low-achieving classmates. One should be cautious about drawing the causal link between the presence of low-achieving peers and regular students' outcomes. First, it is difficult to determine whether a student with low ability causes his/her classmates to misbehave or his/her misbehaved classmates cause him/her to be low-achieving, which is termed the reflection problem (====). Furthermore, students with low ability are likely to self-select into the same classroom as other disadvantaged students, thereby causing the problem of endogenous peer group formation. Finally, low-achieving students and their classmates might be subject to common shocks such as low teacher quality, which would result in poor academic performance of both low-achieving students and their peers. Our identification strategy overcomes these three problems, by using low-achieving students who had repeated a grade during primary school in a setting of random classroom assignment as an exogenous source of variation in peer exposure.====We find that having a high proportion of repeaters in a classroom has significant positive effects on noncognitive outcomes. In particular, we detect heterogeneous impacts of repeater exposure by regular students' grade in junior high school, gender, and household socioeconomic background. Repeater exposure substantially improves noncognitive skills of the 9th graders (i.e., the third-year students in junior high school), girls, and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. These findings highlight the importance of the duration of exposure for the formation of noncognitive skills and the stronger impacts on disadvantaged students.====In the mechanism analysis, we find that repeaters may affect regular students' noncognitive outcomes through behavioral responses by students, teachers, and parents. Firstly, the improvements in the noncognitive skills of regular students could be attributed to the improved teacher¨Cstudent and student¨Cstudent interactions. The presence of repeaters in the classroom may lower teachers' expectations; as a result, teachers may adjust pedagogical practices by giving more praise and less criticism to regular students. Then, the shift in teachers' pedagogy cultivates a pleasant classroom atmosphere, which may facilitate the formation of noncognitive skills. Secondly, parents' evaluation of teachers' pedagogical practices may undermine the development of non-cognitive skills. Due to the highly competitive environment in China, parents usually care more about children's academic performance and may favor a harsh teacher over an amiable one. As a result, parents, especially parents of students with lower academic performance, may have difficulty in accepting the amiable manner of teachers in the presence of low-achieving peers. Further analysis reveals that these possible mechanism channels could explain the heterogeneity in the effect of repeater exposure by grade, gender, and socioeconomic background.====Our study extends two strands of the existing literature. First is the literature on the spillover effect of low-achieving peers on regular students' noncognitive outcomes. The evidence about the peer effects on noncognitive outcomes remains scant.==== As adolescence is a sensitive and critical stage for the development of noncognitive skills (====; ====), it is of particular interest to explore the peer effects among adolescents. ==== and ==== present a positive effect of exposure to female peers on noncognitive outcomes. ==== finds that having adolescent peers who are central in their social network leads boys to better social skills, but has no effects on girls. ==== show that low-achieving peers have small and negative effects on the noncognitive outcomes of first-year students in junior high school. As it may take time for teachers to change their pedagogical practices, the noncognitive impacts of low-ability peers may not emerge until the duration of exposure is sufficiently long. We consider the effect of a comparatively longer duration of peer exposure by including third-year students in junior high school and detect a positive effect of exposure to low-achieving peers on noncognitive outcomes.====Second is the literature on the potential mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous peer effects on students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Most analyses have focused on the identification of the causal impact of peers on outcomes and the choice of specific measures for peer exposure, while much less attention has been given to the underlying mechanisms of peer effects (e.g., ====; ====). Knowledge of the mechanisms is crucial, as otherwise, a policy designed to address the issue of classroom peer effects will be a shot in the dark. Our study extends the existing literature by examining how noncognitive skills are formed and investigating the heterogeneity in the peer effects by students' socioeconomics status (SES). The improvement in mental health and social skills in the presence of repeaters is concentrated among low-SES students; the improved teacher¨Cstudent (e.g., receiving more praises and less critical comments from teachers) and student¨Cstudent interactions (e.g., rating classmates to be friendly) are possible channels.====Our study is closely related to ==== and ====, both of which investigate the impacts of low-achieving classmates on regular students. However, our study differs significantly from these two papers in three aspects. First, our study differs from ==== in terms of the type of outcomes, and from ==== in terms of the duration of exposure. Specifically, we shed light on the spillover effects of low-achieving peers on regular students' noncognitive outcomes, while ==== focus on academic outcomes. Although ==== explore the peer effects on noncognitive outcomes, they restrict their analysis only to the first-year students in junior high school, who have brief exposure to low-ability peers. As it may take time for teachers to adjust their pedagogical practices, brief exposure to low-ability peers might exhibit negligible impact on noncognitive outcomes. Our study complements ==== by investigating the peer effects on noncognitive outcomes from a dynamic nature. Such differences and considerations matter and can drastically impact not only our knowledge and understanding of the peer effects, but also the direction of policies. Second, we probe into the specific mechanisms behind the peer effects on noncognitive outcomes, while ==== do not distinguish the channels for the effects on academic and noncognitive outcomes. Our study enriches the knowledge of the operation of peer effects in the classroom, which may be crucial for designing optimal educational policies. Third, our study imposes stricter sample restrictions than both studies, which only use the random assignment information reported by school principals. In addition to school principals, our study requires that all head teachers in the same school report no assigning by test scores. As the central government in China explicitly prohibits junior high schools from tracking students according to their ability, school principals who practically applied ability tracking have an incentive to claim random assignments. Ignoring the assignment information reported by head teachers would attenuate the estimates toward zero given positive peer impacts on noncognitive skills.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides a brief overview of the institutional background concerning junior secondary education and grade retention in China. ==== describes the data we use for estimation. ==== outlines the identification strategy and discusses the validity of the assumptions required for identification.

It not only has the same economic growth-promoting characteristics as general innovation but also has the unique advantage of reducing negative ecological and environmental externalities associated with growth (====). Though green innovation has ¡°double externalities¡± of bringing economic benefits to enterprises and providing certain environmental and social benefits, it may slow economic growth in the short-term and creates uncertainties which make it difficult for enterprises to voluntarily invest their limited resources in it. Thus there is the need for active government guidance (====; ====). Some scholars argue that the establishment of development zones causes spatial agglomeration of polluting enterprises and population size, which further aggravates environmental pollution in the surrounding areas and has an inhibiting effect on green innovation (====; ====). The effectiveness of development zone policies on enterprises' green innovation is uncertain and depends largely on the support and supervision of the enterprises in the zone. Therefore, it is crucial to explore whether establishing development zones in China can promote green innovation among enterprises in order to build a green innovation system.====The differential set-up purpose and regulatory intensity of National Development Zones (NDZs) and Provincial Development Zones (PDZs) tend to have differential impacts on firms in the domain.

The strongest spillover effects occur when the younger sibling is a girl. Such increases in test scores come from a more intense academic atmosphere within a household when both children enroll in school and are not attributed to differential parental education investments or time inputs.

Despite the importance of investing in children, most of our understanding of children¡¯s human capital production is limited to observations at the household level and from parental resource allocations to their children (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). This paper extends the analysis to ==== dynamics and investigates an externality between siblings on school performance in multi-children households in rural China.====We find that an elder child¡¯s school performance improves significantly when their younger sibling is in school. The increase in school performance does not rely on changes of family resources allocated to the elder sibling, but results from a positive externality from the younger sibling¡¯s studying to the elder sibling¡¯s academic achievements. We refer to this externality as a sibling ====. This positive spillover effect differs across sibling gender-pairs, and is the strongest among children with a younger sister. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to examine a spillover effect in school performance from the younger sibling to an elder sibling.====The biggest challenge in identifying the sibling spillover is to disentangle it from factors outside of the sibship (or common family factors) and to identify the direction of impact between siblings.==== We use the variation in the younger sibling¡¯s schooling status (started school or not) and years of schooling to parse out the impact of spillover effects ====.==== We exploit the arbitrary birth date cutoff imposed by the Chinese Law of Compulsory Education as an exogenous variation in schooling status. The law stipulates that children must be at least 6?years old or above on August 31st to be admitted into elementary school in the new school year. This arbitrary day of birth cutoff generates exogenous variations in the younger sibling¡¯s eligibility of school enrollment, allowing us to attribute changes in the elder sibling¡¯s school performance to that of the enrollment of younger sibling.====We use data from the Rural Household Survey (RHS) of the Longitudinal Survey on Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) to conduct our analysis. Having an in-school younger sibling leads to a 1.42 percentage point increase in Chinese scores for an elder sibling for each year the younger sibling is in school holding constant the grade of the elder sibling. Such an effect appears after controlling for differing gender ratios at the county-level, an approximation of the local son-preference culture,==== and for the annual education expenditures on the student. It is also robust to changes in the younger sibling¡¯s age range.====When further exploring the gender heterogeneity in sibling spillovers, we find that the second child being a girl creates a stronger effect on the spillover to the elder child¡¯s test scores. Having a younger sister in school leads to a 2.26 percentage point increase on the elder sibling¡¯s Chinese score for every year the younger sibling is in school. Meanwhile, when the younger child is a boy, the spillover effect is not statistically significant.====We conjecture that the positive spillover is a result of a positive at-home externality that occurs when both siblings are studying under the same roof. When the younger child begins school, the elder child may experience an increase in sibling studying time relative to sibling play time, a heightened household attention to school performance, or more frequent household discussions on school matters. Elder siblings more exposed to this heightened academic environment at home may see this emphasis on schoolwork translate to a better performance in school. Though difficult to directly measure, we consider siblings with more time at home and a stronger home connection to experience a stronger spillover externality. We approximate the at-home time by investigating the different spillover effects among the elder children¡¯s home-school distance. The positive spillover effect diminishes for elder siblings attending a school that is further away from home compared to those who live closer. To further justify this potential mechanism of the positive spillover effects, we test for changes in parental resource allocation and parental presence when the younger sibling starts school. We find no evidence that the increase in the elder child¡¯s school performance is due to increased parental resource allocation or change in attention devoted to the older child.====Overall, this paper joins others in providing a new perspective on sibling spillovers. Frameworks providing insight on human capital production among siblings within a family typically take one of three approaches: they assess the quantity-quality trade-off needed with multiple children (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====), they allow for birth order effects (e.g. ====, ====, ====), and most recently, they look for possible sibling interactions (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). To date, the literature on sibling spillovers has largely focused on high-income countries and the impact of older children on younger children. We contribute to the literature by studying the spillover effect of younger siblings on the school performance of elder siblings in low income communities.====In low income economies, educational resources are often scarce and gender inequality in educational resource allocation tends to be larger (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====). Only one paper we know of has looked at sibling spillovers in China and this was on the spillover effect from the older to the younger child (====). The findings of our paper reveal a strong sibling spillover in school work, driven by sisters, consistent with the result from ====. However, they examine the impact from an older sibling to a younger one while we examine the impact of younger sibling on an elder child.

Larger urban-rural gaps in mean incomes have been strongly polarizing.","). In short, the proposed aim of the Chinese leadership is to ¡°expand the proportion of middle-income groups¡± (====)¡ªwhat the ==== magazine dubbed ¡°fleshing out the olive.¡±====There has been much public debate about what this implies for policy going forward, and some concern among the country's economic elites, who took the Xi speech as a sign that, as the top of the olive, they would soon to be squeezed.==== (As one possible sign of this, over $1trillion dollars was wiped off the value of Chinese stocks in the latter half of 2021.) Yet very little has been said about what the new goal really means, how progress in attaining the goal might be monitored, how China has done in the past with regard to this goal, and what trade-offs against other valued goals might be anticipated based on past experience. These are the issues explored by this paper.====President Xi Jinping was clearly not saying that this is the only policy goal for China, even within the gamut of goals related to incomes and their distribution. In the tradition of past Presidents, Xi has emphasized the goals of growing the economy and ending poverty. However, these are clearly not the same thing as ¡°fleshing out the olive.¡± Then the question naturally arises as to what trade-offs might exist against growth and poverty reduction. That is a difficult question. Trade-offs can be hard to identify ex-post since the data also reflect past policy choices (given the trade-offs faced at the time) and shocks. Nonetheless, it is of interest to see what the historical experience suggests about potential trade-offs with regard to this newly declared goal, going back to when it was not a goal, at least explicitly. This requires that we can define and measure the idea of ¡°fleshing out the olive.¡±====The well-documented success of China in reducing absolute poverty came (of course) with a rising share of the population living above the absolute poverty line, many of whom joined what can be thought of as China's ¡°middle-class.¡±==== Naturally, what exactly this means depends on the setting. The prevailing definition of a ¡°middle-income group¡± can be expected to change over time with rising living standards; what was considered an adequate ¡°middle¡± income in the China of the 1980s is clearly not the same as today. ¡°Fleshing out the olive¡± can be interpreted as reducing the spread of incomes relative to the current median, which arguably provides a more relevant reference point than some fixed absolute level of real income.====This perspective suggests that the concept of ¡°polarization¡± found in economics is relevant to monitoring China's performance in this new goal, and identifying potential trade-offs against other goals, including poverty reduction. And there are tools available in the literature, notably the Foster-Wolfson (FW) polarization curve and polarization index.==== While much of the literature has essentially equated ¡°polarization¡± and ¡°inequality,¡± ==== make a sharp conceptual distinction. This was motivated by the debates about the claimed decline in the middle class in America, as discussed in ====. The polarization curve shows how far each percentile's income is from the overall median, expressed in units of the median. The curve naturally hits zero at the median, and then fans out as one moves further from the median. ¡°Fleshing out the olive¡± is interpreted as shifting the polarization curve down, so that incomes move closer to the median.====The FW polarization index is a simple summary statistic of the location of the polarization curve. The index has a relationship to the popular ====, but it is conceptually quite distinct, and the two indices could (in principle) tell a very different story. (For example, as we will see, a drop in the Gini index due to less inequality among the top half of the income distribution will increase the FW index.) Since it summarizes the spread of incomes relative to the median, the FW index gives us a measure that appears to be remarkably close in spirit to President Xi's idea of ¡°fleshing out the olive.¡± The fact that the FW tools for studying polarization are well grounded in theory also helps in understanding what exactly is being measured.====The large literature on poverty and inequality in China includes a few references to polarization, though with limited coverage over time.==== Those studies have found evidence of rising polarization. Here we re-examine this question over a longer time frame, spanning virtually the entire post-reform period after 1980. This allows us to identify some key sub-periods when polarization was stable and even falling. Contrary to the prevailing view from the (limited) evidence, we show that income polarization in China has not been on an inexorable rise; indeed, it has been trending downward since 2009. This variance in the time-series data allows us to go further and explore the covariates of polarization. For example, we will be able to see whether there are signs in the historical record that less polarizing time periods came with lower rates of economic growth. We do not attempt to identify causal effects, though we do test whether the crude correlations seen in the data are robust to potentially confounding effects stemming from the dynamics of the variables of interest.====While it is not something that has attracted much attention in the literature, one might expect that the process ==== through structural transformation in a country such as China may have a de-polarizing effect, as the poorest move closer to the middle, though whether that happens also depends on how much the median shifts upwards with development. Nor is this an aspect of the potential distributional changes with development that is likely to be captured well by the standard poverty and inequality indices. Potentially de-polarizing gains among the poorer half may, also come hand-in-hand with polarizing gains among the (primarily urban) upper half, comprising an elite of skilled workers and those who own the capital stock and/or rental properties. The implications of economic development for polarization are clearly quite ambiguous in theory.====Also relevant in the context of China is the evolution of the large disparities found between mean incomes in urban and rural areas (====; ====). This reflects long-standing inequalities in social policies (health, education and social protection) (====; ====) as well as impediments to internal migration, notably through the ==== registration system (====) and administrative land allocation processes (====). Given the large mean income gaps between China's urban and rural areas, the degree of urban-rural sectoral fractionalization¡ªthe extent to which people live in different sectors¡ªmay also matter to both income inequality and polarization.====Motivated by these observations, the paper addresses three main questions:====After describing the Foster-Wolfson index, the following section offers some theoretical arguments as to why trade-offs may or may not arise. ==== provides our new estimates of polarization measures for China back to 1981.

Given the decreasing labor force participation rates over years, this paper is interested in investigating whether the expanding gender gap in labor force participation in China is associated with ¡°child penalty¡±. The impact of children on mothers' labor force participation relative to fathers' is referred as ¡°child penalty¡± (====; ====).====Although the relationship between fertility decisions and women's labor supply has been paid substantial attention by labor economists, there is lack of evidence showing that how child penalty reflects the long-run gender gap in labor force participation rates in China. To understand child penalty, we first propose a theoretical model to explain the relationship between female labor force participation and the number of children in the household. We show that a mother's hours worked decreases as the number of children in the family increases using a static labor supply model.====In the empirical analysis, we investigate changes in labor force participation of mothers relative to fathers around first births following ====. This pseudo event study method shows the evolution of child penalty at first birth and the cost of having additional children. Using the Population Census data from 1982 to 2015, we find evidence that mothers' labor force participation rate drops immediately after first birth; meanwhile, child penalty in China is increasing since 2000.====We also decompose the gender differences in labor force participation and explore the percentage of gender gap in labor force participation due to child penalty. ==== and ==== show that the residual inequality (total gender inequality minus child-related inequality) explains a high percentage of gender differences in labor force participation over time in Demark and many other developed countries. However, we show a higher percentage of child-related gender inequality than the residual inequality in China. We also find that the child-related inequality in labor force participation between mothers and fathers had been increasing over time. Our findings suggest that the labor force participation rates of Chinese women are more sensitive to child birth. As a result, child care and family planning policies might have larger impacts on gender inequality in China.====As China is known to implement a one-child policy for a long period (1980s¨C2010s), we would expect a change of social norm toward gender equality and a decreasing trend of child penalty for Chinese women over years. However, the trend of child penalty has been rising over time, even before the implementation of the two-child policy. Given the stylized facts of increasing child penalty in the past decades, this paper further examines the related institutional changes and policies to explain the increasing trend of child penalty. Using the regional variation in exposure to the state owned enterprise (SOE) reforms and the family-planning policies, we find that the rising child penalty in China is highly consistent with SOE reforms and child care policies.====Our paper contributes to the literature of child penalty for women. ==== show that having additional children reduces the labor supply of lower-educated women using sex composition and twins to generate instruments. ==== shows that having a first child younger than one year old reduces female employment by 26 percentage points. ==== state that having children might increase male wages but decrease female wages. ==== and ==== define fecundity loss as the depreciating ¡°reproductive capital¡± to explain its impact on women's decision-making and assortative matching.

We find evidence that child penalty for women is increasing over years and the gender gap in labor force participation is enlarged as female labor force participation rate drops more than male labor force participation rate in the recent decades at first births.====We also contribute to the strand of literature on the labor supply elasticity of child-related public policies.

We find robust and consistent evidence that exposure to higher minimum wages increases a firm's investment in financial assets. Furthermore, we explore the effects of moderators, such as increased employment stickiness, intensification of financial constraints, and reduced innovation activities as potential explanations for the positive effect of increasing minimum wages. Moreover, firms located in non-coastal cities with relatively higher equity concentration and lower market competition are substantially more incentivized to increase investment in financial assets. Overall, this paper provides new insights into understanding the effects of increasing labor costs on firms' asset allocation in emerging market economies.","Over recent years, the financial sectors in some countries have seen significant growth in their share of GDP, investment, and total profits. For example, the USA saw the financial asset holdings of nonfinancial corporations increase by more than 50% between 1971 and 2014 (====), ease the financing constraints (====), and diversify business risks of firms (====). However, the excessive financial investment will damage the real economy in the long term, such as crowding out real investment (====; ====), fostering housing bubbles (====), and causing shadow banking risks (====).====). Microscopically, although the definitions of financialization are various (====), it is mostly measured in the recent related studies by the share of firm financial assets in total assets (====; ====).====The phenomenon of firm financialization has attracted much research, in particular with regard to macrocosmic factors such as slowdown in economic growth (====; ====), economic environment uncertainty (====), credit financing (====; ====), as well as microcosmic factors such as governance method (====; ====), social responsibility (====) and profitability (====). While most literature investigates the impact of various economic factors on financialization, little research specifically covers the impact of high labor costs on firm financialization. This subject has come to light over recent years due to China's significant increase in labor costs.====Minimum wages are widely used worldwide for labor protection or income redistribution. The promulgation of the ==== in 2004 caused China's labor costs to enter an era of rapid growth. The regulation requires the local government to adjust the minimum wage standard at least once every two years. Statistics showed that the minimum wage annual growth rate between 1994 and 2004 was 7% and reached a height of 13% between 2004 and 2014.==== The rapid increase directly led to a fast rise in labor costs, and the corresponding annual growth rate of the average wage of urban employees in the non-private unit was 15% during the same period. Firms may consequently adjust their production and investment behavior to alleviate labor cost shocks (====; ====). Therefore, we focus on how the impact of increased minimum wage standards on labor costs affects firms' financial asset allocation and financialization tendency. Our paper aims to answer three questions. Firstly, will the minimum wage increase promote the financialization of entity firms? Secondly, if so, what are the economic mechanisms? Thirdly, is there a heterogeneous effect of the minimum wage on the degree of financialization within different types of the firm?====This paper uses a firm-level dataset of China's A-listed firms to formally examine the sensitivity of a firm's financialization to increased labor costs as represented by minimum wage standards over time and across cities. We exploit variations in the local minimum wage across different cities in China between 2009 and 2015 to analyze the relationship between a firm's financial assets investment behavior and labor costs. We find a significantly positive correlation between the minimum wage and the financial assets investment of firms; every 10% increase in the minimum wage causes a 0.35 percentage point increase in the degree of firm financialization. This result remains valid when using ==== and various robustness tests.====We analyzed two potential economic mechanisms: a firm's internal characteristics and the external environment. We found that the increase in employment stickiness and the decline in innovation activities are the two internal economic moderators, whilst the increase in financial constraints is an external moderator for the minimum wage and promotes the financialization of firms. We then examine the heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage on firm financialization from the perspectives of equity concentration, industry competition, and location. We found that the positive effect is more pronounced in firms with higher equity concentration, lower competition, and that are located in non-coastal cities.====Our paper contributes to two strands of literature. First, it provides novel evidence to the studies on the economic consequences of the minimum wage on the firm. Previous research shows that the minimum wage has a mixed effect on employment, income, and human capital (====; ====; ====), improves wage distribution (====; ====; ====). Other recent research has focused on the consequences of increasing minimum wages on the production behavior of Chinese firms, such as inhibiting entrepreneurship (====), stimulating capital investment (====; ====), enhancing the export tendency (====), increasing earnings management(Xiang et al., 20,202), and promoting markups (====).====Second, our paper also contributes to existing research on why firm investment has ¡°shifted from the real to the virtual economy,¡± i.e.==== financialization. Previous studies explore the role of production costs in altering firm investment behavior and their significance on financial investment from the angle of credit financing costs (====; ====) and the angel of interest rate costs (====To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to further understand the relationship between labor cost and firm financialization, particularly in the studies where the direction of the relationship is not fully clear. We comprehensively combine firm-level data with manually collected minimum wage standards for a set of cities across China.

Additionally, we include insights from a number of influential studies published only in Chinese that are unfamiliar to most researchers outside China.==== We also conduct our own descriptive data analysis based on both macro- and micro-level data to provide a clearer understanding of several essential facts about the system.====Our analysis is organized around three key topics on the land finance system, with the pivotal role of profitability in the system highlighted throughout. First, we establish a framework to characterize the essentials of China's land finance system. In short, the land finance system involves local governments creating new urban land-use rights (LURs) via land acquisition, selling LURs to private and public land users, and, most importantly, realizing profits from the gap between the revenues from selling LURs and their acquisition costs. This market is economically large, as official statistics report that total land-sales revenues by local governments reached over 55 trillion RMB between 2007 and 2020. Local governments incurred costs to acquire LURs, and we estimate them to be about 65% of the total land-sales revenues on average. These costs are partly counterbalanced by the revenues raised from ancillary ==== on real estate-related transactions generated by the creation and selling of leasehold estates. We conclude that they amount to about 75% of land-sales profits. Taking 2018 as an example, we estimate that the total volume of land-related profits received by local governments, including both land-sales profits and real estate-related taxes, amounts to about 4 trillion RMB, which equals over 40% of total budgetary income at the local level. Thus, the system is important by any metric. It is also noteworthy that there is extensive heterogeneity across markets in the profitability of the land finance system. LUR acquisition costs do rise with local market land value, but the net benefits of the system have not been equal across cities. The most expensive housing and land markets have benefitted the most. The importance of the profitability of land finance is also evidenced by the fact that the dominant share of local governments' debt financing activities is explicitly or implicitly tied to local governments' future land sales profits, making the land finance system, especially its profitability, a critical factor in shaping local governments' borrowing capacities, too.====Land-sales profits, as well as land-related borrowings, have played a dominant role in supporting local governments' massive infrastructure investments over the past two decades. The funding from the land finance system also supports local governments' other public good provisions, such as subsidies to local firms. Both the urban infrastructure investments and firm subsidies have underpinned China's economic growth over the past few decades. Moreover, the infrastructure investments and/or firm subsidies help boost local land prices, which, in turn, can feed on itself by further enhancing the profitability of the system. Such a self-reinforcing cycle around land finance supports local governments in playing a key role in China's rapid urbanization and its ¡°economic miracle.¡±====Second, we provide detailed discussion of the institutional features underpinning the land finance system. The answer to the question of ¡°why local governments in China use land finance¡± appears to be straightforward ¨C the land finance system was due largely to a 1994 tax-sharing reform that reduced local governments' share of many tax revenue streams while not shrinking their spending needs. It is much more complicated to answer ¡°why land finance has worked effectively (so far) in China.¡± Its institutional underpinnings, which facilitate the profitability of the land finance system, are important to understand in this respect. First, local governments were designated the monopoly provider of local urban LURs. Thus, a city faced no competition from other entities when it made an offer to buy rural land and convert it to urban land. Moreover, the compensation paid was based on land value for current (agricultural) use, instead of its future urban use. Similar rules also apply when local governments repurchase allocated or sold urban LURs and convert them to new LURs. This arrangement allows the urban government to make a profit, something that was accentuated by the rising temporal trend in land prices until recently. It is noteworthy that the rich institutional framework underpinning the land finance system includes both explicit rules such as laws and official documents and implicit norms that are influential in practice. Some of these details do not appear to be appropriately recognized in the existing literature and can lead to misunderstandings about the system. Hopefully, our analysis will bring more clarity to how the system works on the ground within China's federal system.====Finally, we try to shed some light on the sustainability of the land finance system. We conduct this analysis from two perspectives. On the one hand, local governments' high reliance on land finance, especially their strong incentives to maximize profitability, has resulted in increasing costs and risks. The potential for costly moral hazards to build seems clear. When a system is a key facilitator of infrastructure provision and thus is vitally important to the functioning of both local and central government, it is not difficult to imagine that banks, firms, and individuals could come to believe that China's land finance system was ¡°too big (or important) to fail.¡± Mispricing in debt and equity instruments in housing and land markets, as well as in land-backed local government debts, can arise in such a situation. Potential distortions associated with the growth of the system are also a source of growing concern. These distortions include whether the land finance system is contributing to imbalances in the housing market, having undesired impacts on urban form, or damaging rural development. We review the research on these topics, but much remains to be done if we are to have a clearer, or even a robust quantitative, estimate of the costs and benefits of China's land finance system.====On the other hand, the discussions from the feasibility perspective deliver clearer information. As highlighted above, the feasibility of the land finance system strongly depends upon its profitability, or a large gap between the sales revenues of LURs and their acquisition costs. Recent policy interventions allow for limited competition to urban governments as the sole provider of LURs, as well as changes in compensation rules that favor rural land owners. These changes, when combined with lower trend growth in urban land values since 2017, challenge the stability of the land finance system, because they reduce the profitability of the system from the perspective of local urban governments. Thus, the policy priority of the ongoing reform is not how to reduce local governments' reliance on land finance, but to develop viable alternative revenue sources for local governments.",Land finance in China: Analysis and review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001262,29-Sep-22,2022,Research Article,106

We find that compared to average-looking managers, those who rated as attractive do not engage more actively in corporate donations. On the contrary, the probability of donating is approximately 5% higher for unattractive managers than for average-looking managers; further, unattractive managers donate 95% more in charitable giving. To explain these findings, we propose a psychological channel through which physical appearance may influence male managers' charitable donations: Because altruistic behaviors may aggrandize individuals, managers conscious of deficits in their own physical attractiveness may engage in ","Individuals considered physically attractive have quantifiable economic and social advantages. In the public sphere, attractive people are more likely than their unattractive peers to be recruited and promoted (====; ====); to earn higher wages (====; ====); and to prevail in political elections (====; ====; ====; ====); executive compensation (====); and IPO roadshow performance (====). Although prior research has extensively examined stakeholders' and business partners' responses to managers' appearance, little attention has been paid to the influence of the attractiveness of top corporate leaders¡ªprimarily male¡ªon these managers' own decisions regarding firm operation, e.g., whether the firm should participate in charitable giving, and if so, the size of the given contribution.====; ====). The extant literature also shows corporate philanthropy to be highly correlated with the demographics of top executives, including gender, tenure, moral values, and other traits (====; ====; ====). Given the importance of top managers' personal characteristics in corporate charitable contribution as well as the larger significance of physical appearance in socioeconomic contexts, we pose this question: Is there a link between corporate giving and CEO attractiveness? Research has shown that physically attractive people receive larger amounts in donations (====; ====); additionally, more socially desirable personality traits such as altruism, trustworthiness, and intelligence are attributed to attractive people (====In order to account for a stronger incentive for unattractive managers to engage in corporate philanthropy, we propose a psychological channel through which physical appearance may influence a manager's attitude towards charitable giving. The explanation for the negative relation between a given manager's attractiveness and corporate philanthropy is premised on the assumption that physically unattractive people may develop appearance-based concern and anxiety. Because altruistic behaviors may aggrandize individuals and concretely enhance their performance evaluations (====; ====; ====; ====). Accordingly, a corresponding view posits that less attractive managers may anticipate potentially more severe judgement on their prosocial and financial performance due to their looks, and thus tend to contribute more in corporate philanthropy to enhance their performance assessment.==== Namely, corporate philanthropy may emerge as a strategy for certain executives to counteract their concern/anxiety regarding their undesirable appearance. Significantly, this ostensibly altruistic behavior as a response to a manager's personal psychological needs indicates serious agency problems. Consistent with this reasoning, we find that the influence of CEO attractiveness on corporate giving is more pronounced in firms with weaker corporate governance, and that the effect of corporate charity on a firm's financial performance is positive for attractive and average-looking managers but not significant for less unattractive managers.====Our research makes three central contributions to the literature. First, our findings shed new light on distinct motivations for corporate philanthropy, which is a critical component of the larger domain of CSR. The relevant literature posits that companies engage in corporate philanthropy and other prosocial activities as a strategy¡ªreactive or proactive¡ªto achieve one or more of the following six goals: (i) conforming to laws and regulations (====); (ii) improving operating performance (====); (iii) promoting firm image and reputation (====; ====); (iv) meeting external stakeholders' expectations (====; ====); (v) attracting and retaining talented employees (====); and (vi) gaining political resources (====). Other studies look at managers' social performance in the context of their ethics and moral values (====; ====). To our knowledge, no research in management or business ethics has to this point examined managers' physical appearance as a potential determinant of their prosocial motivations and behaviors. Hence, our paper is the first investigation in this line of research.====Second, this study contributes to the literature on the role of the demographics of top executives in corporate decision making. Prior scholarship documents that corporate policies and behaviors are determined by personal qualities of corporate leaders such as age (====); gender (====); education (====); professional experience (====); and organizational identification (====). In the literature on corporate philanthropy, charitable contributions are found to be negatively related to executives' ownership (====) and tenure (====), while positively related to their political connections (====), common owners (====), and to gender in the case of female executives (====). Additional evidence indicates that corporate prosocial engagements are also potentially driven by managers' religiosity (====); political ideologies (====); and narcissism (====). Our study adopts a new perspective by investigating the effect of managers' attractiveness on their business decisions.====Third and finally, the present research expands our knowledge of the beauty effect and appearance-based biases that have been demonstrated as widespread in socioeconomic life. People who believe the platitude that ¡°what is beautiful is good¡± may presume a connection between physical attractiveness and ethical qualities: i.e., inferring warmth, empathy, and altruism from physical attractiveness. However, prior research provides scant evidence on the relation between prosocial behavior and physical attractiveness. ==== document a strong positive relation between a person's attractiveness and volunteering behavior but a much weaker beauty effect on charitable donation.

According to the Revision of ====, the requirements for firms to be identified as high-tech are restricted to their level of research and development (R&D) expenses, the proportion of scientific and technological employees out of the total number of employees, and the proportion of income stemming from new and high-tech products ¨C all of which are contingent upon a firm's innovation capabilities and its corresponding level of existing innovation patents. The existing literature does not significantly explore the degree to which high-tech firm identification policies incentivize its innovation efforts. Additionally, there is scant analysis on the potential channels through which high-tech firm identification policies may positively affect the innovation of these firms. Undoubtedly, these are all important issues requiring further investigation.====There are several representative papers concluding that denoting firms as high-tech ones help promote their innovation (====; ====; ====; ====). Some studies also discuss the heterogeneous effects of the high-tech firm identification policy with regards to shareholders' rights of ultimate ownership control, corporate life cycle, and senior executives' background. However, these studies have the following limitations: (1) they do not offer an in-depth discussion of the channels through which China's high-tech firm identification policy affects firm innovation; (2) the discussion of heterogeneity mainly focuses on firm-level characteristics and rarely considers such effects from the government perspective; an (3) they do not consider the welfare implications of this policy.====This paper makes three main contributions to the existing literature.

We discover that financial permeation via bank branch expansion boosts household income and mitigates household vulnerability to poverty, and these effects are magnified on lower-income and more vulnerable households, especially in impoverished counties. Further considering the potential substitution effect of FinTech, we verify that enhancing financial permeation via bank branch expansion still matters to rural poverty reduction even in the digital era. Exploring the channels, we find that financial permeation accelerates rural poverty reduction directly through improving financial utilization and motivating investment activities and indirectly through spurring local economic growth. Notably, the more pronounced marginal effects of the channels on households in impoverished counties, to some extent, explain the poverty reduction effect of financial permeation. The results imply the necessity of financial permeation via bank branch expansion for the realization of shared prosperity.","). However, about 40% of the world's population is financially excluded (====), and the proportion is even higher in rural areas. In this context, enhancing financial permeation by expanding the financial network to spread financial services among economic entities (====; ====; ====), especially in rural areas, will probably strengthen the beneficial effects of financial services on the poor to reduce poverty.====; ====However, the answer for what on earth enhancing financial permeation via bank branch expansion brings to the poor households is still unclear, especially in the context of rural China. The earlier studies on the effect of banking market development on poverty reduction mainly focus on income disparity (e.g., ====) and rural headcount ratio (e.g., ====) from the macro perspectives using cross-country data. Among micro banking studies, in contrast to the vast banking literature on the importance and specialness of bank branches in serving firms (e.g., ====; ====; ====), there is a void in the literature on the banking market structure evolution in serving the economic and financial needs of households. Also, the existing literature on the banking-household nexus fails to further verify the presence of more significant marginal effects of bank branch supply evolution on poor households (e.g., ====; ====; ====), the importance and necessity of enhancing financial permeation via physical bank branch expansion to the poor in counties are well worth discussing. In fact, physical bank branches should be more critical to the poor, and the digitalization of banks will probably lead to the dilemma that the poor lose bank branches, but the rich secretly keep theirs due to better adaptability to FinTech. In general, understanding how enhancing financial permeation via bank branch expansion affects poor households in rural China is an essential issue for rural poverty reduction.====In this paper, we first shed light on what the enhancement of financial permeation via bank branch expansion in counties brings to rural households in China and how much poor households share in the poverty reduction effect of financial permeation in counties.

Second, we expand the existing literature by examining the heterogeneous effects of financial permeation on households with different poverty intensities rather than only focusing on the average effect, and we have verified the macro conclusions that bank branch expansion tightens the income distribution and reduces rural headcount ratio using micro household data.

The results show that the trade war significantly changed local governments' economic development strategies. As the trade war progressed, Chinese local governments shifted their attention to boosting the development of high-tech ==== by significantly increasing the proportion of land supply for these industries. After the trade war, for every 1% increase in the US exports as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), land supply to high-tech industries increased by 0.25%. This effect is more prevalent in cities with more fiscal resources, a younger secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Municipal Committee, lower levels of public nationalism, and a larger share of foreign enterprises among exporters. These results are consistent with our assumption that the pressure generated by the US¨CChina trade war has significantly increased the potential returns for local governments in terms of developing high-tech industries.","The current era has witnessed a strong resurgence of trade protection and deglobalization; the trade friction between the United States (US) and China is a remarkable example of this. On March 23, 2018, former US President Donald Trump announced the imposition of high new tariffs on China's exports, based on the ¡°301 Investigations.¡± This event marked the beginning of an ongoing US¨CChina trade war during which the scope and rates of punitive tariffs increased significantly; the result was a notable decrease in Chinese exports to the US as well as Chinese exporters' profits. Consequently, the trade war placed direct pressure on China's economic growth and the government's fiscal revenues.====; ====; ====In this study, we investigate how Chinese local governments reacted to the exogenous shock of the US¨CChina trade war and shaped economic development by changing the supply of one essential factor under their control¡ª====. We assume that it is more likely that the trade war negatively affected the Chinese cities with higher exports to the US; accordingly, we compared the differences in government land supply behaviors before and after the trade war among regions with different ratios of exports to the US. This enabled us to employ a difference-in-differences (DID) framework to formally examine how the trade war affected local government behaviors.====To conduct the analysis, we obtained information on nationwide industrial land transfers from 2017 to 2019, which facilitated an effective examination of government behavior. We used land supply to measure governments' development strategies for two reasons. First, land is a fundamentally important carrier of industrial development. According to China's land supervision system, the central government controls the total amount of land resources, and local governments are responsible for land use control. As local governments have direct control over land resources, land resource allocation directly reflects their development strategies. Second, the land transaction data used in this study helped to identify changes in the land transfer behavior during the trade war from a micro perspective. Using this micro dataset, we calculated the monthly share of new high-tech ==== land transfer in each city, as a measure of the local government's tendency to allocate resources.====Further, to measure the variation in economic pressure caused by the trade war, we calculated exports to the US as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) at the city level, using 2016 customs export data. As mentioned above, we assume that this ratio reflects the trade war's potential economic impact on different cities. The larger a city's share of exports to the US in its GDP, the more its economic development relies on its trade relationship with the US. Therefore, the trade war caused cities with a high share of exports to the US to suffer more and experience greater pressure on their economic development.====This study's results show several key findings. First, the trade war significantly increased the proportion of land that local governments granted to high-tech industries. Cities with higher exports to the US significantly increased the share of land they granted to high-tech industries after negotiations between the two countries were blocked in May 2019. A 1% increase in the ratio of US-oriented exports to GDP is associated with a 0.25% increase in the land grants for high-tech enterprises. Second, the higher the export share of foreign-funded enterprises, the faster the trade war had led to growth in high-tech land grants. Third, the trade war's impact is related to local government characteristics. A stronger government fiscal capacity, a younger secretary of the CPC Municipal Committee, a shorter term of the secretary in office, or the presence of a CPC Municipal Committee secretary born outside the city has caused a greater increase in the proportion of land grants for high-tech enterprises after the trade war. In addition, local governments are better able to complement their strategy in cities with low levels of nationalism, which means they do not face public pressure; the positive relationship between exports to the US and high-tech land supply is more prevalent in cities where the public emotion of nationalism is lower.====We contribute to the existing literature in the following ways. First, we study the trade war's impact on government behavior from the perspective of local government resource allocation. Existing literature on the US¨CChina trade war has focused on tariff changes' short-term effects on exports. For example, some studies have found that higher tariffs reduced US consumers' welfare (====), decreased monthly total real revenues (====), and caused an approximate 13.21% decline in Chinese exports (====). Although it is clear that the trade war placed immense pressure on economic growth, we examine the possibility that government resource allocation triggered by these pressures may be beneficial in terms of promoting local industrial upgrading in the long run.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Notably, there is consensus in the literature that openness promotes industrial transformation and upgrading, while restrictions and trade controls exhibit the opposite effects.

First, broadband infrastructure significantly promotes digital financial inclusion in rural China. Second, we distinguish between two dimensions of digital financial inclusion, namely, the coverage dimension and the usage dimension.

We find that the effect of broadband infrastructure on digital financial inclusion in the usage dimension is more profound in areas with higher levels of human capital, higher levels of social capital, and higher penetrations of bank branches.====This study contributes to a better understanding of the path to financial inclusion.

The development of technology has created new opportunities to improve financial inclusion.

Using the example of student vision health care seeking behavior in rural China, this research investigates whether the framing effect in behavioral economics is useful in promoting uptake of public health services under a subsidy intervention. Using randomized controlled trials, 35 rural schools in two counties in Shaanxi province were randomly assigned to different intervention groups, each of which delivered information to students and parents with different message framing. The study found that: (1) Both the gain and loss message framing can significantly improve the vision center visit rate and eyeglasses ownership of rural students with visual impairment and the uptake of public health services. (2) There was no significant difference in the intervention effect of the two message framing. (3) Message framing are more effective for students with high perceived value of eyeglasses voucher, and message framing improves the overall vision health services uptake by increasing the visit rate of students with high perceived value. The findings may serve as a theoretical foundation for future public health service strategies aimed at increasing the contribution of non-economic interventions to economic interventions, thereby promoting the usage of public health services by employing applicable behavioral ====.","With the development of economy and technology, inexpensive, highly efficacious health services exist for many leading developing country diseases. However, the uptake of these public health services remains low in developing countries. Prominent examples include insecticide-treated bed nets(====), condoms (====), vitamin supplements (====), eyeglasses(====) and basic primary health care services. An important problem that remains to be resolved is to increase the uptake of these health services.====A widely used way to improve the uptake of health services for low-income groups is free or highly subsidized distribution of health products by decreasing the financial threshold and ensuring access (====). Although subsidized intervention can improve the uptake of public health services to a certain extent, it is still lower than the optimal level and expectations of policy-makers, and project cost-effectiveness needs to be improved. For example, hepatitis B vaccination is free worldwide, the global coverage rate of birth doses in 2019 was 43%, the coverage rate in the Eastern Mediterranean region was only 34%, and the coverage rate in Africa was only 6% (====). Similarly, only 11.4% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose free COVID-19 vaccine at the end of February 2022 (====). Another, a study conducted in rural areas of China showed that the rate of students wearing eyeglasses only increased to 41% after the distribution of free eyeglasses (====).====The cognitive and behavioral bias in behavioral economics, as well as its empirical studies, give a novel method to address the problem that the impact of providing subsidies to increase the uptake of health services is lower than what policy-maker expects (====, ====). In addition, their cognitive and numeracy abilities are limited, and their decisions are not based on a thorough and thoughtful analysis of all available information, resulting in systemic mistakes (i.e., biases) in the decision-making process, which in turn lead to sub-optimal and even harmful behaviors (====; ====). In recent years, behavioral economics-related studies have shown that policy mistakes caused by behavioral biases can be improved and optimized to a certain extent by combining behavioral economics in policy design (====; ====)¡£.====Some studies have shown that the framing effect of behavioral economics can be properly applied to improve people's health behaviors. The framing effect refers to the fact that individuals' choices often depend on the way the choices are described, or framed, and that these choices are often affected by whether the possible outcomes are framed in terms of the gains or the losses (====). The framing effect has been studied in a wide range of health behaviors (====). It can be used to guide people toward health-promoting decisions. A health message can be framed to stress the advantages (i.e., gain-framed message) of engaging in a certain action or the drawbacks (i.e., loss-framed message) of not doing so (====).====Loss-framed communications are more successful for disease detection activities like cancer screening, whereas gain-framed messages are more effective for encouraging preventative behaviors, according to studies (====; ====; ====). A meta-analysis of 94 research indicated that health messages that were presented as gains or advantages were considerably more likely than those that were framed as losses to enhance preventative behaviors. However, several research has shown that risk in the original framing effect relates to uncertainty, and that applying this idea to all health activities is not suitable. Meanwhile, several recent study findings contradict the above two conclusions (====; ====). As a result, in the field of public health, it is important to explore whether the message framing may enhance the uptake rate of public health services when subsidies are provided, and what form of message framing is more effective.====This study examines whether the use of message framing may enhance the uptake of vision health services among visual impaired students in rural areas of China. We use a randomized control trial design to compare different message framing to the parents of students as the intervention to comparison groups: no message framing. All 4008 in grades 4¨C9 students from 35 schools were screened, and parents of students who failed vision screen were notified. We then randomly assigned schools to one of three groups: a ¡°control¡± group, in which after the screening, an eyeglasses voucher will be issued to the students who failed vision screening. The voucher uses a neutral expression to clearly inform parents that the student has failed vision screening and that they are advised to visit the vision center for further examination. This voucher was redeemable for one pair of free eyeglasses at the vision center in the county seat; a ¡°Loss-framed¡± group, in which compared with the control group, the loss-framed message emphasized the disadvantages of not wearing eyeglasses in time; and a ¡°Gain-framed¡± group, in which compared with the control group, the gain-framed message emphasized the advantages of wearing eyeglasses in time. Using this experimental design, we compare the effects of each type of intervention, on vision center visit and eyeglasses ownership one month and four months after voucher distribution.====We emphasize three main findings. First, Both the gain and loss message framing can significantly improve the vision center visit rate and eyeglasses ownership of rural students with visual impairment and the uptake of public health services. Second, there was no significant difference in the intervention effect of the two message framing. Third, Message framing are more effective for students with high perceived value of eyeglasses voucher, and message framing improves the overall vision health services uptake by increasing the visit rate of students with high perceived value.====Compared with existing researches, this article makes the following contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to examine the effect of message framing on the uptake of vision health services in rural China. The existing studies mainly focus on weight loss(====), smoking cessation (====), and cancer screening (====). Second, to identify the causal relationship, this study conducted a randomized control trail in rural western China, which is one of the rare data for policy evaluation in Chinese field trials. In a methodological sense, this study thus showcases how field experiments can be used in providing insights on health behavior in practice and in identifying the directions future theoretical research should pursue.====The rest of the study is arranged as follows: ==== introduces the research background on the use of visual health services for rural students. ==== introduces the experimental design and data collection. ==== introduces the research results. ==== discusses the policy implications of the experimental results and draws conclusions.",The impact of message framing on uptake of vision health services for rural students in China: A randomized control trial,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001134,8-Sep-22,2022,Research Article,112

We show that robot adoption promotes egalitarian gender role attitudes; and the impact is statistically larger for women, urban, and younger generation subsamples. We provide evidence to show that the reshaping of gender role attitudes is mainly due to the improvement and rationalization of women's employment performance: robot adoption increases females' non-agricultural employment opportunity and their wage, and also improves females' relative economic status both in the workplace and in the household.","Through the twentieth century, there has been a rise in gender-equality awareness and an improvement of females' social status worldwide. Recent research suggests that numerous factors could be the driven determinants, and technological progress is one of the factors (====; ====). Technological progress increases the demand for jobs that require more social and interpersonal skills and less physical skills, giving rise to increased female labor force participation in recent decades (====). However, females are not always beneficiary of any technological progress. For example, ==== find robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones in the US; ==== find that industrial robots and computing equipment lead to a reduction of both male and female wages in the US; and ====As AI and automation become increasingly important drivers of economic growth in many countries, it would be interesting to explore whether automation could shape gender equality views, which is the focus of this paper. Particularly, we investigate how a province's exposure to robots influences an individual's gender role attitudes in China which is the largest developing economy and the world's greatest manufacturing center by combining two datasets: the China General Social Survey (CGSS hereafter) and the robot installation data from the International Federation of Robots (IFR hereafter).====We capture and measure an individual's gender role attitudes by using survey questions in the CGSS. Especially, we focus on five questions asking individuals whether they agree with the statements: ¡°====¡±, ¡°====¡±, ¡°====¡±, ¡°====¡±, and ¡°====¡±. These gender role attitude questions are related to gender role attitudes on career, competency, marriage, dismissal, and housework, accordingly, and are consistently available from round-year 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2018 of the CGSS which covers >28 provinces and makes us possible to investigate whether the impact of robotization extends to other aspects of gender role attitudes.====We find that robot adoption promotes egalitarian gender role attitudes on career, competency, marriage, dismissal, and housework, respectively. There is a key challenge in this research, which is to deal with endogeneity concerns and identify the causal relationship between the exposure to robots and gender role attitudes. There might exists unobserved province-level factors influencing the exposure to robots and gender role attitudes at the same time; and gender role attitudes could affect the labor supply of males and females, and thus shape the demand of robot adoption in each province. The reduced-form effect can be interpreted as a causal relationship if we can show that the pre-trends of gender role attitudes are parallel among provinces before any massive robot adoption in China (====). That is to say, the labor share in industries which can predict the later robot adoption in provinces has no statistically significant relationship with gender role attitudes before any massive adoption of robots.====Following the methods adopted in the literature, we verify the plausibility of the identification assumption by three tests. First, we look at the correlation between the employment shares in each industry and controls at the province level in 2006 (before any massive adoption of robots). The automotive, electronical/electronics, industrial machinery, metal products, and plastic and chemical products industry have the top five largest employment shares at the province level. Following ====, we find that there is no consistent and statistically significant correlation between the employment shares in each industry and the provincial controls. Second, following ====, we find that the robot adoption or employment shares in different industries in 2006 (before any massive adoption of robots) have non-significant impact on gender role attitudes. Third, following ====, we show that the coefficient of the lags is larger and significant and the coefficient of the leads of the variable ==== is not statistically significant in the basic regression by replacing the robotization in year t with that in year t-1, t-2, and t?+?1.==== The results of the three tests above provide evidence to show that the industry employment shares in each province do not predict changes in gender role attitudes when there were a limited number of robots installed, which is the common trends assumption in a difference-in-differences approach.====Several robustness studies further strengthen our findings. First, our results are robust to an alternative measurement of robotization in which the stock of robots before the baseline year is excluded. Second, as ==== and electronical/electronics industry are the two most robot-intensive sectors and are the most important industry in Jilin and Guangdong, respectively, we show that our findings still stand when we exclude Jilin or Guangdong from our sample. Third, since the responses to survey questions on gender role attitudes are category variables and are re-coded as 0¨C1 variables in the main exploration, we adopt non-linear empirical regression methods to show that our results are not driven by the measurement method of gender role attitudes.====After that, we show that the exposure to robots induces changes in the gendered labor markets. More specifically, the process of robotization improves females' probability to get employed and their wage in the workplace; and it reduces males' employment opportunity while it improves the wage return for those who are employed. Females' relative economic status in the labor market and in the household is improved, respectively, by the increasing exposure to robots; that is, females are empowered by robots.====If rationalization of females' (relative) economic status is one mechanism of the impact of robotization, we should observe further empirical evidence that an increase in the exposure to robots leads some cohorts more likely to agree with the egalitarian work-related gender role attitude and females in the cohort more likely to be empowered in the labor market than those for the counterparts. We then explore the heterogenous impacts with respect to gender, residence type (====), age, and provinces with different degree of traditional gender culture and varying degree of robotization, respectively. The exposure to robots improves gender role attitudes in a larger extent for female, urban, younger subsamples, and those from regions with low traditional gender culture and high degree of robotization. The heterogeneous impacts on labor market outcomes are similar, which supports that rationalization of labor market performance is one important channel that robotization shapes gender role attitudes.====This paper contributes to the literature on factors affecting gender equality and gender role attitudes formation. ==== find that countries that historically practiced plough agriculture in the pre-industrial period have less equal gender norms. ==== find that improved medical knowledge and obstetric practices enabled married women to increase their participation in the labor force, thus providing the incentive to invest in labor market skills, potentially narrowing gender earnings differentials. ==== provide empirical evidence that computer technology increases women's share in non-routine and interaction tasks and narrows the gender pay gap in German. ==== show that an increase in computers reduces female wage more than male wage and hence enlarges gender pay gap in the US. ==== finds that export composition differences in gender-specific skills can affect individuals' work-related gender role attitude by using cross-country data from World Value Survey. ==== find that the compulsory primary education can shape egalitarian gender role attitudes, and ==== shows that higher education expansion has a negative impact on egalitarian gender role attitudes in China. ==== finds that increasing female relative income improves survival rates for girls in the beginning of the reform in China. This paper is the first one which explores the determinant role of robots on gender role attitudes.====There is a growing strand of literature studying the impact of robots on gender pay gap. ==== find that industrial robots lead to a reduction of both male and female wages but also decreases the gender pay gap in the US; and ==== find opposite evidence in European countries and show that robot adoption increases both male and female earnings but also increases the gender pay gap in European countries with high initial levels of gender inequality. Our paper contributes to this stream of literature and provides evidence for China, the largest developing country. We find that robotization increases female employment probability and decreases male employment probability in non-agriculture jobs; and robotization increases both male and female wages and also decreases the gender pay gap.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the data used for this study. ==== first outlines the empirical specification and main findings on gender role attitudes, and then presents the identification tests, robustness, and results on labor market outcomes. ==== provides evidence on potential mechanism by heterogeneity analyses, and ==== concludes.",Can robots reshape gender role attitudes?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001109,7-Sep-22,2022,Research Article,113

This paper investigates the impact of higher education expansion on labor market participants' choices, beliefs, and learning effects through an extended education signaling model, and uncovers the behavioral patterns in response to this policy change using a laboratory experiment. We find that subjects playing the role of workers generally follow a threshold strategy, and the changes in their effort investments and received wages after the enrollment expansion are consistent with the theoretical prediction. Using a hierarchical clustering method, we estimate different types of empirical strategies adopted by the subjects. In the low-enrollment treatment, the three types of empirical strategies are more distinct, and there is a strong tendency for effort over-investment by low-ability workers and under-investment by high-ability workers. In the high-enrollment treatment, the distinction between the estimated strategy types becomes much smaller. An analysis using elicited beliefs suggests that effort over-investment stems from workers' inconsistent beliefs regarding firms' wage offers ¡ª this inconsistency persists even in the last few periods of the game. Our findings provide a belief-based explanation for the discussion on over-education and are of great policy relevance.","China's higher education expansion policy has led to significant changes in younger generations' educational choices and labor market outcomes, and this trend is expected to continue. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the State Council and Ministry of Education launched post-graduate education expansion plans over the next few years, in response to the unprecedented economic challenges and enormous pressure on urban employment caused by the pandemic. The Great Expansion at the college level, starting from 1999, had pushed the gross enrollment rate of higher education from 9.76% in 1998 to 57.8% in 2021.==== The ongoing expansion at the post-graduate level brought about a rapid growth in graduate school enrollments from potential labor-market entrants. The number of newly admitted graduate students reached 1.18 million in 2021, a 28.4% leap from 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic.==== Education expansion at the college level has resulted in dramatic changes in the average productivity, unemployment rates, labor costs, and wage premiums in China's labor market (====, ====, ====, ====). Therefore, it is important to understand young market entrants' choices and beliefs, as well as hiring firms' expectations at the micro-level to better shape the current post-graduate education expansion policy. This paper is among the first work to examine the effect of the higher education expansion policy on market participants' choices and beliefs using controlled laboratory methods. We aim to provide a behavioral foundation for the growing literature that evaluates the policy's impact on the labor market in the midst of the pandemic-induced economic shock.====This paper investigates the impact of higher education expansion on the choices, beliefs, and learning effects of both sides of the labor market through an extended education signaling model with unproductive education, and tests the model's prediction using a laboratory experiment. Empirical studies have widely documented the substantial effect of China's education expansion policy on various aspects of the labor market, including the higher unemployment rate among young college graduates (====), fewer opportunities for new labor-market entrants to access ¡°good jobs¡± (====), significant changes in the college-wage premiums for different worker cohorts (====, ====, ====), and magnified resource misallocation and a reduction in average labor productivity (====). However, in the empirical data, individual workers' abilities are largely unobserved. The laboratory environment with induced values for different ability types allows us to identify individual workers' education investment strategies with respect to different potential ability levels. The belief elicitation with real money incentives helps us precisely measure workers' expectations regarding the prevailing wage in the market, and firms' expectations of the average productivity of each worker group. Using experimental methods, we are able to examine the behavioral driving forces behind the labor market outcomes resulting from the higher education expansion.====Besides the unobserved ability, in reality the heterogeneity in workers' production function may also affect firms' expectations regarding average productivity, which contributes to the market wage disparity between degree and non-degree holders. Our theoretical analysis indicates that, after an enrollment expansion, the direction of the change in the wage premium of higher education depends on certain properties of the workers' productivity function with regard to their underlying abilities. For a binary partition of the worker's ability type space, we define the worker's production function as high?/low- ability biased if the negative impact of the higher education expansion on the worker's average productivity is less severe for the high?/low- ability group. Given this characterization, the model in ==== features a high-ability biased production function, which helps explain the increasing wage premium induced by higher education expansion in the United States (====; ====; ====; ====). By contrast, we demonstrate that the class of low-ability biased production functions will result in a decreasing higher-education wage premium; our experimental data confirms the theoretical prediction. Our findings echo the existing empirical results that the college-wage premium in China before and after the higher education expansion increases for older cohorts and decreases for younger cohorts, and that different age groups with different production technology may experience opposite changes in their college wage premiums as a result of the higher education expansion (====, ====).====The analysis of our experimental data indicates the following: first, the ==== of the main choice variables are consistent with our theoretical predictions. Subjects who play the role of workers generally follow a threshold strategy, and their effort investments are lower in the high-enrollment treatment. Compared with the low-enrollment treatment, a type of wage-offering strategy used by most firms in the high-enrollment treatment generates a significant decrease in the wage premium of higher-education, which is consistent with our theoretical analysis of the low-ability biased production functions. Second, using a hierarchical clustering method, we compare different types of empirical strategies adopted by our subjects in the role of workers. In the low-enrollment treatment, the three types of empirical strategies are more distinct. For the two strategy types used by more than 84% of the subjects, there is a strong tendency for over-investment in education by the lower-than-threshold-ability workers, and under-investment in education by the higher-than-threshold-ability workers. In the high-enrollment treatment, the distinction between the estimated strategy types becomes much smaller; nonetheless, more than 85% of the subjects use over-investment strategies when their ability types are below, but relatively close to, the threshold type. The over-investment increases the likelihood of acquiring a higher-education degree for the lower-than-threshold-ability workers. Consequently, firms' wage offers to higher-education degree-holders are significantly below the equilibrium level.====Using the elicited beliefs, we further investigate the reasons behind workers' over-investment in effort choices and firms' under-paying wage offers to the group of degree-holders. We are interested in the following questions: if the non-equilibrium behavioral patterns arise from non-equilibrium beliefs of both sides of the market, how long does it take for the beliefs to converge to the equilibrium level? If the beliefs do not converge, how well do the two sides of the market learn, and are their beliefs eventually consistent with the other side's choices and behavior? Our data indicates that, in both treatments, workers' beliefs are inconsistent with the equilibrium prediction. In particular, workers' beliefs about the market wage paid to non-degree-holders are persistently higher than the equilibrium level. Moreover, compared with firms' wage offers and the realized market wages, workers hold unrealistically high beliefs and over-estimate their potential earnings. For the workers' beliefs about degree-holders' wages, the magnitude of the over-estimation shrinks over time, indicating a sign of adaptive learning. Nonetheless, the workers' over-estimation of non-degree-holders' wages persists even in the last few periods of the game. Furthermore, an examination of firms' beliefs shows that firms systematically under-estimate the ability levels of degree-holders on the market, and the trend persists even in the last few periods. There is little sign of learning, in that firms are reluctant to adjust their expectations in light of the market reality. Our findings of the inconsistency between players' expectations and their actual behaviors provide a belief-based explanation for the discussion on over-education and are of great policy relevance (====, ====, ====).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides details about China's education expansion policy, in particular the post-graduate education expansion in response to the COVID-19 shock. ==== reviews the related literature. ==== presents the model, equilibrium, and comparative static results. ==== presents the experimental design and laboratory procedure. ==== presents the experimental findings in detail.

The Gendered Name Index we constructed shows that male and female names have been converging over the past century, mainly attributed to the defeminization of female names. A ==== reveals that the gender characteristics of Chinese names are highly correlated with parental characteristics, the strength of kinship networks, and local socioeconomic conditions. Additionally, the genderedness of a name has mild but statistically significant effects on labor market performance. Notably, a masculine name will increase men's earnings, while a feminine name will prevent women from entering the labor market and reduce their earnings. These findings support both gender identity and gender discrimination mechanisms.","Over the past century, China has witnessed the most dramatic social transformation¡ªfrom an agrarian society to a planned economy in Mao's era and then to a modern economy marked by reform and opening up. One of the most notable changes has been the rise of women's status and women leaders or ¡°Mulans¡±==== in all areas. A wide array of studies has documented the continued narrowing of China's gender gap in various economic aspects, including education, health, and labor market performance (====; ====; ====). However, few quantitative studies have traced the gender gap from the cultural perspective (====; ====). The latter is challenging, as attitudes and social norms concerning gender roles are subtle, elusive, and difficult to measure quantitatively. In this study, we use the genderedness of personal names to measure gender role attitudes and local social norms about gender, which is more accurate than the commonly used stated attitudes in survey data and varies across time and regions. With the gender name index constructed from census data, we explore two questions: What determines the genderedness of a Chinese name? What impacts will a masculine or feminine name have on the bearer?====As the primary symbol that distinguishes one person from another, a name can contain information of race, class, religion, and culture (====), and may influence an individual's life (====; ====; ====). In the naming practices of most languages, the gender of a name is easily discernible. For example, a name's gender can be explained in Latin languages by combining letters and different tones (====; ====). However, the Chinese have a long tradition of attaching great importance to names, and the abundance of Chinese characters lends more possibilities and meanings (====). Traditionally, male and female names in Chinese are different in the characters used. Nevertheless, Chinese media have observed the emergence of unisex names in recent years, especially for children of Generation Alpha.==== However, to our knowledge, research in the social sciences has so far fallen short of exploring the causes and consequences of such changes in Chinese names.====This study, drawing up data from the 2005 China mini-census, constructs a gendered name index to measure the genderedness of Chinese names. Additionally, by combining multi-source datasets, we investigate the causes and consequences of gendered names. Several interesting findings have emerged. First, the genderedness of male and female names has converged over the past century. Mainly, female names exhibited a more pronounced trend in gender neutrality, with the most significant changes occurring in the 1960s and the 1980s. Second, the genderedness of Chinese names is highly correlated with parental characteristics, the strength of kinship networks, and local socioeconomic conditions. Generally, mothers influence their children's names more than fathers, and daughters' names are more likely to be influenced than sons'. Third, the genderedness of both male and female names is found to have a mild but conspicuous correlation with labor market performance.====Our work builds on and contributes to three strands of literature. First, it sheds new light on understanding the gender gap in China from a cultural perspective. The differences between women and men in education (====; ====), employment (====; ====), income (====; ====), health (====), and political participation (====), have been well documented in China. However, the gender gap issue has not been adequately examined from a cultural perspective. Recent studies have attempted to address this gap. For example, ==== revealed that social norms on gender within families significantly affect female labor force participation in urban China. ==== contend that gender-related community social norms play an important role in the unexplained gap in labor force participation. However, the indicators of gender culture used in these studies are mainly proxied by subjective questionnaire answers, potentially containing measurement errors. The genderedness of names provides a new perspective to examine gender attitudes and local social norms on gender with less systematically error in a manner, since naming a child is an autonomous process and therefore more likely to convey the true attitudes of parents, although it has the weaknesses of being unable to distinguish sub-dimensions of gender-role attitude and the attitude of husband and wife.====Second, this study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants of naming practices. As parents usually have the legal right to decide the name of their newborn in all countries, parental characteristics have been featured most prominently in the literature. For example, ==== analyzed the names of newborn children in Holland from 1982 to 2005 and identified several determinants, including parents' education, family income, parents' religious beliefs, and political values. Similarly, a case study by ==== revealed that parents' racial and educational backgrounds had the strongest influence on the naming patterns of boys and girls born in New York State from 1973 to 1985. In addition to parental characteristics, social, cultural, and historical events could also shape the way parents name their children. For instance, ==== found that exposure to foreign media significantly affected French parents' naming practices. ==== seminal work on African American children born from 1961 to 2000 in California demonstrated that the Black Power Movement led most African American parents to give their children distinct Black names in the 1970s. In China, ==== highlighted that some specific historical events in the last century gave rise to unique names such as ¡°====¡± (Liberation), ¡°====¡± (Founding of the People's Republic), and ¡°====¡± (Cultural Revolution). However, in general, studies examining the social determinants of Chinese names are scarce. Our study enriches the literature by quantitatively analyzing the determinants of Chinese naming practice and proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates parental characteristics, clan culture, and regional socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, we show how the determinants of the gender characteristics of Chinese names can be explained by price theory, signal and identity model, collective decision model, cultural transmission, and cultural assimilation.====Third, the study adds a new dimension, genderedness, to the research topic on the impacts of names and explores the underlying mechanisms. Many previous studies have shown that localness, popularity, and racial characteristics of names would influence social activities, such as job hunting, investment, and crime (====; ====; ====). Few studies have explored the impact of the gender characteristics of names, among which are two pioneering studies: ==== argued that boys with feminine-sounding names tend to act up in class to express their masculinity when entering secondary school; ==== reaffirmed the ¡°Portia hypothesis,¡±==== claiming that women with masculine names perform better in the legal profession. However, such cases are rare in languages such as English, in which the gender of a name is often clearly distinguishable, and masculine female names or feminine male names are uncommon.==== Chinese names have no clear gender boundaries but demonstrate differences between male and female names. Although male and female names have some habitual high-frequency characters, that is all Chinese characters can be used in names and many of them are used in both male and female names. Therefore, Chinese names have no specific gender boundary. This makes it possible to construct a Gendered Name Index based on the frequency in regard to the use of each Chinese character in female and male names.====Researchers have further explored the mechanisms by which names affect people. Among them, the self-identification and discrimination mechanisms are the most discussed. For example, ==== suggested that individuals tend to choose careers similar to their names (e.g., people named ¡°Dennis¡± are more likely to be dentists). ==== showed that name help in the embodied doing of gender in life course, such as at the birth of babies, at marriage, and during gender identity transitions. Much empirical evidence also shows that names may trigger stereotypes in the labor market. For example, a classic audit study found that job seekers with typically White names on their resumes received 50% more interview opportunities than those with typically Black names (====). Similarly, ==== found clear gender discrimination in certain female- or male-dominated occupations in the United Kingdom in their recruitment experiment. Drawing on a rich set of available variables, we propose a series of hypotheses to test the two mechanisms leading to the impacts of gendered names.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: ==== provides background information about naming practices in China and the gendered nature of Chinese names. ==== introduces the construction of a gendered name index and describes its temporal trends and spatial variations. ==== presents the empirical findings on the determinants of the genderedness of Chinese names and seeks theoretical explanations for them. ==== explores the impacts of a name's gendered characteristics on income and labor market participation, and then discusses the underlying mechanisms.

Some highly vaccinated countries, such as Israel, the U.K., and the U.S., started to ease the restrictions associated with coronavirus diseases (COVID-19), such as the mandatory mask rule and social distancing. However, the two recent variants of COVID-19, i.e., Delta and Omicron, appear to be breaking through the protective vaccines provided at a higher rate than previous strains in 2021. According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with a fully vaccinated rate of 62.9% in the nation, community transmission remains high throughout the United States. This trend is driven by the Omicron variant, which now accounts for approximately 98% of cases in the United States. The uneven distribution of vaccination worldwide is also taking its toll on some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. The debate continues on the importance and effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, mask mandates, public information provision, and contact tracing, to curb the spread of new virus strains. Among alternative NPIs, people want to know which approach is more effective in containing pandemics, such as COVID-19 and its variants, but less costly to the economy and society.====This paper provides a novel analysis of the pandemic containment policy by comparing the effectiveness and costs of alternative NPIs, including public information provision, contact tracing and social distancing. We hand-collected the official documents from both the provincial and city-level governments in China. We performed a textual analysis to measure the daily stringency of NPIs at the city level, which provides more information on the NPIs than other measures in the literature, such as the first date when a certain policy was introduced (====). Our measure extends the similar stringency measures of government response reported by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), where OxCGRT only measures NPIs at the country level.==== Moreover, we use a border discontinuous difference-in-difference (DID) method, with exogenous variations in the stringency of NPIs to identify the causal effect of NPIs on COVID-19 spread. We also estimate the cost of these NPIs to the economy and human capital in cities with harsher NPIs.====Our paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on the public policy implemented to manage the global COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate the detrimental effects on the economy and society (====; ====; ====; ====). First, we find that, on average, NPIs significantly reduce the COVID-19 spread in China by 10.8% after 21?days of enforcement. Among the three NPIs, contact tracing is more effective than public information provision and social distancing for COVID-19 containment. Most of the literature focuses on the effect of social distancing, as measured by GPS-based human mobility, on the spread of COVID-19 (====; ====; ====). Our study provides new insights to formulate effective public health policy designed to combat the current and future global pandemics. In particular, we extend the studies by ==== and ==== by causally quantifying the importance of contact tracing and public information provision on COVID-19 containment.====Second, we explore how government officials might impact the implementation of NPIs. ====), which helps mayors with political connections execute their local NPIs more rigidly and effectively.

A sharp reduction in the economy, an approximately 5.16% decrease in the economic growth rate, was observed in both the treatment and control groups during the first quarter of 2020. The loss of human capital associated with children due to school closure is significant. The primary schools of the adjacent treatment group were closed 4.58?days more than those in the control group. The net present value of loss in life cycle earnings is 2153 ==== per child due to more prolonged school closure, even after online learning is considered. This cost estimate is comparable to the 850 ==== loss per child who loses three days of schooling due to a flu-like illness in the study by ====.==== Our results provide empirical evidence that pandemic containment measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have a costly long-term effect on human capital, which policy-makers should consider carefully.====), DID estimation (====; ====), and the event-study method (====) reported in the literature. Before the central government announced the Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, the local governments employed different NPIs based on their local knowledge of the virus. The date of NPIs enforcement and the cities in which individuals reside jointly determine the intensity of their exposure to the NPIs. Inspired by ====, the treatment cities are selected where the residual of the regression of NPIs intensity on the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 23 is positive. We adopt the boundary discontinuous DID approach, i.e., restrict both types of cities that share the exact boundaries (====; ====), to ensure the parallel trends between the treatment and control cities.

Numerous empirical studies confirm the positive role of human capital accumulation in macro- and micro-production efficiency improvements (====; ====; ====; ====). Human capital accrues mainly from formal and informal education (====). The former comprises various forms of academic education, whereas the latter includes on-the-job training provided by various social organizations or firms. Formal education builds the foundation of human capital in society, while on-the-job training plays a key role in increasing human capital by predominantly engendering specialized knowledge and skills. Numerous studies confirm that on-the-job training is important for firms to accumulate high-quality human capital, and plays a significant role in upgrading employees' skills and promoting the level of innovation in firms (====; ====; ====). In some developing countries, socialized training is even more effective than formal education in driving firm performance (====). However, unlike formal education, on-the-job training has increasingly become the focus of policies on implementing reasonable external incentives because it involves a trade-off for firms between training costs and benefits (====). For example, some studies find that employees' acceptance of wage deductions is an important precondition for firms to provide on-the-job training. Alternatively, firms will only provide on-the-job training if the productivity increase after training meets certain criteria (====; ====). The existence of certain cost-shifting channels may be critical for firms to provide on-the-job training.====), tax credits can reduce firms' tax expenditures in proportion to their training expenses, and are also an effective training cost transfer mechanism (====Based on a quasi-natural experiment in China, this study examines the impact of tax incentives on firms' provision of on-the-job training in a plausible framework. The development of on-the-job education in firms has long been at the forefront of the Chinese government's development of the vocational education system, and has been supported by several policies, including tax credits. As early as in 1981, the Chinese government explicitly proposed to solve the problem of insufficient funding for employee education in firms in a document about strengthening employee education and proposed, for the first time, that employee education expenses of firms be deducted before income tax at a rate of 1.5% of total wages.====Based on data from Chinese listed firms from 2015 to 2020, this study investigates the effects of an increase in the proportion of tax ==== (hereinafter, IPTC policy) on firms to provide on-the-job training. The study uses DID analysis to find that the IPTC policy significantly enhances the likelihood of firms in the treatment group to increase on-the-job-training expenses compared with firms in the control group. The finding remains valid after several robustness tests, and the analysis of the heterogeneous effects shows that compared with state-owned and large-scale firms, privately owned and small-scale firms are more susceptible to this policy's impacts. Finally, we test whether the IPTC policy improves employees' production capacity by promoting the accumulation of human capital; we find that the IPTC policy improves firm performance and innovation.====Our study makes several contributions. First, it enriches the discussion on assessing the effectiveness of on-the-job training intervention policies. Some studies evaluate the effects of financial subsidies based on practices in developed countries (====; ====; ====). In contrast, there is a lack of assessment of the effectiveness of tax incentives. Relevant studies also lack a reliable causal identification framework. This study examines the impact of tax incentives on firms' provision of on-the-job training based on micro-data in a more credible framework, providing valid evidence for understanding tax incentives' implementation in developing countries. Second, this study echoes the research on firms' strategic behaviors under tax avoidance motives (====).

We use data from a unique survey of 7202 junior high school students and their parents from Shaanxi province to explore whether the school shutdown enlarged the educational gap between students with different parental socioeconomic statuses (SES) during the pandemic. We find that students with more highly educated parents experienced an increase in relative test rankings after the shutdown period. A 1-year increase in parents' education led to a relative 0.18-percentile increase in students' rankings of total test scores. We also identify the mechanisms behind the enlarged gap by means of heterogeneity analyses. We show that parents' education mainly affected children's academic performance through parents' engagement in their children's homeschooling, mitigating the negative impacts of Internet addiction on students, and serving as substitutes for teachers who were unable to teach well online.","Beginning in early 2020, COVID-19 brought the world into a public health crisis. Schools across the globe were forced to shut down, and classrooms were shifted to online delivery during the lockdown period. The unanticipated school closure may have enlarged the gap in academic achievement by disproportionately affecting disadvantaged children (====; ====). For example, online education required access to the Internet and related facilities, which not all families could afford. Likewise, the school shutdown shifted the burden of supervision from teachers to parents, whose ability to support their children's learning was and remains related to their socioeconomic status (SES).====In this study, we combine administrative data on a sample of 7202 Grade 7 students' test scores before and after the school shutdown with online survey data on students' family backgrounds collected from Shaanxi Province in China to investigate how the COVID-19 school shutdown may have enlarged educational ====. Specifically, we estimate the changes in relative test rankings before and after the school shutdown by students' family socioeconomic status. We measure family socioeconomic status by parents' educational attainment. Then, we use a two-way fixed effects model to estimate the differentiated effects of school shutdown on the changes in students' relative academic rankings by parental years of schooling, taking advantage of the fact that parents' educational attainment is predetermined and not affected by children's current academic performance.====We find that after the 8-week school shutdown period, parental socioeconomic status was an important factor in enlarging students' educational gap. In the empirical design, we use school-level students' percentile rankings of test scores to measure their relative performance because the absolute test scores were not entirely comparable across schools. Then, we compare the changes in students' percentile rankings of test scores before and after the COVID-19 period by parental years of schooling and find the following results. First, students with more highly educated parents experienced an increase in relative test rankings after the shutdown period. In terms of magnitude, a 1-year increase in parents' education led to a relative 0.18-percentile increase in rankings of total scores (equivalently, 0.33 points in total raw scores). In other words, the predicted gap between students with parents who graduated from college and those with parents who only graduated from primary school increased by nearly 2 percentiles in total rankings (equivalently, 3 points in total raw scores) after the school shutdown. Second, paternal education rather than maternal education played a key role during the school shutdown, which complements ====¡¯s findings that more fathers participated in childcare activities during the homeschooling period than before. Third, the effects were driven mostly by the changes in math and English scores, while the gap in Chinese scores was insignificantly enlarged. This result is intuitive since math and English subjects require additional analytical skills and expertise compared with the Chinese subject, making parents' education crucial in determining how effectively parents can assist their children during the homeschooling period. Finally, boys were more sensitive to their parents' socioeconomic status than girls, and disadvantaged boys from less educated families are more likely to be disproportionately affected, which in turn enlarges the gender gap in academic performance following the school shutdown.====Our empirical design assumes that the gap between students with better family backgrounds (higher parents' education) and those with worse family backgrounds would stay unchanged in the absence of the school shutdown. We cannot directly test this assumption using our current sample because our sample students were still in primary school before the academic year affected by the pandemic, and thus, test score data are not available. As an alternative strategy, we use the student-level data from China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) from 2013 to 2015, which contains information on test scores and family background for Chinese junior high school students, to conduct a placebo test. We utilize a sample of students from CEPS who are also junior high school, Grade 7 students. Then, we track the changes in relative test rankings across two periods of similar length to the main analysis, before the COVID-19 school shutdown. We use the same model specification and estimate the changes in the gap by parents' education. The results suggest no significant change in the gap in test rankings by parents' education before the COVID-19 school shutdown.====Next, we utilize the rich information on the characteristics of students, parents, and teachers to explore the mechanisms through which parental socioeconomic status affected students' relative academic performance. First, we find that both parents' education and income could help students improve percentile rankings during the homeschooling period, but these improvements resulted as a function of different mechanisms. Parents' education affected students' performance independently from parents' income when parents could directly accompany or supervise students during the school shutdown period. On the other hand, the significance of parents' income arose only if parents were absent from students' homeschooling. Second, we find that parents' education affected students' performance through mitigating the negative influences of Internet overuse or addiction. The parents' education effect was more significant among students who were relatively more addicted to the Internet. Third, parents served as potential substitutes for teachers when teachers were less professional and less able to teach online courses well. We find that the parents' education effect was statistically and economically significant only if the corresponding teachers' education levels or intrinsic abilities were lower than the median level in our sample.====Our study contributes to the literature on the impact of the COVID-19 school shutdown on education, especially educational inequality (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).==== From the theoretical perspective, ==== and ==== argue that school closures can influence the function of the great equalizer from multiple perspectives because online education is not a perfect substitute. From the empirical perspective, several studies have to date documented the enlargement of educational inequality after the school showdown. ==== find that learning time is reduced more for low-achieving students than high-achieving students. ====, ==== and ==== find that parents' (or mothers') education level increases the educational gap during the pandemic. ==== finds evidence of a greater level of gender inequality attributed to the school shutdown. Our study contributes to previous literature by clarifying the mechanisms through which parental characteristics increase the educational gap, taking advantage of the rich information we acquire from student-level surveys. We show that parents' education mainly affects children's academic performance through parents' engagement in their children's homeschooling, mitigating the negative impacts of Internet addiction on students and serving as substitutes for teachers when teachers are less professional and relatively ineffective in the delivery of online schooling. Specifically, to our best knowledge, we are the first study to provide empirical evidence suggesting that parents partially substitute for teachers in providing educational inputs during the homeschooling period, which echoes the theoretical hypothesis proposed by ====. In addition, we also provide evidence from a developing country, where more disadvantaged children may be negatively affected by the school shutdown, to complement previous studies mainly conducted in developed countries.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Compared with existing studies, we focus on the short-run intergenerational impacts of parental socioeconomic status in the course of a public health crisis. We find that parents' education not only increases intergenerational mobility in the long run but also enhances students' ability to resist short-run shocks.====Meanwhile, this article contributes to the assessment of the performance of K-12 students receiving online courses by different family socioeconomic status. In previous literature, researchers mainly adopted the randomized control trial method to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of online teaching courses (====; ====; ====; ====) and suggested that online courses are a complement to traditional classes, but not a perfect substitute.

Digital finance is financial institutions use new-generation information technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and mobile internet to mine and analyze borrowers' massive digital footprints which allow the lenders to grasp more information that could be used to conduct credit assessments on their potential borrowers, making unsecured pure credit loans and effective control on credit risk possible (====; ====; ====). Digital finance therefore provides a new channel allowing the lenders to better understand their potential borrowers, which greatly reduces the information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Thus, digital finance, in theory, would improve the availability of credit for MSEs and help them get out from financing difficulties.====The main contributions of this paper lie in the following aspects. First, our paper enriches the research on how the financial development affects the real economy. Existing studies have investigated the impact of digital finance on a variety of economic activities, including sales volume and product diversity (====), corporate innovation (====), MSEs' export (====) and household entrepreneurship. In this paper, we examine the relationship between digital finance and MSEs' investment decisions. We find that digital finance significantly increases both MSEs' probability of applying for new investment projects and the number of projects applied, suggesting its positive role in the development of MSEs. Specifically, our baseline model shows that MSEs that use digital finance are 7.5% more likely to apply for new investment projects than those who do not. The average number of new investment projects applied by MSEs that use digital finance is also 37.8% higher. Our paper thus also supplements the literature on factors influencing enterprises' investment decisions by examining the effect of digital finance.====Second, this paper carefully discusses the mechanism through which digital finance works on MSEs' investment behavior. Given that the lack of information between borrowers and lenders is an important source of MSEs' financing difficulty and that the nature of digital finance is about information, in theory, digital finance has the potential to reduce financial constraints. However, to our best knowledge, such a role of digital finance on alleviating financial constraints has rarely been empirically tested in existing studies. Our findings suggest that digital finance significantly promotes MSEs' investment by reducing their financial constraints. Our result thus also provides empirical evidence for digital finance being able to be utilized as an effective solution to MSEs' financial constraint problem.====The mechanism that the role of digital finance on alleviating financial constraints is through reducing information asymmetry between the lender and the borrower is further investigated in this paper. To illustrate the information asymmetry mechanism, we determine two variables to proxy for how well the lenders and the borrowers know about each other. They are, respectively, whether or not an enterprise utilizes agency bookkeeping (i.e., outsourcing financial work to professional third-party ==== providers) to reflect how well the lender knows about the borrower; and whether or not the business owner pays attention to financial information to reflect how well the borrower knows about the lender. Results show that digital finance has a more prominent effect on investment activities for enterprises who do not utilize agency bookkeeping and those who do not pay attention to financial information, suggesting that digital finance is a beneficial supplement to the shortage of information between the lender and the borrower, which ultimately helps alleviate the financing constraints of MSEs.====It is also worth pointing out that our results suggest that digital finance could help reduce the information asymmetry resulting from both the lender's inaccessibility to demanders' information as well as the borrower's inaccessibility to suppliers' information, that is, digital finance has the potential to reduce the two-way information asymmetry between the borrowers and the lenders. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to examine the mechanism of digital finance effect from the perspective of information asymmetry.====In the end, the majority of existing studies on the impact of digital finance on enterprise behavior as well as the underlying mechanisms are focused on listed companies (====; ====), quite few examine its effect for micro and small enterprises. Thus, whether or not the findings on the digital finance effect for large and median enterprises could be applied to micro and small enterprises is still unclear. In this paper, we focus on the manufacturing enterprises by utilizing CMES data to examine the impact of digital finance on micro and small enterprises. Our findings therefore are beneficial supplements to the literature on digital finance.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

The empirical findings indicate that a one percentage point decrease in export tax rebate rates increases the total factor productivity (TFP) of a firm by about 0.1 percentage points. We explore the possible mechanisms that explain this nexus and attribute it to the allocation effect of export tax rebate policy; that is, export tax rebates prevent low-productivity firms from exiting the market and further reallocate resources and economic activities to them. In addition, a decrease in rebate rates significantly encourages the TFP growth of surviving firms and leads to an increase in aggregate TFP. Specifically, throughout 2000¨C07, the declining rebate rates accounted for 5.23% of the rise in the aggregate TFP, and the between-firm effect was 3.85%, which is much larger than the within effect.","Many studies in the available literature have concluded that economic policies or institutions may misguide the allocation of resources across firms, having subsequent substantial effects on economic outcomes, such as total factor productivity (TFP) (====; ====). For example, ==== state that distortions of investment specific to firms resultant from economic policies or other institutional characteristics lead to a large dispersion in capital productivity and a significant reduction in the aggregate TFP.====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), but little attention has been given to the productivity reaction of firms to dynamic changes in export tax rebates.====Export tax rebates can drive the productivity of firms in two conflicting directions. On the one hand, export tax rebates might positively affect productivity. Even with the same export volume, an increase in the rebate rate means additional revenue. Firms can spend this to enhance their technological capability and upgrade equipment to increase productivity. On the other hand, export tax rebates could negatively affect productivity. For example, an external policy may distort the allocation of resources and economic activities among firms (====; ====), thus inhibiting their productivity growth.====Which effect is dominant has significant implications on ====. If the latter dominates, the benefits of export tax rebates on export growth may come at the cost of productivity loss. As a result, the design of export tax rebates should target specific industries or firms. However, if the former dominates, export tax rebates should further encourage firms to export.====There has also been enough productivity dispersion across Chinese manufacturing firms and significant productivity changes over time in recent decades to warrant a study on China (====). In addition, many studies have found that Chinese exporters are not the most productive ones, and this phenomenon is known as the ¡°productivity paradox¡± (====; ====), which contradicts the notion that exporters are exceptional performers in trade literature. This paradox is often attributed to the impact of processing trade exporters,==== while some frequently used trade policies may also bring about this paradox, such as export tax rebate policy. Therefore, China is ideal for studying the effects of export tax rebates on firm productivity.====A major empirical challenge of this study is that firms' productivity could be endogenously dependent on export tax rebates. For example, some unobserved factors could affect export tax rebates and firms' productivity, which are omitted in the empirical estimations. Referring to ====, we mainly use the difference-in-difference (DID) strategy to tackle the potential endogenous problems. There are mainly three modes of trade in China: ordinary trade, processing trade with imported material, and processing trade with supplied inputs. The typical export tax rebate policy for ordinary trade and processing trade with imported material is ¡°exempt, credit, and refund,¡± while that for processing trade with supplied inputs is ¡°no collection and no refund¡± (====). Therefore, only the exports of ordinary trade and processing trade with imported material are eligible for the export tax rebates. Based on this argument, firms only conducting the ordinary trade and/or processing trade with imported materials are regarded as the treatment group, while firms conducting processing trade with supplied materials are regarded as the control group. By comparing the different responses of firms in these two groups to the change in rebate rates, we can identify the causal effect of export tax rebates on firm productivity.====The benchmark result shows that a one percentage point decrease in the export tax rebate rate increases the TFP of a firm by about 0.1 percentage points. This effect is both statistically significant and economically important. During the sample period, about 20% of industries experience a decrease in rebate rates of more than ten percentage points, indicating that the TFP of eligible firms in these industries will increase by about one percentage point, which accounts for >12% of the average firm productivity in the same period. The main result of our study is also robust to a series of checks.====We further explore the possible mechanism that explains why export tax rebates reduce firm productivity instead of raising the productivity with higher export revenue. An important reason is the misallocation of resources, which is particularly relevant to low-productivity firms. We analyze the allocation effect of export tax rebate policy from several perspectives.====First, export tax rebate policy might distort the market exit mechanism.==== The theoretical model in ====; ====; ====). Therefore, if there are no policy interventions, exposure to trade will also force some less productive firms to simultaneously exit the markets in developing countries. However, export tax rebates can bring additional liquidity or cash flow for firms, thus allowing some of the low-productivity firms to enter and stay in the foreign markets,==== and to some extent, could also entice them to do business in the domestic market because of the gains in the foreign markets. Hence, the low-productivity firms remain in the market longer, resulting in lower average productivity.====Moreover, export tax rebates may reallocate resources and economic activities to low-productivity firms. High-productivity firms can rely on technology and the quality of goods to compete in the foreign markets, but low-productivity firms only have the price advantage primarily derived from rebates. Thus, the latter can rapidly expand production size and foreign market share with increased rebate rates. This allocation effect causes the additional overall reduction of firm productivity. The empirical results of our study support these arguments. Specifically, we find that the allocation effect of export tax rebate policy can explain the negative relationship between export tax rebates and firm productivity.====Our study also confirms that export tax rebates negatively affect aggregate TFP because of the reduced TFP growth of the surviving firms. Furthermore, over 2000¨C07, the reduction in rebate rates accounted for 5.23% of the increase in aggregate TFP. By decomposition, we find that the between-firm effect is 3.85%, while the within-firm effect is only 0.36%.====This paper helps to understand the nexus between export tax rebate policy and firms' performance better. Most existing studies focus on the effect of export tax rebates on firms' exporting behavior (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Few directly examine firms' productivity change as the export tax rebates adjust. The recent works of ==== and ==== discuss the relationship between export tax rebates and firm productivity. We differ from ==== and ==== in the following ways. First, we manage the potential endogeneity of export tax rebates by adopting the DID strategy, which helps identify the causal impact of export tax rebates on firm productivity. Second, the allocation effects of the export tax rebate policy are discussed, where they are regarded as a reason for the change in firms' productivity. Third, we analyze how export tax rebates influence aggregate productivity and demonstrate the role of different types of firms in aggregate productivity changes.====Our study also complements current literature on policy distortion and productivity. Policy distortion is one of the leading candidates for generating resource misallocation and furthering productivity loss (====; ====). However, limited attention is given to the non-marketed distortions induced by the export tax rebate policy. ==== note that the disparity of export tax rebates within an industry may aggravate the resource misallocation of that industry. ==== and ==== also argue that the export tax rebates affect firms' production decisions and influence resource allocation between exporters and non-exporters. We add to this research by providing firm-level evidence on the allocation effect of the export tax rebate policy among exporters in China. In addition, this paper quantitatively estimates the aggregate productivity gain from reducing the distortion of the export tax rebate policy.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to study how the strategic investment of renewable energy companies is affected by ====. This paper first robustly explores the non-linear relationship between strategic investment and economic policy uncertainty of Chinese renewable energy enterprises. Then from the three perspectives of the relationship between the government and renewable energy enterprises, the characteristics of renewable energy enterprises, the response of the product market and financial market to renewable energy, this paper innovatively explores how different dimensions will adjust the non-linear relationship between strategic investment of renewable energy enterprises and economic policy uncertainty. The analysis in this paper closely relies on the characteristics of the renewable energy industry at this stage, so our conclusion can provide a reference for the government to formulate the development plan of renewable energy enterprises scientifically and prudently.","With the growth of energy demand and the increasing challenges of climate change, countries around the world are making great strides to promote the development of their domestic renewable energy industries (====). Over the past fifteen years, global investment in renewable energy has grown from $44.8 billion in 2004 to $301.7 billion in 2019,==== Although China's renewable energy industry has achieved sufficient achievements (====; ====; ====).====; ====. Second, the background of this study is not only that China's renewable energy development is relatively mature and large (meaning representative), but also that China has explored various forms of industrial policies during the development of the renewable energy industry (====). This makes the research sample fully reflect the different performances under different compound policies==== (====). Therefore, research on China's listed renewable energy companies can combine industry characteristics and China's industrial policies to put forward targeted policy recommendations, which will not only contribute to China's ¡°dual carbon goals¡±, but also help the world to learn from experience to achieve the ¡°1.5¡ãC temperature control target¡±.====Based on the current stage of China's renewable energy industry, this paper takes China's economic policy uncertainty as the core explanatory variable to study its impact on China's renewable energy enterprise investment. Based on the characteristics of China's renewable energy industry, this paper further explores what factors will influence and how to influence the relationship between them. The research conducted in this article differs from previous literature in the following aspects: Previous literature used industry-wide samples to study the relationship between strategic investment and economic policy uncertainty (====; ====), making it difficult to analyze further how factors under industry characteristics would change the relationship. Therefore, this paper adopts quarterly data of Chinese renewable energy enterprises and uses various methods such as robust fixed effect regression and point estimation to explore the non-linear relationship between strategic investment and economic policy uncertainty of Chinese renewable energy enterprises and the degree of the risk appetite of Chinese renewable energy enterprises. The results show that the non-linear relationship is ¡°inverted U-shaped¡± and the strategic investment of Chinese renewable energy enterprises is risk- preference, which fills the gap in the relevant literature. In further analysis, this paper selects six variables from three perspectives - the relationship between the government and renewable energy companies, the characteristics of renewable energy companies, and the financial market's response to renewable energy companies, using moderating effects and point estimates to test how they will change this non-linear relationship robustly. This empirical analysis has great reference significance for understanding Chinese renewable energy companies. Finally, based on the empirical results, this paper further clarifies the development stage of China's renewable energy industry and provides specific policy recommendations for the current needs, which offers urgent and prominent guidance for policymakers in the transformation of the renewable energy industry.====The above is the first part of this article. The second part firstly introduces the relevant theoretical basis, and then puts forward the specific research hypothesis based on the characteristics of the renewable energy industry.

Therefore, it is essential to study whether central bank communication can effectively guide expectations via various communication methods. We study central bank communication in China using the events collected from its official websites and social media, and we divide them into formal and informal communications. We use the high-frequency quotation data of treasury bonds to identify monetary policy surprise caused by communication, which is measured by the target and path surprise. Then, we evaluate the forward-looking and backward-looking effectiveness of central bank communications. We show that central bank communications can help guide public expectations, but different topics and different forms of communication have heterogeneous effects. Forward guidance carries both potential benefits and drawbacks. It is worth noting that China's current central bank communications may have certain potential to be improved."," tool. Therefore, it is essential to study whether central bank communication is effective.====The basic question is what effective expectation management is, or specifically, what effective communication is. From a broadly accepted perspective, it means that the central bank's current communication has successfully influenced the public's future expectations, which can be understood as forward-effective. All of the existing literature on measuring the effectiveness of monetary policy expectations management applied this angle. However, we propose backward perspective for the first time, which means that implemented policies cause little surprise if previous corresponding communication is effective. And we discover a specific form of formal communication¡ªOMO announcements¡ªto test the effectiveness of expectation guidance from the backward-looking perspective since the PBC rarely changes its expectation management target for ====. If the central bank sufficiently communicated with the private sector, ideally, market participants would no longer have a greater reaction on the actual operation day because the announcement and operation are routine, and all information about the implementation would have been fully expected, except a few unexpected operations, such as changing the operating interest rate or providing particularly excess liquidity.====On the theoretical side, central bank communication is abstracted by forward guidance, which is one of the most important methods of expectation management. Many papers focus on the effect of forward guidance under the zero lower bond(====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, structure models heavily rely on the basic assumption of model stability and the calibration of parameters, and they only answer the question from the forward perspective. Therefore, we decide to test the effectiveness this question from the empirical side.====First, as for the measurement of the communication effect, there are two common ways. The one is measuring the communication content by coding and scoring (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Most literature in China uses this method to study the effect of central bank communication(====; ====). However, this kind of measurement may be inevitably disturbed by the authors' own views and induce look ahead bias since they have observed the final results when they do the research. The other is directly measure the expectation changes by using public surveys or expert questionnaires (====), media forecasts (====; ====) and market-based methods (====; ====; ====). In fact, according to ====. In this paper, we collect various kinds of communication events from the PBC official website and other social media to construct a central bank communication database during the period from October 2014 to February 2021. After identifying the communication events, we use the quotation of the most active short-term treasury bonds and set a longer window length to avoid illiquidity and trading delay problems in over-the-counter market and measure monetary policy surprise caused by communication as target and path surprises according to ====.====; ====; ====In addition, there is some literature discussing whether the central bank should give too much information to the public since too much information may have some drawbacks (====; ====; ====; ====), while inaccurate information may also mislead the public (====; ====). Therefore, we also test whether PBC's information is accurate enough for the market participants.====We reach the broad conclusion that current communications by the PBC can effectively affect public expectations. Through further analysis of the heterogeneity of communication, we find different effects when the central bank communicates in different forms or about different content. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that China's current central bank communications may have some limits and certain potential risks.====Our work contributes to the relevant literature in the following aspects. First, we use market-based monetary policy surprise measurements to test the communication which differs from most of the papers studying central bank communication in China. Previous literature related to central bank expectation guidance does not reach a consensus on the effectiveness, and many heterogeneous conclusions, such as the impact on financial markets(====; ====; ====; ====),the impact on inflation(====; ====), even contradict each other. Meanwhile, it's also impractical to directly compare the results of measuring communication and judge which conclusions are more credible since the process of index construction is subjective, and research methods vary. Therefore, we adopt an objective market-based method to quantify communication as continuous variables, which contains more information naturally and is beneficial for quantitative studies of heterogeneity to be done.====The second contribution is we differentiate and test the two perspectives of PBC's communication effectiveness. We not only conduct effectiveness test from forward perspective as previous literature do, but also add the backward effectiveness perspective for the first time and conduct the corresponding empirical test by studying open market operation announcements, based on the first contribution of our paper that market-based measure can help us evaluate the surprise on the policy implementation day.====The third contribution is we provide a comprehensive analysis of the central bank communication in China and try to compare these events from the forms and contents. We also pay attention to the possible negative effects of central bank communication, and our results provide implications that, in practice, the central bank has some limits when communicating.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes our data and methodology and introduces central bank communications in China. ==== presents our results and analysis on the central bank communication effectiveness test. ==== concludes.====The previous analysis shows that, in general, the unexpected component of the central bank's communications will have a significant impact on bond prices, that is, the term structure of interest rates. Compared with the stock market, when interest rates are expected to change, asset prices in the bond market react more sharply and universally. Based on this, the following further analysis of the heterogeneity in forms of formal communication will only select the bond market as the target market for the communication effectiveness test. Not choosing to conduct heterogeneity on informal communications is that there is only one form by the central bank governor: speech. However, there are many types of formal communications on the official website, such as press conferences, symposiums, and monetary policy reports. Therefore, different forms provide the possibility for the study of heterogeneity in types of communication. Next, we will focus on the impact of official website communications on the bond market and study the heterogeneity of different communication forms in terms of expectation management effectiveness.",Can central bank communication effectively guide the monetary policy expectation of the public?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000918,16-Jul-22,2022,Research Article,122

The essence of common prosperity is to enable people to benefit from the economic growth more equally (====). As is well-known, China has experienced rapid economic growth in the past several decades with market-oriented reforms. We want to know who benefit from economic growth in China and who lose.====; ====; ====). And second, income inequality in China has risen sharply (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). A newer approach in the development literature is to analyze the distributional consequences of economic growth by using panel data (that is, following the same households or individuals over time) to analyze changes in total income (¡°income mobility¡±) or in labor earnings from the labor market (¡°earnings mobility¡±) (====; ====). In this case, if the income or earnings mobility exhibits the pattern of convergence, meaning that those who gained the most in earnings over time have generally been those who had the lowest earnings to begin with, we tend to conclude that people benefit from economic growth more equally, which is consistent with the idea of common prosperity and thus a desirable case from welfare point of view.====; ====). Most people worked in the state sector and enjoyed lifetime employment (====; ====). From the mid-1990s, the labor market in economics sense started to burgeon and the private sector hired more workers (====). Accordingly, the question about how the pattern of earnings mobility changed during these market-oriented reforms is worthy of investigation.====A major contribution of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and careful analysis of the changes in earnings mobility pattern in China during a reform period using the most reliable data available to us from China's Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey (UHIES). Our sample includes nine two-year panels from 1992 to 1993 to 2005¨C2006 as well as several three-year panels (1994¨C1996, 1997¨C1999, and 2002¨C2004). The results of this paper can also shed light on the current policy dialogue in China regarding how to generate convergent earnings mobility and to achieve the goal of common prosperity. The methodology of this paper and the policy insights may also be generalized to other economies experiencing similar market-oriented reforms.====We find that without controlling for other covariates, those who gained the largest earnings growth over time after 2000 have generally been those who had the highest earnings to begin with. This result is sometimes termed ¡°unconditional divergence¡± (====). However, we find the opposite pattern in the 1990s when the convergent earnings mobility was found. The finding of unconditionally divergent mobility in the 2000s is important for policy concerns. The theory of cumulative advantage may explain this pattern meaning that those who have the most to begin with are the ones likely to continue to gain advantage. Policies would be desirable such as compensating low-skill workers by establishing government-initiated training programs. More generally, welfare policies are necessary to help disadvantaged workers avoid from low-income or poverty traps who suffer from negative shocks in market-oriented reforms.====Matching Rule for Households from 2002 to 2006====Since 2002, there is a new survey rule: once an old household is rotated out and a new household is rotated in, a new household id should be given to the new household and it should be different from the id of the old household. The rotating rule, however, varied across provinces. Particularly in small cities, it is not strictly followed.====Therefore, we have to first match household by household id and have a Sample 1. Unmatched households are due to attrition from the rotating rules. Second, we match households of Sample 1 by their housing characteristics and the husband/wife characteristics, and get a Sample 2. There are two reasons why some households are matched by household id but not by household characteristics: 1) the survey rule that ¡°a new household which replaces the old household should be assigned a new id¡± is not strictly followed. There are substantial regional variations on how strictly the local survey team followed the survey rule. Therefore, two households, a rotated out one and a rotated in one, could share the same household id but have different household characteristics; 2) some households moved out of the residence in the sample. The survey did not track households which moved away. The household moved into the same residence was assigned the same household id as the former household living in the same place. In this case, these two households also have the same household id but different household characteristics. We use the following household characteristics to match households: house type, house area, which year the house was built, household head and spouse's gender, age and education.",Earnings mobility during labor market reforms in urban China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22001018,13-Jul-22,2022,Research Article,123

Studies indicate that the increase in infections led to drops in employment and income (====; ====China was no exception to these conditions. Its labor market was severely disrupted, although, in the case of China, the government is known for its rapid response and the implementation of strict measures across the nation after the outbreak. The measures, including strict quarantining, social distancing, and community containment, effectively contained the spread of the pandemic¡ªalbeit, during the initial months of the lockdown, economic activity in many sectors was severely affected. For example, 80% of small- and medium-sized enterprises were temporarily closed; such firms are known to generate 80% of employment in China (====). Due to this and other actions, China reported a decrease of 6.8% in GDP in the first quarter of 2020 (====) as well as serious repercussions in employment (====; ====; ====; ====).====Of all groups who suffered from the pandemic, unemployment among younger workers has been one of the most severe. Before COVID-19, unemployment was higher among the youth compared to other age groups. According to International Labour Organization, the unemployment rate of workers aged 15 to 24?years fluctuated between 16% and 20% during 2010¨C2019, about three times that of workers aged over 25?years (====). COVID-19 has increased the age gap in unemployment. ==== found that the young workers in Germany were more likely to lose their job during the pandemic. ====). Specifically, the unemployment rate among the youth aged 16 to 24?years increased from 12% in 2019 (right before the pandemic) to 14% in 2020 (right after the break of the pandemic) while unemployment among the population aged 24 to 59?years increased from 4.6% to 5.1% in the same period.====Despite the fact that vocational graduates are the major source of young workers, the effects of the pandemic on vocational school graduates received little attention. Such an omission is notable, given that vocational education has been taken as one major measure to deal with youth unemployment by many governments (====) and is also an essential track in the education system in many countries. In the case of upper secondary vocational school (hereafter, vocational high school), 35% of global high school students in 2017 attended vocational high schools (====). In China, vocational high school students number >16 million and accounted for 40% of upper secondary high school students in 2020 (====). Between January 2020 and October 2021, at least five studies have examined the effect of COVID-19 on different education groups, according to a search of the Web of Science. Of these important studies, none separates the impact of the pandemic on labor markets by educational tracks (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Besides, a focus on the impact of COVID-19 on vocational high school students is important for three reasons. First, vocational education develops mainly specific job-related skills of students, which means that, in a world of rapid technological and structural change, there is potentially high unemployment and income risks (====). Hence, when the pandemic quickly transformed the ways that people were working (e.g., switching to remote work), vocational students could be more vulnerable to this shock than are graduates of academic high schools due to the lack of required general knowledge. Second, vocational high school students are more likely to come from disadvantaged families that generally have lower levels of income and social capital, which have been shown to help families to deal with the shocks in cases of pandemic responses and other crises (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====The overall goal of this study is to explore the effects of COVID-19 on vocational high school graduates in China. To meet this goal, we have four specific objectives. First, we describe the labor market outcomes and work attributes of graduates before and after COVID-19, including (a) the extent of their participation in the labor market as full-time workers; (b) their changes in income; (c) the change in time that the workers spent on work; and (d) work attributes, including contract types, management positions, and industries. Second, we use a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to identify the causal effects of COVID-19 on vocational high school graduates and illustrate the robustness of these estimates using alternative approaches (propensity score matching combined with DID [PSM-DID], subsample analysis, and use of propensity weights). Third, we describe the measures that vocational graduates took to cope with the effects of COVID-19 on their jobs and income. Finally, we explore the heterogeneous effects among different subgroups within the sample.====The results indicate that being in a county with an above-average number of COVID-19 infections significantly reduces the participation rate in full-time jobs of vocational high school graduates and leads to a fall in the levels of their monthly earnings (in the case of those who did not lose their jobs). According to our findings, the contraction of labor demand in the county is the main source of the effects of COVID-19. In addition, there were disparities in the nature of the effects in terms of several different dimensions. For example, being in a high-intensity county had a relatively higher negative effect on the monthly income of male graduates (relative to female graduates). Graduates from families with higher social capital experienced much lower, often negligible, effects on their income from the pandemic as compared to those from families with lower social capital, who experienced considerable effects. Although graduates who worked in the service industry were more likely to lose their full-time jobs due to the pandemic, for those who did not lose their jobs, their incomes did not experience as great a shock as did those of whom had jobs in the non-service sectors. The fall in income was also considerably less for graduates who worked in management positions.====Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, this study uses a causal inference approach to identify the pandemic's effects, exploiting variations in time and across space. With such causal inferences, this study adds to the emerging literature on the effects of COVID-19 on labor markets, in general, and China's labor market, in particular. Second, this study contributes to the findings of studies of the heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 by identifying the variation in subgroups that were affected by the shocks. Third, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a survey of vocational high school graduates and evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on their employment, income, and other outcomes. We hope that our study will help to stimulate further discussion and research on vocational students, including how they cope with economic crises, such as those that occurred due to the pandemic.====This study also has one major limitation. We identified the effects of COVID-19 on vocational high school graduates by comparing the effects on graduates who were located in areas with a high pandemic intensity versus those who were in low-intensity areas. Due to data constraints, we could not compare the relative effects of COVID-19 on vocational high school graduates with those on academic high school graduates. That is, we cannot provide a direct conclusion about whether vocational high school graduates are more or less vulnerable than are others in the labor market (e.g., academic high school graduates, workers who never went to high school). We thus hope that more research on this topic will be conducted in the future.",The impact of COVID-19 on employment and income of vocational graduates in China: Evidence from surveys in January and July 2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000906,12-Jul-22,2022,Research Article,124

Our findings are three-fold. First, relief policies in the form of payment deferrals and exemptions significantly improve SMEs' cash flows and further stimulate their operational recovery. This effect is more pronounced for firms with larger shares of high-skilled employees. Second, financial support policies do not appear to be effective in alleviating SMEs' cash constraints or encouraging the reopening of small businesses, potentially due to difficulties in accessing policy-oriented loans and misallocation of credit. Last, regional and local lock-down policies decrease SMEs' incidence of reopening and delay their expected reopening in the near future, likely by reducing consumer demand. Our findings shed new light on the policy debates on supporting SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) form an essential part of the economy. They are also the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis. While numerous policies have been introduced by governments around the globe to combat the virus and to stimulate the economy, their impact, especially on SMEs, remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate how stabilization and lock-down policies affect SMEs' operating conditions, decisions and expectations.====To study those questions, we utilize the ESIEC survey of over 2000 SMEs from 62 Chinese cities.==== The first wave of the survey was conducted between February 10 and 13 of 2020, after all provincial governments in China declared first-degree state of emergency, and a number of local stabilization and lock-down policies were introduced. The second wave was conducted between May 18 and 25 of 2020, when the spread of COVID-19 had largely been contained, and economic recovery was well under way with support from nationwide stabilization policies.====We explore three types of policies in detail: payment relief, financial support (both of which are stabilization policies) and lock-downs; and focus on SMEs' decisions to reopen, expectations of reopening, self-assessment of future cash balance, and percentage of employees who have returned to work. To examine short-run policy effects, we combine the first wave of the survey with hand-collected information on local policies in early February, which were enacted semi-independently by provincial and city governments and exhibited substantial geographical variations. To examine the medium-run effects of stabilization policies, we apply a propensity-score matching (PSM) method on the May wave of the survey to study how national policies affect firms.====We begin by documenting that the effects of stabilization policies vary by their types. While financial policies do not seem to improve SMEs' operating conditions, SMEs that received payment relief policies are less likely to face short-term ==== in February: the probability is reduced by 5.8% under social security deferrals and 13% under rent reductions. Furthermore, SMEs under social security deferrals are 5.7% more likely to have reopened by the time of the February wave, and 9.5% more likely to plan on reopening within one month if they have not opened yet. On the other hand, city-level and provincial-level lock-downs in February are associated with a significantly smaller likelihood to reopen (6.8% and 13% respectively), as well as an 11% smaller likelihood of expecting to reopen within one month.====In the medium-run, similar effects are observed for national stabilization policies: SMEs that received social security deferrals and exemptions and employment stabilization subsidies are 3.7% more likely to reopen and 6.4% more likely to have over half of their employees return to work, and SMEs that received rent exemptions are 12% less likely to face short-term cash constraints. While local ==== deferrals are ineffective in supporting SME recovery in the short-run, national level tax deferrals and exemptions help relieve SMEs' cash constraints and speed up their reopening in the medium-run. Again, we find no evidence that SMEs that received credit and loan supports see improvements in short-term liquidity or likelihood of reopening.====We perform heterogeneity analyses to disentangle potential channels through which local policies affect SMEs. We first explore the effects of stabilization policies on SMEs with different characteristics. Under local social security deferrals, SMEs with a larger share of highly-skilled workers, which we argue reflects a larger share of formal employment,====We then examine the impact of lock-downs on SMEs that face different types of demand. Under provincial highway lock-downs, which hinder the flow of goods across cities and provinces, SMEs relying on a non-local customer base are much less likely to reopen. Under city-wide social-distancing policies, which restrict face-to-face transactions, SMEs that are offline sellers are less likely to reopen. No substantial differences in expected delays in reopening are observed, which is likely because lock-downs are of a temporary nature. These results are consistent with ====, who find that stay-at-home orders lead to a decrease in consumer spending, and with ====, who find that businesses' reopening decisions depend on expected demand.====Our paper is among the early studies on how policy instruments can be used to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on SMEs, and contributes to a fast growing literature that studies the economic consequences of the pandemic. Several papers use survey evidence to study firms' primary challenges in and responses to the COVID-19 crisis (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), and some use stock prices to directly evaluate the impact of the crisis on the performance of listed firms with different characteristics (====; ====). A number of studies examine the effects of policy announcements on the expectations of individuals and SMEs (====; ====; ====), and others investigate the effects of stay-at-home orders and economic stabilization policies on labor and consumption (====; ====; ====). ==== find that lump-sum transfers improves firms' expected survival, but not their performance. Our study connects and enriches these two strands of literature by analyzing the effectiveness of government policies from the perspective of SMEs. We find that payment relief can ease SME's liquidity constraints, which proves to be one of firms' predominant concerns (====; ====), and assist SMEs to reopen; that financial policy may not always achieve the desired effect of directing resources towards to the financially vulnerable; and that lock-downs, which are found to depress consumer demand (====), further translate to a dampening effect on SMEs' decisions and expectations to reopen. These insights are particularly valuable for policymakers.

At present, it is also taken as one of important forms for common prosperity which is a great goal put forward by China. Research on socio-economic integration of migrants normally focuses on its definition (====; ====; ====), the theories (====; ====; ====), and the influencing factors, such as personal characteristics (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), mobility attributes (====; ====), language assimilation (====; ====; ====), social connection (====; ====; ====; ====) and residential segregation (====; ====). China experiences a large-scale migration of migrants. And a large number of scholars pay much attention on the issue of migrants' socio-economic integration. In China, they mainly focus on the following factors: Household registration (====) system (====), neighbourhood or community (====; ====; ====) and hometown land (====).====To bridge the research gap, this paper first conceptualizes and offers a credible framework to explain the relationship between housing tenure choice and migrants' socio-economic integration, including transnational immigration theory, balance theory and utility maximization theory. Further, based on a large national micro-level data from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS), this paper uses the ==== method and the PSM to alleviate the endogeneity and makes robustness check for the results. Third, the underlying mechanism of housing tenure choice on socio-economic integration of migrants is explored. It is worth-noted that digital economy is first introduced as a moderating variable affecting the relationship between housing tenure choice and migrants' socio-economic integration.====It is shown migrants' socio-economic integration mainly includes economic integration (11.24), socio-cultural integration (36.79) and psychological integration (73.40). In terms of total socio-economic integration, the highest level is represented by migrants possessing commercial housing. The hierarchy order is followed by migrants who purchase affordable housing. And, migrants who rent private housing jointly is ranked the second from the bottom. Migrants living in the place of employment is the lowest. It is also found that the level of economic integration and socio-cultural integration of migrants who rent public rental housing provided by the government is the second followed by migrants who own commercial housing. While those who own affordable housing occupy the highest level of psychological integration. However, migrants living in the place of employment is the lowest level in terms of economic integration. Migrants who rent private housing jointly is the lowest in terms of socio-cultural integration, while migrants living in unit/employer's house is the lowest in terms of psychological integration. Migrants' socio-economic integration level, who own housing, is higher than those who are renters. While migrants' socio-economic integration level, who live in employee's dormitory, is comparatively lower, even after controlling the endogenous problem. Further study indicates that the effect of housing tenure choice on migrants' socio-economic integration partly affects their settlement intention, integration will, local capital and labor supply. Heterogeneity analysis shows that new generation migrants' socio-economic integration who are homeowners is lower than that of old generation migrants. Living in eastern China and the development of digital economy can both strengthen the effect of housing tenure choice on migrants' socio-economic integration. This is a new finding in the international literature examining the association between housing tenure choice and socio-economic integration of migrants with Chinese cases. It not only helps Chinese government departments make corresponding decisions, but also provides reference for other countries.====The rest of the paper is arranged as follows.

By taking advantage of China's establishment of interprovincial circuit tribunals (ICTs) that separate the judicial system from local governments, we find that: (1) ICTs significantly rectify the JLP provided by lower-level courts. (2)A micro-mechanism analysis shows that ICTs decrease transportation costs of cases involving small and private enterprises as plaintiffs and increase their probability applying for retrials in the Supreme People's Court (SPC). In combination with the fact that these enterprises are more likely to be discriminated against by lower-level courts, the rectification effect of ICTs becomes significant after the reform. (3)Consistently, although ICTs significantly decrease the MS between provinces within the same circuit area, the MS between provinces of different circuit areas barely changes. Our paper provides timely implications and potentially actionable insights for countries facing similar concerns.","Domestic market segmentation (MS) is deeply rooted in most countries and is responsible for insufficiently specialized regional economies and overcapacity (====; ====). In addition, extensive studies have documented that MS mainly arises from local2015 protection (LP) (====; ====; ====).====Prior scholarship has arrived at theoretically conflicting conclusions about the effects of judicial institutions on LP and MS. Advocates in developed countries primarily argue that judicial institutions could outlaw LP in various forms==== (e.g., the commerce clause in the U.S.) (====). Detractors concern that local governments in developing countries are endowed with the power to make personnel and budgetary decisions for courts; and thus, the branch courts soon become local-interest-oriented (====; ====; ====).====China provides an ideal laboratory to empirically study this decades-old problem. Dating back at least to 1979, China has allowed decentralization and sufficient competition among local governments so as to stimulate economic growth. Unsurprisingly, this policy leads to severe LP and MS.==== According to one recent survey conducted by the Supreme People's Court (SPC), over 68% of judges identified LP as a major cause of unfairness in judicial decisions and a major reason for the difficulties in law enforcement(====). However, with increasing trade uncertainty, China is seeking to rebalance its economy toward a unified domestic market (i.e., great domestic circulation). The discriminatory local policies in mass forms thus are frequently banned. This great structural transformation provides rich exogenous variations in judicial institution that can be used to address the endogeneity issue.====Theoretically, the establishment of ICTs is expected to affect judicial local protection through two ways. First, ICTs might ==== rectify the wrongful conviction judged by lower-level courts (i.e., the rectification effect). For example, small enterprises who are more likely to suffer judicial local protection have to appeal for retrial in the HSPC in Beijing before the reform. Due to the high transportation cost, they might choose to stop appeal even though they have a large winning probability. In contrast, the establishment of ICTs lowers transportation cost. Then small enterprises might turn to appeal and these cases will be more likely to be rectified (see ==== Therefore, the rectification behavior of ICTs will exert negative effect on the assessment of province-or-below court and force them to alleviate JLP in advance (i.e., ====) (see ==== for more details).====We need to bear in mind that rectification of JLP(which is typically opaque and implicit) is difficult to measure directly. In this paper, we primarily follow the conventional literature that uses ==== in the winning probability of plaintiffs to trace the rectification of JLP (====; ====; ====).====Although imperfect, the proxy has its rationales:(1) According to the law, plaintiffs in China need to file a case of first instance in the location where the defendant usually resides (i.e., ====). (2) Under this arrangement, defendants are more likely to be locally protected, which indicates a lower winning probability of plaintiffs in the local court (i.e.,home court bias).==== (3) Since ICTs play the correctional role in rectifying the mistakes made by lower courts, the ==== in the winning probability of plaintiffs (compared with previous trials) is thus evidence of an ==== in the rectification effect.====Our main finding is that the reform rectifies the JLP of lower-level courts and alleviates MS. (1) Compared with the situation without ICT coverage (i.e., retrials are still handled exclusively by the HSPC), the reform increases the rectification effect significantly by 16.6%. (2) ICTs significantly decrease the index of MS by 0.014 or 45.2%, thus providing additional evidence that the increase in winning probability of plaintiff reflects more ¡®correct¡¯ and higher quality judicial decisions. (3) Interestingly, although the MS between provinces of the same circuit area indeed decreases, the MS between provinces of different circuit areas and the MS between cities within the same province barely changes.====Next we turn to mechanisms explaining the rectification effect of ICTs. Several prior studies have suggested the transportation cost conjecture (====).Before the reform, all litigants around the country had to appeal for retrial in the HSPC in Beijing. While after the reform, litigants only needed to appeal for a retrial in ICTs, which significantly lowered their transportation costs (e.g. ¡°the SPC in front of peoples' door¡±). Given that transportation costs are comparatively larger for the set of small(typically private) enterprises, the establishment of ICTs will provide them with stronger incentives to apply for retrials. Since these enpterprises are also more likely to suffer from JLP, the rectification effect will thus increase. We find pieces of evidence that support the above conjecture.====In addition to bolstering the case for our empirical strategy by using a number of specification checks, we also demonstrate its robustness in the following ways. (1) We replace the binary measure of the rectification effect with alternative continuous measures of JLP.==== (2)We rigorously test the assumption of home court bias. (3)We use broader province-level economic factors to test the exogeneity of the timing of the reform. (4), Finally, we change the treatment year to implement the placebo test.====Our paper complements and extends the fast-growing research on how China's judiciary applies national laws against local actors. ==== show that the effect of environmental courts on corporate environmental investment is more pronounced in subsamples with severe LP (e.g., state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or non-SOEs with political connections). ==== provide evidence that whether the plaintiff's residence coincides with the court's location has a significant impact on obtaining a favorable ruling; however, the appellate courts redress the JLP found in the first instance rulings. ==== in administrative litigation, ==== find that the reform improve judicial independence on protecting the rights of the private sector against potential abuses of government. ==== point out that when provinces are covered by the circuit court, investment of the publicly listed companies of those provinces increase significantly. The primary ways that our paper differs from these papers are the type of data used and the nature of the reform. And it is difficult to know whether their conclusions can be generalized to other types of judicial institutions.====Our paper is also widely related to other organizations selected for addressing MS. ==== finds that the reform of incorporating counties into prefectures (ICIP) significantly reduces the LP and MS between incorporated counties and their corresponding prefectures. However, we argue that the generalization of ICIP is limited because we cannot incorporate all provinces into a single province. ==== point out that nonlocal private enterprises have to choose to enter joint ventures with local SOEs to avoid discrimination by the local government, which constitutes an important source of misallocation. ==== state that although China's environmental vertical management reform insulates intervention by local governments, it does not improve environmental outcomes because of a lack of local information. Although lowering the weight of GDP when evaluating local officials could alleviate LP, its GDP growth rate drops significantly(====).====This paper makes three main contributions. (1) How the second-largest economy in the world addresses domestic MS has important policy implications for economies facing similar questions. Although a fast-growing empirical literature has examined the effect of infrastructure on reducing MS, very few have investigated the the role judiciary plays, especially in a weakly institutionalized setting (====; ====). (2) To the best of our knowledge, we present the first empirical evidence on the fundamental importance of the ICT reform (arguably the most important Chinese legal reform of the last two decades) in LP resolution and market integration, which is an area thus far unexplored by academic research due to the lack of valuable data. (3)Although many studies admit that non-SOE discrimination is widespread, finding a resolution is challenging in China, we identify one particular instrument¡ªthe efficiency of judicial institutions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the institutional background, ==== explains the data and variables, and ====, ==== analyze the effects of ICTs on LP and MS, respectively. ==== conducts robustness examinations and ==== concludes.====First, for province ==== and neighboring province ====, we define ?==== as the relative inflation of good ==== across the two provinces in year ==== (see Eq. ====).

In the model, monetary injections through OMOs, together with differentiated collateral regulation in the ==== sector, directly affect banks' loan capacities, which then influence sectoral investments and aggregate GDP. The quantitative analysis shows that the 2009¨C2010 monetary expansion explains nearly 66% of the rise in GDP growth. Moreover, balancing credit allocation across sectors and applying unified banking regulations jointly enhance the GDP growth rate by 1.65 percentage points, with the contribution of the unified banking regulations proving more important.","In the wake of the 2007¨C2008 global financial crisis, the Chinese government announced a massive monetary stimulus in November 2008, in the hope of restoring the annual growth rate to its previous level above-9%.==== As the second largest economy in the world, China's massive stimulus has triggered a fast growing literature to study its impacts on the real economy. Many works stress the ====; ====; ====). However, few studies has provided a structural theoretical framework in which the bank credit channel of the monetary transmission mechanism is explicitly modeled and its quantitative importance is carefully examined. This paper tries to fill the gap. In particular, we develop a theoretical model by capturing the key institutional features of the Chinese monetary policy. We aim to quantify the impact of the monetary stimulus during 2009¨C2010 on the real economy and explore the policy implications of the bank credit channel of monetary transmission.====A unique feature of the Chinese monetary policy is that it works through the bank credit channel. The Open Market Operations (OMOs) and the window guidance policy (non-market-based instrument) play the most significant, albeit different, roles. Specifically, the OMOs are used as the main tool for the People's Bank of China (PBC), the central bank of China, to achieve the explicit target of growth rate of the M2 supply on a regular basis. The window guidance policy is used to ensure that the growth of bank credits is in line with the growth of the M2 supply, and that the bank credits are allocated to the sectors or firms preferred by the central government (see ====).==== into the model. For simplicity, the banking sector, which contains the state-owned banks (SBs) and non-state-owned banks (NSBs), is assumed to be segmented.====Specifically, we assume that the SBs only lend to state-owned-enterprises (SOEs), and that the NSBs only lend to private enterprises (PEs). The assumption of segmented banking sector is mainly motivated by two China-specific stylized facts in the credit market. One is that SBs have a preferential lending relationship with the SOEs (see ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For instance, ==== provide micro-level empirical evidence that there exists a special connection between SOEs and SBs.==== The other is that small-and-medium enterprises (SME), mostly the PEs, have difficulty in obtaining credit from the SBs. For example, ==== provide solid empirical evidence that small-and-medium banks (SMB, i.e., NSBs) have unparalleled advantages in terms of providing SME loans.====The second extension is that we develop an ====The benefits of these two extensions are twofold. First, the OMO rule allows us to explicitly illustrate the bank lending channel of the monetary transmission. In the model, the OMOs directly affect the balance sheet of two types of banks, which affects banks' loan capacity, and therefore, shapes the sectoral and aggregate investments and outputs.====We estimate our model using quarterly data from 2005Q1¨C2014Q4 in China. The decomposition results show that the OMO rule contributes more to fluctuations in investment and output, as opposed to other nine shocks considered in the model. At the aggregate level, around 20% of the fluctuations of output, and 30% of variations in investment are accounted for by the OMO shocks. At the sector level, the OMO shocks display differentiated impacts, explaining around 51% of the variations in SOE investment, while only about 17% of the fluctuations in PE investment. These results echo well the findings in recent studies, such as ====, that the monetary or credit expansions in China mainly boost GDP growth through SOE investment.====The impulse response to the OMO shocks illustrates the credit channel of monetary transmission. During a credit expansion, the estimated OMO rule suggests that a larger portion of credit expansions go to the SBs, which significantly increases the loan capacity of the SBs compared to the NSBs. The resulting lowered lending rate greatly promotes the SOE investment. This effect is further strengthened in the SOE sector given that the SOEs are financially less constrained because of the more favorable borrowing conditions compared to the PEs. In contrast, the PE investment is less responsive to the OMO shock, due to both the smaller portion of credits received by the NSBs and much tighter borrowing constraints faced by the PEs.====We use the estimated model to ask two questions: (1) What is the effect of the 2009¨C2010 monetary stimulus on the GDP growth?==== (2) What are the relative contributions to the GDP growth of the two sources of credit imbalance, which lead to credit misallocation? To answer the first question, we remove the massive monetary stimulus by reducing the size of the OMO shock during 2008Q4¨C2009Q2 when the OMO was implemented intensively during the stimulus period. As expected, eliminating stimulus gives rise to a lower GDP growth. The simulated GDP growth rate in 2009Q3 declines substantially by 3.3 percentage points, accounting for about 66% of the increase in GDP growth between 2008Q3 and 2009Q3. This result is consistent with the finding of 85% in ==== based on an empirical analysis.====Exploring the relative contributions of the two sources of credit imbalance provides some useful insight into the credit misallocation issue raised in some recent empirical works. In particular, we examine what would happen to GDP growth if the credit is allocated between SBs and NSBs in a more balanced way. Two interesting results are found. First, a balanced allocation of credits in the banking sector promotes the GDP growth, and this effect is further amplified by a more unified banking regulations. Specifically, keeping other things equal, when the NSBs are allowed to have more credit injections over the stimulus period than what they have in the baseline case, the predicted average GDP growth rate rises by 0.55 percentage points. Further relaxing the borrowing constraints faced by the PEs induces the average GDP growth rate to increase by 1.65 percentage points. Second, unifying the banking regulations proves more important in addressing the credit misallocation issue. To show this, we switch the status of the SBs and NSBs in the banking sector such that the NSBs receive more credits than the SBs during the stimulus era, while leaving the differentiated borrowing constraints unchanged. The corresponding results show that the GDP growth declines. The same point is also made by decomposition exercises that separate the effects of a more balanced credit allocation and the change in the total credits on GDP growth.====The intuition behind these results is as follows. When new credits are injected into the banking sector in a more balanced way, the rise in credits in the NSBs helps more PEs get loans due to lower borrowing costs (====). Relaxing the tight borrowing constraint by the PEs makes it easy for individual PE firm to get bank loans (====). As a result, a reform along both dimensions greatly encourages the investment in the PE sector, translating into a higher GDP growth. However, switching the status of the SBs and NSBs alone suggests two changes: one is that the reform at the intensive margin is missing. So, the individual PE firm still has difficulties in obtaining bank loans, which leads to a limited rise in the PE investment. The other is that at the extensive margin, a lower loan capacity in the SBs imposes a negative pressure on the SOE investment. By pulling together these two changes, the decrease in the SOE investment outweighs the increase in the PE sector, leading to a lower aggregate investment. This result highlights the importance of the unfavorable borrowing condition faced by the PEs (intensive margin) in explaining the recent economic slowdown in China.====Our paper is mostly related to the literature on Chinese monetary policy. ==== empirically identify an endogenous-switching monetary policy regimes (normal versus shortfall). However, their approach is essentially a reduced-form approach and one cannot see how monetary expansion affects the real economy through the banking sector. ==== attribute the failure of money tightening in the post-stimulus era to the rise in shadow banking activities caused by the NSB's concern for the loan to deposit rate (LDR). Abstracted from the LDR and the shadow banks, our work focuses on the real impact of the monetary stimulus via the OMO rule and the differentiated access to bank loans. Different from the positive question asked in this work, ==== With the OMOs being the primary tool used by the PBC to achieve the monetary policy target during the stimulus period, this work abstracts from the reserve requirement (ratio), and focuses on evaluating the real effect of the 2009¨C2010 monetary expansions with the OMO rule.====Our quantitative results also confirm the findings in the literature on misallocation effect of the 2009¨C2010 stimulus package. For example, ==== find that credit supply increase induced by the stimulus plan gives rise to capital allocation toward less productive firms. And the credit reallocation from PEs to SOEs accounts for 70% of the overall misallocation. They argue that financial friction, such as easier access to finance for state-connected firms, is the driven force of misallocation during recession. Similarly, ==== point out the capital misallocation problem caused by the local governments. In line with this strand of literature, this work analyzes the role of financial friction along the dimension of the two sources of credit misallocation: uneven credit injection and differentiated borrowing constraints across sectors. Through close examination of the details of the quantity-based monetary policy in China, our quantitative results illustrate their relative importance in addressing the credit misallocation problem.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides a brief background of monetary policy in China and the stimulus policy introduced during 2009¨C2010. ==== describes the DSGE model with the segmented banking sector.

There is no consensus on when RMB was undervalued or when it was overvalued.====Based on HCW method, we find that Chinese REER depreciated by 17.49% after the accession to WTO in December 2001 and the depreciation was mainly caused by CPI, since NEER was almost unaffected. The reform of exchange rate regime in July 2005, however, made Chinese REER appreciated by 6.65%. China's 2008 economic stimulus package and 2010 exchange rate policy reform appreciated Chinese REER by 9.20% and 27.74%, receptively. But the appreciations were due to different channels. The former was due to the decreases in CPI, since NEER only appreciated by 0.36% for 2008 stimulus package, and the latter was due to the 20.26% appreciations in NEER for the re-start of the reform of China's exchange rate regime in 2010. The reform in August 2015 was the second time that RMB's international trade competitiveness strengthened, by about 4.44%, while this strengthening was due to the depreciations in NEER and reduced by the decreases in CPI. The US-China trade dispute had no effects on Chinese REER. After March 2018, even RMB's international trade competitiveness seemed stronger in nominal term, it was actually unaffected in real term due to the decreases in CPI. This decreasing was neutralized by the depreciations of NEER. Overall, we find that the reform of China's exchange rate policy in July 2005 and August 2015 strengthened RMB's trade competitiveness in real term, while other events weakened it. The misalignments in REER are caused by the changes in both NEER and China's CPI.==== studied the treatment effects of major economic events on Chinese RMB's nominal exchange rate from 1989 to 2013. Unlike REER and NEER, RMB's nominal exchange rate is a fixed constant from 1994 to 2005 and from 2008 to 2010. Therefore, HCW method cannot be applied directly to nominal exchange rate to study the effects of economic events on Chinese nominal exchange rate. ==== combined HCW method and PPP theory to bypass the fixed dependent variable problem. They found that China's fixed exchange rate policy from 1994 to 2005 indeed undervalued RMB, especially after its accession to WTO. The reform of China's exchange rate policy were making progresses in re-evaluating RMB.

Parents' migration for work purposes may inhibit the development of children's noncognitive abilities, but its influence on children's cooperation preferences remains unclear. Using three one-shot public goods games, we examine the impacts of parental migration on the development of children's cooperation preferences and whether introducing punishment mechanisms could partly exacerbate or offset the effects. We conducted a large-scale field experiment with more than 1600 rural students aged 6¨C16. Our main findings are as follows. First, the cooperation level of non-left-behind children increases significantly with age, while being left behind may affect this stable development track. Specifically, we find that paternal migration significantly decreases children's cooperation levels, while maternal or both parents' migration does not. Second, punishment mechanisms can significantly promote children's cooperation levels and offset the negative effect of paternal migration. Exogenous punishments work across ages, while endogenous punishments work only among middle school students. However, as the extent to which children were left-behind deepens, the offsetting effects of the punishment mechanisms gradually weaken.","Investments in cognitive and noncognitive abilities in the early stage are crucial, as they could significantly predict an individual's future income (====; ====; ====). Compared with cognitive abilities, noncognitive abilities are more plastic during late childhood and should be considered an investment priority in human capital (====; ====; ====; ====).====As an important component of noncognitive abilities, cooperation preferences are gradually formed in the process of child socialization, in which the family environment and parental education play nonnegligible roles. Previous research has found that an intact family in which both parents live with their children is the most conducive family structure to children's development, while the long-term absence of either parent may adversely affect children's development (==== system, these migrant workers are not entitled to welfare services similar to those of local residents regarding children's education, housing, and medical care. They, therefore, must leave their children behind in their hometowns, resulting in a massive number of LBC. As early as 2010, the number of LBC in rural China exceeded 60 million, more than one-fifth of its total children, of whom 29.48 million were in the compulsory education stage.==== Although migrant parents can improve their families' financial conditions, LBC are in a disadvantaged position in the accumulation of human capital, such as education level and physical and mental health (====; ====; ====; ====).====Although abundant empirical studies have investigated the potential effects of parental migration on children's development outcomes, there are gaps in understanding how parental migration influences children's cooperation preferences. Most of the current literature is based solely on questionnaires and focuses on children's physical or mental health and academic performance. In addition, most existing experimental studies use intact family structures and small experimental samples (e.g., ====; ====; ====), making it difficult to infer the effects of parental migration on children's noncognitive abilities. Recently, a few emerging experimental studies using value elicitation incentives have investigated the effects of parents' migration on LBC's noncognitive abilities, such as other-regarding preferences (====), lying behavior (====) and competitive preferences (====), but the effects on cooperation remain to be revealed.====The aim of this paper is to explore the impact of parental migration on the development of LBC's cooperation preferences and answer the following questions. First, what is the overall picture of children's cooperation preference development in rural China? Second, would parental migration influence children's cooperation preferences? Third, does paternal and maternal migration have asymmetric effects on LBC's cooperation preferences? Finally, can punishment exacerbate or alleviate the possible effects caused by parental migration? To answer these questions, we conducted a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment including three public goods games with more than 1600 rural children in Sichuan and surveys about the students' characteristics, family backgrounds, parents' migration status and caregivers' characteristics.====Our study contributes to the literature in four ways. First, we provide new insights into the empirical studies of ==== by exploring the impact of parents' migration on children's cooperation preferences utilizing economic experiments. To our knowledge, this study is one of the largest field experiments in the literature on children's cooperation preferences. Second, we analyze the asymmetric impacts of paternal and maternal migration on children's cooperation preferences and find the essential role of paternal accompaniment. Additionally, we analyze the cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment among children in China and distinguish its potential differences between LBC and non-LBC.

This paper exploits spatial and temporal variations in birthplace diversity to identify its causal effect on household donation in China. Leveraging a novel longitudinal dataset, the paper finds that higher birthplace diversity at the city level decreases donation for local neighborhood affairs and community services, but it does hopefully encourage donation for ==== and disaster relief, and donation for educational aid and health care. Further findings, while are in support of failures in cooperation as the popular mechanism behind the adverse effects of birthplace diversity, indicate that the positive effects of birthplace diversity are primarily driven by changes in emotional states such as perceived fairness, moral values, empathic and responsible awareness. This paper complements the literature on diversity and public goods provision by highlighting the necessity of distinguishing various kinds of public goods and considering the salience of diversity under local specific contexts.","Migration within and across countries has increasingly become prevailing around the world due to economic liberalization and globalization. The potential consequences of population diversity for various aspects of the society in migration destination has received widespread attention from academics and policymakers. One of the most concerned fields is whether and how increased diversity has affected the provision of public goods. The supposedly negative association between population diversity and the quality of public goods has been approved for a broad variety of diversity categories and across public good outcomes, regions, as well as levels of analysis (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), though some recent researches have also confuted the negative relationship (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The leading explanations for why population diversity leads to poor provision of public goods in this branch of literature are feelings of outgroup competitive threats, diversely distributed preferences, lack of social control, and coordination problems in diverse areas, which ultimately undermine social cohesion and are harmful to cooperation.====However, the mechanism mentioned above through which detrimental relationship operates is not undisputed. The well-established contact theory is typically considered as predicting precisely the opposite results. Increased intergroup contact opportunities in diverse areas stimulate, out of choice or necessity, contact experiences with people of other groups, which is negatively related to perceptions of outgroup threat and positively related to interconnectedness across groups (====). In this sense, population diversity should accordingly expand the radius of trust and solidarity.====Meanwhile, an emerging body of studies has attempted to explain why the impacts of diversity on public goods provision are insignificant or even positive rather than negative by employing more plausible causal identification strategies and exploring contextual factors and new underlying mechanisms. For example, when taking the problem of endogeneity resulting from omitted variables, residential sorting, and reverse causality into account, diversity is not consistently an impediment to providing public goods (====; ====; ====; ====). The detrimental effects of diversity are weakened or not observed in areas with extensive intergroup interactions (====; ====). Regarding mechanisms in favor of the positive association, some scattered bits of evidence suggest that diversity can lead to better public services by encouraging electoral competition and emergence of conciliatory states (====; ====; ====).====Moreover, it does not necessarily mean that the importance of one type of diversity and its relevant mechanisms in explaining the quantity of one public good can simply generalize to other contexts. Existing evidence implies that the nature of the relationship is rather complicated and might be highly contingent upon types of public good, types of diversity, and certain conditions (====; ====; ====). For instance, in addition to encompassing different forms of material, public goods can be provided by local government, collective, or even individual; religious, linguistic, ethnic, or immigrant diversity is frequently used as an alternative measure of population diversity. The salience of diversities and representativeness of public goods in real life also vary across social contexts, and thereby the dominant mechanism that decisively drives the association between diversity and public goods provision may also be distinct. While exploring the impact of diversity on private contribution to public goods receives relatively sparse attention, identifying their connections and possible unconventional mechanisms is not only essential to check the validity of the diversity hypothesis but also helpful in better understanding the source of divergent results in the literature.====This article aims to study the relationship between population diversity and private donations. While most previous literature is mainly interested in the association between diversity and local government or collective provision of public goods, in this paper we focus on whether the same pattern holds for the private provision of public goods. The answer is not as straightforward as we subconsciously expected since personal donation is the use of private resources for public purposes possessing dual attributes of public and private. In the extreme case, there is no collective provision of the public goods in question at all when individuals completely take their private donation decision just as normal commodity consumption. At this moment, giving is an almost automatic response out of emotional states such as senses of empathy, notions of justice, social responsibility, and moral values (====). From a theoretical perspective, the observed effect of diversity on giving may therefore depend on the relative size of the impact through cooperation-based mechanisms and emotion-based mechanisms.====This article examines whether and how migration-driven diversity has a causal effect on household donations in immigrant-receiving cities. In particular, we distinguish donations in three different domains (donation for ==== and disaster relief, donation for educational aid and health care, and donation for local neighborhood affairs and community services, respectively), and explore whether the mere presence of internal immigrants systematically impacts the three forms of giving and their aggregate indicator. For the first two forms of giving, we interpret these as donations outside their residential neighborhood with high degrees of private nature that involves few stakeholders such as supporting the homeless; for the last form of giving, we interpret this as donation within the local neighborhood with a high degree of collective nature that requires the cooperation of multiple stakeholders such as infrastructure maintenance.====We leverage a nationally representative survey dataset (the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey) combined with statistical yearbook data in China to explore these issues. The magnitude of the migrant population in China has substantially increased from 109.01 million in 2000 to 375.82 million in 2020, which means that the migrant population has increased by 3.45 times in the past two decades and that approximately a quarter (26.62%) of the country's population was in a fluid state in 2020.==== On the other hand, the total donation in China has slightly increased from 103.20 billion in 2010 to 144.29 billion in 2019, and the figures for personal donation in the corresponding period are 29.61 billion and 39.85 billion, respectively; the donations were mainly used for poverty alleviation, educational aid and health care in 2019, which accounted for 72.32% of the total donation.==== Charitable causes have played a fundamental role in helping solve some of the most severe economic, social and environmental issues in China. All of these background factors make it a good candidate for the case study.====Exploiting the variations in birthplace diversity across Chinese cities over the period 2012¨C2018, we find that birthplace diversity is in general positively associated with household donations after including a rich set of controls to isolate the effects of birthplace diversity. But the pattern of different forms of giving is inconsistent. Specifically, birthplace diversity appears to increase the possibilities of donation for poverty alleviation and disaster relief, and donation for educational aid and health care, while reducing the possibility of donation for local neighborhood affairs and community services. Meanwhile, the main results also show that birthplace diversity matters more in predicting the former two forms of giving than in predicting the latter one. These findings highlight the necessity of distinguishing public goods with different natures to reconcile these contradictory findings.====To eliminate potential threats to a causal interpretation of our baseline results, we adopt a series of different strategies. First, we successively document the impacts of donation on migration destination selection of immigrants and on birthplace diversity at the aggregate level. These regressions allow us to judge whether our main results are driven by the opposite story that places with more donations attract more immigrants. Second, we estimate the baseline specification at alternative geographical levels and investigate the impact of birthplace diversity on the future plan of people. These exercises serve as alternative ways for inspecting and controlling for immigrant-induced native mobility. Third, we separately restrict our sample to people with local official household registration status and those without cross-county migration experiences since the age of 14. Pairwise comparisons of this set of results with the benchmark results enable us to check whether our basic results come from the donation of immigrants instead of natives or even suffer from the problem of residential sorting or missing important variables severely. Fourth, we complement previous strategies by applying a method developed by ==== to assess the possible influence of omitted variables. This approach can formally check the presence of omitted variable bias and investigate whether our main results are sensitive to the selection on unobservables. Fifth, we instrument for birthplace diversity using plausibly exogenous variations in temperature index and precipitation index, which have been confirmed to attract outsiders and encourage population diversity in previous researches (====; ====Considering the potential mechanisms behind our results, we document that the declines in acquaintance, trust, and reciprocity within the local neighborhood likely mediate the effect that birthplace diversity negatively influences donation for neighborhood affairs and community services. Interesting, trust towards outsiders (including business people, colleagues, and strangers) is almost insensitive to immigrant inflows. These findings align with the compromise of contact theory and conflict theory, which suggests that heterogeneity does not always uniformly erode intergroup cohesion. In addition, we also find that birthplace diversity increases the perceived fairness and achievement, as well as reinforces donation motivations such as feelings of empathy and responsibility, fulfilling personal values, and needs for social approval. These emotional aspects are likely channels through which birthplace diversity produces a favorable effect on donations beyond the confines of the neighborhood with high degrees of private nature. Positive experiences in the constructive interactions with dissimilar others, such as those in the workplaces, economic transactions, and civic lives, have the potential to reduce prejudice and form an emotional integration (====; ====), along with the escalating decline in traditional neighborhood interactions based on group identification and mutual acquaintanceship.====This article complements and extends the existing literature on the association between diversity and public goods provision in three ways. First, unlike most researches focusing on diversity and local government or collective provision of public goods, the present article examines the impact of birthplace diversity on privately contributing to public goods and distinguishes three forms of personal donation with varying degrees of public feature. When considering the linkage between diversity and public goods provision, the public nature of providing public goods can be an important determinant of the nexus and can also offer a possible explanation for the overall inconclusive evidence in previous literature.====Second, this article explores additional emotion-based mechanisms that have been given scarce attention in previous studies. Although existing literature on diversity and public goods provision teases out important underlying mechanisms from the perspective of cooperation, such as heterogeneous preferences, norms of reciprocity, and trust, a growing debate on their associations suggests that other potential mechanisms might also be at work. This study complements these researches by additionally considering several psychological aspects like perceived fairness, moral values, empathic and responsible awareness, which can be affected by immigrant inflows and then motivate giving.====Third, this article extends the literature by studying an area that received scant attention, China. Most previous work on diversity takes Western countries as the object of analysis and generally focuses on religious, racial, or linguistic diversity. It's adventurous to generalize these findings to other countries due to distinct social, political, and economic contexts. Consequently, consideration of different types of diversity in other countries can be valuable for thoroughly understanding the role of diversity in public goods provision. China serves as an appropriate context, in which the birthplace diversity is much more salient than other diversity measures concerned by previous researches. It enables us to disentangle better the effect of birthplace diversity from the overall diversity.",Birthplace diversity and private giving: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000852,22-Jun-22,2022,Research Article,131

In 2006, China introduced a new rule that explicitly prohibited grade repetition during the compulsory education period. Exploiting the staggered introduction of this policy across provinces and applying a flexible difference-in-differences strategy, we analyze the causal effects of the reform on various student outcomes, including school completion and cognitive skills, mental health and self-confidence in early adulthood. The results indicate that automatic grade ==== hurts students' educational development, especially for boys and for children with less-educated mothers. On the other hand, however, the reform indeed improved mental health, as noted by the proponents of social promotion. More importantly, we find that all the policy impacts are concentrated solely among students exposed to the reform in an early grade, particularly 1st-3rd grade. The results further indicate that removing the ¡°threat¡± of grade retention results in a decrease in study time in the long run, which we interpret as a potential mechanism.","During the past two decades, there have been numerous debates concerning the practices of grade retention and social promotion, in which students advance to the next grade regardless of their test scores or school performance.==== On the one hand, grade repetition can be viewed as a remedial intervention, and students who are retained in earlier grades may have more opportunities to catch up with their counterparts (====). In addition, the threat of grade retention also incentivizes students to increase their efforts in order to avoid repeating a grade (====). On the other hand, as an extremely stressful life event, grade retention may be associated with poor noncognitive skills and negative socioemotional consequences, such as lower self-esteem or stigmatization, which in turn have a detrimental impact on students' subsequent performance (====; ====; ====).====Beyond the general debate regarding grade retention and social promotion, in the late 1990s, some states/districts in the US began to provide remedial education for students at risk of repeating a grade. Specifically, students who fail to meet the requirements for grade promotion are required to attend summer school for several weeks, after which they can retake the exam that they failed. Those students who score higher than the predetermined cutoff are allowed to advance to the next grade. These accountability policies (grade retention combined with remedial interventions) seem to be an efficient strategy for improving the educational success of low-achieving students because such policies not only preserve the incentive effect induced by repetition but also attenuate the negative consequences of repetition by providing better opportunities to learn the material.====; ====; ====; ====; ====); however, retention in later grades (e.g., the 8th grade) increases the likelihood of high school dropout (====) and even adult crime (====) in the long run. This evidence suggests that test-based promotion policies are not without costs that are in addition to the direct per-pupil fiscal expenditure costs for repeaters and summer school investment costs. Hence, researchers should continue to seek a broader understanding of grade retention practices.====Despite these mixed findings on grade retention, the test-based promotion has become increasingly popular (for a review, see ====). A large body of research has examined the causal effects of test-based promotion on student outcomes in different countries, such as the US (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====, ====; ====), Italy (====), Uruguay (====), and Colombia (====). However, it is less well known whether and to what extent social promotion policies matter for child development. To our knowledge, only two studies have analyzed the effects of social promotion by relying on quasi-experimental methods. Utilizing exogenous variation in the timing of the adoption of social promotion in Brazil, ==== evaluates the effects of abolishing grade retention for the first three grades of primary school in Mexico. In contrast with ====, this paper finds a reduction in dropout rates one year after reform implementation. Further findings indicate that eliminating the threat of grade retention does not affect pupil achievement. All in all, these results are inconclusive; in particular, they focus primarily on students' academic outcomes and are limited to very short periods.====; ====). We show that time-varying treatment effects are unlikely to be a source of bias in our baseline model.====Examining the mechanisms that drive these results, we find evidence that the abolishment of grade retention significantly decreased student effort in the long term. Specifically, we find that students who were exposed to the retention reform tended to spend less study time on weekdays and that the magnitudes of the estimated effects are larger for individuals who were exposed to the reform in earlier grades. In addition, we find considerable heterogeneity in the effects of the retention prohibition policy. More importantly, we show that the negative impacts were stronger for boys and for children with less-educated mothers on both cognitive scores and junior high school completion. From a policy perspective, these heterogeneous effects are important for better understanding social promotion, especially when selecting and implementing interventions to minimize its negative impacts among subgroups of children.====Our study adds to the growing literature on the effect of grade retention or, more broadly, test-based promotion policies. Different from previous studies that have typically focused on test-based promotions¡ªthe effect of switching from non-retention to retention¡ªwe evaluate the treatment effect of social promotion. Although most of the existing studies have documented that mere grade retention interventions do not enhance school performance for low achievers (====), the alternative practice, namely, social promotion, has rarely been investigated. The retention reform in China gives us a rare opportunity to analyze this educational practice and thus develop a more comprehensive understanding of different interventions. Proponents of social promotion hold that the practice helps students develop relationships with their counterparts and reduces dropout behavior that may arise due to stigmatization. Our results indeed show that the reform improved students' mental health status, but it also hurt their educational development. These results provide one example of how automatic promotion policies may damage student achievement.====Our study extends the literature by showing that early-life exposure to social promotion interventions has a long-lasting influence on individuals' academic and nonacademic outcomes. Specifically, we estimate a flexible DID model that allows the impact of the retention prohibition to vary across grade levels. We document that the magnitudes of the estimated results are larger for individuals who were exposed to the reform in earlier grades than for those who were exposed to the reform in later grades, which highlights the importance of the timing of first exposure to retention reform.====Moreover, this is the first study to provide credible causal evidence on the effect of automatic grade promotion on child development in China. Prior to this study, ==== and ==== had analyzed the association between grade retention and student outcomes. Consistent with the majority of the literature, they did not find any significant positive effect of grade retention on the academic performance of the students. In some cases¡ªe.g., for students who repeated grade 2¡ªgrade retention was shown to hurt school performance (====). Although the policies to abolish grade retention have been hotly debated in recent years, and there is abundant anecdotal evidence indicating that such reforms are steadily worsening the quality of student outcomes during the compulsory education period, there has been no systematic investigation of the influence of automatic promotion on student outcomes. In terms of external validity, our results may also have specific policy implications for other developing countries that practice social promotion.",The long-term effects of automatic grade promotion on child development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000827,21-Jun-22,2022,Research Article,132

In our framework, capital misallocation across firms plays a central role. The segmented financial market causes discrimination against private enterprises and favoritism to state-owned firms. This biased financial system not only gives rise to capital misallocation across firms but also significantly pushes down the equilibrium interest rate in the formal financial market. The overly low interest rate in the formal financial market causes a rational bubble in a dynamically efficient economy. More importantly, the bubble improves capital allocation across firms by crowding out inefficient investment in the state-owned sector. Despite the role of improving capital allocation, bubbles may still reduce welfare by crowding out aggregate capital.","Private entrepreneurship used to not exist in China's central planning regime. After the economic reform launched in 1978, considerable entry restrictions imposed on private enterprises gradually expired, but state-owned enterprises (SOEs) still enjoy significant privileges, especially in financial market. Compared to the ¡°shock therapy¡± approach implemented in other former socialist countries, this ¡°dual-track¡± approach smoothed the transitional process and maintained social stability. However, such incomplete reform paves the path to various distortions. In this paper, we argue that this asymmetric or incomplete market reform is the deep-rooted reason for capital misallocation across firms and the existence of a housing bubble.==== (====), an overlapping generation (OLG) structure with rational bubbles ==== (====), and segmented financial markets. The key ingredient in our model is the setup with heterogeneous firms, which help us understand not only how financial friction leads to a rational bubble but also how a bubble raises aggregate efficiency by mitigating capital misallocation.====Asymmetric reform refers to market liberalizations in distinct market with different magnitudes, and this paper looks at a particular form of asymmetry in China: asymmetric liberalizations on product markets and capital markets. Specifically, while most entry barriers to private enterprises have expired, SOEs still dominate formal financial intermediaries and the formal financial market continues discriminating against private firms. Consequently, as state-owned and private enterprises are competing within an integrated product market, the capital market is highly fragmented.====The marginal buyer in a housing bubble is the saver in a formal financial market where a low interest rate prevails. In short, a bubble crowds out household savings that should have flowed to SOEs and formed inefficient investment. Amazingly, the bubble boosts allocation efficiency by crowding out inefficient investments by SOEs. In addition to the efficiency improvement, a bubble also makes income distribution fairer. It redistributes profits from inefficient SOEs to efficient private enterprises and increases interest income of savers with access to the informal financial market at the cost of the declining interest income of savers without access to the informal financial market.====To show the underlying mechanism, we need to compare models characterizing different scenarios. We first construct a benchmark model to represent the economy without any policy distortions, and the resource allocation achieves the first best allocation. In the second model, we introduce the segmented financial market. Theoretically, we show that it generates capital misallocation and an overly low interest rate in the formal financial market. Consequently, it damages aggregate TFP and paves the path to a rational housing bubble. In the third model, we introduce a rational bubble into the second model. We prove that bubble reduces capital misallocation by crowding out overinvestment of SOEs and promotes aggregate productive efficiency and income distribution fairness.====Our theory predicts that financial market segmentation leads to housing bubbles. To elaborate on our argument, we conduct an empirical analysis to show that the housing price growth rate is higher in the city in which the financial market is more significantly segmented. The critical step of empirical analysis is the measurement of financial market segmentation across 35 major cities from 2002 to 2008. To accomplish this task, we measure financial market segmentation by calculating the different capital distortions imposed on both SOEs and private firms across cities based on the key insights from ====. Finally, the empirical regression confirms that financial market segmentation leads to housing price growth.====Our paper fits into the fast-growing body of literature on economic development and resource misallocation under financial frictions.==== Although the bulk of the literature emphasizes the effects of resource reallocation on improving allocative efficiency, we argue that bubble improves the allocative efficiency by crowding out inefficient investment. This paper is closely related to that of ====, which establishes a neoclassical model with financial friction to generate and quantitatively account for the puzzling features of high capital return and high foreign reserves observed in the Chinese economy. Furthermore, ==== build a theoretical model based on ==== to shed light on how a market transition can sustain growing housing bubble and a bubble grows much faster than aggregate income despite a persistently high return on capital. This study is not the first one to demonstrate that bubbles can exist in a dynamically efficient economy with financial frictions, but our main contribution and value added is that we show that a rational bubble can mitigate capital misallocation caused by financial friction. Despite their role in improving capital allocation, bubbles may still reduce welfare by crowding out aggregate capital.==== do a thorough survey.

Further analysis demonstrates some gender differences in the estimated effects of different types of mismatches on labor market outcomes.","Almost a quarter of recent college graduates in China are not working in jobs that are related to their college major (mismatched).==== The relatedness between college major and job represents, to some extent, the employer-worker match quality, which not only reflects the quality of college education, but also reveals the allocative efficiency of the labor market.====In the mismatch literature, researchers have mainly treated mismatched workers as homogeneous (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, individuals are mismatched due to a variety of reasons. For example, some are mismatched because the current job, although not related to college major, fits their personal interests. Such a mismatch may result in a higher employer-worker match quality. By contrast, some individuals are mismatched because their skills are not sufficient, and others are mismatched because jobs in related fields are not available. These mismatches are reflective of a structural mismatch, i.e., the mismatch between the skills possessed by individuals and the skills required by jobs, which is very common and has become the main obstacle for employment among college graduates in China (e.g., ====; ====; ====). To assess the consequences of mismatch, it is important to distinguish between different types of mismatches. A few researchers have documented that mismatches caused by demand-side reasons (such as jobs in related fields being unavailable) are associated with a larger wage decrease compared to mismatches caused by supply-side reasons such as personal interests (====; ====). However, this strand of literature uses data from developed countries, lacking empirical evidence in China. It also focuses primarily on wages, leaving other labor market outcomes largely unexplored. Given the prevalence of job mismatch among college graduates, and the fact that structural mismatch is the main challenge for college graduates' employment in China, it is important to examine the effects of different types of mismatches on a variety of labor market outcomes among Chinese college graduates in order to develop targeted policies for various types of mismatched workers to improve employer-worker match quality.====Using the administrative records and survey data of college graduates from the class of 2019 in a central province of China, this study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence on the effects of different types of mismatches on labor market outcomes among recent Chinese college graduates. Particularly, we make the following contributions. First, according to the ¡°experience good¡± model of job match (====; ====), the employer-worker match quality is revealed after gaining experience on the job. By distinguishing between different types of mismatches based on reasons for mismatch, we are able to capture, to some extent, the multidimensional nature of the employer-worker match quality. Our data include rich information on individuals' education background and a variety of job-related characteristics, especially the main reason for working in jobs that are not related to their college major, which allows us to identify different types of mismatches. Specifically, interest-mismatched workers are those who are interested and employed in a job that is not related to their college major; pay-mismatched workers are those who have better payment opportunities and working environment in jobs that are not related to their college major; demand-mismatched workers are those who are mismatched because jobs in related fields are not available; and skill-mismatched workers are those whose skills are not enough to fulfill the requirement of jobs in related fields.====Second, according to the job match theory (====; ====; ====; ====) to investigate the extent to which our estimates are sensitive to unobserved heterogeneity. Further, the availability of the administrative record of the entire class of 2019 in the province allows us to address the sample selection problem that not every college graduate participated in the survey that is used in this study. Such a problem is often overlooked in related studies due to data limitation.====Results show that although there are statistically significant differences in salaries across different types of mismatched workers, they are not economically significant. More importantly, we demonstrate that interest-mismatched workers have better labor market outcomes than other types of mismatched workers, as well as matched workers, in terms of higher probabilities of getting promoted and receiving OJT. Of all mismatched workers, skill-mismatched and demand-mismatched workers are associated with lower probabilities of job satisfaction, promotion, and job stability. Results from identification strategies reveal some evidence of selection on observed variables and some evidence of sample selection, but our findings remain consistent and most estimates are robust to a potentially relatively large influence of unobserved heterogeneity. Further analysis demonstrates some gender differences in the estimated effects of different types of mismatches on labor market outcomes.====The rest of this study is organized as follows. ==== gives a brief review of related literature. ==== introduces data, sample construction, and variables. ==== outlines estimation strategies. ==== reports estimation results and performs additional analyses. ==== concludes and provides implications.",Reasons for college major-job mismatch and labor market outcomes: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000803,8-Jun-22,2022,Research Article,134

In this paper, we study the short-run effect of capital goods imports on skill premium in China. The surge in capital goods imports, which embody advanced technology, can explain the rising demand for skill in China. We exploit regional variations in capital goods import exposure stemming from initial differences in import structure and instrument for the capital goods import growth using exchange rate movements. A city at the 75th percentile of the distribution of capital goods imports growth has a higher skill premium by 5 percentage points (0.38 standard deviation) over the one at the 25th percentile. To explore the underlying mechanism, we provide firm-level evidence and show that imported capital goods are skill-complementary.","This paper studies the labor market consequences of capital goods imports, an important measure of imported technology (====; ====; ====). While skill-biased technological change has been identified as one of the major driving forces for the rising demand for skills in developed countries (e.g., ====; ====), less is known about its impact on the labor markets in developing countries. For developing countries, technological advances mainly come from the adoption of foreign technologies. In this paper, we show that imported capital goods, which embody advanced technology, increase skill premium in developing countries like China.====Empirically, we exploit city-level variations in skill premium using the Urban Household Survey data and import exposure using the administrative trade record from China's Customs Office. To tackle causality, we use the city-level exchange rate exposure as the ==== for capital goods imports. Because RMB was pegged to USD, a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Euro would cause the RMB/Euro exchange rate to move exogenously. As different cities import from different countries, they are subject to exchange rate shocks to different degrees, which is the source of identification in our empirical work. In the robustness check, we exclude China's imports from the United States and trade partners whose currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollars. Our first-stage regression results demonstrate that exchange rate movements are highly correlated with China's capital goods imports, and they pass the weak instrument tests.====. Using a cross-country sample, ==== show that countries importing more R&D-intensive capital goods have higher skill premium.====Employing firm-level data, we provide direct evidence that imported capital equipment drives up demand for skills. By linking the Annual Survey of Industrial Production (ASIP) data with the administrative record from China's Customs Office, we show that firms importing more capital goods hire more skilled workers, use computers more intensively, pay higher wages, and have higher labor productivity. These findings confirm capital-skill complementarity, as documented in ====, ====, and ====. To further confirm the complementarity between skill and imported capital equipment, we use the employer-employee matched data in 2015 to show that operators of imported machines earn more than domestic machine operators in the same firm. In Hungary, imported machine operators also enjoy wage premium. ==== show that Hungarian workers who operate imported machines earn more than ordinary workers.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== illustrates the empirical model and the identification strategy. ==== introduces the data and documents the data patterns. ==== and ==== present the empirical results. ==== concludes.",China's skill-biased imports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000670,2-Jun-22,2022,Research Article,135

Our identification strategy exploits regional variation in the intensity of the higher education expansion with partially identified difference-in-differences models. We explore various assumptions to account for the potential unparallel trends over years and find that college expansion causally reduces crime rates and the effect changes over time. Moreover, the crime reducing effect extends beyond the post-secondary educational level and into the senior high schools. Our findings document an important yet overlooked positive externality associated with higher education expansion.","Education is one of most important ways to improve human capital and skills that are rewarded in the labor market. The economic literature has generated numerous studies on the private returns to schooling. In addition to improving productivity, education also provides other important positive externalities to the society, such as health enhancement and crime reduction. The economic literature has recently provided interesting causal evidence on how education helps to reduce criminal activity in various countries and different settings. So far, most of the studies have focused on mandatory schooling or compulsory schooling and its impact on crime for youths. Evidence on how expansion policy on higher education affects crime is still sparse with the exception of ====.==== Still little is known on how the expansion of higher education empirically affects criminal activity not only for youth but also for the general population. We intend to fill this gap by providing new evidence on how expansion of university/college education causally affects the incidence of criminal offences among the general population in China.====Since 1999, China has undergone massive expansion and reforms in higher education (HE), resulting in an unprecedented surge in college enrollment throughout the country. The year 1999 witnessed 1.59 million university-admitted students, which is more than 47% from the previous year. The freshmen enrollment of higher education institutions reached 9.15 million in 2019 according to official statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Education. The higher education expansion initiated in 1999 is not only large in magnitude but also unexpected by the population as well as local governments, therefore, it serves as an excellent natural experiment to estimate causal relationship between higher education and crime.====In the economic literature, scholars have primarily focused on the impact of China's higher education expansion on educational outcomes such as schooling, returns to education, labor market outcomes as well as marriage and fertility decisions for college students (====; ====; ====; ====). Better education opportunities clearly influence the person who takes advantage of it, but there are external benefits or costs beyond ==== returns to higher education expansion in China. At the micro level, research reveals that college enrollment expansion has a positive externality and raises the average college wage premium in the Chinese labor market (see, for example, ====). A handful of fairly recent studies have provided evidence on the impact of education expansion on firm's innovation and emissions behaviors (====; ====; ====). There are also a number of studies documenting the importance of Chinese higher education reforms at the macro level, such as its effects on productivity, global economy, and so forth (====; ====). Little attention has been paid, however, to the questions of whether and how crime has been affected by the higher education expansion in China.====In this paper, we would like to answer the question: whether the large-scale higher education expansion in China has causally impacted crimes in the country, and if so, how large is such impact and what are the dynamics of it over time? Our empirical strategy exploits exogenous variation in the intensity of HE expansion across provinces and over time. We first estimate a classical DID model and compare provincial crime rates between provinces that experience a higher intensity of higher education expansion and provinces that experience a relatively low level of higher education expansion. We then move away from the traditional parallel trends assumption and perform a partial identification DID analysis under alternative plausible settings. We thus can provide upper and lower bounds for the ==== under different pre-trend assumptions. We consistently find that the higher education expansion in China significantly reduces the crime rates across provinces regardless of the assumed pre-trend pattern. Furthermore, we show that the higher education expansion starts to demonstrate significant deterring effects on crime after 4 or 5?years of its implementation, and the effects prolong for more than a decade. The negative dynamic effects are quite robust across alternative treatment intensity measures, model specifications, and other contemporary events such as crime-fighting policies. Given the sequential nature of higher education, we also document large expansion on senior high school enrolment and show its negative causal effects on crime. Interestingly, the deterring effects from senior high school enrolment expansion are immediate after the implementation of higher education expansion policy, providing indirect evidence on incapacitation effect on crime.====The focus of our paper is on studying the aggregate impact of a national level higher education expansion reform in China. We are interested in estimating the effects of this policy on aggregate level of criminal activities in the country. To best take advantage of the policy treatment intensity variation across provinces in China, our empirical analysis is based on a variety of data sources at provincial level. For example, the crime rate is derived from China Law Yearbook (1989¨C2013), and Procurator Yearbook of China (1989¨C2013). The intensity of higher education expansion is calculated with China Statistical Yearbook (1989), and Educational Statistics Yearbook of China (1989¨C2012). Other important demographic information is drawn from various sources with details presented in the data section.====Theoretically, there are two streams of research on education and crime. The parameters of interests differ depending on the purpose of the studies in this field. First, the existing literature on causal effects of education on crime highlights four main channels through which education might affect criminal activity: productivity and human capital effects (====; ====), incapacitation effects (====; ====; ====), patience or risk aversion (==== Secondly, the other stream of research focuses on education policy itself and tries to identify causal effects of relevant policy changes on crime. For example, ==== studies the effects of minimum high school dropout age on juvenile arrest rates in the U.S. In particular, the author utilizes a Difference-in-Differences design to compare crime rates between counties with higher or lower state's minimum dropout ages, he then documents significant and negative causal effects of minimum dropout age requirements on arrest rates for young individuals between ages of 16 and 18. Another study that targets the impact of educational policy reforms on crime can be found in a recent paper by ====, in which the authors study how school dropout age policy reforms affect crime in the U.S. over time by looking at all state level school dropout age reforms happened between 1980 and 2010.==== Our study belongs to the second stream of the research and contributes to the effects of educational policies on crime literature.====Given the quantitative negative effects identified by our paper, it is natural to think about potential channels/mechanisms behind the effects just as most of the literature have done. However, due to the lack of matched individual level data (preferably a long panel to capture long-term effects of education) on both age and crime categories, we cannot perform an in-depth analysis on disentangling the various channels through which this massive educational expansion policy change affects variously detailed criminal activities differently. Instead, our results are based on general crime rates defined over the entire age distribution and including all types of criminal activity that result in arrestment. We believe that the overall effects of the large-scale educational policy such as the one we study in this paper warrants an interesting and important causal empirical analysis on the aggregate level, although we have to live with the costs of not being able to disentangle the channels (which will be for sure in our future research agenda on this topic).====This study makes the following important contributions to the empirical educational policy evaluation literature on crime in economics. First, our study is among the first that establish causal effects of national educational expansion program at college level on criminal activity for all age groups. Utilizing post compulsory school expansion reforms as identification conditions is not new in the literature. For example, ==== rely on the UK post-compulsory education expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990 to estimate crime reduction effects of schooling. ==== and ==== provides evidence on causal effects of high school dropout age requirements by focusing on mandatory schooling age young adults in the U.S. Similarly, ==== also focus on mandatory school leaving age laws that are specifically designed for lower than college educational levels. Other selected studies that utilize the educational reforms to estimate impact of education on crime for youths include but not limited to ==== and ====. Both papers look at teachers strikes (at mandatory schooling level) and calendar year changes to estimate the effects of changes in the required day school day attendance on crime. The identified parameters of interest are how individual education decision affects crime. Second, we provide the first empirical evidence on causal impacts of higher education expansion on crime in the Chinese context. To our knowledge, the closest study to ours in the Chinese context is ====. Although ==== utilize the same educational expansion reform in China (as we do in this paper) as an instrument to estimate effects of level of education on crime, which is not the same parameter of interest as ours.====More importantly, our identification strategy extends the traditional differences-in-differences framework and is based on relaxed parallel assumptions which provides quantitative bounds on the causal relationship between the educational expansion reform and crime. In particular, we show in the first step, the classical DID estimates on the effects of the higher educational expansion in China. We then provide further evidence on the bounds of these causal effects by assuming weaker parallel trends assumptions made on the control and treated groups (provinces) following ====. This approach allows for differential trends in outcomes for the more treated and less treated groups which is highly relevant to our setting. We are the first to adopt the ====¡¯s approach to evaluate effects of educational law changes on crime rates. We believe that this approach can be also adopted for other contexts with unbalanced policy treatment intensities, because it relies on less restrictive DID assumptions.====We believe that this paper provides new causal evidence on higher level education reform and its impact on crime to the economic policy evaluation literature by utilizing a new methodology that has been overlooked by the literature of education policy and crime.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In ====, we provide the institutional background of the Chinese higher education reforms in the late 1990s and briefly discuss the potential effects of education expansion on crime. ==== introduces the data used and ==== discusses some important issues in higher education expansion. ==== formally lays out the identification strategy. Empirical results are discussed in detail in ====. ==== offers further discussions of the results.

Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we find evidence that adults with left-behind experience in early life have fewer schooling years, lower cognitive test scores, a lower Big Five personality traits index, but a higher internal locus of control. Meanwhile, they are more likely to report underweight, chronic diseases, depression, and lower levels of perceived health and happiness. Our findings of the negative consequences on personality traits and health outcomes are robust to a battery of specification and validity tests. These effects also differ markedly by adults' gender, birth cohort, ","The last four decades have witnessed an unprecedented internal (rural-to-urban and urban-to-urban) migration as an important part of the urbanization and economic development in China. The institutional constraints caused by China's household registration (====) system, which is often associated with the receipt of local public resources, services, and opportunities (====; ====), have resulted in millions of rural and urban children being left at home while their parents move away for work.==== There has been substantial evidence on the contemporaneous effects of parental migration on the human capital outcomes of left-behind children (LBC) with mixed results (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral), such as educational achievement (====; ====; ====), cognitive and noncognitive skills (====; ====; ====), nutrition and physical health (====; ====; ====), and psychological well-being (====; ====; ====).====Nevertheless, empirical research investigating the long-term and cumulative impacts of childhood left-behind experience (LBE) remains limited (====; ====). This gap in the literature is particularly relevant because rapidly growing evidence from the literature has shown the crucial links between early-life experiences and a range of developmental outcomes later in life (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====This paper represents the first effort to comprehensively identify the long-run human capital consequences of early-life LBE in China. To do so, we combined the unique retrospective measures of early-life exposure to paternal and maternal absence during 0¨C3 and 4¨C12?years of age in the baseline survey of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to develop an overall childhood LBE variable and further categorized LBE by type, timing, and duration. We then proceeded to examine the impacts of early-life LBE on an array of adulthood human capital outcomes, including educational attainment, cognitive and noncognitive skills, and physical and mental health.==== Heterogeneous effects by gender, cohort, and ====Our results suggested that childhood LBE predicted a number of adverse human capital outcomes in adulthood. Specifically, it was inversely associated with schooling years, cognitive test scores, and the Big Five personality traits index in adulthood. In comparison to their non-left-behind peers, LBC were also more likely to report underweight, chronic diseases, depression, lower levels of happiness, and poorer overall health when they became adults. Notably, childhood LBE predicted better internal locus of control later in life, which could be the result of greater adaptability and resilience developed during parent-child separation. Our validity tests showed that, among the human capital consequences, the impacts of childhood LBE on adulthood personality traits and health outcomes were robust. The heterogeneity analyses showed that, for most human capital outcomes, the detrimental effects were more pronounced among adults who were female, born in or after1990, or had a rural ====. Additionally, adulthood human capital accumulation had stronger relationships with a childhood experience of being left behind by both parents or by mother only, during later childhood (4¨C12?years of age), and for longer years.====In terms of the intergenerational effects, we found that LBC's offspring had poorer physical health¡ªsuch as lower birth weight and height-for-age z-score (HAZ)¡ªand lower noncognitive skills. Our channel exploration indicated that LBC spent more time on housework and taking care of children when they became parents. As a result, their offspring were shown to be less likely to become LBC and have more parent-child interactions. However, adults with childhood LBE were more likely to have spouses with lower levels of educational attainment, live in economically disadvantaged households, and make less investment in their offspring's education. As such, we argued that, in addition to potential genetic inheritance of human capital, the low adulthood socioeconomic status associated with childhood LBE was another important pathway linking the early-life exposure to parental absence to intergenerational persistence of human capital.====Our study contributes to the literature in the following aspects. First, as most literature focuses on the contemporaneous effects, there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the long-term impacts of parental migration on LBC's human capital development. Given that human capital is formed in not only an accumulative manner but also a crucial determinant of socioeconomic status later in life, a modest contemporaneous influence on skills development of early-life exposure to parental migration may result in significant consequences in adulthood (====). In addition, an emerging body of research on the economics of human development suggests that cognitive abilities, noncognitive skills, and health are of equal importance in explaining socioeconomic outcomes (====; ====; ====). As such, we extended the literature by examining the long-term effects of childhood LBE on multiple dimensions of adulthood human capital outcomes, especially noncognitive skills and health performance.====Second, rural LBC have been the primary focus of existing studies, overlooking the well-being of numerous LBC in urban areas (====). Therefore, our estimations of the long-lasting effects of early-life LBE were then followed by a group comparison between rural and urban ==== status. Additionally, our heterogeneity analyses explored gender and birth cohort differences, as well as the impacts of distinct LBE types, timings, and durations. These efforts made our results more in-depth than in previous literature.====Third, evidence has demonstrated that changes triggered by positive or adverse shocks during the prenatal period or childhood can be passed on to the next generation (====), thereby indicating that the effects of early-life events can be profound and long-lasting. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to explore whether and through what mechanisms the offspring of adults with childhood LBE may have lower levels of human capital performance.

At the same time, Chinese cities also underwent great urban spatial expansions in the last two decades. Numerous papers have investigated such urban expansions (====; ====; ====; ====). We employ a novel measure of network connectedness proposed by ==== to characterize spatialfeatures of the housing market within a city, using data from two systematically important Chinese cities, Shanghai and Guangzhou.====To characterize mechanisms of housing shock propagation and spatial characteristics of housing price discovery within a city, we conceptualize that urban housing market is composed of many submarkets.==== This viewpoint arises naturally because real estate is probably one of the most heterogeneous consumption and investment goods. The literature diverges on the origination and measurement of housing market segmentation. In this paper, we focus on two dimensions of segmentation, namely spatial location and housing quality. In terms of empirical characterization of spatial location, we define housing market segments by municipal districts. Many papers in the literature use similar categorizations, e.g., by zip code or suburbs. In terms of housing quality, we distinguish between new sales and resales. These choices are constrained by the nature of our data.====Two lines of theoretical inquiries lend support to the segmentation view of urban housing market. We understand spatial segmentation of housing markets through models of urban spatial growth, e.g., ====, ====, and ====, ====. Such models characterize the role of the housing market in urban spatial expansion. The distinction between urban fringe and built-up areas in a city corresponds closely to the notion of spatial segmentation. The simplest version of urban spatial growth, e.g., ====, posits that new supply occurs at the urban fringe, while existing housing stock in the urbanized areas is perfectly durable. In a more general model, e.g., ==== and ====, new supplies can happen anywhere in the city in the form redevelopment or new land conversion. New supplies appear in vintages as buildings go through cycles of redevelopment. It is therefore interesting to see whether the new supplies at the urban periphery or the new supplies from redevelopments at the city center drive the price discovery process in a growing city. Specifically, we analyze how price shocks propagate from district to district.==== In this sense, our findings put restrictions on models of dynamic urban spatial structure.====In terms of segmentation by quality, the filtering model of the housing market (e.g., ====; ====) provides the theoretical basis. This theory posits that the housing market is composed of distinct segments with different quality levels. New housing supply typically occurs at the top of the quality ladder. As houses age, they gradually filter down along the quality ladder. In general, demand and supply shocks in any segment can spill over to other segments through complex interactions and feedbacks.==== In this paper, we use new sales to proxy for one quality segment and resales to represent another quality segment. Specifically, we investigate whether new sales drive price formation in the housing market as predicted by the standard filtering model. Moreover, we describe the spatial characteristics of these relationships. Chinese cities offer a good testing ground for models of urban spatial growth and filtering models. The two cities under study, Shanghai and Guangzhou, underwent dramatic growth in the last decade. The resident population in Shanghai and Guangzhou grew from 18.58?million and 10.05?million in 2007 to 24.90?million and 18.70?million in 2020. Such fast growth enables the identification of driving forces behind urban expansion and its interaction with the housing market using relatively recent data. Moreover, resale markets in these two cities developed and matured as new housing supplies continuously appeared with urban expansions. The lead-lag relationship between the two sectors informs us about the applicability of the filtering model to Chinese cities.====To characterize the lead-lag relationships discussed previously, we apply the network connectedness measure proposed by ====. Again, dimension reduction in LASSO is primarily driven by the data, not by ex-ante restrictions imposed by the researcher. We believe these empirical methods can be applied to other research whenever network or spatial connections are important.====), loss aversion (e.g., ====), and search-and-matching frictions (e.g., ====; ====). We contribute to this literature by adding the spatial and quality dimensions. We can distinguish among districts within a city the leaders and followers in trading volume shocks. We can also attribute price fluctuations in one district to shocks in trading volume in other districts.====Following the literature on inter-city spillovers of housing shocks (====; ====; ====), we consider the aggregate within-city network connectedness of ==== as a measure of contagion risk in urban housing market. This connectedness measure quantifies the aggregate extent of price spillover across housing submarkets. Specifically, we create a time-varying aggregate index of market connectedness to describe the risk profile of the two cities over time. In addition, the insights we obtain on the detailed spillover effects across districts and sectors can help policy makers and private investors devise strategies to control contagion risks. For example, policy makers can choose evidence-based interventions in new sale versus resale markets, price control versus quantity control, etc. Private investors, on the other hand, can devise strategies to control portfolio risk.====We find that the overall intra-city connectedness in the new sale market declined substantially when the government stepped up a campaign against the overheated ====. The opposite seemed to be true for the resale market. In terms of spatial diffusion of shocks, price shocks predominantly transmit from core central areas to outside central and fringe areas for new sale market in Shanghai. The above pattern is still valid in Guangzhou, for both new sale and resale market. In terms of inter-sector spillovers, we observe that shocks usually run from new sale to resale market for Guangzhou as whole. However, this pattern does not hold at the area level for all submarkets, e.g., price shocks are likely transmit from resale to new sale within central areas. Finally, we find that trading volume likely leads price return in both cities with some exceptions. Our empirical evidence is robust with respect to the VAR lag length, the addition of control variables, and prediction horizons.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Parental investments are an important mechanism through which the early learning environment can be enriched (====; ====) and skill development can be fostered (====).====; ====). According to a rich literature in psychology, ==== (LOC) orientation is a key driver of the nature of an individual's subjective expectations (====).====The concept of LOC was introduced to personality psychology by ==== as a measure of the generalized expectancies of the control of reinforcement. The ==== (versus an ====) of LOC is defined as the degree to which persons expect that a reinforcement, or an outcome of their behavior, is contingent on their own behavior or personal characteristics versus the degree to which persons expect that the reinforcement or outcome is a function of chance, luck, or fate, is under the control of powerful others, or is simply unpredictable. (====, p. 489).====The relationship between a person's LOC orientation and his or her own human capital outcomes are long established (====; ====).====). For example, a large-scale cohort study in the United Kingdom provided evidence of a strong association between a more internal LOC orientation of the mother and improved ==== (ECD) outcomes of her offspring, which include positive personal and social outcomes (====), better child language skills (====), fewer behavioral difficulties (====), and higher IQ scores (====). Studies in developed countries also have shown that the positive relationship between LOC internality and better ECD outcomes can be explained by the higher level of intergenerational human capital investments of caregivers with a more internal orientation. More internally oriented caregivers are, in general, willing to invest more of their current resources in the developmental opportunities of their children in expectation of higher future returns on investment as compared with caregivers with a more external orientation (====; ====; ====; ====).====In this study, we seek to refine this argument. Specifically, we seek to show that ==== (PLOC) drives parental investment and child development. This study defines PLOC as a measure of the extent to which parents believe that their child's future skill development is either a matter of luck or fate (====) or the result of individual parenting practices (====). The psychological concept of PLOC overlaps somewhat with the economic concept of subjective expectations of returns on parental investment (====; ====; ====). Therefore, we seek to test whether PLOC is associated with either the parenting knowledge of caregivers or the subjective beliefs of caregivers toward engagement in positive parenting practices during early childhood. We further seek to empirically measure how PLOC orientation is linked to intergenerational investment decisions and ECD outcomes (====; ====).====Although the global evidence base that links parenting-specific PLOC orientation and parental subjective expectations with parental investment decisions and ECD outcomes is expanding, evidence from developing countries is scarce. The research of ==== is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate the relationship between subjective beliefs of caregivers about the returns on parental investment and ECD outcomes in the context of a developing country (i.e., Colombia, ====?=?1200). All of the other studies that we reviewed were, without exception, conducted in the United States (K. D. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) or in Western Europe (====; ====; ====; ====). Further, most earlier studies had sample sizes of fewer than 200 participants.==== Hence, our study's first contribution is to add to the literature through the collection of data on a sample of 995 children under age 3 and their primary caregivers in a developing region in rural Western China to assess the PLOC orientation of caregivers and its implications for children's human capital development.====A second contribution of this study is that it relates PLOC orientation to a comprehensive range of ECD outcomes. Earlier studies also documented associations between internality/externality and ECD outcomes; in particular, the internality of caregivers has been linked to better MacArthur-Bates language scores (====), better IQ test results (====), and fewer behavioral difficulties (====). ==== report a causal link between a change in PLOC orientation and child externalizing behavior as well as coping strategies. Each one of these studies assessed at least one developmental domain during early childhood, but none measured children's cognitive, non-cognitive, and physical development during one specific stage of childhood. In this study, we investigate relationships between PLOC and a comprehensive range of ECD outcomes, based on a rich data set, with measures of child cognitive, non-cognitive, and physical development assessed with more than 15 scales of five different measurement instruments. By using a comprehensive set of ECD indicators, we identify specific areas in which the effects of parental beliefs manifest themselves early in the life cycle of children.====A third contribution is our comparison of differences in the role of the PLOC orientation for parental investment decisions and ECD outcomes across parent and grandparent caregivers. In many developing countries, a large share of grandparents act as primary caregivers for their grandchildren for a number of reasons, including parental migration for work (====). Approximately 30% of infants/toddlers in less developed regions of rural China are raised by their grandparents (====). In the case of most types of positive parenting investments (e.g., playing with toys, reading picture books), grandparent caregivers have been found to invest less time and fewer resources than do parent caregivers (====; ====). Low caregiver engagement in interactive caregiver-child activities has been identified as one of the main causes of poor ECD outcomes (====; ====). A systematic review reported that approximately 45%, 46%, and 36% of the children under age 5 in disadvantaged areas of rural China are delayed in their cognitive, language, and social-emotional development, respectively (====). The disadvantage of being raised by a less engaged grandparent caregiver has been linked to an 8.2 percentage-point increase in the risk of early cognitive delay (====). Because earlier research established that elderly people are, on average, more externally oriented than are younger people (====; ====),==== this study aims to assess whether grandparent caregivers have, on average, a more external PLOC orientation than do parent caregivers. Further, we test whether differences in PLOC scores across parent and grandparent caregivers can explain differences in caregiver-child interactions and ECD outcomes of children.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The sample selection, data collection, ethical review, and ==== framework are described in Section 2. The results are presented in Section 3, and Section 4 concludes.====We administered a range of standardized survey instruments to assess parent and child outcomes. The parent outcomes described in Section A.1 include measures of PLOC orientation (i.e., ==== (PLOC) short form; ====); parenting knowledge (==== (KIDI-P) questionnaire; ====); caregivers' subjective beliefs toward the time spent with children (well-being module of the ==== (ATUS); ====); and intergenerational investment in the family care environment (==== (FCI) survey; ====; ====). For measurement of ECD outcomes (see Section A.2), we administered five different survey instruments: a. the third edition of the ==== (Bayley-III; ====); b. the ==== (ASQ-3; ====); c. the ==== (ASQ:SE; ====); d. the ==== (CREDI; ====); and e. the ==== (IBQ-R; ====) for children under age 1 and the ==== (ECBQ; ====) for children ages 1 up to 3.

As the country with the largest manufacturing production and thus the highest level of carbon emissions, China's carbon reduction efforts not only affect Chinese citizens but also concern the future of the entire human race. Facing such an urgent situation while aiming to maintain its forceful economic growth, China has claimed ambitious targets to reach the highest emission level by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.====In this paper, we explore whether policies combating road congestion, such as driving restriction policies, can also reduce carbon emissions. To quantify the effect of driving restriction policies on carbon emissions, our research is conducted in two steps. In the first step, we take advantage of the high-frequency and fine-scale (road-section-level) traffic data collected by the Didi Chuxing Technology Company, a leading Chinese vehicle-for-hire company, to investigate the impact of driving restrictions on traffic speeds in the city of Xi'an in March and April of 2018. As the largest city in northwestern China, Xi'an imposed driving restrictions on major areas of the city for almost 11?months in 2018, but lifted restrictions between March 16 and April 15. We exploit these policy variations in March and April, and employ a ==== (RDD) to identify the causal effect of driving restrictions on vehicle cruising speeds. We find that the pooled average speed increase on weekdays is 6¨C9%, while during peak hours it can rise as high as 15¨C20% under the driving restrictions.====In the second step, we quantify the reduction in carbon emissions using a back-of-the-envelope calculation through fuel savings based on the estimates above, because observational data on carbon dioxide, unlike data on other air pollutants, were not recorded during the years in which Chinese cities initiated their driving restriction policies. Conditional on the assumptions to be detailed in ====, our calculations show that the reduction in carbon emissions from private vehicles due to driving restrictions ranges from 17.2¨C20.8% under different conditions (assuming 15% of reduction of total number of vehicles), where around 2.2¨C5.8% of the carbon emissions were reduced by higher traffic speeds.====To the best of our knowledge, our paper marks the first attempt to quantify carbon emission reductions generated by driving restrictions, especially focusing on the channel of traffic speed increases. Existing literature on traffic congestion has mostly focused on its negative impact on air quality (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and social efficiency loss (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), as well as the development of public transportation to alleviate congestion (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== estimate that an 11% increase in traffic speeds due to road pricing leads to an annual welfare gain of 1.5 billion CNY from reduced congestion and revenue of 10.5 billion CNY. In a similar vein, ==== find that the expansion of subways can increase social welfare by reducing urban pollution as well as mortality levels.====On the other hand, driving restrictions have been a popular policy tool in many major cities in the world, but the design purpose and academic interests have mainly addressed reduction in air pollutants, and residents' traveling behavior changes. For example, ==== show a 21% reduction in air pollution and a potential reduction in the discretionary labor supply under the one-day-per-week driving restrictions in Beijing. ====We also contribute to the literature by providing new empirical evidence of the effect of driving restriction policies on traffic speeds. The lack of traffic speed measures usually makes it hard to quantify the effects of driving restriction policies (====; ====). In this paper, we overcome this hurdle and provide quantitative estimates by taking advantage of the high frequency data on traffic speed obtained from Didi. In addition, the range and quality of the data set enables us to obtain empirical results through a quasi-experimental policy change, which further strengthens the validity and reliability of our findings.====The remainder of the article is structured as follows. We first provide more details about the city of Xi'an and its driving restriction policy in ====. Then ==== lays out the data that we rely on, before we turn to the RDD specifications in ====. In ====, we exhibit and discuss our results and then provide the back-of-the-envelope calculations on carbon emissions in ====.

Merging nationwide data from two different sources, we construct the city index of cultural diversity and explain the entrepreneurial behavior of "," To solve the employment problem of rural-to-urban migrants, the Chinese government has introduced relevant policies to support migrant workers in setting up businesses since 2015.==== Supporting the entrepreneurship of migrant workers not only mitigates the employment problem of migrant laborers but also creates more employment opportunities, optimizes resource allocation, and improves economic efficiency. In China, the total number of rural-to-urban migrant workers is approximately 290 million, 39.39% of whom have started their own businesses.====Individual behavior is affected by deep-seated cultural factors, as is innovative behavior. ==== demonstrates that cultures affect innovation by influencing individual cognition, ideas and behavior. ==== argue that cultural factors play decisive and crucial roles in innovation. Cultural factors, such as ways of thinking, behavioral norms and values, affect individual entrepreneurial behavior (====; ====). Culture not only reflects individuals' worldviews and values but also affects individuals' behavior and guides individuals to develop trading strategies in a complex environment (====). Therefore, culture plays an important role in explaining the entrepreneurial behavior of migrant workers.====Cultural diversity is on the rise in urban areas, as the populations of cities move more frequently. Although a growing body of literature analyzes the effect of culture on entrepreneurship in China (====), the effect of urban cultural diversity on the entrepreneurship activities of migrant workers remains largely unexplored. Cultural diversity is an important aspect of the way cultures affect the entrepreneurship activities of migrant workers. However, there is no conclusion in the literature about whether diversity affects economic activities positively or negatively. For example, ==== shows that a high level of ethnolinguistic diversity implies a lower level of investment. ==== show that ethnolinguistic fractionalization has a direct negative effect on economic growth. On the other hand, ==== suggest that there is a net positive effect of cultural diversity on the productivity of natives in equilibrium as people and firms are mobile across cities in the long run. ==== find that culture and ethno-linguistic diversity are independently positively associated with national innovation. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to address the following questions. First, how are the entrepreneurship activities of migrant workers affected by urban cultural diversity? Second, are there heterogeneous effects on different groups of migrant workers and different regions? Third, what is the potential mechanism for the effect of urban cultural diversity on migrant workers' entrepreneurship activities? Ethnic diversity and large quantities of rural-to-urban laborers in China provide an opportunity to research the effect of urban cultural diversity on migrant workers who start their own businesses. On the one hand, China is experiencing the largest migration wave in the world. The China Statistical Yearbook 2019 shows that the number of rural laborers who migrated to work in urban areas reached approximately 290 million. On the other hand, China has a vast territory and significant cultural differences across regions. Rural migration represents changes not only in geographical locations but also in cultural environments.====We merge the dataset of the China Migrants Dynamic Survey 2017 (CMDS 2017) with the dataset of the Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects to study the effect of cultural diversity on the entrepreneurship activities of migrant workers. CMDS 2017 contains personal information on all migrant workers across all provinces in China, including ID number, employment status, job category, place of residence, hometown, medical service accessibility, and fertility status. The Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects is composed of 42 different local Chinese dialects. Individual dictionaries cover dialects spread across the dialect groups identified in the Language Atlas of China. Following the literature (====; ====; ==== Using the Great Dictionary of Modern Chinese Dialects allows us to identify the percentage of the population using each dialect in a city and measure the dialect diversity in the city.====We use both linear probability and discrete regression models with ==== (IV) to examine the effect of urban cultural diversity on the entrepreneurship activities of migrant workers. The IV estimates indicate that urban cultural diversity increases the probability that migrant workers will be entrepreneurs, and the effect is larger for those who are necessity entrepreneurs. The theory of dynamic capability suggests that there are significant differences between individuals in terms of the formation of dynamic capabilities in perceiving, grasping and transforming, which leads to different levels of migrant workers' utilization of resources generated from cultural diversity. Therefore, we investigate the heterogeneity of the effect of urban cultural diversity at the micro level. The results show that compared with intra-provincial migrant workers, urban cultural diversity has a more significant effect on interprovincial migrant workers. In addition, we investigate regional heterogeneity according to the province location, as the economies, cultures and policies in different provinces vary greatly. The results show that the effect of urban cultural diversity on migrant workers who work in the eastern region and highly developed cities is significantly larger than the effect on workers in other locations. We further analyze possible mechanisms of the effect of urban cultural diversity by employing a mediation analysis. We find that innovation resource accessibility and social inclusion explain the increase in the entrepreneurship of migrant workers brought by urban cultural diversity.====Our paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, there is a growing literature that explores different factors that contribute to the success of migrant workers who start their own businesses (====; ====; ====The paper is organized as follows.

It suggests that the ¡°Internet population¡± is a better proxy of actual city population.

It indicates that the public resource distortions will continue to exist or even worsen off in China if the allocation process relies greatly on traditional population statistics. Although no measures are perfect, our new population measure provides important incremental information for future discussion.","Geographic population agglomeration promotes economic efficiency and facilitates resource allocation (====; ====). Many studies have emphasized that urbanization is one of the major driving forces for China's economic growth and production efficiency improvement (====; ====; ====; ====). In this paper, we obtain the Location Based Service (LBS) data of the largest social media company in China to construct a better complementary proxy for population distribution. The LBS data is superior in locating users' residence, avoiding the omission or misstatement problem of migrants during the manual record process of the census.====Previous literature has consistently shown that population distribution of cities in the United States and many other countries fit Zipf's law, which states that city size distribution is well approximated by a Pareto distribution with coefficient 1 ====; ====, ====; ====). Previous studies also prove that if all cities exhibit the same expected growth rates and encounter idiosyncratic shocks, the city size distribution will converge to Zipf ¡®s law in the steady state (====, ====). However, many studies find that the Chinese urban scale distribution largely fail to validate Zipf's law. Violating Zipf's Law is often regarded as evidence that Chinese population distribution deviates from steady state, which harms economic efficiency (====; ====).====It's worth noting that earlier studies against Zipf's law mainly rely on traditional population statistics. However, previous studies often find it difficult to obtain high-quality measures of population distribution. For example, the census data of the United States is often criticized for its omission of immigration statistics (====; ====; ====). This problem is extremely severe in China during the mass urbanization process in past 40?years. We have observed evidence that official population statistics published by the National Bureau of Statistics, hereinafter called ¡°the NBS population statistics¡±, mismeasures the actual population number in many cities.====An interesting example emerges during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. In a press conference after the outbreak, the Wuhan Municipal Government announced that 5 million people have left the city before the lockdown and 9 million residents were still in the city. However, according to the NBS population statistics, the total amount of resident population of Wuhan is 11 million, which implies a gap of 3 million people, or nearly 30% of the total population.====Shenzhen is another interesting example. In the past 40?years, Shenzhen grows from small villages into a mega city, but its population size remains a mystery. According to the NBS population statistics, the?total amount of Shenzhen's permanent residents in 2017 is 12.5 million. However, according to Shenzhen Municipal Social Security Bureau, the number of residents insured by social medical insurance is about 14 million. Furthermore, according to the China Mobile Data Center, the estimated population based on the number of mobile phone users is about 22 million in 2017, which almost doubles the population published by the NBS.====Wuhan and Shenzhen are typical epitomes of the difficulties in estimating the geographic population distribution in China. Numerous studies suggest three major defects that hurt the accuracy of NBS population statistics based on census data. First, the NBS statistics are prone to underestimate the floating population.==== Migrants that often change their places of residence are much more likely to be missed by the census than local residents. In addition, landlords are unwilling to report the residence information of their renters, in order to hide rent income. Similarly, employers also tend to under-report migrant employees to save social security expenditure. As a result, large cities that attract a large crowd of migrants are prone to underestimate their population size (====; ====; ====).====Third, population census is conducted only every ten years. During the ten?years in between, 1% population sampling is conducted every five years and 1¡ë population sampling is conducted every year. In non-census years, the statistical error could be very significant due to small sample problems.====). The inconsistency is obvious and significant. However, due to data limitations, these errors are very difficult to be corrected based on traditional data resources.====In this paper, we use mobile internet big data to construct an ¡°Internet population¡± indicator to reduce biases in the traditional demographic statistics and to reestimate Chinese urban structure. This is made possible by the Location Based Service (LBS) data of the larggest social media platform in China. The LBS data is aggregated to the city level and does not contain any individual user's privacy information. The mobile penetration rate of the social media platform reaches 96.4% among Chinese mobile Internet users by March 2020. Excluding users that are younger than 15 or elder than 64?years old, our data sample is almost the total sample of Chinese working-age population. The location based service (LBS) data is able to capture the accurate location of users' residence, avoiding the omission or misstatement of migrants during the manual record process of the census.====Based on the ¡°Internet population¡± measurement, we have three main findings. First, the ¡°Internet population¡± indicator has much better explanatory power for inelastic household consumption behaviors, such as water and electricity consumption and urban garbage disposal, than the NBS population statistics. In particular, ¡°Internet population¡± explains 71.4% of variations of water consumption, which is about 50% higher than the explanatory power of NBS population statistics. These findings imply that ¡°Internet population¡± is a better measure for actual population distribution in the sense of higher correlation with basic household consumption.====Second, contrary to previous studies based on the NBS population statistics, the ¡°Internet population¡± distribution fits well into the Zipf's Law with a ==== of 90.7%. Further analysis shows that this is because the NBS statistics underestimate the population of large cities while overestimate the population of small cities. Compared with the NBS population statistics, the agglomeration of ¡°Internet population¡± in large cities significantly increases.====Third, using the ¡°Internet population¡± indicator, we find that the size of floating population is significantly underestimated in previous studies. The total floating population from the official census data is 224 million. In comparison, the total floating population calculated from the ¡°Internet population¡± is about 336 million, which is about 50% higher from the NBS population statistics. The extra 112 million floating population is mostly crowded in large cities.====This paper pioneers the empirical study of Chinese urban structure by utilizing a new data source of mobile internet to reduce statistical biases of official demographic data and providing novel evidence of Chinese population distribution. This paper makes three main contributions.==== and ==== prove the feasibility of using nighttime lighting data instead of GDP data. ====Second, using Location-Based-Service data of mobile internet users, this paper reduces statistical biases of the NBS population statistics and contributes to the estimation of population distribution, especially floating population. We find that the floating population in China is heavily underestimated by offical statistics. And we also find that ¡°Internet population¡± is superior to the NBS population statistics in explaining inelastic household consumption variables such as water, electricity and garbage disposal, which implies that ¡°Internet population¡± is a better description of actual population distribution in China.====Finally, this paper finds novel empirical evidence of Chinese population distribution. Contrary to previous studies based on the NBS population statistics, the ¡°Internet population¡± distribution fits well into the Zipf's Law with a R==== of 90.7%. This means that the basic economic forces play a more fundamental role in population mobility, despite multiple obstacles that hinder free migration. These results have important policy implication. The NBS population statistics systematically overestimate population in small cities and underestimate population in large cities. However, the allocation of public resources is largely relied on the flawed statistics, which will lead to spatial distortion of public resource distribution and severe social welfare loss.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces data and the construction methodology of ¡°Internet population¡±. ==== reports the data quality tests.

We also assess the impact of in- and out-group biases on cooperative behaviors by surveying attitudes of both in- and out-group nations and measuring the correlation of these to behavior. Finally, we conduct our experiments with a single iteration of play with participants only being informed of their counterpart's country of residence.

Three results concern behavior unconditional of whether the interaction is intra- or international. First, American participants exhibit higher proportions of cooperative behavior than Chinese ones, though only marginally so when controlling for multiple factors. Second, females exhibit higher rates of cooperation. This is particularly significant in regression results in which we control for other potential factors. Third, the expected cooperation rate of one's counterpart is a significant factor affecting cooperation. The marginal effect is twice as strong for Chinese participants as it is for American ones. Finally, regarding cooperation across countries, in- and out-group attitudes are important in international cooperation. Higher in-group attitudes and lower out-group attitudes both diminish international cooperation.====The Prisoner's Dilemma Game is a commonly used instrument which is well suited to analytically and empirically investigate cooperative tendencies.

Based on economic operation, public opinion, public health, government policies and population inflow in the affected areas, this study measures daily economic resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak in 286 prefecture-level cities in China (from 1==== January to 8","In addition to the grave consequences for human health, a public health emergency of international concern invariably influences economic systems. In early 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic swept the world with unprecedented speed, intensity, breadth, and the trend of globalisation contributed to its rapid spread around the planet. Historically, the international market mechanism supported economic growth, improved people's well-being, and increased the world's ability to withstand exceptional and unexpected events. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it failed to provide the timely relief that countries hoped for, thereby slowing down many governments in their desperate attempts to fight the spread of the virus. In addition, many countries responded to the event without adequate anticipatory preparation, and the initial outbreak¡ªin which when many countries faced the overwhelmed medical resources and the breakdown in market mechanisms¡ªleft many governments uncertain about how to respond. This limited the ability of many countries to make strategic choices in the early stages. Even with COVID-19's low mortality rate, its outbreak resulted in anxiety about the threats of diseases, panic, immediate life and health effects, far-reaching social and political implications, local economic damage, and global economic turmoil. However, pandemics can also cause adverse changes in the environment in which the affected economies operate, leading to significant economic impacts (====).====China quickly took a series of lockdown measures to minimise the spread of COVID-19. Wuhan implemented a city-lockdown measurement on 23rd January 2020, to prohibit unnecessary travel to and from Wuhan. Subsequently, most prefecture-level cities in China gradually implemented measures such as locking down the city, reducing road traffic, and activating first-level public health emergency response to curb the pandemic spread. Although these measures effectively slowed down the spread of COVID-19, the lockdown measures and quarantine status changed China's economic environment in terms of not only the decline in total social retail demand, investment slowdown, ==== (CPI) fluctuations, and shrinking imports and exports, but also the corporate financing environment (monetary policy) and the taxation environments (fiscal policy), which increased the pressure on China's economic development and affected its economic resilience.====Resilience refers to how quickly a system recovers from a shock (====). Economic resilience means the ability to achieve rapid recovery from external shocks and the to reallocate resources, adjust the industrial structure, and continuously transform and upgrade after experiencing economic shocks (====; ====; ====). Each crisis and shock have its specific characteristics and given the disparitiesin scale and duration, the impact on regional economies and regional resilience vary (====). For example, with the constant impact of various crises (economic crises, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks) worldwide, some areas remain vulnerable, while others can recover quickly. Different regions are heterogeneous in their ability to withstand and recover from shocks; that is, the economic resilience of different areas varies. In China, Wuhan was the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the distance from each city to Wuhan, the size of population flows, the economic base, the support of national policies, and other factors contribute to the differences in the economic resilience of each city. Studying the COVID-19 pandemic and China's economic resilience contributes to rethinking the responses of individual cities and local governments, their support strategies, and the regional layout of industrial structures in reaction to sudden public health events and pandemic crises.====; ====), economic uncertainty (====), and predicting the economic and social impacts of the pandemic through models (====). Studies on pandemics and resilience have mainly focused on the public health or social domains (====; ====), and relatively few on economic resilience. Existing studies have mostly looked into this relationship from perspectives such as social governance (====), information technology (====), stock and financial markets (====), and tourism markets (====The pandemic has made short-term economic stabilisation more difficult. However, the delayed anticipation of global destructive events such as the spread of COVID-19 and the collapse of the market mechanisms for the provision of vital anti-disease goods has left many nations unsure of how to respond, thereby limiting their ability to make strategic choices. Accordingly, our study first constructs an evaluation indicator system that considers five aspects, namely, economic performance, public opinion, public health, policy support, and population mobility during the study period, and calculates the economic resilience of each Chinese prefecture-level city using the subjective-objective weighting method and technique for ==== by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model. Then, using geographic information science, we spatially visualise a city's economic resilience and the number of confirmed cases throughout the study period and analyse the spatial distribution of economic resilience and the pandemic using spatial standard deviation ellipses (SDE). Finally, we re-examine the impact of the pandemic on China's economic resilience using a panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model and highlight the pressures experienced during this era as well as potential future policy implications. We found that, despite the lockdown measurement may sacrifice the economy during pandemics, they were effective in halting a widespread and sustained outbreak of COVID-19, and played a significant role in preventing the deterioration of economic resilience. Much of the support enabled many cities to achieve a great deal of economic resilience. The Chinese economy is resilient, but if the economiy heals in the future, the risk of infection may increase .====Our study may contribute to the rapidly growing literature on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and economic resilience. Studying the spatiotemporal evolution of pandemics can disclose the outcomes of interactions between humans, infectious illness, and the environment, as well as aid in the ==== of public health and the construction of possible prevention methods. China's ¡®lockdown¡¯ policy has been partially discussed in the world, and our study also provides a visual description of the relationship between China's ¡®lockdown¡¯ policy and economic recovery. Examining the relationship between pandemic shocks and economic resilience at the city scale will allow cities to better prepare for and recover from future public health emergencies. The measure of economic resilience in this study provides a more intuitive picture of the ability of Chinese cities to recover from pandemic shock and serves as a methodological and conceptual example for similar studies. This study can help future studies to predict or determine how to respond to future black swan incidents more appropriately.====This paper is structured as follows. The introduction presents the background, ideas, and a brief overview of the findings. A overview of the current literature on pandemics, resilience, and economic resilience follows Section 2. The data and methodology are presented in Section 3, followed by an analysis and comparison of the results of the geographical visualisation of the pandemic and economic resilience in Section 4.

We hypothesize that family with strong lineage¡ªproxied by owning genealogy¡ªhas a negative effect on women's income through the son-targeting fertility behavior. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, this study confirms the hypothesis. Relative to the women whose first child is a son, the women marring into families owning genealogy indeed have more children and lower income, if their first child is a daughter. In contrast, such finding does not hold for the male sample. Preliminary evidence suggests that shorter work time can explain the findings.","Over the past century, women's rising economic status has accompanied the dwindling of traditional family institution such as patrilineal family institution (====). However, little is known about the following questions: Do patrilineal family institutions contribute toward lowering women's economic status and maintaining their low status? If so, what driving mechanism underlies this? This study aims to answer these questions by investigating how family lineage (====)¡ªa typical patrilineal family system in China¡ªthrough fertility behavior, can influence women's income.====Since ancient times, family lineage or family clan (====) has been associated with a strong son preference (====; ====). Giving birth multiple times increases the chance of having at least one son (====). Meanwhile, the negative relationship between fertility and women's income is well documented (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Therefore, I hypothesize that, family with strong lineage can negatively affect women's income, through the channel of fertility behavior. This study tests this hypothesis by using empirical evidence from China.====The intuition of the hypothesis is as follows. Son preference is deeply rooted in Chinese families. The pressure of continuing the family bloodline makes parents highly desirous of producing at least one son. However, the strict fertility restrictions of the one-child policy have ensured that such families have lower chances of achieving this goal. Therefore, some families resort to giving excessive births, which is costly under the one-child policy. In this case, such son-targeting stopping rule of fertility decisions increases the ==== of families whose first child is a daughter. Hence, there is a difference in fertility rate between the families whose first child is a daughter (henceforth, first-daughter families) and those whose first child is a son (henceforth, first-son families). This difference in fertility rate would be larger among families with a strong son preference. As mentioned previously, family lineage is characterized by a strong son preference. Therefore, the first hypothesis of this study is that women marrying into family with strong lineage have more children if their first child is a daughter. Moreover, building on the well-documented socioeconomic phenomenon of motherhood penalty, the second hypothesis of this study is that women marrying into family with strong lineage have lower income if their first child is a daughter.====I examine these hypotheses using a difference-in-differences strategy. Using data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies (a large-scale nationally representative survey), I explore how family lineage can influence the fertility and income of women whose first child is a daughter, while the women whose first child is a son are employed as the control group. Consistent with previous studies (====; ====, ====; ====; ====), this study uses genealogy as a proxy for family lineage.====To test both the hypotheses, I focus on the coefficient of the interaction term estimated by the difference-in-differences model. The baseline estimation results are in favor of the hypotheses. In particular, among women whose first child is a daughter, marrying into a family with genealogy is associated with an increase in the number of produced children by 0.117, relative to the first-son mothers. Moreover, among women whose first child is a daughter, marrying into a family with genealogy is associated with a 39.3% decrease in annual income, relative to the first-son mothers. These results suggest that, compared to first-son mothers, among first-daughter mothers, family lineage has a significantly negative effect on their income as it increases their number of births. Moreover, this negative effect of family lineage on income is absent for fathers.====I explore several mechanisms that may account for why higher fertility leads to women's lower income in this study. Four possible channels¡ªlabor participation, work time, family responsibilities, and human capital investments¡ªare examined with the same regression model as in the baseline estimation. Exploratory evidence suggests that, in the context of this study, shorter work time can explain the findings.====This study mainly contributes to three strands of the literature. First, this study broadens literature regarding family institutions¡ªparticularly patriarchal norms¡ªthat account for women's low socioeconomic status in developing countries. Numerous studies provide evidence that equal inheritance rights have an impact on women's educational attainments, health, and gender bias (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). A series of studies show that kinship structure (matrilineal or patrilineal) plays an essential role in shaping female outcomes, such as competition preference, risk attitude, and political participation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Dowry, which is a traditional marital transfer mechanism rooted in patrilineal culture, is shown to play an important role in intrahousehold bargaining and women's well-being (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This study contributes to this strand of research by providing a novel explanation of how family lineage affects women's income; furthermore, it presents a clear identification of the fertility-related channel.==== provides causal evidence showing that traditional agricultural practice, such as using the plough, has persistent influences on the gender norms and beliefs today. It is one of the fundamental papers on this topic from the perspective of historical development. ==== is the first paper in this literature exploiting the Chinese context. As another important work on the origins of gender inequality, it shows that cotton textile production in imperial China permanently changes the sex ratio at birth and beliefs about women and increases women's socio-economic status. Besides, ==== test the hypothesis that societies with long agriculture histories have less gender equality by showing a significant negative relationship between years of agriculture and female labor force participation in European regions. ==== shows the long-term influence of medieval commerce on the contemporary gender education gap in Italy. ==== investigates the economic origins of restrictions on women's sexuality by providing evidence of pastoralism and female genital cutting. In this study, family lineage¡ªa traditional patrilineal family system in China¡ªis shown to lead to gender inequality in economic status.====The current study is also closely related to that of ==== in that both papers show how cultural and social factors influence women's economic outcomes. ==== explore how traditional fertility norm influences fertility behavior and women's economic status. In particular, they find that local fertility norm positively affects the number of births and sex ratio, and negatively impacts women's schooling year, employment, and income. The current paper has consistent findings with ====. However, the empirical strategies and focus of the two studies are different. Using an indicator of local fertility norm, ==== focus on the belief of continuing the family line, while the source of this fertility norm is not discussed. Using owning genealogy as a proxy for family lineage, the current study employs a difference-in-differences empirical strategy that hinges on the gender of the first child. Moreover, the current paper focuses on patrilineality¡ªthe family institution behind the fertility norm in China¡ªand directly links it to son-targeting fertility behavior and women's labor market outcomes. In other words, this study extends the scope of ==== by discussing family lineage, which could account for the origin of the fertility norm. Besides, this study shows that shorter work time could explain first-daughter mothers' lower income and that such loss of income tends to be transient when the child is young. In this sense, this study provides supplementary evidence for this strand of literature.====Third, this study adds to a growing body of literature on the influences of family lineage in China. ==== shows that clan culture is associated with arrangements for old-age support, including co-residence with sons, financial transfers from non-coresident children, and barriers in availing social pension programs. ==== finds that clans account for a higher share of the economy in the private sector in China. ==== show that Confucian clan, which works as risk-sharing institutions, contributes to the population rise in pre-industrial China.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the background of this study, including family lineage, genealogy, and the one-child policy. ==== introduces the identification strategy and data. ==== presents the baseline estimation results and robustness checks. ==== explores potential mechanisms and other outcomes. ==== concludes the paper.","Patrilineality, fertility, and women's income: Evidence from family lineage in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000633,13-May-22,2022,Research Article,145

As of December 2020, the number of Chinese internet users reached 989 million, and the internet penetration rate was 70.4%.==== The internet has increasingly penetrated and changed people's lives. In particular, the integration of food, clothing, housing, transportation, financial management, medical and environmental protection, and other fields with the internet has deepened. Considerable studies have explored the internet's effects on unemployment (====), wages (====), labor productivity (====), economic growth (====; ====), political elections (====; ====), etc. However, few studies consider the causal relationship between internet popularization and enterprise technological innovation. Understanding this causal effect holds great significance for building an innovative country.====By matching patent data from the IncoPat Global Patent Database with the Wind database of listed companies and incorporating local broadband internet data from the Annual Report on China's Communications Statistics, this paper employs the first-difference method to explore the relationship between broadband internet and enterprise innovation. To alleviate the ====, we use the change in telecom market concentration caused by the North¨CSouth separation reform of China Telecom in 2002 as an instrumental variable. The instrumental variable model suggests that in general, a 1% increase in broadband internet access results in a 1.395% increase in the number of corporate patents. Specifically, the number of valid patents, patent citations and valid patent citations reflecting patent quality increases by 1.499%, 0.920% and 0.763%, respectively. After testing the robustness of the model specification, changing the measurement of the dependent variables, screening the samples, adjusting the year of the first-difference model, adopting the counting model, and further considering the exogeneity of the instrumental variable, the empirical results remain robust. The mechanistic analysis shows that broadband internet access contributes to increasing the number of R&D personnel and personal innovation efficiency, enhancing enterprises' willingness to innovate, and easing financing constraints. Further analysis suggests that broadband internet access mainly promotes invention patents rather than design patents and that the innovation effect is more obvious among high-tech enterprises, inventor-intensive companies, state-owned enterprises, and enterprises located in the non-southeastern coastal region of China.====Compared with existing research, this article makes the following contributions.

Using firm-level accounting data and matched transaction-level trade data, the paper documents that firms responded to the inception of a new labor contract law as accepted by the National People's Congress of China in mid-2007 not only by adjusting their labor demand but also in terms of other adjustments: they raised the capital intensity of production and increased the quality of their output. The paper provides evidence that such changes and adjustments were particularly strong for firms in ex ante labor-intensive sectors and for private firms which were less shielded from adverse competitive effects than state-owned ones.",", ====, ====, ====, ====). Hence, EPL implicitly raises the costs of labor as a factor of production, in particular, the adjustment costs for that factor, and it might depress employment at any moment of time. Much of the discussion on the consequences of EPL is focused on the direct effects on labor markets rather than other economic outcomes.====In this paper, we focus on the effects of the announcement of a new EPL and its subsequent inception on exporting firms in China.====While the success of other large exporting countries such as the United States, Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom is mainly ascribed to their comparative advantage in the production of capital-, innovation-, and advertisement-intensive, differentiated products, China's success, at least at the time between 2000 and 2010, was largely ascribed to its comparative advantage in producing labor-intensive, low-cost, relatively homogeneous products. Clearly, for a country with this kind of comparative advantage any form of EPL should be expected to have first-order effects on the behavior of firms engaged in exports. Analyzing this type of response is at the heart of the present paper's interest.====. Second, in order to stay competitive in the global market, Chinese exporters apparently had to raise the quality of their products. Doing the latter helped them to not only defend their export-market success but even become more successful abroad than at home, in response to the increase in labor costs and the capital-intensity of production. These findings are obtained from using panel data on export transactions of Chinese firms as well as information on their other characteristics based on source data from Chinese Customs and the National Bureau of Statistics.====We show that core aspects of the aforementioned findings can be rationalized well in a stylized model, where monopolistic (or monopolistically competitive) firms choose labor and capital optimally for production and, at the same time, the (costly) level of quality of their output to attract larger consumer demand. Four ingredients are needed to make the case in favor of the observed findings: (i) firms need capital as well as labor for production, and these factors are substitutes; (ii) the EPL raises labor costs while leaving capital costs more or less unaffected; (iii) the consumer valuation of quality is not excessive; (iv) firms have an incentive to invest in the quality of their products, with the returns on this investment being diminishing with higher quality.====The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. The next section outlines the background of the EPL in China and provides an overview of earlier theoretical and empirical research relating to the consequences of EPL for factor substitution. ==== introduces the data and variables used in the analysis of the paper. ==== describes the estimation approach and presents the main results. ==== presents a stylized model to rationalize the findings obtained in ====. ==== presents some robustness checks and extensions. The last section concludes with a summary of the main findings. An appendix provides further results which we suppress in the main text for the sake of brevity.====We follow ==== to construct exchange rates at the 2-digit CSIC sector-level.====We first combine the CSIC classification with the HS commodity definitions to generate exact export and import values across markets at the 2-digit CSIC sector-level. Specifically, we use concordance tables between the ISIC Rev.?3 and HS 1992 classifications as published by the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database, and the concordance tables between ISIC Rev.?3 and CSIC 2002 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics China (NBSC) to establish a link between the HS 1992 and 2-digit CSIC identifiers. We converted different versions of the 2-digit CSIC classification into CSIC 2002 based on conversion tables from NBSC.====Then, we combine China's 2-digit CSIC sector-country-level trade shares with yearly exchange rate data. The exchange rate between a trading partner and China is retrieved from the International Monetary Fzund's (IMF's) International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. An exchange rate with the Chinese yuan is quoted as the price of any foreign currency in terms of Chinese yuan. Accordingly, an increase in the exchange rate means a depreciation of Chinese yuan against the currency of a respective trading partner.====While using annual industry-country trade shares to construct exchange rates can precisely measure changes in the competitive environment in each year, it may create an endogeneity issue. A random shock to a factor that primarily impacts trade can simultaneously affect some of our main outcome variables. As a consequence, the regression residuals may be a function of some omitted factors that co-determine contemporaneous trade weights. To overcome this problem, we use fixed (time-invariant) trade shares to define the sector-specific exchange rate. Specifically, we employ the beginning of the sample period's trade shares as the weights. Therefore, the sector-specific exchange rate is calculated as follows:====where ====, which denotes the share of sector ===='s import values (====) and export values (====) with country ==== in all of its trade values in the year 2000. ==== is the exchange rate between country ==== and China in year ====.====In general, we will use the log of the latter, which we denote by ====?=?ln(====).

While many of these public health measures are effective in suppressing the spread of Covid-19 (e.g., ====), they can also bring significant social and economic costs and disruptions (====; ====).====In this paper, we explore the feasibility of imposing travel restrictions on specific origin and destination pairs and examine the optimal designs of such policies. In addition to being less restrictive and therefore more cost-effective than lockdowns of entire cities, route-specific travel restrictions can still be implemented even when complete lockdowns are not (e.g., when the unit under consideration is a major metropolitan area or an entire country). Even in scenarios when route-specific travel restrictions are not possible, our identified targeted travel restrictions, once integrated with advanced mobile technology and specific public health measures,====; ====). These data can also guide border checks and surveillance (====).====To characterize which route-specific travel restrictions are more effective, we consider a standard model of network interactions. Various studies have highlighted that features of networks can be used to enhance the effectiveness of policy interventions that intend to influence agents' behavior (e.g., ====; ====). ==== characterize the key node in a network whose removal has the largest impact on the aggregate outcome. We determine the key link between two nodes, whose removal results in the largest reduction in the aggregate outcome, and show that this can be characterized as a product of the centrality of the origin, the centrality of the destination, and the link intensity. Therefore, an optimal travel restriction policy should take into account the travel intensity of a route, and also the risk of the origin and the risk that the destination can bring to other cities. Our results are applicable in network interaction models where agents' outcomes or actions depend on those of the peers (e.g., ====; ====), and a planner can alter the strength of network links. Other potential applications include determining key collaboration relationships in the network of firms (====), and strengthening connections in networks to support interventions on suicide and alcohol use disorders (====).====Building on the literature examining key links in network interactions, our theoretical analysis further accommodates features such as contextual effects and ex-ante heterogeneity between units, which are motivated by our empirical analysis on key population flow routes in the spread of Covid-19 in China. A city may import infections from other cities that have infections due to population inflows. In addition, the city can be affected by exposure to the risk factors in other cities connected through population flows (====) and cities have different levels of initial infections before population flows spread the disease (====). Building on the key player analysis of ====, ==== provide theoretical results on the contributions of specific network links to the aggregate activities. Units are assumed ex-ante homogeneous in their analysis. ==== is a recent paper that comprehensively studies the design of interventions targeting characteristics of network nodes and intensities of network links.==== Unlike directed networks studied in this paper, ==== examine undirected networks which can be more challenging as the network symmetry imposes restrictions on feasible modifications of network links. Based on a network model of product adoptions, ==== examine key nodes and links. We complement ==== and ==== by considering contextual effects.====Applying the theoretical model to the data on the spread of Covid-19 in China between January and February 2020, we first show that intercity population flows intensify spatial virus spreading. Based on the estimated parameters, we identify the routes in the population flow networks most influential on the total number of Covid-19 cases in China and thus the top candidates where additional public health measures prove necessary. The top routes consist of those closely connected to areas with severe infections and those whose destinations are cities with large population outflows. Accounting for such ==== saliently alters our perceptions of travel restriction policies. These results can be generalized to guide our responses to other communicable diseases with human-to-human transmission.====We add to the literature on the spatial spread of diseases (====) by considering the design of policies that affect the rate of spillovers. Our paper also contributes to the growing literature on the optimal designs of various aspects of the public health measures in response to Covid-19. A number of studies embed a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model (====) in an optimal control problem, such as lockdowns of certain sections of the population (====; ====; ====), testing and quarantine (====), along with coordinated and uncoordinated shelter-in-place orders (====), initiatives that help students cope with distance learning (====), etc. ==== examine optimal restrictions on directional commuting flows, integrating a spatial epidemiology model with a quantitative model of commuting, production, and equilibrium across locations. Their focus is on commuting flows within a metropolitan area, where population flows in the form of commuting affect disease spread and production. We identify the key parameters using a causal inference model, in comparison to the literature, which is dominated by epidemiology models. Our model is more concise and applicable on a larger geographic scale, such as the spread of diseases across many cities or countries.====The paper is organized as follows. ==== describes a network interaction model and provides measures that identify the key network links. In ====, we illustrate the use of the model in determining key population flow routes using the Covid-19 data in China. ==== presents conclusions.

Intervention policies represented by "," (also known as caloric sweeteners (CS),==== hereinafter referred to as sugar) intake level of residents. SSB is a sugar-sweetened food with sugar as the main component and includes regular carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), fruit and vegetable (F?+?V) drinks, sports and energy drinks, ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee and tea, and Asian specialty drinks. Compared with other solid sugar-sweetened foods with equivalent nutrients, SSBs are more likely to cause excessive sugar intake because they provide less satiety (====; ====). Similar to nicotine and alcohol, eating sugar stimulates pathways in the brain that are associated with pleasure, which fosters addiction and consumption dependence (====). Many studies have shown that as a high-energy food, long-term excessive intake of sugar can cause energy imbalances in the body, which will lead to obesity (====; ====), and further induces type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (====; ====).====Many studies have discussed the effect of taxation on the consumption of SSBs and have generally shown that taxation has exerted a positive impact on the consumption of SSBs. Most research focused on developed or high sugar consumption countries such as the United States (====), Chile (====), the United Kingdom (====), Germany (====), Mexico (====; ====), and South Africa (====), have shown that consumption tax on SSBs can effectively reduce the consumption of SSBs. Few studies claim that the implementation effect of taxation is not ideal (e.g., ====), one of the main reason being that the tax rate setting does not incorporate the price elasticity of the taxed product (====; ====).====At present, most studies on consumption tax on SSBs are carried out in countries with higher consumption levels of SSBs. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on emerging markets in China. As a country with a relatively low consumption level of SSBs but a rapid growth rate, China has different SSB consumption structures compared to the United States and other nations with high levels of SSB consumption (====). In addition, there is a lack of relevant research on the heterogeneity of different socioeconomic groups. ==== show that the heterogeneity analysis is helpful in judging whether the consumption tax on SSBs is well-targeted, which is conducive to a more in-depth and comprehensive assessment of the validity of the tax.====The changes in the consumption of SSBs and their main substitutes, sugar-free beverages (including water and the low-calorie categories of beverages that use non-caloric sweeteners instead of sugar as the main ingredient; for convenience, this paper refers to them collectively as diet drinks), is the main indicator in evaluating the effect of the implementation of consumption tax on SSBs (====). The actual impact of taxation in reducing the consumption of SSBs is undoubtedly one of the key points of policy evaluation (====). As the main potential substitutes, changes in diet drinks' consumption will also help evaluate the effect of taxation on SSBs (====). From a public health perspective, although the relationship between diet and health is still controversial (====; ====), it is generally assumed that sugar-free products with low calories are healthier than their corresponding sugar-sweetened foods. Hence, if the policy goal is to prevent obesity, under the situation that there is an obvious substitution relationship between SSBs and diet drinks, taxation on SSBs to promote the consumption of diet drinks may be a better choice (====; ====). However, existing studies have different conclusions about the substitution relationship between SSBs and diet drinks (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The significance of the substitution effect between SSBs and diet drinks is determined by contextual factors such as price elasticity (====; ====).====Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of SSB taxes on Chinese beverages (with sugar and sugar-free) consumption in order to judge whether SSB taxes will significantly change the beverage consumption structure in China and promote the shift of beverage consumption in a low-calorie direction. Estimating price elasticity based on demand models is a common way to measure the potential impact of price intervention policies on the consumption of specific groups (====). Based on a large sample of microdata on the consumption of RTD beverages for Chinese urban households, we first used the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model to estimate the Marshallian (uncompensated) price elasticities of various beverages. On this basis, a simulation of the effect of the consumption tax on SSBs on the consumption of various beverages was conducted.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

With the worsening environmental pollution, such as air pollution (====; ====), water pollution (====; ====), and soil pollution (====; ====),==== environmental disputes have increased at a rate of more than 30% per year since 2005 in China (====). However, some features in the trial of environmental cases lead to low efficiencies of environmental justice, such as unprofessional judges, difficulty in determining causality, and difficulty in providing evidence in environmental disputes (====).====Environmental courts have been regarded as an effective way to improve environmental justice efficiency and alleviate the conflict between environmental protection and sustainable economic growth (====; ====; ====). Considering that firms are often blamed as the primary source of pollution (====), it is crucial to study the impact of environmental courts on corporate green innovations. As an essential driver of green transformations, extensive discussions have been conducted on corporate green innovations (====; ====; ====; ====), but little is known about the relationship between the intensive judicial oversight brought about by environmental courts and corporate green innovations.====To fill this gap, this paper attempts to explore the impact of intensive judicial oversight on corporate green innovations by regarding the establishment of environmental courts in China as a quasi-natural experiment. The first environmental court was established by the People's Court of Qingzhen city in Guizhou Province on November 20, 2007. More than 100 environmental courts have been established in 20 provinces and municipalities by the end of 2014 (====). On July 3, 2014, the Supreme People's Court of China officially declared establishing a particular environmental court. Thus, we construct our sample based on Chinese listed firms from 2004 to 2014 to alleviate this confounding effect. To explore the real effect of environmental courts on corporate green innovations, we mainly employ a multi-period difference-in-differences strategy, which compares the before-and-after variations in green innovations of firms located in regions with or without environmental courts.====; ====; ====), we find that environmental courts have a positively significant impact on corporate green innovations. It shows that establishing environmental courts is a long-term judicial oversight mechanism, which is conducive to corporate green innovations and pollution control.====, the interaction of each city's river length and national industrial chemical oxygen demand; (2) ====Identifying the potential mechanisms is crucial for this paper. First, environmental courts can improve the efficiency of regional environmental justice. Second, establishing environmental courts is conducive to weakening the collaboration between local government and local firms. Under the increasing pressure for pollution abatement caused by intensive judicial oversight, firms may conduct more green innovations to avoid possible environmental litigation risks. Besides, we further conduct a complete cost-benefit analysis on environmental courts, and find that environmental courts could bring additional costs to firms, such as crowding out non-green innovations and reducing corporate TFP in the short term. However, the establishment of environmental courts could also achieve specific social welfare effects, such as improving local ====.====We contribute to the current literature in three aspects. First, we extend the research on the impact of law and corporate activities. Most of the existing research focuses on the law about intellectual property protection (====; ====; ====) and patent infringement litigation (====; ====; ====), but studies based on environmental justice is relatively rare. In recent years, some studies try to explore the real effect of environmental courts. ==== take environmental courts in China as a quasi-natural experiment and find that environmental courts significantly enhance corporate environmental investment. ==== employ the establishment of environmental courts in intermediate people's courts in China as an exogenous shock, and find the environmental court has effectively reduced the total and per capita emissions of industrial pollutants. This paper is different from ==== and ==== about the real impact of environmental courts. (1) The main topic of the study is different. ==== and ==== focus on the impact of environmental courts on corporate environmental investment and emissions of industrial pollutants, respectively. In our paper, we mainly emphasize the relationship between environmental court and the quantity and quality of corporate green innovations. We find the different impacts about the effect of environmental courts on the quantity and quality of corporate green innovations. (2) ==== and ==== have not clearly resolved endogeneity issues related to the establishment of environmental courts.

We construct prefecture-level export shocks, by exploiting variations in national cross-industry export changes and cross-prefecture industrial employment. Empirical results suggest that prefectures experiencing larger export shocks are more likely to have higher intergenerational education mobility. The baseline results stand when we use alternative measures for educational outcomes, consider the migration situations, or include more controls. Using the ==== framework proposed by Becker et al. (2018), we explain and empirically test how income effect and substitution effect of export expansions influence education mobility. The mechanism testing suggests that the income effect is the dominant force underlying the results.","; ====; ====; ====). Literature has found that education is associated with higher income levels, improved health outcomes and extended lifespans, which are important aspects of welfare (====; ====). Additionally, education mobility is closely related to equal opportunities in society.====China has witnessed a decreasing trend in intergenerational education mobility since late 1990s (====). Plenty of factors could contribute to this trend, including economic reform, rocketing price of tertiary education, unequal access to educational institutions and urban-rural divide in China.====Having observed the positive export shock and decreasing trend of intergenerational education mobility, we might wonder whether the export shock is another driving factor (or a suppressant) for the reduced education mobility. In this study, we examine empirically how the export boom of China affects the local intergenerational education mobility, and explore the mechanism of the impact. In particular, we focus on export expansion from 2000 to 2007, as China has gone through a tripling of exports from $360 billion to $1380 billion during this time period.====; ====; ====). This coefficient is mostly positive, and a larger coefficient indicates greater intergenerational education dependence, and therefore less intergenerational education mobility.====Our baseline results suggest that prefectures exposed to stronger export shocks tend to experience higher intergenerational education mobility, i.e. lower intergenerational education dependence. In particular,a one-standard-deviation increase in export shock would decrease intergenerational education dependence by 0.056?years. To further relieve endogeneity concerns, we perform a battery of robustness checks, including using alternative measures for education attainment, using different instruments, considering situations where parents work outside home and controlling for prefecture-level confounders. In all senarios, the baseline results still stand, suggesting a robust mobility-promoting effect of export expansions on intergenerational education mobility.====To explore the mechanism behind the mobility-promoting effect, we first propose a conceptual framework based on ====. Then we test the mechanism using subsamples and income data. Combining the theory and empirical evidence, we summarize the mechanism as follow. According to Heckscher-Ohlin theory, as export expansion brings more job opportunities to China, prefectures endowed with more low-skill workers (henceforth, low-education prefecture) would specialize in low-skill-intensive industries, while prefectures endowed with more high-skill workers (henceforth, high-education prefecture) would specialize in high-skill-intensive industries. In low-education prefectures, the export shocks are relatively mild, and bring low-skill-intensive job opportunities to the local industry. This increases the income of low-skill workers only, so that children from low-skill families are funded by export shocks for more education. As educational attainment increases in children from low-skill families increase while remaining the same for children from high-skill families, intergenerational education mobility improves in the low-education prefectures. This channel is called an income effect, as export shocks shift the education mobility by relaxing the financial constraint of some families. In high-education prefectures, the export shocks are relatively strong, and bring high-skill-intensive job opportunities to the local industry. This stimulates an income rise for all workers, although bigger rise for high-skill workers than low-skill workers. As low-skill families are more financially constrained, the education outcomes of children from low-skill families are more responsive to income changes than that of children from high-skill families. Thus the observed increment in educational attainment is bigger for children from low-skill families than children from high-skill families, improving intergenerational education mobility improves as well in the high-education prefectures.====In theory, in addition to the income effect, export shock could affect education mobility through another channel, called substitution effect. Specifically, the income rise due to export shock export is unbalanced across high-skill workers and low-skill workers, causing a rise or drop in the returns to education of the economy. The returns to education is a key factor for the weights between further education and working at young age. The intergenerational mobility framework by ==== implies that education choice of children from high-skill families are more sensitive to changes in returns to education. Hence export shock could affect education mobility through tweaking the returns to education in the economy. However, our empirical evidence implies that this substitution effect is dominated by the income effect.",Export expansion and intergenerational education mobility: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000554,15 April 2022,2022,Research Article,151

This paper seeks to provide a novel explanation for heterogeneous food waste behaviors across age cohorts from the perspective of differing famine experiences. Based on 2004¨C2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, this paper constructs a difference-in-difference estimator to explore the long-term effects of the early-life famine experience of the household head on household food waste behavior in later life. The results indicate that the more serious famine that the household head experienced in early life was, the less wasted food and lost calories per capita there were, especially for adolescence during the famine. The mechanism analysis shows that households whose heads experienced the 1959¨C1961 Great Famine in early life tend to save more than those whose head did not. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the formation of preference and the variation in household food waste behaviors across age cohorts.","Studies of experienced utilities reveal that consumers' choices often involve experiences they have already had (====; ====). One possible explanation is that life experiences of extreme events can shape preferences and can have long-term effects on individual behaviors. Individuals who experience extreme events may change their perceptions of the likelihood of a future extreme event and become more cautious in their behaviors due to risk perception bias and confirmation bias through memory (====; ====; ====). In particular, an extreme event experienced in childhood can have a profound influence on the formation of individuals' beliefs and preferences as well as on their behavioral choices in adulthood (====).====Food loss and waste are increasingly becoming a global problem and exacerbate the long-standing challenges of food security. Nearly 690 million people are hungry, and 821 million people are undernourished. In sharp contrast to this, approximately one-third of the world's food is wasted, causing an economic loss of approximately one trillion dollars a year (====). In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could undermine sustainable food systems, implying that zero hunger (one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals) may not be on track to be achieved by 2030 (====).====Food waste at the household level is one of the largest contributors to total food loss and waste in both developed and developing countries. While household food waste in rich countries has leveled off, the increased food waste in low- and middle-income countries accounts for most of the growth in food waste that has occurred in the past three decades (====; ====; ====).====The heterogeneity of food waste is highly related to consumers' age cohorts (====; ====). Empirical evidence shows that elderly people (persons aged 60 and above) are the least likely to discard food (====; ====; ====). The question of why consumers' food waste behavior differs so much across age cohorts is of interest because it relates directly to adequate food policies. Does food waste behavior differ between the young and elderly generations? Do people in some age cohorts waste food in an ¡°as if¡± irrational way? If so, what accounts for this heterogeneity in food waste behavior? A better understanding of individuals' food consumption-waste motives will contribute to identifying the heterogeneity of food waste behaviors across age cohorts. One major aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue.====Differences in food waste behavior across age cohorts may arise from early-life experiences. In the context of China, the 1959©\1961 Great Famine provides a quasi-natural experimental setting in which to explain this heterogeneous food waste behavior. Early-life famine experiences may create two psychological states. One is the compensatory psychology for loss. Individuals who experienced food scarcity in early life may seek compensation in later life, leading to belly worship and the search for high-quality food, which may involve more food waste in later life (====; ====; ====). The other is irrational preventive psychological motivation (====; ====). Individuals who experienced the famine in childhood were deeply impressed by the scarcity of food, which may have induced ¡°fear¡± memories of hunger (====). These ¡°fear¡± memories brought about by the famine may have encouraged these famine victims to form frugal consumption habits and reduce potential food waste in later life. As the severity of the 1959©\1961 Great Famine across regions is arguably orthogonal to later economic shocks (such as trends of food consumption) that may affect food waste, the 1959¨C1961 Great Famine provides a compelling natural experiment to identify the heterogeneity of food waste behavior by age cohorts.====This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, our study fills a gap by analyzing the heterogeneity of food waste due to the experience of an exogenous extreme shock. Using the 1959¨C1961 Great Famine as a quasi-natural experiment, this paper tests whether an extreme food scarcity experience of the household head in early life can profoundly influence food waste behavior in late life, providing a novel explanation for heterogeneous household food waste behavior. The second contribution is that our study develops a novel theoretical utility model that incorporates the concept of the psychological price of food. The theoretical innovation of this model is that consumers with famine experience may place a different psychological or subjective value on food beyond real market price. The nature of heterogeneous food waste behavior is that consumers make food purchase decisions based on the psychological price rather than the market price of the food. The third contribution is that this paper supplements the literature associated with the long-term effects of famine experience from the perspective of behavioral economics.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== briefly introduces the 1959¨C1961 Great Famine and household food waste situation in China. ==== discusses the theoretical model and its psychological underpinnings. ==== develops an empirical framework for examining the long-term impacts of early-life famine experience on household food waste behavior in China. ==== presents the baseline results, robustness check results, heterogeneous results and mechanism analysis results.

The number of admitted first-year students in higher education (HE) increased from 1.08 million to 1.6 million in 1999, and more than quadrupled (4.7) between 1998 and 2005 (====; ====; ====; ====). HE has long been regarded as a key gateway to mobility (====; ====; ====While the prior literature has examined CHEE's effects on education attainment and economic return at an individual level (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====), few studies have focused on HE's effect on intergenerational mobility in terms of socioeconomic status (SES), especially when taking rural¨Curban heterogeneity into account. One plausible reason is the lack of available data to link individuals to their original SES and distinguish the rural¨Curban migrations properly.====Drawing on seven waves of data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS), we link individuals' self-assessed social status and International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) to the SES of their family and father when they were 14?years old, and identify their urban and rural origins by their household registration records. Next, we conduct an empirical study on the heterogeneous effects of CHEE on the effects of HE on rural and urban SES mobility.====We find that the positive effects of HE on intergenerational mobility generally shows a significant decrease after CHEE, and that obvious heterogeneity exists between rural and urban residents. Though HE that excludes two- or three-year college courses can still significantly promote rural intergenerational mobility as measured by the ISEI, HE that includes two- or three-year college courses tends to undermine rather than promote urban intergenerational mobility in occupational SES. As to self-assessment status, larger declines in the effects of HE on improving social mobility are observed in the rural residents than their urban counterparts. The propensity score matching (PSM) method is used to mitigate sample selection bias. We also conduct a placebo test assuming that CHEE began in 1990 to rule out potential confounding factors empirically. These results are also robust for omitted variable tests by including more independent variables and the sensitivity test approach proposed by ====.====The major contributions of this research are as follows. First, we investigate CHEE's effects from a SES perspective, which provides a more comprehensive overview of an individual's relative position in society than just income or education, and adds a new dimension to the existing literature. Secondly, this study empirically identifies the heterogeneous effects of CHEE on China's urban and rural residents. The results also enrich the literature on urban¨Crural dichotomy and provide a plausible explanation for the decline in HE effects from the perspective of the distribution of newly added HE opportunities.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. ==== reviews the relevant literature. ==== contextualises the study. ==== presents the data and methodology. ==== provides an overview of the study's empirical findings. ==== presents the results of the robustness tests. ==== discusses the heterogeneous effects of CHEE. ==== presents the conclusion.",The effects of China's higher education expansion on urban and rural intergenerational mobility,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000517,9 April 2022,2022,Research Article,154

To account for this, we propose a beyond-borders approach to measuring trade flows that explicitly considers firm ownership, termed ¡°trade in factor income (TiFI),¡± that defines the US-owned factor income induced by China's final demand as US exports to China. Applying this approach to ==== data, we find that on average from 2005 to 2016 in TiFI terms, US exports to China were 20.34% and 8.21% greater, China's exports to the US were 1.64% and 16.04% less, and the US trade deficits with China were 17.4% and 32.0% less than the trade figures reported in value added and gross terms, respectively. The concept of TiFI transforms trade measures from a territory-based ¡°made in¡± label to a factor income-based ¡°created by¡± label.","In 2018, the US recorded a 418 billion US$ trade deficit with China,==== which was approximately half of its total trade deficit that year. This huge and persistent trade deficit was one of the most important factors that triggered the trade war between the two largest economies in the world. This trade deficit might have been a valid reason for the US to initiate a trade war in an attempt to gain greater access to Chinese markets for its exports. However, a critical question is whether the current trade statistics, which are compiled based on classical ¡°cloth-for-wine¡± trade, present the true picture regarding the balance of trade between the two countries.====; ====). As a result, most of China's exports are manufactured and traded along GVCs and contain a large amount of foreign value added, which has significantly inflated China's exports to and trade surplus with the US. For example, ==== case study of 3G iPhone exports from China to the US showed that iPhones contributed 1.9 billion US$ to the US¨CChina gross trade deficit in 2009, but from a value added perspective, China contributed only 3.6% to this deficit.

Furthermore, if their products are shipped to Japan, they are treated as Chinese exports to Japan in conventional trade statistics, rather than US exports to Japan. Current trade statistics are defined by territory (i.e., determined by national borders) rather than ownership of factor income, resulting in the problem of ¡°what (domestic sales or trade flows) you see is not what (income) you get¡± in terms of examining economic transactions.====One of the important objectives of exporting is to derive income from foreign markets. Exporting products directly to foreign countries, building factories abroad, or outsourcing production to foreign manufacturers are different business models, but are all aimed at making profits. Thus, in terms of income generation, they are no different. FDI combined with intellectual property is a popular means of earning returns on intangible assets in the global market. For example, an estimated 90% of S&P 500 (the 500 largest firms on the US stock market, most of which are involved internationally) market capitalization comes from intangible assets (Ocean ====).====, the Heckscher¨COhlin model, the Heckscher¨COhlin¨CVanek model, and their variants and extensions, for example, ====)==== to factor income embodied in GVCs. Therefore, using TiFI, we can systematically trace factor income embodied in GVCs at the country, sector, and bilateral levels based on firm ownership, and thus obtain a better understanding of the true magnitude of trade flows between the US and China, as well as the corresponding bilateral trade balance.====), in which sectors are divided by foreign-owned MNEs and domestically-owned firms at the aggregate level, but no information is available for the production function of MNEs by the specific FDI home country. To overcome this limitation, in this study we introduce some technological assumptions based on various combinations of production functions potentially applied by MNEs in FDI host countries, and also estimate bilateral FDI flows and stocks at the sector level. Using these assumptions and estimates, it is possible to derive the distribution of returns on capital by firm ownership at the bilateral and country-sector level.====Our main conclusion, which is based on the OECD's AMNE ICIO database, shows that when treating the US-owned factor income induced (absorbed) by China's final demand in both domestic transactions and international trade as US exports to China (we define this as bilateral TiFI) and Chinese-owned factor income induced by US final demand as China's exports to the US, on average in TiFI terms from 2005 to 2016, US exports to China are 20.34% and 8.21% greater, China's exports to the US are 1.64% and 16.04% less, and the US trade deficits with China are 17.4% and 32.0% less than those reported using conventional TiVA trade measures and traditional gross trade statistics, respectively.

This study contributes to the literature by assessing the potential impacts of Chinese netizens' experience with the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic on their willingness to donate for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. Specifically, this study applies a difference-in-differences (DID) model to a dataset collected from a nationwide survey to examine how individuals' exposure to the SARS epidemic affects their willingness to donate to alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that individuals' SARS epidemic experiences in their early lives, especially during the ¡°childhood-adolescence¡± period, had a lasting and far-reaching impact on their willingness to donate toward COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. Also, the impacts were likely heterogeneous by such sociodemographic factors as educational background, health status, and income level. The empirical findings highlight the importance of considering early-life experiences in developing and implementing epidemic prevention and control policies. While the SARS experience likely affected Chinese netizens' willingness to donate toward COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control, lessons learned from both the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic could be used to develop more effective public health education and prevention programs as well as to increase public donations for future pandemic prevention and control.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as one of the most widely influential global epidemics in recent decades. According to the statistics of WHO, as of March 25, 2022, a total of 479,006,033 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed globally and a total of 6,118,499 people had died. COVID-19 has been the most serious global pandemic since the outbreak of the Spanish flu in 1918 and will continue to bring about many unprecedented impacts on public health and socioeconomic development. Regarding COVID-19's impacts on human beings, the pandemic has influenced people's mental health and happiness, in addition to the pressure it has placed on individuals' physical health, and research has identified significant increases in individuals' sense of isolation, fear, and uncertainty (====).====During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the early 2000s, China received 4.074 billion yuan in donations. Of this, about 2.744 billion yuan from mainland enterprises and individuals, 215 million yuan from foreign companies, individuals, and non-governmental organizations, and 1.115 billion yuan from party and government organizations of China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan of the greater China region, as well as foreign nations and international organizations, etc.==== As report by China's State Council Information Office, by May 31, 2020, the Red Cross and other charitable organizations in China received 38.93 billion yuan of social donations and about 990 million pieces of materials, which by far exceeded the amounts of social donations during the SARS epidemic. To some extent, this reflects individuals' increasing enthusiasm to donate after the SARS epidemic.====Donation decisions are likely influenced by tax incentives (====), priority rule (====), information (====), media exposure (====), economic income status (====), firm-government relationship (====), supplier heterogeneous perceptions (====), and other exogenous factors. Recently, some studies have explored the impact of public health emergencies on individual behavior decision-making. For instance, ==== found that avian influenza outbreak affected people's intention to donate blood. The study of ==== suggested that public health emergencies could inspire individuals to donate blood as well as to make contributions to public interest. Similarly, we assume that the experience of public health emergencies (i.e., SARS) could exert a positive influence on individuals' willingness to donate for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control.====Currently, insights from COVID-19 on health and economic outcomes are of high interest. Several recent studies have discussed the current situation and the impact of COVID-19, as well as the coping strategies (====; ====; ====). However, our literature review suggests that the impacts of previous public health emergency experiences on public donation decision for COVID-19 prevention and control has yet to be elucidated and this study presents one of the first efforts in assessing such impacts by addressing the following three research questions:====(1) Are Chinese residents willing to donate toward COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control in terms of participation rate and amount?====(2) What are the major reasons and factors that determine their donations toward COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control?====(3) Does the residents' experience with the SARS epidemic may affect their donations toward COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control and if so, how?====The potential contributions of this paper are twofold. First, based on a theoretical perspective, this paper offers some interesting insights into the potential effects of early exposure to SARS on the willingness to donate in support of COVID-19 relief efforts. Second, this paper empirically assesses the impacts of Chinese residents' SARS experience on their willingness to donate for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control, using data collected from a nationwide survey in 2020. Because the data used in our empirical analysis are collected from an online survey, our analysis focuses on the netizens' willingness to donate for COVID-19 prevention and control.====This paper is organized into five sections.

The basic regression results of the whole sample are reported in ====. Regression results show that, although the interaction term of SARS intensity and birth cohort 3 had a positive effect, it is not statistically significant. This suggests that the impact of SARS intensity on donation was obviously underestimated, which indicates that protest responses do not explain the change of positive level of willingness to donate. In addition, as compared to the results in ====, the regression results in ==== that excluded the protest sample, showed that the impact of the interaction term of SARS intensity and birth cohort 3 is not only significantly larger, but the R-squared also increases from 0.0781 to 0.1013. This means that the explanatory power of the model in ==== is enhanced, suggesting that excluding protest sample would help to improve the accuracy of the estimation results.",Out of the shadows: Impact of SARS experience on Chinese netizens' willingness to donate for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000487,3 April 2022,2022,Research Article,157

Arguably, constructing a self-owned house is one of the most important investment and consumption decisions most rural households ever make.====; ====).====There is increasing recognition in the literature that peer effects play a major role in determining individual and household decisions. Examples include educational participation and academic achievement (====; ====; ====), work productivity and entrepreneurship (====; ====; ====), retirement savings (====; ====), and individual and household consumption (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), among many others. However, studies on peer effects in the housing market are extremely limited (====, p.7). Only a few papers have studied peer effects in housing markets (e.g., ====; ====, ====; ====), and virtually all of these papers have focused on urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first systematic evidence on peer effects in housing consumption in rural areas.====Empirical tests for peer effects are quite problematic. The issues that render identification difficult are well known (====): (i) the self-selection problem (ii) unobserved, correlated common effects and (iii) the reflection problem, which is a particular case of simultaneity. In this paper, we pursue a set of empirical strategies to overcome these problems and to determine whether the correlations we uncover are, in fact, causal.====For the self-selection problem, one commonly exploited approach in the literature is to use rural Chinese households as a research sample (e.g., ====; ====) due to the country's well-known hukou system. In addition, rural residents usually cannot self-select the locations of their houses due to the homestead system in China. Thus, the use of the rural samples stemming from the research questions already helps alleviate the selection problem to some extent.====Second, we run several placebo tests to address the correlated problem. Specifically, we assign the least similar household from the same community, the most similar household among those who have built a house later than a focal household from the same community, and a randomly chosen household from other communities in the same county as three false peers. It is reasonable to expect that these false peers are unlikely to influence focal households' housing consumption. However, false peers and focal households might be subject to some common shocks. If there is no correlation effect, then there should be no significant relationship between households' housing consumption and false peers' housing consumption. This is exactly what we find. Therefore, it is unlikely that our estimates can be attributed to a correlated effect.====Third, following ==== and others, we use peer households' firstborn boy rate (i.e., the fraction of firstborn boys in the peer group) as an instrument for peer households' housing consumption. The strict regulation of prenatal gender selection in China provides a basis for the instrument's exogeneity. In addition, ====, ==== and others argue that the observed gender imbalance in China is mostly driven by gender selection for the second and later children. Thus, it is unlikely that peers' first-born boy rate had a direct impact on focal households' housing consumption, other than through their own housing consumption. The IV regressions return estimates that are qualitatively identical to the OLS estimates.====To further address the concerns on the exclusion restriction, we follow ==== approach to perform falsification tests that examine the reduced-form relationship between the instrument and focal households' housing consumption for false peers. If the rate of first-born boys of peer households affects focal households' housing consumption only through peer households' housing consumption (i.e., if the exclusion restriction is satisfied), then there should be no relationships between IVs and focal households' housing consumption for constructed false peers. Looking at samples from false peers, we estimate a statistically insignificant relationship between the instrument and the focal households' housing consumption.====After establishing peer effects in rural housing demand, we turn to the task of distinguishing between two channels. The first plausible channel is ====. The ownership of a larger, newer house typically demonstrates the wealth and ¡°face¡± of rural Chinese households (====; ====). Thus, rural households try to improve their social status through investments in housing. Another potential channel is ====. Focal households may learn the benefits and costs of living in a newer house, relevant policies, building costs, decoration options, and other valuable information from their peers, making them follow the similar design and budget plan for building a house.====We undertake two exercises to identify the existence and the relative importance of these two channels. The rationale for the tests is the difference in focal households' response to changes in peer households' housing consumption under social learning and status seeking. More specifically, social leaning implies that focal households are mainly affected by peers with higher housing consumption (superior peers), as the households tend to improve their living conditions and hence would prefer to learn from their superior peers (e.g., ====). On the other hand, status seeking makes a household affected by both superior and inferior peers (peers with lower housing consumption), but is more sensitive to its inferior peers. That is because an increases in an inferior peer's housing consumption not only narrows the gap between the focal household and the peer, but may also affect the focal household's overall ranking in a community. In contrast, an increase in a superior peer's housing consumption would not affect the focal household's overall ranking in a community.====We first run a regression to determine the focal households' housing consumption in the response to changes in superior and inferior peers' housing consumption. The estimated coefficients for superior and inferior peers are positive and significant and the coefficient for inferior peers is greater than the coefficient for superior peers. The estimation results are prone to predictions from status-seeking, suggesting that status-seeking is the leading mechanism. Moreover, we consider possible heterogeneous peer effects among households with different status-seeking motives. To compete in the marriage market, it is reasonable to expect that households that build a house before marriage have stronger status seeking motives than households that build a house after marriage. Therefore, heterogeneous peer effects may arise among these households. Our estimates show that households with strong status-seeking motive respond more (less) aggressively to their superior (inferior) peer's housing consumption changes.====Second, we identify the existence of the social learning effect by focusing on less familiar peers. We again consider the difference in focal households' response to the changes in peer households' housing consumption, but this time we focus on less familiar peers who arguably affect focal households mainly through the social learning channel. The estimation results support our conjecture and hence verify the existence of social learning.====Finally, our focus on the social learning and statue-seeking mechanisms is not meant to suggest that other channels are not important. There is substantial evidence to show that other channels (e.g., risk sharing) are also important (====; ====) in determining peer effects. However, our dataset is not able to distinguish between these finer mechanisms, seeing that it usually requires peer-level exogeneous shocks (e.g., death or retirement).==== Instead, our aim and intended contribution is to causally estimate the peer effect in rural housing demand, and to identify the extent to which this peer effect arises due to social interactions.====This paper adds evidence to a fast-growing literature that examines peer effects in household consumption and investment. We present empirical evidence for peer effects in the acquisition of one of the most important assets for rural households: self-built housing. Furthermore, our findings suggest that both status seeking and social learning are important channels in determining peer effects in rural housing demand.====This paper also contributes to our understanding of the house-building craze in rural China. The existing literature explains this rural housing boom mainly through the lens of institutional and/or cultural factors (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, little is known about what determines the value of self-constructed rural houses. Our results show that one particular life experience, the peer influence a rural household receives from its peers plays an important role.====The rest of paper is organized as follows.

The expansion of higher education in China that began in 1999 is considered as an exogenous shock to identify causal effects. We find (1) that college education of entrepreneur significantly increases the total factor productivity of firms; (2) that college education of entrepreneur significantly increases the probability of innovation; and (3) that college education of entrepreneur significantly increases the likelihood that firms will gain policy supports from governments. The estimation results suggest that the increasing human capital of entrepreneurs is an important driving force for productivity growth in China. The study has policy implications for both higher education expansion and entrepreneurship.","China's recent economic growth is characterized by a significant rise of productivity (====). Fast productivity growth proceeds from the reallocation through selection of more productive firms (====; ====; ====). Meanwhile, China has activated the engine of innovation-led growth by investing in R&D and technology adoption (====; ====; ====).====China's growing human capital is also an important driving force for productivity growth. ¡°China runs one of the world's largest education systems, with more than 7 million students graduating from its universities (in 2017), of whom more than 40 percent are in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics¡± (====).

In this paper, we show that the human capital of entrepreneurs also plays a critical role in productivity growth.====This research is motivated by the patterns observed in the field study we conducted in 6 provinces in 2018. Enhanced human capital of entrepreneurs, particularly that represented by higher education, improves productivity, for two main reasons. First, study and training in college provide entrepreneurs with a deeper understanding of the technologies in their business, so that they usually know better how to turn ideas into new products or services, put people together in particular ways and combine them with physical capital and other factors. Second, college education, as a signal of capability, can help entrepreneurs to obtain supports from governments and ====.====We investigate the impact of the higher education of entrepreneur on total factor productivity (TFP) and the underlying mechanisms by taking advantage of a unique natural experiment in China that expanded college access for high-school graduates with effect from 1999 and thus generated a surge in college-educated entrepreneurs from 2003. Following ====, we adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) model to identify the impact of this increase in entrepreneurial human capital on productivity. We estimate the impact using a unique dataset of small and medium enterprises from the Enterprise Survey for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in China (ESIEC). The survey covers small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 6 provinces, collecting information related to start-up history, performance, innovation, and the overall business environment, which allows us to link the education background of entrepreneurs and firm performance.====The estimation results confirm that the expansion of higher education significantly increased the incidence of entrepreneurs graduating from college. Considering this expansion as an exogenous shock, we examine the impact of college education on entrepreneurial performance. We find that college-educated entrepreneurs run more productive firms than those with no higher education background. We further explore the underlying mechanisms of the impact. We find that college-educated entrepreneurs are more likely to develop new products or services than those with no college degree, and their innovation, on average, creates more value. College-educated entrepreneurs are more likely to hire college-educated employees and provide on-the-job training for their employees. We also find that college-educated entrepreneurs are more likely to obtain government subsidies that nurture start-up firms and to receive any type of policy supports from governments.====This study contributes to the empirical literature on the role of human capital in entrepreneurial selection and performance. ==== and ==== have summarized the literature on the relationship between education and entrepreneurial entry and outcomes. Most prior studies have revealed that even though the relationship between education and selection into entrepreneurship is ambiguous, the relationship between education and entrepreneurial performance is significantly positive, irrespective of the performance measure used (such as survival, profit, firm growth, or income). This paper focuses on the impact of the higher education of entrepreneur on firm productivity, highlighting how college education helps them to innovate and win government support. The paper also speaks to the literature studying the impact of human capital on economic growth. The lack of human capital poses a major barrier to productivity growth and economic development (====). By examining plant-level data, ==== finds that local human capital positively influences productivity. ====, using a panel of firm-level data from China, find that education level improves worker productivity and the total factor productivity of firms, and that higher education of CEOs increases TFP for firms with foreign investment. This paper extends this strand of literature by investigating the effect of human capital of entrepreneurs, rather than workers, on firm productivity. Also, this paper is closely related to a new stream of literature on the impact of higher education expansion. Using China's education reform that began in 1999, a series of papers have estimated the impacts of the expansion of higher education on employment (====; ====; ====), total factor productivity (====) and entrepreneurial selection (====). Following their methodology, we explore the impact of the higher education of entrepreneur on firm performance. The results have clear implications for education reform and productivity growth in China.====The rest of this article is organized as follows. In ====, we present the theory underlying the empirical analysis and derive testable hypotheses.

Based on FDI data from 2003 to 2012, the empirical test, employing the difference-in-differences (DID) model, shows that, after the implementation of the ==== agreement between the mainland and Hong Kong in 2007, FDI from Hong Kong increased significantly. After the integration of domestic and foreign-funded enterprise income tax systems in 2008, Hong Kong ==== increased even more drastically. The extended analyses show that, the substantial increase in Hong Kong capital after the implementation of this bilateral tax agreement was partly related to the diversion effect of investment. MNCs might have diverted investment from other ==== to the mainland via Hong Kong, resulting in a sharp increase in the amount and proportion of Hong Kong investment, whereas those of FDI from other tax havens have declined."," research which focuses on China finds that market potential has a positive impact on FDI inflows. The labor cost is also related to the entry of FDI. The cheap labor cost in China plays a significant role in promoting the FDI inflows (====). As a necessary condition for business activities, the infrastructure also matters in the entry of foreign capital (====). In addition, environmental regulation (====; ====), and preferential policies (====; ====) also have a significant impact on foreign capital inflow.====Hong Kong has long been the largest source of foreign capital to the mainland, but the existing research on Hong Kong capital is quite limited. The geographical and cultural proximity is an important factor for Hong Kong capital to enter the mainland (====; ====). In addition, ==== finds that labor cost is also influential factors for Hong Kong capital to enter the mainland. As an international financial center and tax haven, Hong Kong has natural advantages in attracting international capital. In addition to the ==== investment by the Hong Kong people, the other two types of Hong Kong capital flowing into the mainland are round-tripping FDI and investment from other countries or regions via Hong Kong to the mainland.====Round-tripping FDI is a practice in which the mainland enterprises first invest in Hong Kong and then return this investment to the mainland. This practice is essentially the same as investment from other countries or regions via Hong Kong to the mainland, both of which are reinvested in the mainland via Hong Kong.====In terms of the impact of tax on FDI inflows, there is a huge literature. Based on cross-country panel data of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ==== finds that there was a significant negative relationship between high tax rates and FDI inflows. ==== also use the data of OECD countries and find that the tax rate of the host country significantly affected the FDI inflows. ==== find that both the host and home country tax systems are important factors affecting the location choice of MNCs. To attract foreign investment, China used to offer preferential tax policies to foreign-funded enterprises. Studies show that such policies play an important role in attracting foreign investment (====; ====). After the integration of enterprise income taxes (¡°====¡± hereinafter) in 2008, however, domestic and foreign-funded enterprises have the same tax rate.==== As a result, foreign-funded enterprises may lack incentives to increase investment (====) and even begin to withdraw capital (====). ==== further reveal that, as a result of the ==== foreign investment but did not affect the ==== foreign investment.====A bilateral tax agreement is an agreement between countries or regions. Avoidance of double taxation and prevention of tax evasion are the main purposes of a tax agreement. ====, using OECD data from 1982 to 1992, find that bilateral tax agreements did not induce new investment but rather might have reduced investment. Their research on two-way FDI in the United States also shows that bilateral tax agreements had no impact on FDI activities in the United States (====). ==== find that tax agreements had a negative impact on bilateral direct investment in OECD countries. ====, based on data from developing countries, finds that the developing countries having bilateral tax agreements with major capital exporting countries, such as the United States, received more FDI inflows, but this effect existed only in middle-income developing countries. ==== use the data of MNCs in Sweden to show that bilateral tax agreements had no effect on the intensive margin of FDI, but that they could significantly increase the possibility of investment, that is, the extensive margin of FDI. Based on the data of U.S. MNCs, ==== find that, after the signing of tax agreements between the U.S. and other countries, U.S. MNCs using heterogeneous inputs would increase their activities in the relevant country. U.S. MNCs, however, making use of homogenous inputs, were not affected. ==== may be the only relevant study in this regard. Using the data of Chinese-listed companies, they examine the role of bilateral tax agreements on Chinese OFDI along the Belt & Road countries and find that the effect of bilateral tax agreements depended on the characteristics of the host countries.====Related to but slightly different from the above-mentioned literature, this paper investigates the impact of the Mainland¨CHong Kong bilateral tax agreement implemented in 2007 on the inflow of Hong Kong capital and other tax havens into the mainland, which provides empirical evidence from China on how bilateral tax agreements affected FDI inflows. Through the difference-in-differences (DID) method, we find that, after the implementation of the bilateral tax agreement between the mainland and Hong Kong in 2007, FDI from Hong Kong increased significantly, and the findings remain the same after a series of robustness checks. Additionally, after the ==== in 2008, the inflow of Hong Kong capital increased more dramatically. Finally, the extended analyses show that, there may be an investment diversion effect¡ªthat is, MNCs may reroute the investment from other tax havens to Hong Kong and then reinvest in the mainland.====Compared with the existing literature, the marginal contribution of this paper lies in four aspects. First, there is little literature that specifically probes into the change of the sources of foreign investment of a country. This paper focuses on the changes of the composition of FDI source countries or regions in the mainland before and after 2007, and provides an explanation from the perspective of taxation. Second, based on FDI data in the mainland, we study the impact of a bilateral tax agreement on FDI inflows and provide empirical evidence about how a bilateral tax agreement affected FDI inflows from different source countries or regions. Third, Hong Kong is the most important source of FDI in the mainland, but the existing literature on the inflow of Hong Kong capital is lacking. This paper examines the impact of a bilateral tax agreement on the inflow of Hong Kong capital to the mainland and confirms the existence of a tax-driven investment diversion effect, which is helpful to a better understanding of the dynamic of Hong Kong capital in the mainland. Fourth, although ¡°tax treaty shopping¡± has attracted wide attention in the academic circle, the empirical research is quite limited. This study finds that the tax agreement between the mainland and Hong Kong triggered the diversion effect of FDI, which adds new evidence to the literature in this field.====The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: the second section is the institutional background and research hypotheses; the third section introduces the empirical strategy and data sources; the fourth section is the estimation results and analyses; the fifth section is the extended analyses; and the last section provides the conclusions and policy implications.",Bilateral tax agreement and FDI inflows: Evidence from Hong Kong investment in the Mainland China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000463,26-Mar-22,2022,Research Article,160

Today, less than 1% of the Chinese population falls below the international poverty line (====). Targeted poverty alleviation has been recognized as a national strategy since 2013, which exerts a profound political pressure on the participation of listed firms in poverty alleviation programs in China, specifically for those firms with politically connected executives.====Listed firms participate in poverty alleviation programs for two main reasons. First, the anti-poverty movement is initiated by the Chinese Communist Party, and local governments take several measures to call on listed firms to provide helping a hand. Politically connected executives are especially under political pressure to engage in such activities. Apart from external pressure, those executives are also motivated to participate in the corporate poverty alleviation programs for obtaining scarce resources from authorities. In particular, participation in poverty alleviation activities for politically connected executives helps promote their corporate profile, facilitates future job ====, and aids in obtaining preferencial policies. Therefore, examining executives' political connections when decisions about poverty alleviation are made provides a new understanding of the relationship between corporate executives and CSR.====.====In addition, we examine the relationship between the chairperson's political connections and the efficiency of the poverty alleviation programs using a stochastic frontier model. The model considers assisted poor people as output and the amount of investment and other firm characteristics as input elements. The results show that the chairperson's political connections are not related to the efficiency of that firm's poverty alleviation programs. Politically connected firms receive less government recognitions with an increase in investments in poverty alleviation.

We develop a simple model to explore how the policies affect the relative demand of firms for skilled labor and illustrate the roles of financing constraints and tax compliance in mediating the policy effects. We then employ a firm-level dataset from China's A-share listed companies and use a quasi-experimental design to examine the model predictions. We find that the policies significantly increase the relative demand of firms for skilled labor. The channels underlying the policy effects are that the policies generate additional cash flow for firms, stimulate investment and, thus, raise the demand of firms for skilled labor with the presence of capital¨Cskill complementarity. We also find that the positive effects of the policies on the relative demand for skilled labor are primarily significant for firms with strong financing constraints and high tax compliance. Moreover, we document the positive effects of the policies on R&D investment, firm value added, productivity, workers' benefits, and ==== performance, which further corroborate our main results.","The accelerated depreciation policy, which is popular worldwide as a means of investment promotion and economic stimulation, allows companies to write off their capital expenditure quickly and, thus, lowers user costs of capital. From 2004 to 2016, 41 countries worldwide implemented this policy to encourage investment and stimulate their respective economies (====). Previous studies evaluating the impact of accelerated depreciation policies in the United States of America (USA) (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), the United Kingdom (====), and China (====; ====; ====). If labor and capital are complements, the rise in capital investment creates jobs and then raises workers' wages; however, if they are substitutes, investment increments introduced by accelerated depreciation policies crowd out employment and decrease wages. This indicates that the impact of accelerated depreciation policies on the labor market is an empirical question. Taking capital¨Cskill complementarity as a logical starting point, this study tests the effects of China's accelerated depreciation policies on the relative demand of firms for skilled labor, thereby contributing to the scarce literature about labor market responses to accelerated depreciation policies.====We first construct a simple conceptual framework based on ==== and ==== We exploit the ratio of the quantity of skilled labor to that of unskilled labor (in log.) and the ratio of skilled workers to total workers to measure the relative demand of a firm for skilled labor.==== (CSR) performance, which further corroborate our main findings in benchmark regression.====The key challenge in our identification framework is the probability that enactment of the policies may be correlated to unobserved determinants of the relative demand of firms for skilled labor. We solve this concern using the following five tactics. First, we show graphically that the relative demands of treatment and control groups for skilled labor behave alike prior to policies enactment, whilst they diverge after the enactment, with the relative demand of treatment group for skilled labor increasing, and that of the control group remaining unchanged. Second, we control for firm characteristics and within-industry shocks by adding a set of firm-level and industry-level controls to the regression model. Third, we use a DID event-study specification to test whether there is any pre-policies trend. The results show that the relative demand for skilled labor does not increase before policies enactment and increases significantly after the enactment. Fourth, we conduct a set of placebo tests. We find that the policies have more apparent impacts on firms with positive profits and those that invest in longer-lived assets. The false policies generated by randomly assigning treatment status to firms have no effect on them. Finally, our main findings remain robust in alternative empirical settings, measures for the relative demand for skilled labor, and restricted samples.====This paper contributes to the literature in five ways. First, it adds to a growing body of literature that evaluates the effects of accelerated depreciation policies. Existing literature mainly tests the policies' investment effects (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), while the studies focusing on the labor market responses are scarce.==== Based on ==== and ====, this study first lays a theoretical foundation on the nexus between the policies and the relative demand for skilled labor and then empirically examines both average and heterogeneous policy effects. In addition, this paper also investigates the policies' effects on other outcomes of interest, especially corporate social responsibility (CSR), an unexplored but significant outcome. Second, this paper contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence for capital¨Cskill complementarity from the world's largest developing country. Several studies have supported the capital¨Cskill complementarity hypothesis, but most of them are based on developed countries (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In a more recent contribution, ==== finding that firms with strong financing constraints are more sensitive to tax incentives. Thus, this study also adds to the literature on investigating the impacts of financial constraints on firm performance (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Fourth, this study supplements the literature on the consequences of tax avoidance. Extant research shows that tax avoidance reduces corporate information transparency (====), increases corporate audit costs (====) and financing costs (====; ====), and affects firm value (====; ====). Consistent with ====, our results suggest that tax non-compliance can impair the effectiveness of tax incentives. Fifth, related to the explanations for the unchanged demand for unskilled labor after policies enactment, this study touches on the literature about the determinants of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. ==== provide the first systemic review of the extant literature exploring the determinants of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Based on a literature survey, they conclude that there may be a coexistence of high-intensity government intervention and high elasticity of substitution between capital and labor in China, implying a positive relationship. Meanwhile, they do not document any research on the nexus between labor market regulations or unions and the elasticity of substitution in China. More recently, ==== demonstrate that the energy intensity target constraint in China can even change the nexus between production factors from substitute to complementary, or vice versa. Our results suggest that government intervention and labor protection lower the elasticity of substitution between capital and unskilled labor, providing additional evidence for the link between government intervention and the elasticity of substitution and supplementing the literature on the relationship between labor market regulations and the elasticity of substitution.====The studies most closely related to ours are those by ==== and ====. The former tests the impact of accelerated depreciation policies of the USA on the local labor market (employment, total earnings for workers, and earnings per worker), while the latter estimates the effects of China's 2014 accelerated depreciation policy on corporate human capital. However, this paper differs from ==== work in the following four key aspects. First, the accelerated depreciation policies of the USA are temporary tax incentives, while those of China¡ªwhich we focus on¡ªare permanent, which may lead to different labor market responses. Second, the policies of the USA do not aim at specific industries or locations; thus, ====Compared with ====, in addition to our systematic analysis on both the 2014 and 2015 rounds of accelerated depreciation policies in China, our paper also distinguishes from ==== work in six ways. First, we develop a simple model based on ==== and ==== to elucidate how accelerated depreciation policies work on firms' relative demand for skilled labor and illustrate the roles of financing constraints and tax compliance in mediating the tax policy effects. Second, using a framework of translog production function, we provide direct evidence for the presence of capital-skill complementarity by estimating the elasticity of substitution between capital, skilled labor, and unskilled labor. Third, we add a dummy variable denoting the value-added tax (VAT) reform, which replaces the business tax system with a VAT one, to the regression model for controlling confounding factors from the other reform.==== Fourth, we not only estimate the average effects of the policies but also explore the heterogeneous policy effects by financing constraints and tax compliance. Although there are several studies about the heterogeneous effects of the ADP on business investment, that on labor market outcomes are still an empirical void. This paper aims to fill the gaps. Fifth, we provide possible explanations for the lack of significant changes in firms' demand for unskilled labor after policies enactment from the perspectives of government intervention and labor protection. Sixth, we also estimate the impact of the policies on R&D investment, firm value added, firm productivity, total earnings for workers, earnings per worker, and CSR performance, and find the policies have significant positive effects on these outcomes, which not only supplements the corresponding branch of literature but also further corroborates our main findings.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the evolution of China's accelerated depreciation policies.

Adjusted dialectal fractionalization; 3. Dialectal polarization; 4. Adjusted dialectal polarization and 5. Periphery heterogeneity. Dialectal fractionalization and dialectal polarization have a positive effect on both income per capita and economic growth. Adjusted dialectal fractionalization and periphery heterogeneity exhibit a positive effect on economic growth. The effect if robust when considering the influence of Putonghua proficiency and external migration. Our analysis also shows that dialectal diversity promotes economic performance through increasing public expenditure.","In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Chinese dialectal and cultural diversity as well as between dialectal diversity and economic performance across Chinese prefecture-level cities.==== China has ten major dialect supergroups, including about one hundred dialectal subgroups.====; ====). Empirical studies also provide evidence for the positive relationship between regional cultural diversity and innovation (====; ====; ====; ====). ==== argue that cultural diversity, measured by the fractionalization of cultural values, is positively associated with less civil conflicts, more public goods provision and higher income per capita.====Although ==== argue that the negative effect of dialectal diversity on economic growth in Chinese cities is due to the difficulty of communication, the evidence they provide is not convincing. First, in their study, the number of Han dialects used in one city is used as the main index of dialectal diversity, which can reflect neither fractionalization nor polarization of the population. If one dialect is used only by a small fraction of the population, the equal treatment of all dialects will result in biased results. Although dialectal fractionalization is used in the robustness test, dialectal distances are not examined in their paper. Second, they only use economic data of the year 2010, which does not capture the actual effects of dialectal diversity because of unobserved factors. Third, given its long history of diversity, Chinese society is very inclusive of people from different dialect groups and there are few obstacles to their communication, which may undermine the negative effect of dialectal diversity on economic development. Furthermore, the writing system is standard for all dialects and the official language, Putonghua, has been promoted since the 1950s, providing more pathways for different dialect groups to understand each other.==== Dialectal diversity may also cause damage to economic performance because of the lack of social trust (====; ====). But according to ====, the interaction of different dialect groups in the long history should increase social trust. Hence, at the local level in China, the negative effect of dialectal diversity is reduced, and we expect a positive influence of dialectal diversity on economic performance.====We first demonstrate the association between dialects and cultural values using the dataset of the CFPS (China Family Panel Studies, 2010), which indicates that dialectal diversity is related to cultural diversity. Thus, dialectal diversity has significant economic implications. We perform an improved empirical analysis of the relationship between dialectal diversity and economic performance. First, to measure dialectal diversity at the prefecture-level, we have five indices: dialectal fractionalization, adjusted dialectal fractionalization, dialectal polarization, adjusted dialectal polarization and periphery heterogeneity. Second, we build a panel sample covering the period 2001¨C2015, and 5-year average is used in the estimation.====To test our hypotheses, we use a fixed effect model and pooled 2SLS on the whole sample. We find that dialectal diversity is conducive to higher levels of income and growth in China.==== Analysis of the whole sample indicates that dialectal fractionalization and polarization have positive impacts on both income levels and growth. Dialectal fractionalization adjusted by dialectal distances and periphery heterogeneity show a positive effect only on economic growth. The results are robust even when we consider the effect of Putonghua proficiency and external migration. We also find that dialectal diversity positively shapes economic performance through increasing public expenditure.====The organization of the paper is the following.

Taking the case of the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics (NYO), this study examines the impacts on the host's local ==== during the ¡®preparatory-hosting-after¡¯ stages of a MSE. By adopting a synthetic control method (SCM) and logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition, the following findings are reached: (1) From 2010, when the city of Nanjing announced the decision to bid to host the NYO, the NYO increased the carbon emissions of Jiangsu (the province to which Nanjing belongs) in every year from 2010 to 2019. The total increase in the emissions caused by the NYO was approximately 584.63 million tons. That figure is 1.65 times the total carbon emissions of the United Kingdom in 2018. (2) The annual amount of increased emissions also rose during the preparatory and post stages of the NYO, but the amount of increased emissions during the hosting year was relatively lower, at 53.36 million tons. (3) The NYO improved the energy intensity of the industrial sector, and thereby partially decreased local carbon emissions. Conversely, the NYO induced continuous impacts on local per capita output, the energy intensity of the transportation sector, the scale and energy structure of the industrial sector, and thus promoted emissions, even after the games.","A mega sporting event (MSE) (such as the Olympic Games) is defined as an event hosted by a government, with at least 10,000 audience members and national or global media coverage (====). In order to host a MSE, in preparation for the event, the host country or city must refurbish and build stadium infrastructure, improve the ability to generate electricity, and so on. These high?carbon practices may significantly increase local carbon emissions during the preparatory stage (prior to the event).====Conversely, a MSE having a positive impact on local carbon emissions may also be plausible. For example, during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Beijing municipal government shut down a considerable number of factories with inferior production techniques. This step was taken to achieve temporary pollution control, and the sudden decrease in economic activities might have led to a decline in local carbon emissions (====).====Theoretically, the uncertainty with regard to the impacts of a MSE is due to at least two issues. One is that the environmental impacts may be different before, during and after a MSE. Another is that a number of previously examined factors also drive carbon emissions, such as energy structure, energy intensity, etc. (====). The different impacts of a MSE on different driving factors may lead to a complicated and complex impact on local carbon emissions.====Without exception, it is cities in developed countries, or countries with significant economic activity, that host MSEs. Many of these countries may have already committed to an international climate change obligation, and therefore may be concerned about the impacts of MSEs on their low-carbon roadmap. Consequently, policymakers in these countries may need to understand the impacts of hosting MSEs.====Existing literature related to MSEs has mostly focused on economic performance (====), the travel intentions of potential international tourists (====), and ecological costs (====). Some scholars have conducted investigations into the environmental impacts that occur during the different stages of a MSE (====; ====; ====). However, a research gap exists with regard to the impacts of MSEs on local carbon emissions; there is also a scarcity of any discussion about how the carbon impacts are caused.====The aim of this study is to investigate how and why MSEs have an impact on local carbon emissions. To be specific, this study empirically determines what impacts MSEs have on local carbon emissions during the ¡®preparatory-hosting-after¡¯ stages of the events. Where any impact is discovered, this study additionally investigates in which channels such impacts are generated, from the perspective of the factors that drive carbon emissions. The investigations on different stages and channels may shed light on the theoretically uncertain carbon impacts of MSEs.====This study takes the 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympics (NYO) as a case to conduct the investigation. In February 2010, Nanjing won the bid to host the second Summer Youth Olympics; the city successfully hosted the NYO in August 2014. This was not only a MSE for the Chinese government, similar in nature to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but also a mission and opportunity to manage carbon emissions before, during and after the games. In December 2009, at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Chinese government committed to reducing China's carbon emissions. Therefore, some policy instruments (such as improving the efficiency of coal-powered electricity production) were adopted after Nanjing won the bid. The goal was both for the success of the event and for carbon emission reduction purposes.====This study contributes to existing literature in the following two aspects: (1) The study enriches the related research by determining the impacts of a MSE on local carbon emissions. Through a synthetic control method (SCM), the impacts of a MSE on local carbon emissions before, during and after the games are identified. (2) Using a method combination of a SCM method and logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) decomposition, the study reveals the impacting channels through which MSEs affect local carbon emissions. The impacting channels shed light on a low-carbon roadmap for hosting a MSE.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 introduces the methods. Section 4 reports and discusses the main results.

Examining revision effects can facilitate better understanding whether and how the revision process eliminated the fundamental roots of the discrepancy. Through multiple index decomposition methods, this study traced the overall discrepancy to raw coal consumption by energy source, coal washing by transforming process and industrial consumption by economic sector. The reduction of the discrepancy was primarily based on improvements in the data consistency for raw coal, including the input by coal washing and industrial raw coal consumption. At provincial level, unexpected operations were detected during benchmark revisions, particularly inner-provincial inconsistency and inter-provincial incoordination. We conclude that the data discrepancy was institutionally rooted and cannot be solved by benchmark revision alone. Shifting the statistical system from a hierarchical regime to a more centralized one, which would allow greater coordination during energy data accounting and revisions, can help resolve this issue fundamentally.","The quality of China's official economic statistics has long been the focus of domestic and international observers (Carsten A. ====; ====). To produce more solid and reliable statistical products, China's statistical system has undergone a series of long-term optimizations and reforms (====; ====). As low-carbon development becomes a clear trend, the statistics on energy consumption have drawn increasing attention, as there are long-lasting data discrepancies between national and provincial level statistics on energy consumption (====; ====). In 2012, for example, the total energy consumption for all provinces==== exceeded the national figure by 815 million tons of standard coal equivalent (tce), or 22.5% of the national total energy consumption that year (====). The stubborn inconsistency of energy consumption statistics between the country and its provinces has created considerable uncertainty for China's carbon accounting (====; ====), which may undermine public trust in the reliability of China's carbon reduction achievements.====To better capture booming economic activities in statistics, China has initiated a system of periodic economic censuses since 2004.==== An economic census typically has more comprehensive statistical coverage than traditional yearly statistics based on sampling and estimation. As data of the economic census are considered more reliable, yearly energy consumption statistics routinely undergo a benchmark revision process for the census and prior years to enhance statistical data quality.==== Benchmark revision is a systematic adjustment, which includes not only updating data sources but changes in statistical rules (Carsten A ====). From a traditional perspective, post-revision data are supposed to have the edge on quality; however, increasing evidence has demonstrated that the benchmark revision process adds additional uncertainties to China's official statistics (Y. ====). The revision is generally accompanied by changes in the statistical concept, scope, and rules (Carsten A ====; ====), whereas revision procedures and specifications are typically lack of transparency (X. ====; Y. ====). The temporal comparability of China's energy statistics has been undermined by the sequential discontinuity of benchmark revisions (====), and substantial revisions increased the uncertainty of China's energy consumption and carbon emissions accounting, thus creating additional difficulties in realizing China's national target and international commitments for carbon emissions reduction (====; ====; ====; ====). More recently, scholars have reported the risk of systematic bias in benchmark revisions by local officials under pressure to reach rigid energy conservation targets (====). How multi-level governments act during benchmark revisions and how the revisions improve data quality for energy consumption remain questions deserving careful examination for China.====Logically, national energy consumption data should equal the summation of data from all provincial regions. In practice, however, evident discrepancies between these two figures have been widely reported (====; ====; ====). As energy statistics periodically undergo substantial revisions, the effect of benchmark revisions on the discrepancy is considered relevant for finding out effective means to narrow this inconsistency. The benchmark revisions following the Second Economic Census in 2008, however, have proved to exert little effect on the discrepancy (====). Turning to the Third Economic Census in 2013, however, the benchmark revisions significantly reduced the data inconsistency (====; ====). Specifically, the post-revision discrepancy rate for total energy consumption between the country and its provinces plummeted to 2.5% in 2013 against 22.5% in 2012. In the academic community, however, most of researches focused primarily on the results and impacts of revisions by treating revisions as exogenous (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Few studies discussed the logic and behaviors of authorities on benchmark revisions, for example, by investigating the second benchmark revisions (====). For the third benchmark revision that for the first time the discrepancy was reduced significantly, there is a clear research gap to further examine revision behaviors by comparing provincial authorities with their national counterpart. Accordingly, previous researches are insufficient on bridging the knowledge gap between the effects of discrepancy reduction and the underlying root causes of the discrepancy.====Taking the inconsistency between provincial and national energy consumption statistics as a starting point, this study employed several index decomposition methods to explore the reasons why the discrepancy was significantly reduced after the benchmark revision in 2013. The revision behaviors of both national and provincial governments are comprehensively examined to reveal their distinct revision strategies. We found that the national revision is mainly upward, whereas the provincial revision is typically downward. The reduction of the discrepancy is primarily based on the improvement of data consistency for raw coal, particularly the input by coal washing and industrial raw coal consumption. Simultaneously, irregular or self-contradictory revision behaviors have also been detected at the provincial level. To close the data gap, provinces have had to revise their energy consumption downward. They have adjusted input into an upward transforming process and revised terminal consumption downward. This revision is motivated by the fact that provinces can reduce the corresponding coal consumption by trans-provincial export of cleaned and other washed coal. Nearly all provinces tend to reduce energy consumption figures by expanding net exports, leading to a revision contradiction between individual rationality and collective irrationality. Further investigation reveals a year-on-year growing discrepancy in the post-census period, and we argue that discrepancy reduction through benchmark revisions has failed to reach the fundamental causes of the discrepancy and calls for more thorough technical and institutional changes to enhance China's energy data quality by eliminating the discrepancy.====This paper has several novel aspects. First, instead of focusing on the results of the revision and treating the revision process as exogenous (====; ====), this study takes the third benchmark revisions as endogenous by directly analyzing the energy statistical revision process to reveal the impact of revision behaviors on the improved data inconsistency. Second, this paper for the first time employs dual-dimension comparisons between national and provincial data, and between pre-revision and post-revision data to comprehensively assess the benchmark revisions on data consistency. Third, this paper reveals the continuously enlarging trend of discrepancies after benchmark revisions to trigger in-depth discussion on the fundamental causes of data discrepancies, highlighting the necessity to reform the decentralized statistical system in China.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. An overview of the 2013 benchmark revision is provided in ==== with a general assessment using aggregate data. In ====, data estimation is conducted and the index decomposition method is introduced. ==== reports the index decomposition results for the overall discrepancy by energy source, transforming processes, and economic sectors and compares the situation before and after the benchmark revisions. The logic and behaviors of the revisions by provincial and national authorities are further examined in ====. In ====, we employ post-census data to test whether the data discrepancy will diminish and then discuss the fundamental causes of the discrepancy.

To fill this gap, we investigate whether and how tax enforcement affects corporate employment.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). First, as labor is a quasi-fixed production factor, hiring workers may involve fixed costs for advertising, hiring, and training (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Third, if labor and physical capital are complementary inputs in the production process, the availability of external finance may play a positive role in the labor demand indirectly through increasing investment in fixed assets (e.g., ====; ====Our baseline result shows that the corporate employment growth relative to 2017 decreased by 1.12% on average for the treatment firms after the merger of the STB and LTBs. To illustrate the robustness of this finding, we conduct a series of sensitivity tests. On the one hand, the key assumption to satisfy for our DID identification is that the control and treatment groups follow a similar trend to that if the merger of the STB and LTBs had not occurred. With respect to the parallel trend assumption, we provide two pieces of evidence, consisting of the stylized facts and an ==== approach. On the other hand, to show that other contemporaneous shocks do not drive our baseline result, we exclude the 2018 trade war, the environmental protection law enacted in 2018, and province- and industry-level shocks by introducing more fixed effects into our DID regression. In addition, our baseline result is robust to omitted variables and an alternative dependent variable, subsample, and econometric specification.====Our analysis continues by testing the underlying mechanism. We first explore how the merger of the STB and LTBs affected the corporate effective income tax rate. The results show that this policy change led to an increase in tax enforcement. Second, we assess the response of firms' liquidity constraints to the merger of the STB and LTBs. The results suggest that firms' cash holdings and the cash flow sensitivity of fixed asset investment increase with tougher tax enforcement, while the supply of trade credit and the dividend payments decrease, consistent with the liquidity constraints channel.====Further, we conduct several cross-sectional tests to provide some further evidence for our argument. First, given that tougher tax enforcement has a significantly negative effect on corporate employment, this effect should be stronger for firms with higher ==== and less severe labor market frictions. Second, when firms' initial tax rate before 2017 or their tax transfer ability is lower, they are more exposed to the merger of the STB and LTBs, suggesting that the negative effect on corporate employment should be more pronounced. Third, if the liquidity constraints channel exists, the merger of the STB and LTBs should have a stronger negative employment effect on firms with greater financial constraints and more serious credit market imperfections. Overall, the results are consistent with these predictions derived from our main hypothesis.====We finish our analysis by discussing how tax enforcement affects firms' other behaviors. On the one hand, the merger of the STB and LTBs has a significant and negative impact on corporate investment, resulting in a decrease in capital intensity. Moreover, firms' operating performance, measured by the scale of total profits and operating income, decreases. On the other hand, we distinguish between high- and low-skilled workers and investigate how the labor force composition changes. The results show that the numbers of both high- and low-skilled workers decrease after the merger of the STB and LTBs, with a particular decline in the percentage of high-skilled workers. Taken together, our findings imply that the tougher tax enforcement caused by the merger of the STB and LTBs inhibits the expansion and long-term growth of firms.====Our study contributes to the existing literature in three respects. First, it sheds light on the impact of tax reforms on firms' investment and financing decisions. A massive number of previous studies explore the impact of tax policies on real investment (e.g., ====; ====; ====), capital structure (e.g., ====; ====), entrepreneurial risk taking (e.g., ====; ====), and innovation (e.g., ====; ====), among many others. However, the impact of taxes on corporate employment is not well explored (====), and the above works focus on the adjustment of the tax rate. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of tax enforcement change rather than an explicit tax reduction on corporate employment.====Second, our study is related to the literature exploring the determinants of the labor demand. A substantial number of previous studies emphasize the importance of external finance, including collateral value (e.g., ====; ====), the enlargement of collateral menus (e.g., ====; ====), and credit market imperfections (e.g., ====; ====), labor income tax (====), accelerated depreciation policies (====), and export tariff (====). In our study, we focus on the crucial impact of corporate income tax on employment and argue that the liquidity constraints channel dominates our findings.====Third, our study contributes to the literature on tax enforcement. While plenty of previous studies consider performance pay for tax collectors (====), third-party information (====), and auditing (====), little attention is paid to the importance of the incentives of local governments and tax agencies. Some recent works explore the key roles of horizontal tax competition (e.g., ====; ====), fiscal squeeze (====), and the switch of tax collection agencies (====). In our study, we demonstrate that the merger of the STB and LTBs significantly increases the enforcement of corporate income tax.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== presents the institutional background and proposes our main hypothesis. ==== provides our identification strategy. ==== reports the baseline result, a series of robustness checks, and mechanism tests. ==== conducts several cross-sectional tests and provides further discussions. ==== concludes.",Tax enforcement and corporate employment: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000293,12-Mar-22,2022,Research Article,166

Our findings demonstrate that researchers with a track record of publication in the most exclusive academic outlets publish more papers in high quality journals, with an average 12.4% increase, as they move up the career ladder, obtain more external grants, and acquire more executive powers. As the observable channels fail to explain most of the publication persistence, the increase in the research productivity along a researcher's career trajectory is attributed to other mechanisms that are suggestive of resource misallocation, including a reputation effect gained from initial visibility in leading academic outlets and non-academic channels facilitated by better access to social resources, among other mechanisms. Our findings depict some intriguing observations regarding the ecosystem of a prominent subject in Chinese ==== and reveal tentative evidence on how structural changes, such as fostering a more open and international research environment, could benefit early career researchers.","Resource misallocation is prevalent in the developing world, including China (====; ====). As a partially reformed economy (====), China is characterized by high degrees of distortions in the product and factor markets (====). While most of the earlier studies have focused on misallocation in physical goods production, recent work has explored the significance of misallocation in knowledge production (====; ====; ====), it is critical to understand the patterns and causes of distortions in knowledge production, particularly in the context of a less developed country, which has not been fully understood.====In this paper, we focus on the distortions in knowledge production in China. More specifically, we examine the effect of early publication in leading (Chinese scholarly) journals==== on the substantial performance of scientific research and investigate the potential channels with a focus on possible explanations for the evidence of misallocation of academic resources.====Our choice of academic research in China as the subject of this study is motivated by several facts. First, China's rapid economic growth and structural changes following the Reform and Opening-up in the late 1970s have attracted global attention as well as fueled the rapid expansion of modern scientific education and research in the country. During this great transition, the problem of resource misallocation in various sectors and forms from the perspective of a market economy has become prominent (====).====Second, since the implementation of the strategy to ¡°Revitalizing China through Science and Education¡± in 1995,==== China has maintained a consistently high-level investment in knowledge production, transforming the country from a silent observer to a major player in the international research arena.====). As academic resource constraints are tight and the number of researchers is rapidly increasing, researchers are compelled to compete for resources in an early stage to obtain follow-up benefits (====). This distorts their efforts and incentivizes excessive effort in managing ¡°relationships¡± and lobbying, as opposed to conducting research to advance knowledge (====).====Finally, there are obvious flaws in many Chinese economics journals' review processes. Unlike most international journals, editorships are mostly full-time jobs in China, and the editors are not necessarily academic researchers themselves. Rather than being recommended through academic referrals, these editors are often directly appointed by an editorial office, which itself is usually a government-affiliated unit or is overseen by a higher-level government institution.==== A large number of submissions are desk rejected by Chinese journals based on these editors' own assessment, even if their professional background is far away from the subject area.==== As they are not familiar with the academic content of research, including the literature and research methods, it remains a black box how the editors actually evaluate the quality of submitted research. This then raises the suspicion that authors' publication records and social status, among other considerations, could become important references of information that can influence an editorial decision.====Our research is directly related to the literature regarding the ¡°Matthew Effect¡± among researchers, which refers to the phenomenon of productive researchers becoming even more productive relative to others (====; ====; ====; ====). ====, ==== found that a frequently cited economist attracts new citations that are often disproportionate to the quality of their articles. Notably, the sample in ==== was limited to only 100 economists, leading to an insufficient representation of the sample, whereas the sample in ==== includes only citation information, making it difficult to effectively control for individual differences between researchers. More importantly, as the citation data are based on peer reference, it is far from comprehensive as a measure of the ¡°Matthew Effect,¡± which describes a process of self-enhancement. This paper employs a much larger sample collected with more individual-level information to explicitly study the process of ¡°self-enhancement¡± through subsequent publications, external grant capture, and accolades. This paper not only estimates the ¡°Matthew Effect¡± in the Chinese economics research community, but also speaks about the general literature on the ¡°Matthew Effect¡± by investigating possible underlying misallocation and attempting to explain this phenomenon through specific channels.====Recent studies have also identified the role of ¡°relationships¡± (or ¡°guanxi¡± in the Chinese context) in generating misallocation in producing knowledge. For example, findings regarding the ¡°club effect¡± of citation found in the literature (====; ====) indicate that researchers may form a cross-reference group. A number of studies on collaborative motivations (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) find that the number of collaborations in journal publication is rising, and this is attributed to factors such as information sharing and collaboration efficiency. ==== distinguish collaborators between junior and senior researchers, identifying a difference in the long-term benefits of the cooperation between the two, with senior partners being more likely to benefit from the cooperation. In a recent study on China, ==== present notable findings regarding the impact of relationships in the allocation of some of the most prestigious research resources in China. They focus on the influence of relationships on the awarding of fellowships by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of engineering (the Chinese equivalents of the US National Academy of Sciences and the US National Academy of Engineering, respectively), finding that although relationships do not appear to affect the first-stage selection, it has a significant impact on second-stage selection outcomes. In particular, candidates with relationships with existing fellows are more likely to be selected as a new fellow.====; ====). Researchers who have published in influential journals are more likely to earn reputations and are more valued by editors and grant reviewers, making it easier for them to continue to publish work in these exclusive outlets.====Using hand-collected data on 875 economics researchers spread across 19 research-intensive universities, we examine the relationship between past publications and subsequent academic achievements. We mitigate the influences of spurious correlations in the following ways. First, we adopt a ¡°difference-in-difference¡± (DID) strategy and focuses on investigating the differential effect of previous publication on researchers' subsequent performance. Second, we conduct a series of robustness checks to assess the influence of authorship, differences in journals, change of jobs, and research ability, proxied by observable measures. Third, we control for researcher fixed effects to rule out the influence of time-invariant characteristics of researchers, and institution-year fixed effects to absorb policy shocks at the institution level. Finally, employing an event-study method to estimate the differences in publications before and after particular publication events, we examine the time patterns of publication persistence.====The benchmark result demonstrates that compared with researchers who have not published any papers in leading journals, those with at least one publication in a leading journal publish more papers in subsequent years (a 12.4% increase in total annual publication). This pattern is reaffirmed using an event-study approach. We also find that observable variables fail to explain the majority of the correlation between past and subsequent publications, suggesting that misallocation might have an important influence on driving the persistence of publication in exclusive outlets.====As we are unable to rule out the effect of the unobserved research capability for which we do not have an explicit measure, we control for this channel indirectly by checking the effect of past publication in the top two Chinese journals or in international journals. The publications in the top two Chinese outlets represent the highest level of economics research published in the Chinese language. We find the ¡°Matthew Effect¡± associated with these publications to be either short-lived or highly correlated with researchers' managerial positions, a finding that is consistent with those in ====. This contradicts the possibility of a substantial improvement in capability as the main driver of continued publication in those exclusive Chinese outlets. Turning to international publications, if the experience of publication in leading Chinese journals leads to substantially improved research ability, it may be expected that the researchers' work will be published in international journals, either individually or collaboratively, for even wider research impact and more career benefits.==== However, this effect is found to be considerably weak compared to the baseline results, indicating that an improvement in ability, including the ability to find and work with collaborators who have experience in international publication, is unlikely to happen immediately following publication in leading Chinese journals.====Our extended study offers additional interesting findings. First, publishing papers in leading Chinese journals benefits male researchers more, whereas publishing papers in international journals benefits female researchers more. Second, publishing papers in leading Chinese journals benefits job switchers more, whereas publishing papers in international journals benefits non-job switchers more. Third, publishing papers in leading journals benefits researchers who published earlier more. Fourth, the benefits of publishing papers in leading journals decreases with time.====In summary, this contributes to the aforementioned literature in three grounds. First, we build a novel dataset of the academic trajectories of a large number of economists in China, which allows us to estimate the ¡°Matthew Effect¡± in economics research in a more systematic way. Second, we examine the heterogeneous relationship between researchers' past and future achievements to shed light on academic resource misallocation. Third, we tentatively investigate the possible channels through which misallocation occurs in knowledge production in China, revealing patterns that are compatible with the institutional background of Chinese academia.====The remainder of the paper proceeds is organized into six sections. ==== introduces the data and variables. ==== provides the summary statistics and stylized facts. ==== presents the baseline results and a battery of additional checks. ==== investigates the patterns of academic resource misallocation and possible mechanisms. ==== reports additional findings related to the heterogeneities of the results that can potentially explain the misallocation.

Further analysis suggests that education may affect health and health behaviors through two channels: the resources acquired by individuals and the prices faced by them.","The causal effect of education on health is a popular topic among economists. It is a key parameter in the classical model of demand for health (====; ====).====Many studies have investigated the importance of education as a determinant of individuals' health outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Most of these studies focus on compulsory schooling law reform and estimate health returns to primary or secondary education. However, the evidence for the causal effect of higher education on health is limited, and most of the existing studies are based on data from developed countries (====; ====; ====; ====). Few studies have estimated health returns to higher education in developing countries, although the positive correlation between college education and health is obvious. For example, using the 2000 and 2010 census data in China, we find that the 10-year mortality rate for individuals aged 60¨C64?years old in 2000 was 1.6% among those with college and advanced degrees, which is 13.4 times smaller than that for those without college degrees. This study aims to fill this gap by exploiting the college enrollment expansion reform in China.====Our study mainly contributes to two strands of literature. First, our study relates to the broad empirical literature on the health returns to education. Existing research mostly uses changes in the compulsory education law to estimate the causal effect of primary or secondary education on health or health behaviors (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). By exploiting the massive college enrollment expansion in China beginning in 1999, this study estimates the health returns to college education. Our findings support the argument by ==== that the influence of education may be greater at higher levels of education, rather than lower levels of education.

Previous analyses have mainly focused on the effect of this policy on employment, income, household consumption, and industrial productivity (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).

A finer-grained empirical analysis supports that firms led by managers with R&D hands-on experience are associated with high innovation productivity. Using the mediation effect models, we uncover three underlying economic mechanisms that possibly explain the relation between R&D experience and innovation; the transformation effect, the information effect, and the resource effect. Furthermore, we find that R&D experience is critical for senior managers (CEO and co-CEO) and junior managers (other executives) in spurring corporate innovation and their combination substantially contributes to increased innovation productivity; however, our findings suggest junior managers play a more fundamental role while senior managers play a leadership role. We also find that managerial R&D experience enhances more innovation in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than in non-SOEs. Our conclusions are consistent with the learning by doing theory that specialist managers with hands-on experience are more critical for technological innovation.","The upper echelon theory posits that managers' characteristics are essential in shaping a firm's strategy and performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, most studies on manager characteristics and firm innovation outcomes narrow their analyses on CEO characteristics==== and focus less on top management team skills (====; ====). The entire management team's prior experience is potentially more important for long-term explorative success than just the CEO's skill set (====). Regardless of this caveat, there is less focus in the literature on how the management team's prior working experience and related mechanisms influence technological innovation. In particular, there is less evidence in the literature on the implications of employing top managers with R&D hands-on experience as agents to drive corporate innovation. R&D working experience is an important factor for innovation decision making, but surprisingly there is still little focus in the literature on the top management team's prior innovation experience.====This paper, drawing from the upper echelon theory and learning by doing theory, analyzes the implications of managerial R&D experience on firm innovation activities. Theoretical and empirical studies support that hands-on experience enhances an individual's decision-making ability to formulate, evaluate and execute corporate strategic plans (====; ====; ====). In our context, we argue that hands-on experience is particularly more important for innovation projects that are complex and risky (====). Innovation activities require exceptional talent to evaluate the potential value and limitations of various innovation projects. In addition, innovation requires a long-term explorative mindset that tolerates early failure (====; ====). Thus, we hypothesize that managerial R&D experience improves the manager's cognitive ability and fosters the patience needed to nurture breakthrough inventions. However, specialist managers may impede innovation by being fixated on their ideas and not embracing new or different ideas that lie out of their technical expertise due to biases originating from past experiences (====). Furthermore, managers with specific prior knowledge in the R&D department may also neglect other critical areas like sales and marketing that support firm-level innovation productivity (====). Therefore, whether specialized functional experience related to innovation matters for firm-level innovation is still an empirical question that requires further investigation.====To solve the above research gaps, this paper examines whether top management R&D hands-on experience affects firm innovation policy using a sample of Chinese listed companies. First, we obtain all managerial team members' working experience data from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database and listed companies' annual reports. We then identify all managers who worked in the R&D departments or institutions before joining the company's top management team. Next, we analyze the impact of top management R&D hands-on experience on innovation productivity. Our baseline results show that firms that have top managers with R&D experience obtain more ==== than those whose top managers have no prior R&D experience.==== Our findings suggest that junior managers with R&D hands-on experience play a more fundamental role in promoting innovation than senior managers. Our results also indicate that a combination of senior managers with R&D experience and junior managers with R&D experience substantially contributes to increased innovation productivity.====We also examine the heterogeneous effects of R&D hands-on experience on corporate innovation between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). One particular feature of SOEs is that they have more resources and less financing constraints (====). Therefore, if SOE executive managers with R&D experience have high innovation abilities and strong risk preferences, these firms are more likely to show better innovation performance than private firms with fewer resources. Consistent with our expectations, we find that R&D hands-on experience plays a more significant role in promoting enterprise innovation in SOEs than non-SOEs.====Our study contributes to three streams of literature in several ways. First, we complement the growing body of research that studies the effect of top management team characteristics (====; ====) and CEO characteristics (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) on corporate innovation. In contrast to these studies that solely focus on CEO characteristics, we move in a new direction and analyze the impact of the management team's R&D experience and underlying mechanisms on corporate innovation. We also provide a new perspective by comparing senior and junior managers' roles within the management team. Prior literature does not extensively discuss the differences between the CEO and non-CEO manager characteristics and their corresponding impacts on firm innovation policies.====Second, we contribute to firm ownership research by examining how state ownership influences the relationship between manager team characteristics and corporate innovation. Existing research on manager characteristics and corporate innovation focuses less on the influence of state ownership on this link. This paper does not only discuss the heterogeneous effects of firm ownership on this issue but goes on to compare the impact of senior managers and junior managers with R&D hands-on experience in SOEs and non-SOEs.====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our paper adds to this literature by documenting that the manager's prior hands-on technical experience increases firm value via firm innovation.====We proceed as follows: In Section 2, we build on prior works and explain how prior R&D experience can influence firm innovation productivity. Section 3 contains the methodology. We present the baseline results and underlying mechanisms in Section 4. Section 5 compares the effects of senior managers and junior managers with R&D experience, while Section 6 compares the effects of R&D experience for firms with different ownership.

The high income that comes with a high educational attainment ensures investment expenditures in children's education and also transmits the idea of valuing education to children, creating a family-oriented educational climate (====). Studies based on the overlapping generations' model show that parents with a high educational attainment have longer life expectancies and thus a stronger willingness to invest in their own education as well as that of their children (====). Thus, highly educated parents' preferences for education appear to be internalized and transmitted between generations. The increase in educational levels in the society as a whole has led to a decline in the income of highly educated individuals, generating a wage compression effect (====). The value return of education in the labor market has decreased (====). In addition, a structural imbalance between the level of demand for talent and its supply has arisen, while the threshold for entry into the workforce has been continuously raised from the employment side of the economic equation. This has led to the widespread phenomenon of low employment amidst a highly educated labor force. The above factors have notably changed the opportunity cost-benefit evaluation by parents with high levels of education towards their children's education, raising the important question as to whether they still advocate for more education for their children.====The exploration is a primary part of understanding the complex issue of the intergenerational transmission of education. This is because positive educational expectations lead families to invest more economic and parenting capital, which influences the ultimate educational achievement of their children (====; ====In 1979, China formally implemented a ¡°one-child¡± family planning policy, that is, the one-child policy, which advocates that a couple should have only one child and that a second child can be born only if the first child has a serious physical or mental disability.

It was found that one-child policy compliers have lower educational expectations for their children after acquiring advanced education than those who did not, and this finding remains valid after the robustness analysis and placebo tests. The interaction term estimates and rolling regressions that consider the intergenerational effects of birth tell us that there are significant differences in the marginal effects of educational attainment on educational expectations among parents who grew up in different time periods.

Of the many dimensions of income inequality, we explore four, analysing a rich data set for China. Does actual or perceived inequality have a greater effect on happiness? We find that perceptions of inequality are the more important. How broad is the reference group with which people compare themselves? They report that it is narrow; and indeed narrowly defined inequality has the greater effect on happiness. Do perceptions of the degree of fairness of inequality matter? They do, as they ameliorate the adverse effect of inequality on happiness, especially for the poorest. Is it self-centred or community-based inequality which affects happiness? Both measures have significant effects, but in opposite directions. The research and policy implications are discussed.","The effect of ==== on happiness is an issue that should intrigue social scientists. It is one that sits uncomfortably with much conventional economics. Yet it goes back a long way: both Adam Smith and Karl Marx argued that happiness depends not only on one's own income but also, negatively, on the income of others relative to one's own. We live in society, and it is likely that we evaluate our lives in relation to society. Results from playing the experimental Ultimatum Game (designed to test perceptions of fairness) show that people in many contexts are willing to forgo absolute income in order to avoid lower relative income. In many countries inequality and redistribution are central issues in public discourse and economic policy-making, often implying that a reduction of inequality is considered to be good for the well-being of society.====Income inequality is widely researched but there is inadequate discussion of the concepts and measures that are appropriate for normative and policy purposes. We need to think beyond measures of the national ====. Our approach is to estimate happiness functions in order to discover which forms of inequality are important for subjective well-being. We define inequality as household differences in income per capita. Thus, it encompasses both the inequality of an income distribution among households and the income of each household relative to other households.====This study explores the relationships between income inequality and happiness in ways that remain under-researched. For instance, in a comprehensive albeit now dated survey of the literature on the effect of inequality on happiness, ==== had little to say about any of the distinctions that will be addressed. The opportunity to do so arises because of the data available in the China Household Income Project (CHIP) surveys. They enable us to analyse interesting aspects of the relationship between income inequality and happiness, a relationship made complex by conceptual and measurement issues and the various channels of influence.==== provides the setting and explains relevant aspects of the data. We then pose four questions. ====, is happiness sensitive, or more sensitive, to actual or perceived income inequalities? Most happiness studies analyse only actual inequality, normally because actual inequality is the only measured variable available. However, because happiness itself is a subjective variable, it is plausible that inequality as subjectively perceived has the greater influence on happiness. This issue is addressed in ====, first by summarising the relevant literature, second by setting out the hypothesis to be examined and the hypothesis tests to be applied, and third by conducting the tests.====, does broadly or narrowly defined inequality have an impact, or a greater impact, on happiness? Some happiness studies analyse quite broad comparator groups, normally because these are the only data available. Much depends on the information about others that people possess: poorly informed people are likely to have narrow orbits of comparison. It is important to identify people's reference groups, and to analyse the relevant comparator incomes. ==== does this under the same three sub-headings.====, we pose the question: does the effect on happiness differ according to whether inequality is perceived to be fair or unfair? It is plausible, and also supported by evidence, that people are willing to accept inequality if they perceive it to be fair but unwilling if it seems to be unfair. ==== reviews the literature and tests the hypothesis with proxies for fairness and unfairness available in the data.====, does self-centred or community-based inequality have an impact, or a greater impact, on happiness? Income inequality can affect happiness through two different channels. One concerns the distribution of income in relation to the individual's income. The other concerns the distribution of income irrespective of the individual's place in that distribution. Both channels can affect happiness, but the literature often analyses only one or other of them. In ==== we analyse both, contrasting the two notions and their corresponding variables under the same three sub-headings.====The literature on the effects of inequality on happiness has grown rapidly in recent years. A more up-to-date literature survey (====) contained direct discussions of three of our four questions: choice of reference group, the moderating effect of fairness, and the distinction between comparative and normative inequality. Nevertheless, our case study and data set make it possible to contribute to that literature. We will suggest that perceptions of inequality are more important for happiness than actual inequality, that inequality when more narrowly defined has a greater effect on happiness, that perceptions of fairness ameliorate the adverse effect of inequality on happiness, and that both self-centred and community-based inequality have significant effects on happiness but in opposite directions. ==== concludes, reflects, and examines the implications of the results for research and for policy.

Specifically, it looks at how clan culture decreases the risk-taking of Chinese enterprises. Using a unique dataset, which combines the pedigree density and distribution of publicly listed Chinese enterprises in city-regions, we document that a 1% increase in regional pedigree density dramatically decreases the risk-taking of locally listed enterprises by 2.66%. Furthermore, this paper verifies that in places with a strong clan culture, senior executives (presidents and CEOs) make their enterprises more conservative, taking on the responsibility of protecting the interests and maintaining stability of the clan, and the reputation of them in the clan. Such enterprises have relatively stable business networks and are unwilling to carry out high-risk innovations and cross-city M&As. In addition, their senior executives (presidents and CEOs) are more stable, with longer tenure and a lower frequency of replacement. Finally, the paper notes that improvements in formal institutions could mitigate the negative relationship between clan culture and corporate risk-taking.","Clan culture has a strong effect on China's social and economic development, including corporate behaviors (====; ====; ====). This paper specifically examines how clan culture decreases risk-taking in Chinese enterprises. Corporate risk-taking describes the willingness of companies to take risks in the pursuit of high profits, an important characteristic of successful enterprises. However, to the best of our knowledge, few empirical studies have documented the causal role of clan culture in shaping corporate risk-taking.====Clan culture is a longstanding cultural tradition in China (====), along with (and contrasted against) western-style city-state. Clan culture is arguably one of the two major foundations of institutions around the world (====). The earliest Chinese enterprises were primarily clan- or family-based enterprises, and rich in traditional clan culture. They were central to the construction of the modern enterprise system following China's reform and opening-up policy. Many even developed into listed enterprises. A well-known example is Tongrentang (Í¬ÈÊÌÃ), one of the largest pharmaceutical enterprises in China,==== established in what is now Beijing, by the Lue clan in 1669?CE (The eighth year of Kangxi, Qing Dynasty). In the early 20th century, Tongrentang was transformed into a modern enterprise. In 1954, it implemented a public-private partnership, and was then listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1997. Today, members of the Lue clan no longer serve as the president, CEO, or senior executives of Tongrentang, but those who do have studied at or worked for Tongrentang for many years. Despite having existed for more than 300?years, and indeed now being a major listed company, Tongrentang still mainly sells traditional Chinese medicine, especially Angong Niuhuang Wan (°²¹¬Å£»ÆÍè), in addition to a few other famous new products and businesses. Our research traces the connections between the consistency of Tongrentang's contemporary portfolio and its historical longevity.====The development of Tongrentang initially suggests that clan culture affects the proclivity of Chinese enterprises towards risk-taking. In regions with strong clan culture, the development of new enterprises often benefits from clan support. In return, the enterprises take on the responsibility of guaranteeing the stability and long-term interests of the clan. Equally, clan culture emphasizes reputation, making enterprises and their executives afraid of defaults, or other losses that may cause great reputational harm to the clan. Therefore, we hypothesized that enterprises in regions with strong clan culture would be less willing to engage in high-risk projects.====To investigate this hypothesis, we tested the causal effect of clan culture on enterprises risk-taking in China. We used a sample of 2843 Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2001 to 2016, yielding a total of 25,638 observations. We assumed that enterprises located in regions with higher clan culture would show lower degrees of risk-taking behavior.====For clan culture, we used city-level pedigree density as a proxy to measure the strength of regional culture. ¡°Pedigree¡± is defined by family genealogy records that address all descendants of common ancestry. We used the logarithm of the number of pedigrees in a given city scaled by the city-region population (it is worth noting that in China, the concept of ¡°city¡± customarily denotes a ¡°city region¡±, which includes both urban areas and countryside administrated by the city). This pedigree-driven measure of clan culture is consistent with numerous studies focusing on the role of clan culture in China (====; ====; ====; ====).====For corporate risk-taking, we used the volatility of corporate earnings as a proxy (====; ====; ====). We then used panel data regressions to empirically identify the relationship between regional clan culture and enterprise risk-taking. Our results show that a 1% increase in the strength of clan culture leads to a significant 2.66% decrease in risk-taking by local enterprises, which strongly supports our hypothesis that clan culture plays a substantial role in reducing enterprise risk-taking.====Additionally, we did a series of further tests to confirm the robustness of the above measures. Such tests included using alternative variables of risk-taking and clan culture, and an alternative sample that eliminated enterprises from Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen,====The first additional test was aimed at ruling out the potential explanations for the causal relationship between clan culture and risk-taking. We eliminated the samples from Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and removed the samples from treaty port cities. We also used DID to rule out the effects of government corruption. The results again solidly confirmed our predictions.====Following ====, we further addressed potential endogenous problems with a falsification test and an epidemiological approach analysis. In the falsification test, we found that the relationship between clan culture and risk-taking only exists in Han areas, and is not significant in ethnic minorities autonomous regions. In the epidemiological approach, we found that an enterprise's risk-taking is affected by the local clan culture of the firm rather than the clan culture of the birthplace of the president and CEO.====After confirming the initial results, we tried to locate the specific mechanisms that would explain why those enterprises located in regions with a strong clan culture tended to have lower levels of risk-taking. When taking clan culture into consideration, we believe that executives are more conservative, and take on the responsibility of maintaining clan stability and safeguarding clan interests, and want to improve their reputation. We find that enterprises in cities with strong clan culture have relatively stable business networks, and are thus unwilling to carry out high-risk innovations and cross-city M&As. In addition, the senior executives (presidents and CEOs) of these risk-averse enterprises are more stable, with longer tenures and lower frequencies of replacement. The empirical results of our study indicate that listed companies in regions with strong clan culture are more reluctant to take risks. In order to demonstrate the relationship between clan culture and executive responsibility and reputation, we separate samples to regress by whether the president or CEO is local to the area, whether the president or CEO belongs to the local top three surnames, and separate the samples into three groups: POEs; local SOEs; central SOEs.====Finally, we asked whether formal institutions could alleviate the role of clan culture in corporate risk-taking. If our measure of clan culture is dominated by city effects, then the influence of clan culture on risk-taking will not be impaired by formal institutions. To test this idea, we examined how marketization institutions weaken the effects of clan culture, as predicted by ====. Using the marketization index developed by ==== and the so-called Fangang index, to denote the regional impact of formal institutions, we find that higher levels of regional marketization weaken the links between clan culture and an enterprise's risk-taking. These results confirm that formal institutions decrease the influence of clan culture on corporate risk-taking, further confirming the validity of our measure of clan culture.====This paper makes several contributions to the existing scholarship. Firstly, most existing studies on corporate risk-taking prioritize internal factors and external market factors; very few investigate the sociocultural dimensions of risk-taking (====; ====; ====; ====). By working from the distinctive perspective of China's distinct clan culture, this paper investigates the effects of sociological factors on corporate risk-taking, and thereby partly addresses an important gap amongst existing research on corporate risk-taking.====Secondly, research on clan culture tends to adopt the perspectives of sociology and anthropology (====; ====; ====). Whilst there exist a few papers with nascent interests in the microeconomic effects of clan culture, little research covers the question of how clan culture influences the decisions and operations of corporations (====; ====; ====Thirdly, this paper provides empirical evidence that clan culture can be used to stimulate economic development. Therefore, it offers a practical dimension in terms of public policy. Our work demonstrates that a reasonable level of risk-taking can improve the efficiency of resource allocation and promote economic development (====; ====; ====). Consequently, results from this study have implications for social and cultural governance and corporate operations.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 details the conceptual framework of our work and outlines the three hypotheses for our tests; Section 3 describes the methodology; Section 4 discusses the empirical results; Section 5 analyzes the possible mechanisms for these results; Section 6 is the heterogeneity test; Section 7 concludes and reviews broader arguments from the findings.",Clan culture and risk-taking of Chinese enterprises,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000219,11-Feb-22,2022,Research Article,172

Using a Logit regression, we find that an increase in a parent's education level significantly raises their child's probability of entering university. Moreover, the effects of parental involvement and children's trust towards their parents on university entrance are highly significant. The results are robust to Probit and Linear-Probability-Model specifications. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that for rural and/or worse-educated families, parental involvement significantly affects the child's access to university, while for urban and/or better-educated families, the child's own study attitude is key for progression to university. To address the confounder of genetic inheritance, we use regression discontinuity and two-stage least squares and find that the nine-year compulsory ==== launched in 1986 not only increased the education years of the first generation by about 1.66 years, but has also had a lasting effect by raising the second generation's probability of access to university by 11.77%.","The HE expansion has opened the door for some of the next generation to consolidate the economic gains of their parents and for others to improve their economic standing through a university qualification. As such, the advantage of undertaking HE among children was understood, and enjoyed, by two groups of people: those with slightly better levels of education in the countryside, where average education tends to be low, and those in the urban middle class whose parents would encourage them to enroll. The rest of society has thus far been somewhat left behind.====Up until the late 1970s, the importance of education in China was severely undermined. Children from highly educated families had no suitable employment opportunities and therefore no real incentive to pursue higher education. When the college entrance exam was restored in 1977, children from both low and highly educated families were recruited into the higher-education system. Higher-education inequality was perhaps at its historically lowest level during that period. However, since the late 1990s, higher-education inequality has been rising again, for several reasons. First, many of the new middle-class parents are from the grassroots class and are themselves beneficiaries of the reforms to higher education. They would thus pass on the ideology of the importance of education to their children. Second, ==== inequality has developed and children of better-educated parents have received greater input in terms of educational expenditure. Third, many constraints of the ¡°hukou¡± system have been loosened while the market economy has developed vigorously. Thus, rural children have been able to migrate to cities, settling for blue-collar jobs, making studying for degrees less attractive and less monetarily rewarding, at least in the short run. Overall, the problem of higher-education inequality is closely connected to the development of China's economy. In fact, the problem is expected to become more intense in the near future, with deepening marketization and wealth inequality.====Since initiating its Reform and Opening-Up policy in 1978, China has witnessed the emergence of a large and growing middle class. This middle-class population is characterized by urban-hukou status and generous public-sector positions which are associated with guarantees of employment for life and a high level of social security, as well as significant barriers to entry. Over time, the first generation of the post-reform middle class has put great effort into maintaining or improving on its children's middle-class status, by making full use of its monetary wealth as well as its human and social capital. As a result, social mobility has been rather limited. Today, ¡°a noble son coming from a poor family¡±, as the old Chinese saying goes, is a rare occurrence indeed.====In this context, from an individual perspective, the best way a lower-class child can break the social boundaries is still through higher education, by aiming for acceptance at a university. There has been significant change in the economic returns to schooling. Estimates of the rate of return are in the range of 1.4¨C1.9% for urban areas vs 0.0¨C2.6% for rural areas in the pre-reform period (before 1978); thereafter, the estimated returns increase to 3.3¨C9.0% for the full sample, 1.5¨C12.1% for the urban sample and up to 4.8% for the rural sample (====). These estimates are consistent with the experiences of other Central and East European countries that went through the transition from a planned economy to a market economy and saw rising returns to education in post-reform years (====; ====).====Higher-education expansion is also known to have increased educational inequality in other countries. For example, in the UK, higher-education expansion disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families and widened participation gaps between children from rich and poor families from the 1970s to the 1990s (====). Similarly, ==== find tradeoffs between HE expansion and equalizing opportunities across different groups of countries including liberal-market countries, social-democratic countries and East Asian societies. The problem described here is by no means unique to China as it applies to many other regions of the world.====In this paper, we study university entrance as a proxy for social mobility, and the role of parental input in raising the odds of university entrance, within the context of the higher-education expansion in China since 1999. As ==== points out, there has been very little solid evidence of intergenerational educational mobility following the educational expansion. We investigate the effects of parents' education levels, the time they spend with their children, as well as their investments in private tutoring, on university entrance during the period of educational expansion. This study highlights the effects of HE expansion on two groups of people (and their children): those with slightly higher education in the countryside (aiming to better themselves economically) and the urban middle class (aiming to consolidate previous economic gains). According to our analysis, policy makers can evaluate how effective the higher-education expansion has been and explore the best way to advance social mobility.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This paper shows the optimality of a two-tier salary scheme in internal labor markets. It identifies the conditions under which discretionary promotion is better than rule-based promotion and vice versa.====We consider an employment relationship between a principal (the owner) and an agent (a manager). As in real life, the employment relationship in our model includes a salary package and a possibility of promotion. A two-tier salary system with promotion offers two different salary schemes before and after promotion. We focus on two issues: the optimality of a two-tier salary system with promotion and the conditions under which discretionary promotion is better than rule-based promotion and vice versa. Our model allows various risks in internal labor markets, including the risk of facing a high replacement cost of human capital for the firm and the risk of having a low human capital agent. We also consider the impact of an expected replacement cost of human capital and a productivity improvement resulting from a job promotion. We investigate what effects these factors may have on the employment relationship.====We use the standard principal-agent model with verifiable output and unverifiable inputs (called efforts). In addition, we allow the principal to have an additional control option, which is contractable ex ante and exercisable ex post. This control option is a promotion option. The principal may choose to write the option into a contract or leave it out. If the promotion option is in the contract, the principal commits to a promotion rule (rule-based promotion); if the promotion option is not in the contract, the principal can offer promotion at discretion (discretionary promotion). Besides, the promotion option is tied in with the salary package in that the salary structure may change with promotion. Under this model, will the salary scheme be linear in performance? Will the salary scheme be contingent on promotion? Will discretionary promotion be better than rule-based promotion? Under what circumstances would the principal prefer discretionary promotion to rule-based promotion and vice versa?====The theme of our study is like that of ====, which compares two alternative compensation schemes: one based on the rank of individual output and the other based on the value of individual output. They discuss various circumstances involving risk and ability, under which one scheme is better than the other. Our theme is similar to theirs in that we compare two alternative promotion schemes: one based on rule-based promotion and the other based on discretionary promotion. Our two compensation schemes are completely different from theirs. We also discuss various circumstances involving risk, cost and human capital, under which one form of promotion scheme is better than the other.====In internal markets, firms are observed to offer tiers of salary and different promotion possibilities. As pointed out by ====, typically focuses on one particular type of contract. Another difference is that we discuss an endogenous combination of promotion and a salary scheme, while the existing literature only focuses on either one.====In our model, promotion has two potential benefits for the principal: (1) a new job may be more suitable for the manager; (2) the possibility of promotion is an incentive for the agent (a substitute for a monetary payment). Comparing the two types of promotion, discretionary promotion is based on a more suitable job for the agent, while rule-based promotion focuses on better incentives for the agent. We assume that effort is observable ex post, while the agent's human capital is not observable but identifiable by observing the effort. Hence, after one period, the principal can observe the effort and identify the human capital of the agent. The agent has two reasons to work for promotion: (1) promotion is accompanied by a salary raise; (2) the agent is more productive in a more suitable job. Considering the above factors, we investigate the conditions under which discretionary promotion is better than rule-based promotion and vice versa. Coupled with empirical evidence, we provide a theory on contractual solutions with two promotion types and two salary tiers.====Our findings are as follows. First, a two-tier linear salary system is optimal. That is, a linear pay package is optimal, and the pay structure is contingent on promotion. In particular, the pay scheme offers a fixed pay before promotion, and it is linear in performance after promotion. This two-tier linear salary system is optimal for both discretionary promotion and rule-based promotion. Second, if the firm's expected replacement cost of human capital is high, discretionary promotion is superior. Third, if the difference in human capital among agents is small, discretionary promotion is superior. Fourth, if the risk of facing a high replacement cost of human capital ex post is high, discretionary promotion is superior. Fifth, if the chance of having an agent with high human capital is high, rule-based promotion is likely to be superior. Finally, if the productivity improvement from a job promotion is large, rule-based promotion is likely to be superior.====We contribute to research on contingent monetary and non-monetary incentives (promotion/career concerns) in internal labor markets. Our work is based on the incomplete-contract approach (====; ====, ====; ====). Our non-committal contract with discretionary promotion is an incomplete contract, while our committal contract with rule-based promotion is a complete contract. In practice, firms have different degrees of commitment to promotion prospects. Tenure-track contracts in universities are such examples. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the rational choice between discretionary promotion and rule-based promotion. We find that the relative advantages of discretionary promotion versus rule-based promotion depend on risks and incentives. Discretionary promotion is better at controlling risks, whereas rule-based promotion is better at inducing incentives. Emphasizing the agent's ability, ==== find that the agent's ability is the common driver that drives both wage growth and promotion, ==== find a positive correlation between wage growth and promotion, and ==== show that the agent's ability is a crucial factor in the relative efficiency of their rank-order tournament compensation scheme. We also emphasize the agent's ability, called human capital. We find that the principal tends to adopt rule-based promotion if the agent is of high ability, consistent with the findings of ==== and ====. Conditional on specific human capital, ==== finds that a contract in which the wage is dependent on seniority (relative tenure) induces efficient turnover. This finding is consistent with the structure of our optimal promotion contract. We further investigate whether or not the promotion option should be discretionary or rule-based. We also discuss internal promotion versus external promotion. ==== and ==== investigate external recruitment versus internal promotion. Chan finds that most promotions in a corporation are through internal promotions rather than external recruitments, whereas Lambertides finds that external recruitments are better than internal promotions in terms of firm performance. In our model, the principal may promote internally or recruit externally, depending on ex-post market conditions. We find that internal promotion is more likely under a committal contract.====We not only compare discretionary promotion with rule-based promotion, but also take into account different salary schemes before and after promotion. A vast empirical literature, including ==== and ====, indicates a critical role of stock options in managers' pay packages. The structure of our optimal contract (in Propositions 1 and 2) supports this finding. The bonus component in our contract is implementable by a stock option. Our solution further indicates that the stock option should apply to managers after promotion, but not to ordinary employees before promotion. ==== argue that since output is often unverifiable, promotion is an alternative incentive. In contrast, we show that promotion offers an effective incentive even if output is verifiable. In our model, promotion offers a complementary incentive to monetary incentives. ==== empirical study finds that ¡°promotions are the dominant factor in establishing the wage pattern.¡± This is consistent with the structure of our optimal contract, which associates promotion with a bonus wage structure. They also find a clear incentive effect of promotion, which is also consistent with our theory. We show that the agent's pay increases rely on promotion. This is consistent with observations in the literature (====; ====; ====). For example, ==== finds that promotion is ¡°the primary means by which workers can increase their long-run compensation.¡±====Our theory has many unique implications for different promotion mechanisms between SOEs and private firms, especially regarding China. These two types of firms compete in the marketplace for resources, including human resources. Our analysis offers guidance to SOE reforms in China. Promotion in SOEs is determined by the government (====; ====; ====), while promotion in private firms is determined by market mechanisms. Consequently, the quality of state-appointed managers is highly uncertain, whereas the cost of market-selected managers tends to be high. The government often carries out interventions involving SOE reforms and policy implementations. There is a high level of heterogeneity in organizational responses to state intervention. Our theory attributes this heterogeneity to differences in underlying factors, such as labor replacement cost, labor quality, and risk in labor quality.====Although our empirical work is specific to China, our theory is applicable to any country's internal labor markets. Promotion-based incentives are widely used in practice, and promotion-related research covers a wide range of issues in academics. Our paper offers unique contributions to the literature. We provide justifications on why fixed hourly rate contracts and performance-based contracts are popular in both developed and developing countries. Also, both discretionary promotion and rule-based promotion are widely observed in the business world. Our theory derives conditions under which one is superior to the other.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Section 3 sets up the model. Section 4 derives the optimal committal contract (with rule-based promotion) and the optimal non-committal contract (with discretionary promotion). A two-tier linear pay package with promotion is shown to be optimal for both contracts. Section 5 studies various circumstances under which the committal contract may be inferior or superior to the non-committal contract. Section 6 offers empirical evidence in support of our theory. Section 7 discusses policy implications for China and other countries. Section 8 concludes with some remarks.

This dataset is fitful for our research for several reasons. First, detailed information of patient home addresses and pollution data enable us to establish exposure relationships instead of using the exposure relationships at medical sites. Second, the medical records for patients are helpful for us to investigate the types of diseases directly caused by ozone exposure. What's more, the expenditure records allow us to estimate the medical burden caused by ozone pollution.====We use the emergency room diagnosis records of the largest general hospital in Weihai from 2007 to 2018 to identify the number of weekly admission room visits in each township. The detailed patient address and admission time information ensure the accurate identification of patients' current pollution exposure. Based on the diagnosis content, we calculate the number of patients for the respiratory, ophthalmology, and internal medicine departments. Respiratory and ophthalmological diseases are the main hazards of short-term ozone exposure, and internal medicine is the department for multiple diseases. We calculate the weekly average ozone concentration and particular matters concentration of each township using the real-time air pollution data disclosed by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) from 2014 to 2020. We accurately identify short-term pollution exposure with detailed patient residence information.====Furthermore, the overall air pollution level in Weihai is lower than the national air quality standards most of the time, and the haze problem in the city almost does not exist. Such a condition greatly reduces people's attention to air pollution, thereby reducing the bias caused by avoidance behavior to our estimation to a certain extent.====We identify the contemporaneous health effects of ozone using high-frequency data with a linear model controlling regional fixed effects and year by month fixed effects. We also control the lag effect of ozone, other pollutants, and weather conditions. Our results show that ozone pollution significantly increases the emergency room visits for respiratory, ophthalmology, and internal medicine departments. In particular, one ==== increase in ozone pollution will result in an additional 3.30, 2.25, and 4.94 weekly emergency room admissions in respiratory, ophthalmology, and internal medicine, respectively.====To alleviate the concerns of endogeneity, we document the evidence that residual variation in weekly ozone pollution is large after controlling other pollutants, the weather condition, and multiple regional and time fixed effects. As a secondary pollutant, ozone has complicated generation conditions, and its concentration can be considered exogenous. The high-frequency pollution and diagnostic data alleviate the ==== to an extent.====We also conduct a set of placebo tests to address the bias induced by omitted variables and the inference of other pollutants and precursors. We first use obstetric and orthopedic patient data as placebos and find no evidence that ozone has an impact on obstetric and orthopedic patient admission. We examine the interference effects of particulate matter, SO==== and ozone pollution precursors NO==== on the results. Owing to the low concentration of other pollutants in Weihai, we find no evidence that pollutants other than ozone significantly affect health in the city.====Considering the non-negative and discrete nature of the patient admission data, we further use the Poisson model to test the results and show that our finding is robust. We also examine the specifications with different data frequencies and found that the results of monthly data and daily data are still robust. We also examined in detail the main types of diseases lead by short-term ozone exposure. We classify diseases according to the diagnostic information. Our results indicate that short-term ozone pollution exposure mainly leads to the risk of tracheitis, bronchitis, and glaucoma.====We conduct a series of analyses to explore the heterogeneity of ozone health effects. First, wind has a heterogeneous effect on the health effects of ozone pollution. Sea wind can alleviate the negative health effects of ozone, but land-wind does not have a mitigating effect, which is probably due to the transmission of ozone or precursors. Second, ozone is a photochemical pollutant. We find evidence that the health effects of ozone pollution on a sunny day are more significant, which leads to suggestions for avoiding the health effects of ozone. Third, we investigate the source of the negative effects of ozone. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), the precursors of ozone, can be emitted from automobile exhaust, and they are prone to generate ozone pollution under outdoor light conditions. We find that the negative health impact of ozone is more significant in regions with dense roads in urban areas, but the impact is insignificant in areas with sparse roads. We also find that the elderly and males are more affected by ozone pollution, especially respiratory diseases.====After exploring the negative health effects of ozone, a key issue is to estimate the welfare loss caused by ozone pollution. Using the total medical charges as the independent variable, we find that a 10% increase in ozone pollution leads to a 11.2%, 5.73%, and 9.10% increase in total expenditure on emergency room admissions for respiratory, ophthalmology, and internal medicine departments, respectively. Adding this cost to the city's annual level, our research shows that for every additional one standard deviation increase of ozone consumption, the annual medical expenditure of urban residents will increase 5.89 million yuan (approximately 0.922 million US dollars). This estimation is only a lower bound. Considering that Weihai is a city with relatively good air quality, and China's average ozone pollution has risen by nearly 20 ====/==== in the past six years, the actual health cost for the whole country is huge.====We further estimate the dose-response function to examine the non-linearity of the health effects of ozone. In our estimation, we find that the higher the ozone concentration, the greater the negative health effects. We provide evidence of a sharp increase of the negative health effect in the range of 40 to 60 ====/==== for the emergency room admission of respiratory and internal medicine departments.====This study makes several contributions to the literature. First, we contribute to the literature on the health impact of air pollution. Previous literature focuses mainly on the health effects of sulfur oxides and particulate matter. Most studies focus on the more vulnerable populations such as infants, children, and elders. Few works study the contemporaneous effects of short-term air pollution exposure. This study adds to these literatures by investigating the short-term impact of ozone pollution on the health of all residents and estimates the corresponding welfare loss. We exclude the interference of other pollutants and precursors and conduct detailed heterogeneity analysis of the effects. We study the visits of all patients, so the findings can be regarded as the welfare loss caused by ozone pollution to the whole society. We also supplement the literature on the effects of short-term pollution exposure.====Second, we add to the environmental science and medical literature. ==== point out that strict particulate control may increase ozone pollution. ==== and ==== clinically estimate the impact of ozone on health. Several environmental science literature estimates the health impact of ozone in China with the macro data of population exposure (====). ====Third, we present timely evidence of the negative health effect of ozone even if the comprehensive air quality is excellent, which offers a clear policy implication for environmental governance. After the success of the large-scale haze control, the negative impact of ozone may become the core of air pollution governance in the future. Going back to the history of combating air pollution in developed and developing countries, we find that the two have similar trends. The London smog incident started the process of controlling sulfur oxide air pollution in developed countries. At the end of the last century, the smog caused by particulate matter was vigorously controlled. In recent years, ozone pollution is effectively controlled in the United States.==== As a developing country, China has struggled with air pollution for more than 20?years and implemented strategies including the ¡°Two Control Zones¡± policy in the 1990s to control sulfur oxides, the 11th Five-Year Plan to strictly control particulate matters to reduce haze, and the launch of ¡°fight to defend the blue sky¡± slogan. China has achieved initial results in combating haze, which can be proven by the declining particle concentration yearly. However, ozone pollution has not received enough attention. Ozone was not included in the monitoring scope until the air quality inspection reform was carried out in 2012. Our study reminds developing countries that ozone pollution has negative health effects and may become a new problem after defeating haze.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides the necessary background and reviews the relative literature. ==== describes the data. ==== describes our empirical methodology. ==== discusses the empirical results, conducts various robustness checks, and analyzes the heterogeneity effects. ==== estimates the welfare loss and dose-response function of ozone pollution. ==== concludes.",Invisible enemy: The health impact of ozone,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000189,2-Feb-22,2022,Research Article,176

By investigating two different types of SMEs (namely, ==== businesses and ==== SMEs) in China, we find that SMEs turn to credit card debt as a substitute when they fail to obtain bank loans. Specifically, we find that households with ==== businesses are more likely to use credit cards when their businesses are financially constrained. We also find that when financially constrained, ==== SMEs are more likely to carry credit card debt and are also carrying more. This relationship persists after selection issues are addressed. However, credit card debt and bank loans are hardly perfect substitutes as these two instruments may function differently. Consistently, we find that even with bank loans, ==== SMEs still carry substantial credit card debt. Additionally, compared to those with no fund need and thus no bank loan, ==== SMEs with bank loans are carrying more credit card debt.","In the US, perhaps because credit loans have been sufficiently supplied, credit card debt, a close substitute to credit loans but more costly, composes only an ignorable proportion of total finance (0.14%) among SMEs (====). However, the situation may be substantially different in an emerging economy like China. On the one hand, with an under-developed banking system, Chinese SMEs are generally credit depressed (====). On the other hand, SME owners' credit access has been improved as credit lines became available to individuals, thanks to the recent diffusion of credit cards. Though no systematic evidence has been provided, anecdotal evidence shows that SME owners have been using personal credit cards to finance their SMEs. It seems to be a rational choice: loans from credit lines, which are extensively used by SMEs in developed countries, are rarely distributed to SMEs in China; with information advantages about their businesses, owners thus use credit card debt as a close substitute for credit loans, thereby helping their SMEs to better deal with liquidity contingencies. We thus postulate that when SMEs are credit constrained, their demand for credit card debt would increase.====There are two major types of SMEs in China, the so-called ¡°informal businesses¡± and ¡°formal SMEs.¡± Both types are officially registered. Informal businesses (registered as ==== or so-called sole industrial and commercial proprietorship) are different from formal SMEs (mostly registered as limited liability companies) in that informal businesses are not required to have a fixed office location, a complete accounting system, or minimum registration capital. Given the popularity of both types of SMEs in China and their substantial differences, it is necessary to investigate them separately. Accordingly, we turn to two data sources, the 2015 China Household Finance Survey (2015 CHFS) and the 2015 China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey (2015 CMES). Both surveys were conducted by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.====We first turn to the 2015 CHFS data and investigate urban households with informal businesses. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that a household is more likely to use credit cards when its business is credit constrained. It holds when we control for business characteristics, owner characteristics, and household characteristics. The estimate may be biased because bank loans are not randomly distributed. With control for such selection effects by applying the selection model, in which we follow the literature (e.g., ====; ====To identify underlying mechanisms, we explore whether such a substitution effect exhibits heterogeneity in the cross-section along a number of characteristics. Our story implies that the prevalence of credit cards is important; otherwise, owners are unlikely to hold credit cards when their SMEs need financial help. Consistently, we find that this substitution effect is more pronounced in communities where credit cards are more accessible. Additionally, this substitution effect is more pronounced among businesses whose owners are risk averse, suggesting that such credit card use for SME financing is done in a prudent manner. We further find that the sensitivity of credit card use to credit constraints persists even among mature businesses, suggesting that the problem of opaque information is not well solved even after an informal business has been running for a long time.====We then turn to the 2015 CMES data to investigate ==== SMEs (hereafter, F-SMEs). In the survey, owners were directly asked whether they were using credit card debt to finance their F-SMEs and the amount if any. It clearly shows that carrying credit card debt was common among F-SMEs in China and the amount was substantial. For a typical F-SME with positive credit card debt, the proportion of credit card debt to its total finance was comparable to that of bank loans (4.8% vs. 5.1%).====We further find that credit-constrained F-SMEs were more likely to carry credit card debt and carried 73,300 yuan more, indicating that the substitution effect was also pronounced among F-SMEs. Moreover, the above effects at both the extensive and intensive margin persist after selection bias is addressed. Similarly, we find that the substitution effect persisted even among mature F-SMEs, suggesting that the information problem was not well solved over time for F-SMEs as well.====So far, following the literature, we have pooled SMEs with bank loans and SMEs with no fund needs, regarding them as SMEs with no credit constraint. However, SMEs may still carry credit card debt even when they have access to bank loans for two reasons. First, SMEs are generally credit depressed; even when bank loans are obtained, SMEs' fund needs are likely not fully satisfied. Second, credit card debt and bank loans are functioning differently and thus are not perfect substitutes. For example, credit card debt is suitable to deal with liquidity contingencies while bank loans are not.====Consistently, our data reveal that credit card use remains popular among SMEs with bank loans. We further investigate how the propensity of credit card use is influenced when SMEs have managed to obtain bank loans, which either partially or fully meet their fund needs. We investigate two types of SMEs, respectively. For informal businesses, when their fund needs are only partially met by bank loans, they are more likely to use credit cards for business purposes than those with no fund need, but such a difference is insignificant when their needs are fully met.====In contrast, For F-SMEs, the propensity of carrying credit card debt remains higher even when their fund needs are fully met by bank loans. Nevertheless, consistent with the fund need story, F-SMEs with fund needs partially met are more likely to carry credit card debt than those with fund needs fully met. The same pattern persists at the intensive margin. Relative to F-SMEs with no fund need, F-SMEs with fund needs fully met by bank loans carry 58,700 yuan more credit card debt, while F-SMEs with fund needs partially met carry 93,400 yuan more.==== show that credit card debt is taken as a substitute to bank loans when SMEs are credit constrained. Specifically, ==== find that for those SMEs with experiences of credit application denial in the past three years, the probability of carrying credit card debt is five percentage points higher and $2281 more credit card debt is carried; the importance of credit card debt also reflects on its consequence as they find that that SMEs with ==== credit cards grow more rapidly than those without. ==== confirm the causality by documenting that the deregulation of credit card markets in the late 1970s enabled credit-constrained individuals to borrow money and establish new businesses.====This paper complements ==== by documenting credit card debt as an important substitute for bank loans for SME financing in a developing country where SMEs are credit depressed. Additionally, we address the selection problem and confirm the causality of the substitution effect. Our paper differs from ==== mainly in two ways. First, we study a broader category of small businesses. Compared to ==== focusing on firms with formal types of organization, our study includes both formal and informal businesses in China. Second, thanks to the richness of the data, we additionally document and explore the coexistence of credit card debt and bank loans in SMEs.====This paper is also related to the literature on SMEs using informal finance as a substitute for formal finance. Trade credit, an important source of informal finance (====), has been documented as a substitute for bank loans when firms, particularly small ones, are credit constrained (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Along this line, it has been documented that financially advantaged but inefficient firms supply funds by extending their trade credit (====; ====).==== This paper documents that financially disadvantaged SMEs receive funds through credit card debt.====Our paper is also closely related to two recent papers on Chinese credit markets. ==== are among the first to document credit card illegal cash-out in China. Using a proprietary account-level database from a commercial bank, ==== show that credit card cash-out through bogus transactions is associated with credit card holders' lower overdue risks. They further explore the role of credit card cash-out as an informal financing channel for households with small businesses. ==== document the important role of credit constraints in entrepreneurial choices (i.e., whether to have a small business) among urban households in China.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== develops hypotheses. ==== describes key variables and model specifications. ==== describes data. ==== presents the results, followed by discussions on the coexistence of credit card debt and bank loans in ====. ==== concludes.",Depressed access to formal finance and the use of credit card debt in Chinese SMEs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000165,1-Feb-22,2022,Research Article,177

We find that, among rural young teachers, the pandemic has caused higher teaching stress and career development stress and has reduced passion toward the teaching occupation. We investigate the working channels of the pandemic, including changes in job-related activities and social network. After controlling for possible working channels, the COVID-19 pandemic still shows a strong direct impact on job sentiments.","The highly infectious nature of COVID-19 has raised substantial anxieties among people. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. By December 31 of that year, there were 83.42 million cumulative confirmed cases and 1.82 million deaths across 191 countries and regions.==== Coincident with the unanticipated epidemic, the COVID-19 lockdown has also significantly changed people's lives and work due to disrupted travel plans, social isolation, and media information overload (====). As a result, the pandemic effect on people's psychological and mental health has become an important concern.====Because of its exogenous nature, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study people's reactions to extreme events. Studies have investigated physiological changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, ==== studies the impact on the general population; ==== focuses on vulnerable groups such as health professionals; ==== studies the influence on student experiences. However, little is known about how the pandemic influences specific job-related stresses and job perceptions.====Because the COVID-19 pandemic may affect occupations differently, it is important to investigate its psychological impacts on certain highly affected occupations, especially those where work morale has a deep impact on society.==== Teaching is considered one of the most stressful professions and requires intensive interactive instructions (see ====; ====). Teachers with high levels of stress show a reduced sense of job satisfaction and a tendency to exit the teaching profession. More importantly, teachers' work attitudes affect education quality and student performance (====). Therefore, the influences of the pandemic on teachers have potential consequences for the educational outcomes of the future generations.====In this study, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teachers' job sentiments. We focus on how the pandemic influences teachers' job-specific stresses, including teaching stress and career development stress, and their job satisfaction as measured by enthusiasm for the teaching occupation. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lots of sudden changes have occurred for teachers, such as prolonged school closures and distance teaching (====). A recent survey of teachers in the United States during August 2020 found that approximately 32% of the respondents reported low morale, and 47% considered making a major job-related change, with 17% saying they would completely change their career away from teaching.====Our data come from large-scale annual surveys from approximately 7500 elementary school and middle school teachers in rural China.==== The surveys were conducted both before and after the breakout of the pandemic and thus allow us to estimate the total changes in job sentiments attributed to COVID-19. We apply the cross-section estimation as well as the difference-in-differences (DD) method to identify the impact of the pandemic. We further test the robustness of our results with various samples and estimation techniques.====For most studies about the psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the data were collected after the pandemic started, and they are mostly cross-sectional (e.g., ====; ====). For example, ====, using one province's data from China, finds around 70% of their sample reported no increase in stress from work between January 28 and February 5, 2020. Some longitudinal studies exist, but they generally cover different time points during the pandemic, not before the pandemic. For example, ==== found stable stress levels of the general population and no significant temporal changes despite the sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 cases from January 30th to March 11, 2020. Such data can help identify the change of the psychological effect at different times during the pandemic but not the overall before-after effect of the pandemic.====In comparison with the literature, our data have some unique features: 1) it is a longitudinal survey conducted before the pandemic and during the pandemic; 2) the survey provides detailed assessments of the respondents' job sentiments; 3) the survey focuses on young rural teachers in China, and thus the samples are homogenous in representing a particular population. In addition, as a routine annual survey of a large national training program for rural teachers, the purpose of the surveys is not directly related to the pandemic, so the responses are less likely to be induced toward a particular direction by the survey questions.====We propose a theoretical framework on how the pandemic affects job stress, and measure job stress and enthusiasm levels with both categories and scales. The results show that the pandemic significantly increases teaching stress and career development stress. Moreover, the pandemic reduces passion toward teaching. In addition, local pandemic severity has statistically significant effects on teachers' career development stress and job enthusiasm, but the magnitudes are very small and economically insignificant. This result indicates that studies based on cross-sectional data during the pandemic may only reflect a smaller portion of the total COVID-19 pandemic effect.====We further investigate the working channels of the pandemic, including behavioral changes in job-related activities and social network, and find that those channels affect teachers' job attitudes. Moreover, the results show that teaching stress raises career development stress, and both job stresses reduce passion toward teaching. However, even after considering these channels, the COVID-19 pandemic still has a strong direct influence on teachers' job sentiments.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II presents a theoretical framework. Section III introduces the COVID-19 pandemic in China and relevant data. Section IV estimates the effect of the pandemic on job stress and enthusiasm via cross-section and before-after estimations. Section V discusses identification strategies and applies the DD estimation. Section VI tests the robustness of the results using various samples and estimation methods.

However, little is known about how the Internet affects patients' online provider choices and thus the spatial distribution of healthcare utilization. This study investigates the effect of distance on flows of online medical consultations using a unique dataset from one of the leading third-party online healthcare platforms in China: ","In low- and middle-income countries, travel distance creates significant barriers, in both time and cost, to healthcare access, especially for higher-quality specialist care. With the advent of internet technology, telemedicine and telehealth may hold promise for reducing, if not eliminating, access barriers due to travel distance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, few studies have investigated patients' provider choices in online healthcare markets and the spatial distribution of online healthcare utilization.====Using records of 1.3 million transactions on ==== resemble that of a free market and allow us to study the effect of distance on patient choice with minimal restriction or interference by third parties.====Following the empirical strategy commonly employed to study e-commerce (e.g., ====; ====) and patient mobility (e.g., ====), we use the gravity model to motivate our analysis. For the main estimation, we aggregate the transaction data at the province level and examine whether the volume of online medical consultations between any pair of provinces is affected by the distance between them. We also aggregate our data at the province-year and the prefecture level to test the robustness of our results.====Our main result is that distance is negatively associated with volume of online medical consultations, though the magnitude of this effect is smaller than for offline inpatient services. The online service volume may decrease by 35%?~?50% when the geographic distance between the doctor and the patient doubles, depending on the model specifications and measures. This suggests that patients still prefer doctors who are located closer to them, even for online consultations. We also find a very strong ¡°home bias¡± for consulting with doctors located in the same province. All results are robust to Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood estimations, as well as alternative specifications. Similar results are obtained when data are aggregated at the prefecture level.====We assess several plausible channels through which distance could affect patient choice on the Internet. First, given that 10.5% of patients have prior in-person visits to the same doctors before seeking online services from them, we exclude these observations from the regression and test whether the observed distance effect is driven by these patients. We find that the distance effect decreases by approximately 10%, and the coefficients for the same-province dummy and the same-region dummy also decrease modestly. These results suggest that the prior in-person visits before online consultations contribute partly to the distance effect observed in this study.====Second, online and offline visits are not always substitutes. For patients who need follow-up physical visits subsequent to online consultations, they are complements. Consequently, patients may choose providers closer to them in anticipation of follow-up on-site visits. To explore this hypothesis, we examine differences in the effects of distance on patient choice across different medical departments, finding that distance has a larger effect for consultations with surgical departments, such as those offering urologic surgery, thoracic surgery, orthopedic care, and burn care, where follow-up on-site visits are more likely to take place, than departments such as dermatology and mental health. Furthermore, after including a series of variables that measure transportation time in the regression, we find that the transportation time matters more for surgical departments and pediatric departments than for dermatology and mental health. All these results suggest that the potential need for a follow-up on-site visit after an online consultation is an important factor in choosing doctors on the Internet.====Third, we test whether the distance-related delivery cost is a contributor to the distance effect. Although doctors and patients communicate through VoIP on ====, the costs of which are covered by ====, it is possible that some patients are unaware of this fact and take the cost of long-distance calls into consideration when they select online doctors. We use the well-known policy change that the Chinese government canceled roaming charges nationwide in September 2017 to test this hypothesis. Estimating the gravity equation year by year, we find that the distance effect remains largely unchanged from 2016 to 2018. This suggests that long-distance telephone charges do not explain the distance effects observed in this study.====Last, we test whether the distance effect and home bias vary by doctors' reputations. We estimate the gravity equation for ¡°Excellent Doctors¡± and ¡°non-Excellent Doctors,¡± respectively. Our estimations show that home bias is much more pronounced for doctors without a strong reputation, suggesting that information friction might be one of potential mechanisms for distance and home bias effects.====Our findings mainly contribute to three bodies of literature. First, this study provides new evidence on patient choice in the online healthcare market. This is particularly timely, given the role of telemedicine and telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential to remain a common mode of healthcare delivery. Most existing research has only examined the determinants of patient choices in the offline world, finding that patients make trade-offs between measured quality, price, and distance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Second, our study advances the literature examining the impact of the Internet on reducing geographic barriers to economic activities (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our results reinforce previous findings that geographic distance is still an important factor in people's online activities, even though the Internet has substantially reduced search frictions and transaction costs (====). Third, our study is related to the literature on the impact of telemedicine on healthcare delivery. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of telemedicine in reducing access barriers varies across medical departments, consistent with the previous findings (====; ====).",Distance effects and home bias in patient choice on the Internet: Evidence from an online healthcare platform in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000153,31-Jan-22,2022,Research Article,179

Baseline regressions suggest that Chinese family firms have significantly lower R&D investment and number of ","; ====; ====). Theoretically, firm governance is considered to have considerable impact on firms' long-term decisions (====; ====; ====), which is associated with innovation performance. Since family ownership is a highly prevalent form of firm governance in China (====), this study aims to examine whether family ownership can facilitate or hinder firm innovation and, more importantly, the underlying reasons.====Although a growing number of studies have analyzed the effects of family ownership on firm innovation (e.g., ====; ====; ====), no consensus has been reached on whether family firms are more innovative or not. Some studies claim that family business is potentially able to create thriving organizations (====). From this perspective, family ownership may have beneficial effects on firm innovation (====). In contrast, other studies claim that family firms are perceived as less efficient and less innovative than widely held firms (====; ====), suggesting that family firms may have less efficient R&D spending and lower research productivity. Their findings are inconsistent and mainly focus on developed countries.====Drawing on a large-scale representative survey dataset, the China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES), this study adds to the literature by providing new evidence from China. This database has the following advantages. First, using a random-sampling method, the CEES includes more small- and medium-sized firms (====; ====). Unlike other datasets, such as the Chinese Listed Firm data used in existing papers (====), this database allows us to avoid neglecting smaller firms (====). Since small- and medium-sized firms are more likely to be family-owned (====Based on empirical analyses, it was found that Chinese family firms indeed do worse than their non-family counterparts in both innovation inputs and outputs. As reported by the data summary, using R&D investment as the proxy variable for input-based innovation measure, the mean value of family firms was RMB 2.81 million per year between 2015 and 2017, 63.2% lower than that of non-family firms during the same period (RMB 7.64 million per year). Similarly, for output-based innovation measures, the average number of total ====Furthermore, we investigate the underlying reasons for the innovation gap from the perspective of management. According to existing studies, the differences in management between family and non-family firms may be an important reason for the effects of family ownership on innovation (====). However, owing to a lack of comprehensive management measures at the firm level, few recent empirical studies have studied this issue (====). We hypothesize that the disadvantage in management quality is an important reason for low innovation in Chinese family firms. First, we find that family firms have lower management quality than non-family firms do. As presented in the descriptive results, not only are the shares of establishing a board of directors in family firms much smaller, but also their management scores and DDD are significantly lower than their non-family counterparts. These statistics support our hypothesis that family firms have lower levels of management quality. Second, when adding management measures into the regressions, these factors can fully explain the differences in both R&D investment and the number of total patents filed each year between family firms and non-family firms, and they can also explain about a fifth of the difference in the number of invention patents filed annually between these two types of firms.====The heterogeneity analysis indicates that the low innovation of Chinese family firms is more prevalent in environments with stronger competition. Specifically, the effects of family ownership on innovation appear only in cities with more foreign-invested firms. This result suggests that, owing to poor management, family firms may have much lower efficiency to exploit extant R&D resources (i.e., knowledge, skilled workers, etc.) in more competitive environments, thus hindering their innovation growth.====The contributions of our study are threefold. First, we provide more detailed information about the differences in innovation between family and non-family firms. Compared to other studies that only focus on innovation inputs (====), our study examines differences in both input- and output-based innovation measures. Since a larger R&D investment does not necessarily mean that a firm is more innovative (====; ====), our findings on the effects of family ownership on innovation are more comprehensive. Based on our empirical analyses, family owned firms were found to be less innovative, regardless of which variable is used. Not only are the innovation inputs (measured by R&D investment) much less, but their innovation outputs (measured by both flow and stock numbers of total patents) are significantly lower than those of non-family firms. Furthermore, family firms have poorer innovation quality (measured by both flow and stock numbers of invention patents).====Second, this paper adds to the literature the finding that the lower innovation input and performance of family firms can be explained by their lower management quality (e.g., ====). Some studies argue that concentrated family ownership is more inclined to have stronger incentives to monitor firm management processes (====; ====), and achieve sustained competitive advantages through family specific social capital (====; ====), which would reduce agency costs and increase R&D efficiency (====; ====). However, our findings indicate that family firms have lower management quality than non-family firms. Several explanations have been explored in the literature. For instance, since decentralization in management is harder to realize for family firms, the total effects of family ownership on innovativeness and risk-taking are significantly negative (====). In addition, concentrated family ownership may allow an owner to pursue private profits that are incompatible with the efficient operation of the firm (====). Owing to such disadvantages in management, family firms may have less efficient R&D spending and lower research productivity (====). To close the innovation gap, family firms could improve their management quality by decentralizing the management process and hiring professional managers to operate the firm (====).====Finally, this study contributes to the existing literature examining innovation differences between different types of family firms (====). After controlling for firm characteristics in the regressions, this study found no statistical differences in both R&D investment and total patents between founder-controlled family firms and those run by successors. However, the average number of invention patents filed each year for family firms run by founders is significantly higher than their successor-controlled counterparts. These results suggest that founder-controlled family firms may have better innovation performance than family firms controlled by successors. Our new evidence from China is consistent with the findings of some studies in developed countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). They argue that founder-controlled family firms are more innovative than family firms run by successors because of the more trustworthy reputation and higher managerial talents of firm leaders.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The model replicates well the volatility and cyclicality of key macroeconomic variables observed in the past two decades in China.

Yet, the economic growth tended to slow down in the near decade. The annual growth rate rose to 14.23 percent in 2007, and then gradually felt to 6.6 percent in 2018.

Our estimated model explains the business cycle properties of the data well. In particular, it replicates the volatility and cyclicality in consumption, nonresidential investment, house prices, bank net worth, nonresidential loans, deposits, bank leverage, ====, and hours, as observed in the data over the past two decades. Furthermore, we find that the capital quality, non-housing technology, housing demand and supply, loan-to-value (LTV), and labor supply shocks are the main driving forces of the China's business cycles, accounting for more than 80 percent of the variance in all variables of interest at business cycle frequencies. Of them, the contributions of the financial and housing shocks, such as capital quality shocks, LTV shocks and housing demand shocks, play the most prominent roles in the fluctuations of Chinese macroeconomy at the business cycle frequencies. Moreover, there are substantial interactions between the banking and housing sectors in China. Housing shocks exert a significant influence on the operation of the banking sector via financial frictions.====Our baseline model consists of six main features: (i) two production sectors of consumption goods and housing; (ii) two types of households, savers and borrowers; (iii) nominal rigidities; (iv) collateral constraints in household loans; (v) financial frictions in the banking sector; and (vi) a rich set of shocks. These features are mostly drawn from the two strands of current literature which study the housing and financial cycles. The business cycle models with housing study the behavior of the housing market over the business cycle by dealing with some combination of (i)¨C(iv).==== Business cycle models with banking study the role of financial intermediaries in the transmission of financial shocks by dealing with (v).==== While many papers in the literature focus on housing and banking separately, we stress that a combination of the two is crucial to understand the business cycles in China.====Among the literature considering the interaction between housing and banking over the business cycles, ====, ====, and ==== are the closest to this paper. ==== finds that repayment shocks, housing demand shocks and LTV shocks account for about two-thirds of the decline in output and investment during the Great Recession. In addition to frictions tied to households and banks, ==== introduces endogenous default to a DSGE model in accounting for the comovements in consumption, house prices, business investment and output, and finds that housing risk shocks and MBS collateral shocks are able to explain the pattern of comovements among these variables during the Great Recession. ====As in ====, ====, and ==== finds the investment wedge to play a minor role in the US business cycles, the more recent works applying the methodology to emerging countries and Asian economies find that the investment wedge to be a dominant factor in business cycle fluctuations.====There are a few recent papers studying the Chinese housing market using the DSGE framework. ==== represents an early attempt to understand China's housing market from a macro perspective based on NK DSGE approach, however, due to data limitation, the author relies on annual data to estimate the model. Abstracting from the nominal side, ==== focus on the real house price dynamics in China by incorporating an external habits in housing consumption into the preference specification. The recent paper by ====, which is also based on the NK DSGE framework, focuses on the implications of the housing collateral constraint on China's business cycles. Contrary to the typical findings in the literature, the statistical test of this paper favors the benchmark model without the collateral constraint on house financing. The crucial distinction of our paper from these three papers lies in both the modeling part and the empirical implementation. All the three papers do not incorporate banking and financial frictions into their model frameworks. As showed by our quantitative evaluations, shocks and frictions in the housing sector have significant impacts on the dynamics of the financial sector. Intuitively, Chinese economy features a tight link in the banking sector and housing sector, since housing related loans claim a substantial portion on the bank's balance sheet in China. Moreover, the quarterly data sample we construct for the calibration and estimation spans for nearly two decades and covers all the key variables in both financial and housing sector, the most comprehensive one in the related literature on China's business cycle, as far as we know.

We construct the aggregate total working hours series by first interpolating the weekly working hours series in annual frequency to arrive at a measure in quarterly frequency, second multiplying the weekly working hours in quarterly frequency by the quarterly employment (interpolated from annual data from the NBSC), and lastly multiplying again by 13 to convert the weekly working hours into quarterly working hours.

Based on stragged establishments timing of regional Supervision Centers for Environmental Protection (SCEPs) in China, we introduce a unique government administrative dataset on firm pollution in order to conduct gradual intensity difference-in-differences estimations. We present strong evidence that establishing the SCEPs significantly prompt firms to reduce emission pollution. Since the establishment of the SCEPs brings more effective information collection and supervision, promoting local firms reduce pollutant generation and increase investment in pollution control. Moreover, the SCEPs could coordinate adjacent provinces' incentives on reducing firms' emissions around provincial boundaries. Besides, this study provides clear policy implications that when ==== carries the risk of aggravating environmental pollution, vertical management structures in environmental governance could effectively strengthen incentives and coordination.","Countries with multiple levels of government must decide how regulatory responsibilities should be distributed among those levels (====; ====; ====). Environmental governance is a typical case, local governments in a decentralized system may sacrifice environmental protection in order to compete for economic growth, which could lead to insufficient incentives for environmental protection. Furthermore, the spatial externality of pollution may contribute to a ¡°beggar-thy-neighbor¡± scenario in environmental governance among adjacent regions due to insufficient coordination. It is therefore crucial that central governments design mechanisms that strengthen local governments' incentives and coordination for environmental protection and governance.====To investigate the causal effects of (de)centralization on local governments' environmental governance, this paper assesses whether ==== agencies accredited by the central government could mitigate the lack of incentives and coordination, which could hinder local environmental governance.====While environmental federalism argues that (de)centralization in environmental regulations plays an important role (====; ====), it is unclear whether and how decentralization affect the relationship between environmental governance at the central and local levels. One the one hand, if the public ¡°votes with their feet¡±, i.e., they could choose residence based on the quality of public services in different regions, which in turn will encourage local governments to improve public services for standing out in human capital competence. While public preferences are heterogeneous, and environmental quality is not always considered a priority. Therefore, local governments often ignore this factor during the flowing factor resources competence. Accordingly, decentralization may have less conducive effect on environmental governance (====; ====; ====; ====).====On the other hand, the existence of the disadvantages of decentralization does not mean the centralized environmental authority could totally solve environmental governance problems. Direct environmental regulation by a centralized authority may face two challenges, information collection costs and supervision costs. Consolidating regulatory powers into a centralized environmental authority could increase regulatory distance, thus increase the difficulty of information collection, since the further distance is, the more regulatory costs are required. Therefore, countries around the world generally seek a balance between decentralization and centralization in their environmental regulatory reforms, trying to find the right degree and form of decentralization. The incentive distortion of decentralization on environmental governance has already well-documented (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). So far, however, very little research has investigated ways to strengthen incentives for local environmental governance through institutional design (====; ====). And empirical researches remain relatively unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, only two papers discussed the impact of abnormal environmental inspections of the China's central government on the local governance, without exploring the mechanisms and addressing environmental coordination (====; ====). Besides, much of the existing research focus on the temporary incentive mechanisms, such as environmental auditing, environmental monitoring and central environmental inspections, resulting in establishing environmental institutions and changing government's transfer payments. Institutional mechanisms for environmental incentives and coordination have received little attention. Compared with temporary mechanism design, the latter has a longer-term impact and is more helpful in understanding how the central government plays a role in coordinating regional environmental relations.====China is an ideal setting for our study. Firstly, China is a typical environmentally decentralized country. Although China is a constitutionally unified sovereign state, there is a system of formal and informal authority division between the central government and various levels of local and regional governments. Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates that local governments are responsible for the environmental quality in their administrative areas. Until at least 2018, local environmental protection bureaus were subordinate to and directly managed by local governments, which means they only received operational guidance from superior bureaus. However, in China's political power structure and economic system, economic growth is primarily driven and executed at the prefecture and county level. Prefecture and county governments usually have largely aligned developmental goals. Combining both the economic development and environmental protection aspects mentioned above, the conflict and contradiction between these two goals of local governments is particularly obvious at the city and county level. Secondly, China is one of the world's most populous countries and the leading manufacturing hub of the world with substantial pollution problem (====).====). Greater distances entail higher communication costs and greater difficulty in obtaining information. Therefore, information cost measured by geographic distance is an important indicator for measuring the effectiveness of political supervision (====).====Our empirical results support for prediction that the establishment of the SCEPs obviously promote firms' pollution emissions reduction in the local government's jurisdiction. For each increase in the ==== (0.0475), the firm-level chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions in the supervision region would decreases by approximately 16.30%.====Our further research shows that the incentive effect on emission reduction is mainly achieved by encouraging firms to reduce their dependence on resources and energy. That is, while the establishment of SCEP has improved the efficiency of energy consumption and enhanced pollution treatment, there is no evidence that SCEP encourages technological innovation. Besides, the incentive effect is more obvious in big emitters, non-state-owned enterprises, and local enterprises. In terms of the coordination effect, the SCEPs have partially alleviated the problem of increasing pollution emissions interprovincial borders within the supervision region. However, the SCEPs do not have the role of coordinating border pollution between large-supervision region.====We also conduct a series of robustness checks to prove the reliability of our conclusions is not affected by variable measurement errors, firm migrations, the establishment year of the SCEPs, the provincial capital effects, endogeneity, residency effects, or import and export trades.====This paper contributes to several strands of literature in three ways. First, we add to the literature on environmental decentralization from the perspective of supervision and coordination. While traditional theories on decentralization and centralization mainly focused on the vertical division of power among governments (====), we investigate whether the potential quasi-centralized coordination mechanism in the framework of decentralization could be introduced. Without changing the environmental governance structure among local governments, the introduction of central agencies could effectively supervise and incentivize pro-environmental behaviors among regions' governments and firms within their jurisdictions, also contributing to coordinate environmental competition between regions. Previous studies have paid more attention to the role of central incentives and constraints (====; ====; ====), without enough attention to the role of environmental coordination among local governments.====Second, our study provides evidence that reducing information asymmetry plays a key role of the SCEPs on environmental governance. That is, establishing the SCEPs has partially reduced the information asymmetry between China's central and local governments in environmental governance. Although the SCEPs are clearly prohibited from directly interfering with local environmental supervision, they can collect and supply environmental information throughout their regulatory regions. Thus, the MEP can make timely and effective decisions, along with supervising enterprises of the regional supervision and inspection centers. Then the SCEPs strengthen the ¡°deterrent¡± effect of local government environmental supervision, which was previously limited to intermittent environmental inspections, and mitigates opportunistic behavior between local governments and enterprises as well. Specifically, enterprises would reduce their dependence on resources and energy, improve resource and energy consumption efficiency, and improve pollution treatment capacity. However, the inspection center cannot coordinate environmental disputes between regions, at least between regions, requiring direct coordination by the central government. Although existing studies have explored the role of reducing information asymmetry in solving subordinate supervision problems, such as government audits, state-owned enterprises (SOE) reforms, etc., (====; ====; ====). Considering that environmental governance requires information to a greater extent, the SCEPs significantly improves the influence of central government on the local environment.====Third, this study could also enrich the understanding of decentralization reform in developing countries. Due to differences in historical traditions, political systems, and incentive mechanisms, decentralization in developing countries mostly involves asymmetric incentive reforms, i.e., the incentive to promote economic development is significantly greater than the incentive to improve social affairs such as environmental protection. Based on this background, we could find the conflicts and contradictions between the goals ==== and environmental protection are more obvious in decentralized developing countries. This paper provides clear policy implications for regulators concerned with asymmetric incentive structure.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 and Section 3 reviews related literature and introduces the institutional background. Section 4 describes our data and empirical strategy.

The mode of over-reliance on energy not only constrains economic sustainable growth, but more pollutant emissions also lead to serious public health damage. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (====) reports that environment pollution has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for mortality in China. Thus achieving the green transformation of Chinese industrial sector is of crucial importance to cast off resource and environment constraints as well as promote economic development. Although the central governments have enacted a set of environmental laws and regulations, higher implementation costs and lower environmental transparency are main impediments to environmental governance. The environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) that are able to serve as information brokers about environment-related issues could strengthen regulatory capacity and perform social functions indispensable for green growth (====).==== and ==== and ==== have identified that media coverage of corporate environmental violation events could affect the market values due to shareholders' reactions. Also, the response of stock market to the pollution information in EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program is a negative shock to firms (====; ====). Overall firms' values and future cash flows are affected directly because of expected increases in financing costs (====; ====), which reversely creates incentives for pollution control (====; ====).====). The severe pollution is imposing a substantial human health (====), and thus labor supply and productivity are reduced as well (====; ====; ====), but pollution abatement activities themselves require labor input at the same time (====). Hence environmental information may affect employment distribution among industries rather than the economy-wide employment level (====), which results in significant changes of local industry structure.====In the decentralized system in China, the compliance problems between central and local governments could be alleviated when NGOs provide valuable information on the environmental performance of local regulators (====; ====). The regulations on polluting enterprises are also set to be strengthened directly. In such case, the higher compliance costs than before could lead heavily polluting companies to exit an industry (====; ====). In another line of literature, studies find evidence about the negative effects of environmental stringency on new plant site choices (====; ====).====However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the public disclosure of environmental performance information on the green transformation of industrial sector, and the mechanism of action of this program on the green transformation of Chinese industrial sector is also not clear. In order to bridge this gap, by combing the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) with a unique city-level data set of pollution information transparency index (PITI), this paper is designed to evaluate the impact of the non-governmental ====This study makes three primary contributions to the existing literatures. First, based on the ASIF firm-level data, we merge all the industrial enterprises above designated size (over 300 thousand in 2013) at both the city level and the industry level, and thereby examine the green transformation process of China's industrial sector for prefecture-level cities between 2004 and 2013. Second, based on a unique city-level data set of PITI, we extend the existing research on the ENGOs to the industrial sector and evaluate the impact on greening China's industrial sector. To the best of our knowledge, it is among the first efforts to estimate the effects of the non-governmental environmental monitoring on the green transformation in the industrial sector. Third, we try to provide more recent evidence concerning green transformation from stakeholder behaviors, and mainly explain it from resource reallocation among different sectors. The factor flows and firms' entry and exit are also considered at the micro level. Remarkably, our study further investigates how polluting enterprises and non-polluting ones respond to the environmental monitoring.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: ==== describes the institutional background; ==== introduces the empirical methodology, main variables and the dataset; ==== reports the main results, including a series of robustness tests and heterogeneity tests; ==== explores the underlying channels by which non-governmental environmental monitoring affects the green transformation of China's industrial sector, and ==== concludes the paper.",Greening of Chinese industrial sector: Stakeholders' responsiveness to non-governmental environmental monitoring,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X22000025,17-Jan-22,2022,Research Article,183

We find that the workers displaced during the SOE reform suffered substantial and persistent earnings losses. In addition, by comparing wage losses and reductions in employment and work hours over time, we find that the majority of long-term earnings losses were driven by declines in post-displacement wages. Moreover, we find that the displaced workers tended to find ==== in low-skilled occupations, in the private sector, with less profitable employers, and through informal contracts, which may explain the substantial costs of displacement.","Many academic studies have shown that job displacement during mass layoffs has a large and persistent effect on workers' earnings. However, the effect of displacement varies across countries. Researchers often find that the earnings losses of displaced workers are larger in the US than in Europe (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====We use a panel dataset, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), from 1991 to 2011 to obtain evidence on the cost of displacement. We are able to capture the displaced workers' labor market outcomes both before and after the incidence of job loss, and we can follow the workers for over a decade after displacement, which allows us to examine the long-term effect of job displacement. We employ the multi-period difference-in-differences method, which is widely used in the literature (====; ====; ====), to estimate the effect of displacement by comparing changes in the labor market outcomes of workers displaced during the SOE reform with those who were not displaced while controlling for individual fixed effects and differential earnings trends.====The CHNS data provide detailed information on various measures of individual workers' labor market outcomes, allowing us to comprehensively examine the effect of displacement. First, we examine the long-term earnings losses of workers displaced during the SOE reform. Second, we examine the long-term effect of displacement on monthly wages, employment, and daily work hours. We intend to explore the relative contribution of wage losses and reductions in employment and work hours to earnings losses.==== (b). Our study provides evidence on losses of various labor market outcomes under different macroeconomic conditions in China.====) and with smaller and lower-paying firms (====; ====) and informal jobs (====). Owing to the rich information in our data, we are able to examine the effect of displacement on five alternative variables that may potentially explain the earnings losses. Specifically, we focus on 1) low-skilled occupation, 2) whether the workers received a bonus, 3) the amount of the bonus received, 4) temporary employment, and 5) private sector. Since we do not have information on the employers' characteristics, we use the two bonus variables to measure the quality of a worker's employer. The literature shows that there is a close relationship between bonus payments and firm profitability and productivity in China (====; ====; ====; ====). We assume that if a worker receives a bonus from her employer or receives a large bonus, then her employer tends to be more profitable or more productive.====Our main findings are as follows. First, we find that workers displaced during the SOE reform suffered substantial and long-lasting earnings losses. The estimated earnings losses experienced by the workers displaced between 1998 and 2000 are 6900 RMB in 2000, and the amount increases to 17,000 RMB in 2011.==== In addition, the estimated earnings losses for workers displaced during 2001¨C2004 are 12,000 RMB in 2004 and increase to 18,800 RMB in 2011. We do not find an apparent recovery in earnings over time as found in the literature on developed countries (====; ====).====Second, we find that the losses in employment and work hours of the displaced workers increased greatly in the wave following the job loss but then apparently recovered over time. In contrast, the estimated wage losses of displaced workers who reentered employment continued to increase over time, showing little sign of recovery, which resembles the trend of earnings losses. The results imply that the majority of the long-term earnings losses were driven by declines in monthly wages, which is consistent with the findings in the US literature.====Third, we find that both workers displaced between 1998 and 2000 and those displaced between 2001 and 2004 suffered long and substantial earnings losses, and the losses in both periods are similar in magnitude. However, we find that the latter tended to find a new job faster than the former. In addition, the results show that the losses are heterogeneous across different demographic groups. Specifically, we find that the displaced workers who were male, older, and more educated suffered more earnings losses. In addition, we find that males had higher reemployment probabilities than females after displacement.====Finally, we find that the displaced workers who found reemployment were more likely to work in low-skilled occupations, in the private sector, less likely to receive bonuses, tended to receive smaller bonuses, and were more likely to have temporary jobs, implying that the characteristics of the occupations, firm's ownership, employers and informal employment may explain the long-term earnings losses of displaced workers in China.====In the robustness section, we deal with the potential sample selection issue by using ==== to construct a comparison group that is similar to the treatment group in terms of age and education. We also examine the possible influences from historical events such as the higher education expansion, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the state-owned housing reform. In addition, we examine potential sample attrition bias, alternative control groups, and alternative specifications. Our results are robust to these sensitivity checks.====This paper contributes to the literature that examines the effects of job displacement on workers' earnings losses. The current literature mainly focuses on the US, Canada, and European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and Russia (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). We are among the first to estimate the long-term earnings losses of displaced workers in China, the largest developing country in the world.====This paper also contributes to the literature that examines the labor market effects of job losses on workers displaced during the dramatic SOE reform in China.==== Early academic studies mainly focus on the short-term effects of displacement on unemployment duration, wages, and earnings losses (====; ====; ====; ====). Most of these papers use data from surveys conducted in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Thus, their results mainly reflect the short-term losses of job displacement rather than long-term losses, which can be substantially larger in magnitude, as suggested by ====. Our paper extends this body of the literature by exploring the causal effects of displacement and showing that displaced workers suffer substantial earnings losses in the long run.====Our paper also adds to the literature that explores potential explanations for the large and persistent costs of job displacement (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The recent literature identifies several sources contributing to the long-term earnings losses of displaced workers. ==== shows that the cost of job displacement in the US is mainly concentrated among workers who are reemployed in lower-paying occupations. ==== find that changes in employer characteristics can help explain the large costs of job losses. Specifically, using data from Germany, they find that displaced workers tend to find reemployment in smaller and lower-paying firms. Our paper shows that lower-skilled occupations, private-sector jobs, less profitable employers, and informal employment may explain the substantial costs of workers who were displaced during the SOE reform in China.====Second, developed countries usually provide much more generous social security than China does. There were almost no social security systems independent of the SOEs in China during the reform period (====). Although the government initiated a special policy to help the newly laid-off workers in 1998, the performance of the policy was very poor in terms of both benefit coverage and reemployment (====). Thus, the workers displaced during the SOE reform could not afford to search for good job matches, which may also have contributed to the increased earnings losses over time.====Third, displaced workers during the SOE reform are more likely to be middle-aged and unskilled workers. Many of these workers received their education during the Chinese Cultural Revolution when the quality of education was poorer than usual. Moreover, the mass layoff significantly increased the supply of unskilled workers during a short period of time. These facts might make displaced workers during the SOE reform suffer larger earnings losses and have longer durations of unemployment.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section two, we describe the data, the definition of job displacement, and the main variables. In section three, we introduce the ==== methods, and in section four, we present our main results.

The heterogeneous effects of gender identity for different residence types, education levels, and age groups are also studied. Supporting empirical evidence is explored for the preference mechanism that couples with traditional gender identities are more averse to having a wife who earns more than her husband. We also find that a husband earns less if the husband or the wife has a traditional gender identity.","The gender wage gap has been extensively and intensively explored for a number of decades and remains an area of active research. However, an unexplained gap has been stable for decades in many developed countries (==== and references there). Recently, economists have become increasingly interested in the effect of non-cognitive skills on labor market outcomes and behavior (====, ====, and ====). In the existing literature, researchers have found that women with a traditional gender identity participate in the labor market less frequently, and are pay less than those who have an egalitarian gender identity (====; ====; ====; ====, ==== and ====).==== The gender gap in unobserved skills even widened considerably in the beginning of the 21st century in China (====; ====).====The objective of this paper is to investigate directly whether and how gender identity affects a wife's relative income within households.==== Attempts in this direction would be even more demanding in China, where traditional gender identity and gender wage gap are pervasive today.==== Based on those previous findings, it seems natural to the conclusion that the traditional gender identity would negatively impact a wife's relative income in the household. However, gender identity may affect not only a wife's labor market performance but also her husband's, and the impact of gender identity on a husband's labor outcome may not be deterministic. A husband with a traditional gender identity, on one hand, needs to earn more as the main breadwinner; on the other, he faces less pressure to follow the gender norm that a wife should not earn more than her husband. Therefore, a husband with a traditional gender identity may also work less if the second effect dominates, which is not tackled in the literature.====To estimate the effect of gender identity on a wife's relative income, we use micro-data from the China General Society Surveys (CGSSs) between 2010 and 2015. We show that both wife's and husband's gender identity have a statistically significant and negative impact on women's relative income in the household. The impact of gender identity is heterogeneous among different cohorts. Gender identity has a statistically significant and negative effect only for rural wives. The impact is larger for those born in the 1980s, and in middle-income families. The impact of gender identity emerges only for wives with junior high school or lower education.====We also obtain empirical evidence to support the preference mechanism. Ceteris paribus, a wife with a traditional gender identity tends to be less happy with her life if she earns more than her husband; however, a wife with an egalitarian gender identity has higher life satisfaction if she earns more than her husband. A husband's life satisfaction is reduced if his wife earns more; however, this effect does not differ systematically according to the husband's gender identity. We then examine whether and how gender identity affects a husband's labor market performance. Surprisingly, we find that a husband with a traditional gender identity earns less (by work).====This study makes four important contributions to the existing literature. We first document the causal relationship between a wife's traditional gender identity and her relative income within households where both individuals are in the labor market.==== Our empirical work generates interesting findings, which confirm Bertrand, Kamenica, and Pan's claim that a traditional gender identity makes a wife earn less in the household. This finding provides a new explanation for the gender wage gap from the perspective of household economics and supports the view that slow-moving identity norms are an important factor that limits further gender convergence in labor market outcomes (====, ====, and Heckman and Kautz 2012).====Next, we study the role of a husband's gender identity on his wife's relative income within households.==== In previous studies that mainly focus on Western societies, researchers examined the impact of a woman's own gender identity. Several scholars (====) have studied the impact of a husband's gender identity on his wife's labor force participation==== and find that a wife is more likely to work when her husband holds an egalitarian gender identity.====We further explore a possible mechanism: Couples who have traditional gender identity may be more averse to having a wife who earns a relatively high income than those with less traditional gender identity. Therefore, the difference in the couple's preference could serve as an underlying mechanism for this negative relationship between relative income and traditional gender identity. Several papers in the literature also study the impact of gender identity on couples' preferences with respect to relative income. ==== find that spouses tend to be less happy with the marriage, are more likely to report the marriage is in trouble, and are more likely to have discussed separation if the wife earns more than the husband. However, Bertrand, Kamenica, and Pan do not investigate whether this aversion to having a wife earn more has a different effect on people with different gender identities. ==== and ==== provide evidence that the impact of a wife's income contribution on her husband's subjective well-being is smaller if her husband's mother was not in the labor force; however, ==== finds no empirical evidence that the satisfaction of married women is affected by their contribution to household income or that this effect differs systematically according to the work status of their mother-in-law.====Additionally, we investigate the channels in which traditional gender identity reduces a wife's relative income. In this paper, we study whether gender identity increases a husband's labor force performance, which is ignored in the literature. Understanding of the impact of gender identity on a husband's labor market performance would also be helpful to understand the gender wage gap in the broader view.====In addition to the references mentioned above, literature on the relationship between culture and labor force participation is related. Within this direction, researchers study how the collateral gender ideology in home countries affects second-generation immigrants' labor force participation (====; ====). ==== study childcare usage and labor force participation by mothers with preschool children in the Netherlands. ==== and ==== study the effect of cultural attitudes on female labor force participation in which attitudes are instrumented using data on historical gendered economic behaviors. For recent overviews, see ==== and ====.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, in ====, we describe the data sets, how we select the samples, and the empirical methods. Then, in ====, we describe the distribution of wives' relative income within households and analyze the impact of gender identity on a wife's relative income.

The homeownership rate was 86% in urban China and 94% in rural areas in 2015, which is much higher than the corresponding figure in almost all developed countries, in which the housing ownership rate ranges from 50 to 60% (====; ====), health (====), fertility (====; ====), and subjective wellbeing (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====); enrol in a flagship public university vis-¨¤-vis a non-flagship public university or a community college (====); or enrol in a private college vis-¨¤-vis public college (====). However, there is limited research on the potential impact of higher education on housing wealth. Those studies that do exist typically use data for developed countries and do not attempt to identify the causal relationship between higher education and housing wealth (====; ====; ====).====This paper examines the causal relationship between higher educational attainment and homeownership and housing wealth in China using nationally representative microdata from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). China represents an ideal setting for such a study given that in Confucian culture, it is a traditional belief that academic excellence will lead to a better life in a hierarchical society (====; ====). Homeownership is an ultimate symbol of personal success in China (====). As such, parents often prioritise spending on their children's education in the hope that they can obtain a place at an elite university and, eventually, be successful in the interrelated labour, housing and marriage markets later in life (====; ====; ====, ====).====Our preferred estimates suggest that having a university education increases the probability of homeownership by 3.5¨C6.3 percentage points and housing wealth by 24.3¨C51.1 percentage points. We find that self-reported social status and entitlement to superannuation are channels through which higher education affects homeownership and housing wealth and that financial literacy is a channel through which higher education affects housing wealth. We also find that the impact of higher education on homeownership and housing wealth varies across gender, family income levels, parent education and between those living in urban and rural areas.====; ====). Since housing wealth plays a dominant and increasingly important role in driving a deterioration in wealth distribution in China, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the drivers of housing wealth accumulation, distribution and inequality (====; ====; ====; ====), they do not focus on the relationship between higher educational attainment and housing wealth.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the impact of the higher education expansion policy by examining homeownership and housing wealth as an important individual outcome. The world experienced a rapid expansion in higher educational enrolments over the twentieth century (====). In 1999, China expanded the university sector, seeking to transform it from an elitist to a mass higher education system. Compared to the situation in 1998, the number of new students enrolled in three-year graduate diplomas (====) and four-year bachelor's degrees (====) increased by 40% in 1999, and were five times larger by 2005 (====). Gross enrolment rates in higher education among 18¨C22-year-old rose from 9.8% in 1998 to 24% in 2009, with nearly 30 million students enrolled in higher education institutions in 2009 (====). Existing studies have focused on the effect that the higher education expansion policy had on the (short-term) unemployment rate among young university graduates (====; ====); wage returns to education (====); and intergenerational education mobility (====). We extend this literature to consider the effect on homeownership and housing wealth.====Third, we pay particular attention to identifying the causal relationship. A few studies show that having a higher education is associated with more housing wealth in China, but they do not address the potential endogeneity of having a higher education degree (====; ====). We address the endogeneity of higher educational attainment in estimating its impacts on homeownership and housing wealth by employing China's higher education expansion policy in 1999 as a quasi-natural experiment. The 1999 higher education expansion effectively resulted in different probabilities of being admitted to university among students who took the university entrance exam before and after the expansion policy. Since China implemented a relatively strict school starting age policy, the before and after groups were primarily determined by their ages, which were exogenous to the higher education expansion policy implemented long after they were born. To address the potential endogeneity of higher education qualifications using ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, we employ the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimators to identify the causal effects of higher education on homeownership and housing wealth.","University education, homeownership and housing wealth",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001607,2-Jan-22,2022,Research Article,187

These findings demonstrate the transformation of tax system has multiple economic effects in developing countries.","BT-to-VAT reform is one of the most important fiscal reforms in China. Business tax (BT) and value-added tax (VAT) have long represented the lion's share of China's tax revenue and are also the main taxes paid by firms. In 2011, the year just before the reform, the BT and VAT ratio was 27.04% and 15.24%, respectively, and reached 1367.90 and 2426.66 billion ====.==== tax reduction since its implementation in 2012.====Therefore, the BT-to-VAT reform could lead to large and profound effects on firm productivity. As mentioned above, under the dual system of indirect tax, not only were the input taxes of BT taxpayers (BT taxpayers are mainly firms in service sectors) unable to be deducted, but their business customers were also unable to deduct input taxes imposed on supplies made to them. This led to server-duplicated taxation, which caused market distortion and inefficiencies with the rapid development of the service sector in China. China began its BT-to-VAT reform gradually in 2012, which means that the service sector and its business customers could enjoy the input tax credit by allowing firms in the service sector to issue a special VAT invoice. This reform solves the problem of input tax deduction breaks caused by BT. Otherwise, the government uses a set of measures to avoid increasing the tax burden during reform, including cautiously setting the new VAT rate (two-tier tax rates of 11% and 6% were newly added). This may, at first, substantially reduce the production costs of firms and may stimulate these firms to invest more on fixed assets or R&D. By expanding the scope of input VAT deduction, this reform may also promote the professional production of enterprises, leading them to focus more on producing products that have comparative advantages and on yielding intermediate services designed for tax reduction purposes (such as self-built transport logistics services in manufacturing). These activities have the capability to enhance productivity.====Exploiting an administrative dataset from the China National Tax Survey Database, we explored the BT-to-VAT reform and used a difference-in-differences method to explored the effects of tax transformation on firm productivity and its underlying mechanisms of investment. Though the BT-to-VAT reform targets the service sector, it also impacts firm behaviors in ==== through various indirect channels.====Our first empirical finding is that the BT-to-VAT reform has a substantial effect on firms' productivity in the service sector. Quantitatively, in contrast to non-reformed firms, this reform raised the productivity of the affected firms by 14.6% on average (productivity is measured by TFP using the method of ====). In addition, the estimated results also show that the tax cut effects of the BT-to-VAT reform provide affluent cash flow for pro-productivity measures. The main reasons for the positive impact of this reform are its positive effects on fixed asset investment, R&D expenditure, and specialization.====The key challenge to our design is that other industry-shocks may be correlated with the BT-to-VAT reform. To address this concern, we first check the parallel pre-trends between the treated and control groups. Secondly, the results are stable across many tests of robustness, such as the alternative dependent variables, including differentiating the fixed effects and clustering the standard errors at different levels. Thirdly, we also construct a false BT-to-VAT reform (randomly assigning reform statuses to firms) to conduct placebo test.====This paper complements lots of work that test the effects of tax reform. Our first contribution to these studies is that we explicitly estimate the effectiveness of the BT-to-VAT reform, one of the largest tax reforms in China, by using a large unique and reliable dataset in the world's largest developing country. While many previous influential studies have explored the effect of tax policy based on developed countries (especially the United States (U.S.)), the majority study tax policy's impacts on investment and R&D spending (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== showed that U.S. federal R&D tax credit between 1981 and 1991 had a positive effect on R&D expenditures in the short-term. ==== examined Sweden's 2006 dividend tax cut and found that it had no effect on the aggregate investment, but had a positive effect on cash-constrained firms. Numerous other studies also estimated the impact of many tax policies on firm behaviors, such as accelerated tax depreciation (====; ====; ====), R&D tax credit, and subsidies to private capital (====). It is noteworthy that studies focusing on developing countries are scarce; details and compelling evidence of the effects of tax policies or tax reforms on firm behavior, particularly on firm productivity, are even more limited. Undoubtedly, the reform of tax system transformation in developing countries provides an opportunity to make up for the above researches deficiencies. And the rich information about the firms' basic, financial and taxation information of the China National Tax Survey Database enabled us to systematic estimate the effect of the BT-to-VAT reform.====Secondly, we also contribute to the literature by analyzing the productivity in service sector and introducing the mechanisms of how the BT-to-VAT reform affects firm productivity. Related literatures focused on the impact of tax policy on manufacturing industries, With the increasing total value added proportion of service industry (China's total value added proportion of service industry reached 54.5% in 2020), and the integration of service and manufacturing industry is a key national program. So, some scholars have started to pay attention to this topic recently (====; ====; ====). What's more, the BT-to-VAT reform studied in our paper is a complicated tax reform, which replaced a long-standing, substantial, and indirect tax (BT) with a different type of indirect tax (VAT). Thus, this reform contains many unusual characteristics that may not exist in other tax reforms in developed countries. The mechanisms underlying the positive correlation between the BT-to-VAT reform and firm productivity do not speak for themselves. In this paper, we explore the underlying mechanisms from different perspectives by using detailed micro data on the financial and tax situations of firms, including tax burden, cash flow, fixed asset investment, R&D spending, and specialization. This study, then, provides a good supplement to the existing research.====Finally, this study addresses many ==== (such as potential selection bias) by taking full advantage of the variations across time, industries, regions and the different type of pre-reform VAT taxpayer. And we also take parallel pre-trends test, placebo test and lots of robust tests to confirm the basic estimation results. Otherwise, the large unique administrative dataset allows us to conduct various heterogeneous effects analysis across firm ownership, size, pre-reform financial constraints, etc. Findings may help us to understand the effects of BT-to-VAT reform more precisely, especially for an emerging economy in transformation period like China.====Our paper is closely related to the recent studies that explore the effects of fiscal policy on firm behavior in China. ====, ==== analyzed the effects of VAT reform starting in 2004¡ªchanging the VAT from a production type tax to a consumption type tax¡ªon firm fixed investment and productivity. This reform is targeted at VAT taxpayers, mainly belonging to the manufacturing industry. This allows VAT taxpayers to deduct the costs for purchasing capital goods when calculating their VAT bases permanently. As the general VAT tax rate is 17% or 13%, this reform offers a large cost reduction for the firm and could have a substantial positive impact on firm investment and productivity. By using different datasets, ==== found that VAT reform significantly increases fixed investment by 28% and 38.4% on average, while ==== showed that this reform also increased the productivity of treated firms by 8.9%.====The BT-to-VAT reform in our paper is quite different from previous reforms, as mentioned above. Some scholars in China have done some analyses its effects on firms' behaviors about this reform or other tax reform in China (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, despite the differences in research topic, our paper also differs from previous studies in the following aspects. First, instead of using listed firms that have larger sizes and better financial conditions, we use a large detailed micro dataset that covers all kinds of firms. This dataset enhances the reliability of our results and allows us to study many heterogeneous effects. Second, our data covers all stages of this reform, which allows us to test parallel trend assumptions by engaging in many placebo and robustness tests, and to examine how the effects of the reform evolved over time. Thirdly, given that previous studies measure industrial upgrading (similar to firm productivity) by dividing the value added by the average employers, we use the OP, LP, and ACF methods to more precisely measure firm productivity.==== Finally, we analyze the potential mechanisms to clearly determine the channels through which the BT-to-VAT reform affects firm productivity.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of the BT-to-VAT reform and describes the details of the evolution of the examined BT-to-VAT reform. Section 3 presents the data, variable construction, and empirical methodology. Section 4 presents the main results, robustness test, heterogeneity in driving our results.

While importing promotes the expansion of economic scale, does it also lead the increase of pollution emissions in production? In this paper, we establish a micro theoretical model to analyze the impacts of importing on firms¡¯ environmental performance, and then use the data of China's manufacturing firms for empirical tests. We show that the importing of ","Among many aspects of China's economic growth in the past few decades is simultaneous prosperity of the import development: China's average annual growth rate of import is 14.1% from 1990 to 2018.====). Besides, this mode of using imported capital goods and intermediate goods in production also causes a concern, whether the expansion of economic scale after importing will lead to the deterioration of the environment.====To date, some existing literature has studied the environmental effects of trade. ==== and ==== analyze the impacts of trade on a country's environment, and propose that trade can affect the environment through technical effect, factor composition effect and scale effect. Because of the lack of emission data at micro-level, the existing studies mainly analyze from macro-level and industry-level. Though recent studies start to analyze the micro environmental impacts of trade, they mainly study the impacts of trade liberalization (tariff changes) on firms¡¯ pollution emissions, few studies focus on the impacts of firms¡¯ trade behavior on the emissions. Additionally, because the importance of exporting is more emphasized in trade, most of the existing research focuses on the analysis of the environmental effects of exporting (e.g. ====, ====), while the impacts of importing are often ignored. Thus, analyzing the impacts of firms¡¯ importing behavior on the environment, especially from the perspective of product-level, is of great theoretical value, which is helpful to comprehensively understand the relationship between trade and environment.====To our knowledge, studies on how importing affects pollution emissions at product-level are scarce. ==== establish a theoretical model to analyze the environmental effects of intermediate goods importing. It should be noted that, until now, there is still little empirical evidence at product-level (intermediate goods importing or capital goods importing) on the impacts of importing on environment. Therefore, this paper focuses on studying the environmental impacts of intermediate goods importing and capital goods importing. To do so, we first establish a micro theoretical model to analyze the impacts of intermediate goods importing and capital goods importing on firms¡¯ pollution emissions, and then employ the data of China's manufacturing firms for empirical tests. In the empirical tests, we use the PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching-Difference in differences) model to identify the causal relationship between importing and firms¡¯ pollution emissions. Our results demonstrate that the impacts of importing on China's environment actually have two sides. On the one hand, the importing of intermediate goods and capital goods will lead to the decrease of firms¡¯ emission intensity.==== On the other hand, the importing of intermediate goods and capital goods can increase firms¡¯ total amount of emissions. This will bring huge losses to the welfare of the entire society, since total pollution emissions have a tremendous impact on the social welfare.==== In fact, if we only analyze China's interests in trade from the perspective of GDP growth and technological progress, but ignore the environmental changes, then China's gains in trade are likely to be overestimated. Our analysis shows the importance of considering environmental effects in trade benefits.====We next explore why the importing of intermediate goods and capital goods will lead to the increase of firms¡¯ total emissions and the decrease of their emission intensity. We propose two potential mechanism¡ªproduction scale effect (====) and abatement investment effect (====, ====), to explain the change of firms¡¯ emission behaviors. Our empirical results show that after importing intermediate goods and capital goods, firms will expand their production scale, which leads to the increase of their total emissions. Besides, firms¡¯ investment in pollution abatement will also increase after the importing of intermediate goods or capital goods. This can effectively reduce firms¡¯ emission intensity. Furthermore, we also conduct the heterogeneous tests to examine the impacts of importing on firms¡¯ pollution emissions from the perspectives of different ownership types, different exporting status and different regions.====Compared with the existing studies, the contributions of our analysis are mainly in the following three aspects. Firstly, this paper analyzes the impacts of importing on firms¡¯ pollution emissions by classifying different types of imported products, which provides important product-level evidence on the relationship between importing and environment. Secondly, this paper provides a theoretical explanation to analyze the environmental impacts of importing. Based on the model of ==== and ====, this paper incorporates firm's behaviors of intermediate goods importing and capital goods importing into the framework, which analyzes the impacts of importing on firm's emission intensity and total emissions simultaneously. This can provide important theoretical references for the existing studies. Thirdly, just as mentioned, when analyzing the relationship between trade and environment, the existing studies focus more on trade liberalization on pollution emissions, and emphasize the importance of exporting on environment. This paper analyzes the environmental effects of trade from the perspective of importing, which is an important supplement to the existing studies and is helpful to comprehensively evaluate the role of importing on a country.====The rest of this paper is constructed as follows. ==== shows the literature review.

A 2-period model of household saving decisions demonstrates why increased college opportunities induce households with children to save more. We examine this theory using survey data from Chinese households during the unprecedented education expansion. Using estimates of the change in the expected probability of college attendance, we estimate the effect on household saving rates by comparing households before and after the reform. We find that a 10-percentage point increase in the probability of going to college raises the saving rate by 5.9 percentage points.","Beginning in 1999, the Chinese government rapidly expanded the previously constrained Chinese higher education system. The expansion increased the number of students allowed into Chinese universities by over 40 percent in the first year alone. While education in China is heavily subsidized, costs to families of the students were high relative to overall income and student loans were uncommon, requiring households to pay these costs out of accumulated savings or current income (====). In recent years, education expenditures have accounted for nearly 10 percent of Chinese household expenditures (====, ====, ====, ====), income uncertainty (====), private expenditures (====), economic reforms (====), and gender-related issues (====, ====). None of the theories fully explains the changes. We provide evidence that the college expansion was an additional factor in the rise of household savings rates in China.====To motivate our empirical approach and to clearly articulate the potential connection between education expansion and saving rates, we present a simple two-period theoretical model of household saving. The model is designed to highlight college saving decisions in a two period world where there is uncertainty in college admission. The key implication is that when the probability of admission to college rises, saving rises as well, for some households. This leads us to a testable hypothesis that, conditional on other factors which would determine the baseline saving rates prior to the expansion, families experiencing a larger rise in expectation of attendance will have higher saving rates. We exploit this intuition in our empirical estimation.====We use China's 1999 higher-education expansion as a natural experiment and estimate how the policy-induced changes in the likelihood of college affected saving rates. Guided by our theoretical findings, we focus on identifying families with ==== whose expectation of college opportunities for those children changed. These families are likely to have higher saving rates - in part to catch up - than other families, even those who would have expected to send their child to college prior to the expansion. We use 1995 and 2002 data from the China Household Income Project (CHIP). We use four distinct samples: families with college aged children before and after the expansion and families with school aged children before and after the expansion. We use the college aged samples to estimate models of college attendance and then use the primary school aged samples to estimate the savings model, using the change in probability to measure the intensity of treatment. We estimate the savings models both prior to the expansion and after the expansion. Much of our variation derives from differences in the timing and magnitude of the expansion across provinces. While the expansion has been large across all provinces, in 2002, there was substantial variation.====Our approach is consistent with other literature examining the impact of the higher education expansion. For example, ==== use an approach similar to ours to show that the Chinese college expansion increased human capital and improved productivity. ==== examine how the college expansion affected technology adoption in Chinese firms. Also, see ====, ====, ==== and ====, ====. These papers primarily focus on labor market implications, while we connect college expansion to saving behavior.====Consistent with the theoretical model, our main finding is that the expansion has an economically and statistically significant effect on household saving rates. A 10 percentage point increase in the college probability increases the average household's saving rate by 5.9 percentage points. This result provides evidence that the education expansion increased saving for households with school-age children. Our results appear to be driven by households experiencing a large increase in the possibility of college, while the few households who might always have planned on college had similar savings. Our main findings are robust to a variety of alternative specifications including interactions with important demographic variables, omitting provinces with the largest changes in enrollment rates and including households without a dependent child. We also carefully consider other policy changes that occurred in China, including housing reform, public healthcare reform, and the reorganization of State-Owned Enterprises.====The rest of our paper is organized as follows. ==== documents the saving rates among Chinese households and provides background on the education expansion. ==== presents the model of household saving that motivates our empirical analysis. ==== introduces the data, and ==== discusses our estimation strategy. ==== presents the main empirical findings. ==== contains additional analysis, and ==== concludes.",The expansion of higher education and household saving in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001541,29-Dec-21,2021,Research Article,190

This paper takes advantage of the large-scale smart meter data to investigate the electricity consumption inequality and adaptation vulnerability issues. We find that there is a serious inequality underestimation issue arising from annual aggregate data. An average of 8.39% of the inequality is hidden every quarter, while the monthly hidden value reached 13.41% due to the seasonal offset effects. This inequality is the robust nonlinear inverted-N shaped relationship with temperature, which implies that the cold temperatures have a more severe impact on social inequality issues than hot. For cold days, one additional day in the range?<?30?¡ãF would result in an increase of 3.05% electricity consumption inequality. We also find households in high inequality cities have worse response ability when facing extreme temperature, indicating poor will suffer more from extreme temperature exposure. Policies to address climate-induced inequality issues would be more efficient if more attention be paid to the poor in cold winter.","Despite the significant socio-economic development since 1978, increasing inequality has become the main barrier to China's further sustainable development (====). It has widely accepted that usage of modern energy, especially electricity, is a good proxy for economic activities (====; ====; ====). Scholars also confirm that the household electricity consumption inequality index represents a major social inequality issue, as it is closely related to lifestyle choices and living standards (====). The household sector is the only sector that can control electricity consumption through their individual decisions (====). Hence, it is probably the sector that is heavily affected by climate change (====). Rich households benefit most from inequality issues because they possess more than their proportional share of electricity to improve the quality of life and adaptation to climate change (====, ====). Therefore, identifying the inequality of household electricity consumption is the premise of promoting social equity and sustainable development.====Previous literature has examined the energy inequality issues at the regional and country-level (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), shows that electricity consumption remains relatively steady compared to other sources of energy (====; ====; ====). ==== and ==== find there is a huge diversity in electricity consumption per capita across province in China. Most research focuses on estimating annual energy inequality and analyse the inherent relationship between economic and energy inequality. ==== found there was severe inequality in expenses of energy among different income levels in Mexico. ==== noted that all conventional income inequality approaches can also be applied to energy equity issues by appropriate adjustment. Based on large nation-wide household survey data, ==== employed residential energy consumption data as a new index to measure economic inequality in China. ==== notes that there is a strong connection between income inequality and household energy consumption. Some studies also use energy data to investigate rural and urban inequality issues. For example, ==== analysed the effect of urban-rural income inequality on electricity consumption and revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between electricity consumption and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Zhou and ==== conducted a comparative analysis of the inequality heterogeneity among urban and rural residents. ==== explored energy inequality in Europe and found that different forms of energy service deprivation are major causes of energy inequity.====Some studies also used energy data to investigate inequality issues. For instance, ==== for the first time used the Lorenz curves to measure the inequality in energy consumption and noticed that changes in the energy distribution provide a new perspective from which to assess global inequality in the context of climate change. Climate change issues have become increasingly serious (====; ====). To date, climate-induced research on inequality issues generally focuses on the macro-regional level. ====, ==== introduced a Nested Inequalities Climate Economy model (NICE) to model the annual distributional of both climate change damages and inequalities of 12 world regions. ==== pointed out that there is a robust correlation between the Gini index of income and household heating ability. ==== found that climate change plays a key role in reshaping the distributions of energy consumption. With detailed examination, it turns out that there is a surprising twisting effect between seasonal and annual electricity consumption inequality. Recently, there also exist a few studies that use micro-level electricity consumption data for research. ==== applied segmented regression method to estimate the relationship between electricity demand and meteorological conditions in the United based on hourly electricity load data. ==== quantified the climate change impacts on household electricity consumption by using daily electricity data at a regional scale. ==== use hourly electricity data from Italian to examine how residential demand response to temperature. ==== examined how temperature rising affects electricity consumption patterns in future based on hourly data. Most of these research are focused on the temperature-electricity response functions, while the electricity consumption inequality issues are rarely involved. However, there is no research estimating and decomposing the climate-induced energy inequality as far as we know.====Most of these studies used aggregated data to carry out the analysis. When, however, fine-grained data are aggregated, potentially valuable information will be lost (====; ====). Both seasonal and regional heterogeneity determines the electricity consumption inequality due to varying responsibility to temperature change, lifestyle, and living standards. In practice, the electricity consumption varies throughout the year, and there is seasonal inequality heterogeneity in electricity consumption. Inequality issues in summer and winter are much more serious than those in spring and autumn since different households have different responsiveness to seasonal temperature changes. Poorer households are more vulnerable than richer households (====, ====). Namely, even the annual electricity consumption is relatively fair, there are still high risks for poor households bearing serious inequality issues when facing extreme weather.====Existing studies are useful to make a proxy for economic activities, while there are some limitations in making recommendations to provide a more specific and targeted policy to alleviate the vulnerability of the poor to climate change. Moreover, in terms of regional energy inequality, most of the studies are divided into several groups according to their geographical location, ignoring the inequality of electricity consumption of the intra-groups and evaluating the unfairness of electricity consumption (====;====). On the other hand, few studies have explored the determinants of seasonal energy inequity. ==== examined the inequality of energy consumption opportunity and the driving factors associated with circumstances. ==== elucidated the causes of household electricity poverty and noted that that income is the key variable concerning electricity poverty. ==== described how household electricity expenditure inequality depended heavily on national wealth, income distribution, and infrastructure. However, they did not conduct empirical analysis.In summary, previous studies have explored the energy consumption inequality issues, most of which rely on aggregate data at annual and country levels. Here, we aim to measure the seasonal inequality, identify the hidden inequality, and explore the inequality determinants based on large scale fine-grained data. This study contributes to the previous literature in three aspects. First, we study the dynamic social inequality evolution from the electricity consumption perspective, which contributes to provide more specific suggestions for formulating policies to alleviate social inequality issues. Second, it is one of the few studies that matching large-scale smart meter data with meteorological data to measure the inequality, identify hidden inequality, and investigate the determinants. Third, this study provides a new perspective on studying climate change adaptation vulnerability from the electricity consumption inequality lens, and reveals that poor people in high inequity cities have worse response ability when facing extreme temperature, especially cold weather. Although the results are based on the southern cities in China, it could be most credibly extended to the cities in other developing countries in subtropical regions.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, the inequality measurement, decomposition method and data sources are provided.

This significant positive effect can plausibly be attributed to their migration responses: mothers engage in temporary rural-urban migration to care for children following school closure. We find no effects on fathers' income and migration behavior. Our study provides the first causal estimation of the impacts of school closure on household labor supply and sheds light on the migration decision-making of rural females.","; ====; ====; ====; ====). Additionally, cost of education and cost of living in urban areas are generally higher, which may induce family members to increase labor supply to augment family income. In this paper, we study the effects of school closure on labor supply of mothers and fathers of primary school-aged children (henceforth, ¡°females¡± and ¡°males¡±), one important aspect of family behavioral changes, and in the process shed light on the migration decision-making of rural females.====For the empirical analysis, we use the rural sample of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data from 1991 to 2011, which covers several periods both before (1991, 1993, 1997, and 2000) and after (2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011) the school closure reform. We use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of school closure on parental labor supply, exploiting temporal and regional variations in the implementation of the school closure reform. We designate parents in villages that reformed during 2001¨C2011 as the treatment group, and those in villages that did not reform during the sample periods as the control group. To ensure the comparability of the treatment and control groups, we conduct propensity-score matching based on a wide range of observed village characteristics in the year before the reform. We conduct complementary analyses with the rural sample of the 2007¨C2008 Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) data using the same identification strategy. We consider males and females separately.====Using the CHNS data, we find that the school closure reform significantly increases female total annual income by1,762 Yuan, a 36.3% increase relative to the pre-reform average total annual income of the treatment group (1762/4851). This increase comes almost entirely from increases in wage income. Additionally, females in the treatment group show a higher probability of participating in wage work, higher wages, and more hours worked. In contrast, we find no impacts of school closure on male total income, income from different sources, participation, or hours worked. Dynamic analyses indicate identical patterns in total and wage income of females in the two groups of villages prior to the reform, but a sharp relative increase for females in the treatment villages post of the reform. Our results are robust to a broad range of alternative specifications and different sample restrictions. Corroborating findings from the CHNS data with the CHIP data, we again find a significant positive impact of school closure on female participation probability, monthly wages, and weekly hours worked in non-agricultural work, but no impact on males in any of these activities.====Having established that the school closure reform positively affects labor supply of females, we further explore potential mechanisms leading to these changes. Since females earn higher wages in wage work following the reform, we hypothesize that this may be due to females of reform villages working in higher-paying ====. Females move to the urban area to care for children; in this process, they incur a higher cost of living as well as a higher cost of education of their children, but they also become close to urban job opportunities. Using the CHIP data, we find school closure significantly decreases female probability of working in rural areas within the home province, while increases female probability of working in the urban areas within the home province. Meanwhile, we find no impact of school closure on female place of residence. These findings indicate that females engage in temporary rural-urban migration to care for children in response to school closure, but they also maintain permanent residence in the rural area, perhaps to fulfill other duties.====Childcare needs in the urban area appear to help females overcome inertia and migrate, whereas job information and ====Our findings that male labor supply or migration decisions are not affected by the school closure reform and female responses are not sensitive to husbands' wages suggest some element of a bargaining model in the decision-making of rural households, where females care more about children's education and hence work more to cover the higher cost of education in the urban area (====). In contrast, a unitary model of household decision-making would more likely to predict increases in male labor supply since males tend to face higher wage rates than females (====).====This paper is related and contributes to three strands of the literature. First is the literature on the effect of school closure. Previous studies focus on the direct effect of school closure, such as the effect on children's academic performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and educational attainment (====; ====). There is a relatively small body of work that studies other impacts of school closure such as house values (====; ====) and consumption and welfare of rural residents (====). Our study adds a new dimension and sheds new light on the consequences of school closure by providing the first (to the best of our knowledge) causal estimation of the impacts on parental labor supply.====Second, our paper adds to the literature on the relationships between childcare and family labor supply. An abundance of studies has investigated how childcare prices, subsidies, and the availability of public childcare programs affect family childcare and labor supply decisions, especially female labor supply (====; Blau and Robins 1986; ====; ====; ====). Most of these studies concern developed countries and urban areas, where public childcare services are widely available. In sharp contrast, in rural China, childcare is generally provided by family members, especially mothers, at home. School closure policies thus exogenously and substantially change childcare circumstances for families, which provides a unique opportunity to study the family childcare and labor supply decisions in the context of rural areas of a developing country. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, we find that labor supply of mothers, but not fathers, are responsive to changes in childcare needs.====Finally, this paper is related to the literature examining determinants and patterns of internal migration. Previous studies suggest that internal migrants in developing countries move mainly for employment, and it is the males who tend to migrate while females remain in villages to fulfill family responsibilities, such as child and elderly care (====; ====; ====). Determinants such as labor market opportunities, networks, information, capital, etc., have been widely studied (====; ====; ====; ====, who, using the same data (the 1991¨C2009 CHNS) and a fixed-effects model, find that the reduction in the number of primary schools increased the probability of out-migration of rural residents.==== Our paper differs from ==== primarily in two aspects. First, we employ a more rigorous identification strategy, a difference-in-differences (DID) model, to estimate the causal impacts of school closure. Before applying the DID estimator, we conduct a propensity-score matching between treatment and control villages to ensure comparability. Second, different from the rural residents at large considered in ====, we focus on parents of primary school-aged children, the group most likely affected by the school closure reform. A novel finding of our paper is that mothers of school-aged children are more likely to migrate to urban areas in response to school closure, and they move circularly between their village homes and in-province urban destinations.==== This migration pattern of females in our context may be attributed to their particular motivations for and barriers faced in moving. Detailed analyses of different groups of females in ==== generate further understanding of the migration behavior of rural females.====The paper proceeds as follows. ==== briefly describes the school closure reform and how it may affect household labor supply. ==== describes the data and the empirical model. ====, ==== present results for the impact of school closure on household labor supply and explore potential mechanisms. ==== concludes.",Effects of school closure on household labor supply: Evidence from rural China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001553,25-Dec-21,2021,Research Article,192

Does it harm the students' academic performance? This paper uses a representative survey of middle school students in China to answer the question. Using a causal identification based on schools with random class assignments, we find that the effect of a headteacher's holding an AP is negative and significant. In contrast, the effect of a subject teacher's holding an AP may be positive. The results are robust to various robustness checks. The heterogeneity analysis shows that the negative effect is driven by 9th grade students and is larger for boys, rural students, those whose parents migrate out to work, and those whose mothers have lower levels of education. Mechanism analysis suggests that head teachers with an AP devote lower levels of teaching effort, measured by time spent on grading and frequency of adopting supplementary teaching tools.","It is well established that teaching and management play critical roles in the education production process (====; ====; ====; ====). However, previous studies usually separate school managerial practice from teaching when evaluating student performance. This separation may be because teaching and administration positions (APs) are regarded as different career development paths in the western education system (====; ====).====The Chinese education system has a unique feature: teachers in the compulsory education stage are often given an AP. There are two motivations for this. First, teachers are motivated to seek APs for ==== in the highly competitive labor market; holding administrative positions while teaching is usually an easier way for high-qualified teachers with outstanding achievements to obtain promotions. The other is that limited by the number of teachers, school authorities such as principals or higher-level administrative departments are inclined to accord highly qualified teachers APs, hoping they will guide other faculties, such as young teachers, in improving teaching quality.====Although holding an AP while teaching is a common phenomenon in China's middle schools, few studies have examined its effect on students' academic performance. Does the headteacher's or subject teacher's holding a concurrent administrative position have a negative impact on the students' academic performance? If the effect is significant, what are its primary mechanisms? Will teachers' holding APs have a more profound impact on the students with poor backgrounds' than those with wealthier backgrounds?====(====). By estimating the students' academic outcome differences between the teachers with and without APs, we find that the headteacher's holding an AP has a negative and significant effect on the students' average academic outcomes and three core subject scores, but subject teachers' holding an AP does not harm the students' academic performance. Moreover, it is more noteworthy that the interaction effect of the subject teacher being a headteacher and simultaneously holding an AP is negative. The mechanisms can be explained by the headteachers' teaching effort, innovative teaching methods, feelings of esteem, and students' responses to the teacher's behavior.====Our study contributes to the literature on evaluating students' academic outcomes by examining the effect of teachers holding an AP on students' performance. Most existing studies examine the impact by considering teachers' demographic characteristics, quality and effectiveness, labor market conditions affecting supply and demand, and external interventions (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, among others). These studies provide a versatile understanding of teachers' influence on students' academic performance. However, the effect of teachers' holding an AP on students' performance is seldom studied. Our empirical finding provides new evidence that head teachers' holding APs harms students' academic outcomes with a significant economic implication.====Some studies on the effect of school governance and management on students' outcomes are related to our study. For instance, ==== find that changing a student's school environment effectively increases achievement among the poor. ==== link school-level charter impacts to school inputs and practices to explain why Massachusetts' urban charter schools boost students' achievement well beyond traditional urban public school students. ==== exploits a school-level randomized field experiment and quasi-experimental comparisons and finds that injecting best practices from charter schools into conventional public schools significantly increases students' math achievement in treated elementary and secondary schools.====Besides school governance, this study also contributes to our understanding of the role of school autonomy and institutional differences in determining student achievement. Teachers with concurrent participation in administrative management are given the right to formulate teaching plans and content autonomously. Our study reinforces previous findings on the impact of school autonomy on student outcomes. For example, school autonomy affects student achievement negatively in developing and low-performing countries (====). This conclusion is consistent with our finding that a headteacher holding an AP while teaching negatively affects the students' performance in a developing country, China. Moreover, our research helps to further understand the effect of the school education system. ==== finds that international differences in institutional structures of school systems are important sources of international differences in student achievement. Correspondingly, our finding shows that China's unique institutional arrangements also impact student performance.====Another contribution of this study is that it uncovers the mechanisms that drive the negative effect of headteachers' holding an AP based on both teacher- and student- responses. More directly, the headteacher's holding an AP tends to have lower teaching input, whether outside or inside the class. In addition, their teaching methods degenerate, and they feel less respected by students. At the student level, we find that the headteacher holding an AP makes students spend slightly less time on their homework. Hence, our findings support that the negative effect of holding an AP is derived from the lack of teacher-student interaction in behaviors and esthesis. Understanding these mechanisms is essential when designing policies to mitigate such adverse effects for middle schools in China.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows. ==== provides a background on institutions and policies about teachers holding APs in China. In ====, we introduce the data and variables. In ====, we present the estimation strategy and specify the models.

It remains unclear to what extent these variations may be explained by bureaucrats' professionalism, as measured by their educational background or work experience in public health or medicine. To investigate the effects of officials' professionalism on their response to and performance in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, we collect information from the r¨¦sum¨¦s of government and Party officials in 294 Chinese cities, and integrate this information with other data sources, including weather conditions, city characteristics, COVID-19-related policy measures, and health outcomes. We show that, on average, cities whose top officials had public health or medical backgrounds (PHMBGs) had a significantly lower infection rate than cities whose top officials lacked such backgrounds. We test the mechanisms of these effects and find that cities whose officials had a PHMBG implemented community closure more rapidly than those lacked such backgrounds. Our findings highlight the importance of professionalism in combating the pandemic.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China, in early December 2019. It then spread rapidly within China and worldwide, becoming a pandemic and bringing about devastating consequences (====). To contain the transmission of the novel coronavirus, countries around the world have adopted a wide range of stringent measures to reduce human interactions, such as family outdoor restrictions, closed community management, and large-scale quarantines and isolations.====The exponential viral transmission highlights the importance of a swift response. However, COVID-19 countermeasures vary substantially in the timing of their implementation and their efficacy. For instance, most East Asian countries, with their existing contact-tracing systems and experience of viral outbreaks, could contain COVID-19 in a relatively short time. Western governments, on the other hand, often began with loose regulations and delayed responses, which were followed by blanket lockdown. Countries that responded more quickly, such as Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, contained the spread of the virus more effectively than countries with a delayed response, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States (====; ====). The effectiveness of the pandemic response varied across countries and regions. For instance, in the initial phase of the pandemic, the case fatality rate (CFR) in Italy was 13.98% (number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases), in contrast to only 5.40% in China (====). Response effectiveness also varied within countries. In China, Hubei province had a CFR of 6.62%, which was much higher than the average value of 0.82% for other Chinese provinces (====). In the early stage of COVID-19 transmission, quarantine was often the most effective approach, especially in combination with other prevention and control measures (====). China's early implementation of family outdoor restrictions and closed community management might have avoided a large number of infections and casualties (====).====There is no doubt that combating the pandemic requires collaboration of the public, scientists, and government officials. The characteristics of officials may be particularly important, as they oversee policy formulation and enforcement to contain the spread of the virus. Their scientific knowledge may affect their perceptions of the underlying risks and corresponding responses. Numerous studies have suggested that a more diverse leadership team tends to be more productive and creative in problem solving, and leads to higher quality decision-making (====; ====). Moreover, leaders' educational backgrounds may shape their ideas and beliefs about policymaking (====). Leaders' experience may also be a good predictor of their behavior (====). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic offers the opportunity to better understand the role of officials' professionalism in emergency responses in a high-stakes context.====Do more professional officials strengthen the efforts to fight COVID-19? To test this hypothesis, we collect data on officials in 294 Chinese cities, and examine the effect of the officials' professionalism, as measured by having a public health or medical background (PHMBG), on epidemic control. A PHMBG is broadly defined as having received education or worked in public health or medicine. Senior officials are central to social management and development in China. Professional leaders with a PHMBG may leverage their unique experience during a public health crisis to demonstrate urgently needed skills in monitoring infectious diseases and organizing an effective policy response.==== However, only a small proportion of Chinese officials have a PHMBG. We collect the official r¨¦sum¨¦s of principal and deputy Communist Party secretaries (secretaries hereafter) and mayors, the officials responsible for managing a city, from which we extract information on their experiences relevant to a PHMBG. We merge this information with data from other sources, including COVID-19 infection and fatality data, a rich set of socioeconomic characteristics, and meteorological and environmental information at city level that may influence virus transmission. We estimate the effects of officials' PHMBG on the COVID-19 infection rates, death rates, and public health measures taken. Our linear regression model at the city level controls for city-level covariates associated with both the officials' profiles and outcome measures, including population density, GDP per capita, the number of doctors per 10,000 population, and the average air quality index (AQI). We also include weather controls, such as the average daily maximum temperature, average wind speed, and average precipitation. Our results indicate that a city leadership with a PHMBG was significantly associated with a lower infection rate, which seemed to be driven by the Party secretary's PHMBG. The backgrounds of the Party secretaries seemed to play a much bigger role in reducing infections than those of the mayors. We also show that having a PHMBG was important for timely implementation of local public health measures, such as community closure and outdoor restrictions, to curb human-to-human virus transmission.====This analysis represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to empirically test the impact of officials' professionalism on their policy response and performance in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. We contribute to the literature in the following respects. First, we offer novel evidence on how officials' characteristics influence policies, in the context of responding to a major public health crisis. Existing studies have mostly focused on the roles of officials' gender, age, and educational attainment (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Second, we add to the literature on the determinants of virus transmission. In addition to socioeconomic factors, environmental conditions, the political system, and compliance with disease control norms (====; ====), the PHMBG of a political leadership has an important effect on transmission, though this factor has received less attention in the literature.====This paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the data sources of this paper. ==== lays out our empirical strategy. ==== reports the findings.

We use data from the China Family Panel Studies, which is a nationally representative survey, and employ ","). Family care plays a critical role in shaping non-cognitive skills (====). Economics studies have analyzed extensively the impacts of parental care on children's non-cognitive skills (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Most of these studies are in the fields of medical science, psychology, and sociology, with only a few in economics (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====).====To address this research gap, this study analyzes the impacts of grandparental involvement in childcare on children's non-cognitive skills in China, with a focus on locus of control (LOC). LOC refers to a person's attitude or belief that the consequences of individual behaviors are typically either under their control (internal) or the control of the environment (external) (====). In other words, an individual with an internal LOC usually attributes individual success to internal factors, for example, effort, rather than external factors, such as luck, fate, and family background. LOC is related to other noncognitive skills, for example, neuroticism in the big five personalities, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, but its correlation with these noncognitive skills is weak (====). This implies that LOC captures different components from other noncognitive skills. LOC not only affects educational attainment (e.g., ====; ====; ====), but is also associated with life behaviors in young adults, like tobacco and alcohol consumption (====; ====), psychotic symptoms in early adolescence (====), and labor market performance and saving behavior in adults (====; ====; ====). In particular, ==== show that the effects of LOC on labor-market outcomes and social performance appear to be as strong as cognitive skills.====Economics and social psychology studies show that noncognitive skills develop and mature during the teen years and are malleable until late adolescence (====; ====; ====). Thus, interventions during adolescence can affect noncognitive skills (====). ==== document that the sensitive period for the influence of parental inputs on noncognitive skills is at age 8 to 11, and the effect at age 10 to 13 remains at least 40% of the effect at the sensitive period. As a key dimension of noncognitive skills, LOC develops during childhood and stabilize during adolescence (====), and the changes of LOC are concentrated among the young or very old (====). Hence, childhood and adolescence are crucial periods of LOC development, and family parenting can have important effects on its formation before a child reaches adulthood.====Childcare provided by grandparents has become a widespread phenomenon in many families in both urban and rural regions of China (====). Children with grandparental care analyzed in this study are different from the children left behind by rural migrants (e.g., ====). While left-behind children are mainly targeted at skipped-generation households (children living with only grandparents), the households in this study include skipped-generation and multigenerational households (children living with both parents and grandparents), as well as nuclear families. Based on the census data, although the number of skipped-generation households has grown rapidly in recent years, the proportion among all the household types remains relatively low, accounting for 2.78% in 2010 (====).==== By comparison, multigenerational households accounted for 17.18% of all the household types in 2010, which remains stable compared with its proportions in 2000 and even 1982 (====). The only data used in this study are from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), which is a nationally representative survey of Chinese families and individuals launched by Peking University in 2010, with three-generation households accounting for 50.4% of families with children under 16?years of age (====).====The reasons for grandparental care differ between urban and rural families in China. Besides traditional culture and custom, an important reason for grandparental care in rural areas is the rising number of rural-to-urban migrants. As more working-age couples migrate to urban areas for temporary employment, these couples usually have to leave their children with their elderly parents in rural villages due to the restriction of household registration and economic considerations (====). By contrast, because the existing public childcare system is incomplete and the market-based childcare services are imperfect in urban areas, urban couples often struggle to balance work and childcare, especially with the implementation of the comprehensive two-child policy (====). For these reasons, many grandparents assume responsibility for looking after their grandchildren in China.====In this study, we examine the effect of grandparental involvement in childcare on the LOC of children aged 10 to 15, which overlaps the effective period of family care for the formation of non-cognitive skills. In our definition, grandparental care occurs when grandparents are involved in childcare, and we compare children with grandparental care to those in the sole care of parents. We adopt the numbers of parents' siblings as ====We contribute to the existing literature in the following aspects. First, we address the research gap in the current economics literature on the impact of grandparental care on children's LOC and complement the literature on the effect of family caring on noncognitive skills by providing evidence from a large developing country. Previous economics studies usually focus on the effect of parental care on child development, while related literature on China often considers left-behind children of rural migrants who are in the absence of parental care as the research subjects. Second, our study extends the psychology literature, as we focus on school-age children and we provide empirical evidence on the potential mechanisms underlying the effect of grandparental care. Psychology studies usually examine the LOC of preschool children, and most of their mechanism analysis involves expository arguments. Third, since the childcare choice is usually a joint decision made by family members, we attempt to address the endogeneity issue by using the numbers of parents' siblings (brothers and sisters, separately) as IVs. We consider a possible threat to the exclusion restriction in the presence of LOC transmission within the family. We also conduct inference approaches proposed by ==== given that our IVs are only plausibly exogenous.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== reviews the existing literature on grandparental care and children's non-cognitive skills. ==== introduces the CFPS data and reports summary statistics. ==== presents our empirical models and main results. ==== conducts robustness checks. ==== discusses the underlying mechanisms, and ==== concludes.====Columns (1) to (3) in ==== report the estimation results after controlling parents' working hours. Only around one third of the observations remain in the estimation sample. Mother's working hours is strongly correlated with the probability of grandparental care. The OLS estimate is positive and larger than the one in ==== (0.124). The IV estimate is also positive and close to 1, though statistically insignificant, which is probably due to the small sample size. Mother's working hours negatively correlates with children's external LOC, with marginal significance. Columns (4) to (6) report the results after controlling parents' migration variable. Around 4000 observations remain in the estimation sample. Both parents' migrations positively correlate with the probability of grandparental care, especially mother's migration. Both the OLS and IV estimates are positive and statistically significant, and they are larger than the corresponding ones in ==== (0.124 and 1.135). In addition, mother's migration negatively correlates with children's external LOC. Therefore, controlling parents' migrations helps us distinguish the effect of grandparental care from the effect of the absence of parental care and we confirm that grandparental care has a positive effect on children's external LOC.",Is care by grandparents or parents better for children's non-cognitive skills?

To conduct our analysis, we employ a difference-in-differences (henceforth diff-in-diff) identification strategy to estimate the effect of a prefecture's lockdown measures on its air quality. Then, we use the rich information of the lockdown documents from local office to discuss the heterogeneity in the effects of lockdown measures. Finally, by collecting the most recent air quality data from monitoring Stations, we are able to check the long-term effect of lockdown measures.====; ====), he or she might be reluctant to enact such measures until the situation is quite bad. The second concern is that a local politician could be replaced if the spread of COVID-19 gets out of control.====To address this issue, we construct a prefecture's time-varying risk of COVID-19 outbreak, conditional on the average inflow of population from epidemic areas (other prefectures). This measure can be used to predict a prefecture's decision regarding lockdown measures. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that if a prefecture receives a significant inflow of population from an epidemic area, this prefecture might face a high risk of COVID-19 outbreak and should undertake lockdown measures (====).==== To construct our instrument, we use a prefecture's population inflow from another prefecture ====, to capture the relative importance of population flow from ==== to ==== between January 1st and January 9th.==== Before the outbreak of COVID-19, we believe the local governments had no incentives to manipulate this population flow out of the COVID-19 concerns. Therefore, this population flow could be treated as exogenous. To construct the time-varying aspect of a prefecture's COVID-19 risk, we use a time-varying dummy to indicate whether prefecture ==== had more than a certain number of confirmed cases ==== at time ====. The combination of these two variables allows us to predict whether a prefecture received a high inflow of population from a COVID-19 epidemic area, and whether this prefecture should have undertaken a lockdown.==== and ==== by around 25% and 35% respectively, and the results of diff-in-diff with OLS are only around 11% and 12%. The sharp difference between diff-in-diff with 2SLS and with OLS seems to suggest that there exists substantial heterogeneity in the stringency of lockdown implementation. This further suggests that the prefectures with a high risk of COVID-19 as predicted by our instrument did not undertake stringent lockdown measures, and prefectures with a low risk of COVID-19 did undertake stringent lockdown measures. This could also be confirmed by the fact that the accumulative confirmed cases of every prefecture located in Inner Mongolia and Liaoning province totaled less than 10 until the end of March. Both Inner Mongolia and Liaoning province declared a lockdown in every prefecture in their provinces on February 10.====Given that a prefecture's lockdown significantly reduces the density of air pollutants, we still need to carefully explain the mechanism behind. A prefecture's lockdown measures limit both the mobility of a prefecture's population and the operation of its factories. Only a handful of companies in ==== such as retail selling of medical supplies, medical services, and utilities were allowed to operate during the lockdown. We explore two major sources of a prefecture's air pollution: traffic and manufacturing production. To assess the effects of a traffic reduction on air pollution due to lockdown, we construct a prefecture's road intensity to capture its potential traffic volume in 2017. To capture the effects of production on pollution, we construct a prefecture's aggregate manufacturing firms' coal consumption intensity. A prefecture's aggregate manufacturing coal consumption intensity represents the dirtiness of this prefecture's production technology. If manufacturing production of a prefecture is at full capacity, more polluted technology implies worse air conditions. In other words, a prefecture is expected to experience a stronger improvement in air quality during its lockdown if it uses dirtier technology. Our estimates suggest that such prefectures experienced a stronger improvement in air conditions under lockdown, and that road intensity did not contribute significantly to the effects of lockdown on air quality.====We also investigated the heterogeneity in the effects of the various lockdown measures. By collecting the official documents about lockdown measures, we obtained the rich information of the severity of lockdown in different prefectures. For example, some low risk regions such as Yinchuan and Wuzhong tended to adopt weaker regulations like setting up checkpoints, cleaning and disinfecting the community, canceling mass gatherings and so on. Therefore, we can conduct a series of regressions to check the heterogeneous effects of various lockdown measures. we find that there are significant differences among the effects of various lockdown measures on AQI.====We provide a brief discussion herein on how our study is linked with the literature.

Drawing on aggregate education statistics, we first document a significant increase not only in the quantity, but also in the quality of teachers during the 1990¨C2005 period. ==== (IV) results based on the natural experiment of a substantial HE expansion in 1992/93 indicate that graduates exposed to the expansion had very high propensities, around 27%, to become teachers. Consistent with differential opportunity costs in a quasi-marketized labour market for graduates, the supply effect is found to be more pronounced for women and those living in less developed regions (up to 65%). While there is little evidence of an increase in the college premium for teachers resulting from the HE expansion on average, the findings of differential college premiums in earnings and non-pecuniary benefits between teaching and non-teaching graduate occupations, across such dimensions as gender, region type and the conditional earning distribution, suggest that teacher recruitment has become more market-oriented and flexible, in attracting low to lower-middle ability graduates into teaching, in an increasingly competitive graduate labour market.====This paper makes at least two contributions. First, we document a previously unexplored HE expansion in China in the early 1990s in the context of a mass transformation in secondary education, evidenced by the remarkable increases in both quantity and quality of teachers, over 1990¨C2005. Second, using the HE expansion in China in the early 1990 as a natural experiment, our IV estimates show a strong positive causal effect of the HE expansion on supply of teachers for college graduates who enrolled in HE only because of the expansion. Our findings indicate that the 1992/93 HE expansion has been instrumental in the substantial growth in the supply of college-educated teachers in an increasingly decentralized graduate labour market. Without this earlier expansion which markedly increased both the quantity and quality of secondary schoolteachers, the subsequent ==== which increased HE enrolment by 5-fold between 1998 and 2008 could not have been sustained due to the severe bottleneck in the supply of secondary schoolteachers.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 introduces the 1992/93 HE expansion in the context of the transformation of secondary education over 1990¨C2005, with details on the institutional factors. Section 4 presents the data and summary statistics of the analytical sample. Section 5 outlines the identification strategy based on instrumental variables estimation using the HE expansion as a natural experiment. Section 6 presents the empirical analysis which shows that the HE expansion has a positive causal effect on the supply of teachers, especially for women. This is complemented by analysis of the effect of the HE expansion on the college premiums in earnings and non-pecuniary benefits in explaining the heterogeneous patterns across gender, area type and ability distribution.

The effectiveness of these programs hinges on how successful the targeting is, but poor targeting remains concerned (====). Political elite capture is often considered as the major challenge in these programs (====; ====; ====), as most decentralized targeted transfer programs rely on the local political elite in implementation, such as selection of the recipients and dissemination of program information. Being directly connected with local political elite provides opportunities for households to obtain program benefits (====; ====). Targeted poverty alleviation has been an important component of China's antipoverty initiatives. China's poverty targeting has been evolving through district-county-township-village levels to households and individuals (====). TPA initiated in 2013 and designed to target households and individuals to lift 89.62 million poor people out of absolute poverty defined by the 2010 national poverty line in rural areas by the end of 2020. TPA adopted a bottom-up approach to identify the poor in the village as the beneficiaries are often chosen by the village authorities in a decentralized approach, which could offer space for villager social capital to exert influence. As the largest poverty targeting program in the world, exploring the role of villager social capital in TPA's targeting could offer a useful Chinese experience for global antipoverty efforts.====Villager social capital is the resources embedded in social structures that can be acquired or mobilized based on purposeful actions (====), usually including trust, reciprocity, political connections, and other types of social networks. Social capital is a kind of capital (====; ====), which implies that it can benefit people and directly or indirectly lead to a higher level of welfare (====). Many development studies have found that social capital contributes to poverty reduction, by providing financial support, emotional support, or credit (====; ====; ====). In the labor market, previous studies found that individual social capital provided job information and opportunities (====; ====). However, can villager mobilize their social capital to capture public antipoverty resource allocation?====Theoretically, since villager social capital is ¡°social¡±(====), there are mainly two types of resources embedded in villager social structure: the influence of power and information (====). In a decentralized targeted transfer program, beneficiary selection usually relies on the community (====), which provides the potential for villagers to mobilize their social capital to capture the benefits. First, villagers have social links to valuable nodes in the village, such as a member of the village executive committee, and use their social capital to exert influence on the committee those who can manipulate the selection process to favor these villagers. Second, villagers with rich social networks have access to unique information and can, therefore, take a more efficient lobby for beneficiary quotas (====In this paper, we empirically investigate the role of villager social capital in poverty targeting.

Many of these studies proved that the presence of elite capture is an important cause (====; ====; ====), but neglected the possibility of how ordinary villagers can obtain policy benefits through their accumulated social capital. Our paper also contributes to the literature on investigating the role of villager social capital. Most sociological studies agreed that people can mobilize their social capital to access resources of interest (====; ====; ====), while only some economic literature found a positive role of villager social capital in poverty reduction (====; ====; ====) by mobilizing financial support or credit.

Using a representative national survey data, we show that an increase in the share of religion believers in a village significantly raises the voting participation of individual believers but reduces the voting participation of individual nonbelievers. ","Religions are on rise in China. Traditionally, China didn't have any official religion, and the current official ideology is communism which considers religions as ¡°opium of the people¡± (====). However, in the post-Mao era (1976----), China witnessed the revival of religions. According to the World Value Survey, the number of religion practitioners quickly increased after the Cultural Revolution (====). It's even projected that China may become the country with the largest Christian population in the world in 30?years (====). This trend is particularly visible in the rural area, as a survey in six provinces in 2008 showed that about 15% of rural residents believed in institutional religions, e.g., Buddhism, Christian, Daoism, and Catholicism (====). The expansion of religions may profoundly affect China, as the teaching of religions stand in sharp contrast with the official ideology; and religious groups could emerge in some less controlled rural areas, posing a potential challenge for the existing orders (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====From the perspective of individual villagers, the outcome of election is a public good, and the probability to become a pivotal voter is relatively small as the size of a typical village is usually large.==== Hence, the classical voter turnout problem emerges (====). In this regard, religious groups, formally or informally, could act as an organizing force to mobilize voters. Various news reports by the state media also suggest the potential of religions in village elections in some regions.==== We employ a basic rational voting model with heterogenous voters to study the impact of the size of religion believers groups on voter turnout. On the one hand, believers groups provide selective incentives (==== method to evaluate the impact of omitted variable problems. The robustness check excludes the possible impact of competition among multiple religions.====To investigate the mechanism, we explore the questionnaires about the voting process and the allocation of government subsidies. It's shown that the size of religion believers in a village is significantly negatively correlated with the nonbelievers' willingness to vote, supporting the influence on expected pivotality by the religion believers group. Moreover, as the size of believers increases, the gap in election-related information transmission expands. The believers become more informed about the election information, but those nonbelievers suffer from information exclusion. This suggests that the exclusive information sharing among believers affects the cost to vote. Finally, we provide evidence that the size of religion believers in a village distorts the distribution of anti-poverty subsidies toward the religious households. Hence, religion believers groups reward the believers with more private benefits.====We contribute to the research on the role of religions in China. ====, ==== summarize the determinants of religious practices, as well as the links between religion and economic growth and socio-economic well-beings. Various studies show that religion could affect the preferences of believers and raise their willingness to voluntarily provide public goods (====; ====; ====). In China, the rapid revival of religion leads to the huge regional disparity in the share of believers (====). The complex interactions between religions and governments receive growing attentions (====; ====, ====). This paper disentangles the impact of religions on voter turnout, and shows that religion could mitigate information cost, raises the expected pivotality, and bias the targeting programs. Therefore, it complements with the study on the influence of religious in politics (====; ====).====Our paper also contributes to the study on the village committee election in China. Previous studies point out various factors influencing voter turnout decisions in rural China, including the economy, industrial structure, the performance of incumbents, clan culture, the quality of election, social fragmentation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), few studies examine the individual level variables like social trust, political trust, identity, etc. (====; ====). ==== examine the introduction of election from the perspective of state capacity. A paper closely related to us by ==== provides evidence that religious believers are less likely to cast vote in village committee elections. Consistent with the literature on the role of social capital in individual behavior, we consider religious groups as an organization of believers that play a similar role as social capital, and stress the role of religious groups in voter turnout. However, in contrast with previous works, we illustrate the dark side of social capital: religion believers groups may discourage the turnout by nonbelievers. This advances the understanding about the determinants of voting behavior in rural China.====Finally, our finding that the religion believers groups may distort the allocation of anti-poverty subsidies also adds to the growing literature on local elite capture in developing countries.

Using a ==== in a quasi-experimental framework, we find that having a Party branch has a significant effect on the coverage rates of individual and collective labour contracts as well as five social insurance schemes. The positive effect of having a Party branch on contract and social insurance coverage are weaker when the enterprise also has a trade union and staff representative congress, when the entrepreneur is a member of the CCP or the People's Congress or Political Consultative Conference and in provinces in which government intervention is lower or the private sector more developed. We find that firm-level mean wages and spending on training and occupational health and safety mediate the relationship between having a Party branch and labour rights.","The private sector has become the growth engine of the Chinese economy, contributing to two-thirds of China's GDP (====). In general, workers employed in the private sector have poorer access to employee rights and benefits than those in the state sector. For instance, compared to the state sector, private firms have lower social insurance coverage (====), lower labour contract coverage (====) and a higher incidence of wage arrears (====).====). The major functions of the Party branch include recruiting new Party members, monitoring private enterprise to ensure that they comply with laws and policies, advising private enterprises on significant operational matters, guiding trade unions, defending employees' legal rights and completing tasks assigned by higher CCP organisations (====).====The existing literature finds that state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which have strong connections with the CCP, have played a significant role in providing social services and welfare to workers in China (====, ====, ====; ====; ====). However, despite their strong organisational presence, it remains unclear whether, and how, Party branches impact the operation of private enterprises (====; ====; ====). There is a lack of research on the causal effects of Party branches in private enterprises. This study helps address this gap by identifying the causal effects of Party branches in ensuring that private enterprises meet obligations to workers through providing labour contracts and social insurance.====It is challenging to estimate the causal effect of having a Party branch in Chinese private enterprises. In the context of our study, the ideal approach to identify a causal relationship would be to randomly assign Party branches to private enterprises in an experimental design and then compare the outcomes between the two groups of private enterprises that have, and do not have, Party branches. But, obviously, running such an experiment is not feasible.====).====We contribute to three strands of literature. First, we contribute to the literature on employer compliance with labour contract and social insurance laws in China. Extant studies find that private domestic firms were much less likely to participate in social insurance schemes than SOEs (====; ====). The focus in this literature, thus far, has been mostly on identifying individual determinants of access to labour contracts and social insurance (====; ====; ====; ====) or factors external to the enterprise, such as employer monitoring, industrial agglomeration and the intergovernmental fiscal system (====; ====; ====; ====).====We broaden this focus to examine the extent to which labour contract and social insurance coverage is influenced by political organisational arrangements ==== the enterprise. ==== show that external monitoring has only been partially effective in improving compliance of private enterprises in China with their social insurance obligations. There is much evidence that external monitoring has been ineffective in ensuring labour contracts are provided (see e.g. ====). Given that the CCP is concerned about improving compliance with social insurance, this makes alternatives to external monitoring, such as exerting organisational influence from within, a vital channel. A few studies that are more closely related to ours examine the relationship between having a Party branch and varied aspects of employment protection and firm performance (====; ====; ====, ====). Different from these existing studies, the present study employs a different identification strategy and/or examines a different set of outcome variables, moderators and mediators.====; ====).

An examination of the mechanism shows that both electricity and irrigation infrastructure increase the probability of participating in agricultural work and therefore increase agricultural income. These findings imply that, through increasing the utilization of agricultural land and the labor of impoverished households, electricity and irrigation infrastructure investments in rural impoverished areas are likely to lead to pro-poor and sustainable development.","); the Rural Roads and Markets Improvement and Maintenance Project (RRMIMP) in Bangladesh funded by the World Bank (====); and the Prime Minister's Village Road Program in India (====), while rural roads in Philippines did not benefit the poor (====). Given the large observable and unobservable differences in regions and projects, it is difficult to compare across these investments and reach a general conclusion on the effectiveness of investments. The Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program in China, started in 2013, provides an opportunity for a more comprehensive comparison, as this program invested in various kinds of infrastructure in a large number of impoverished villages during the same period. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the infrastructure investment shock brought about by the TPA program in China, and investigate the effects of various infrastructure investments on agricultural income of impoverished households.====There has been a large literature studying the effect on income of infrastructure investments in rural areas, especially in developing countries. Theoretical literature generally agrees that infrastructure investment can stimulate economic growth by raising the productivity of the agricultural sector (e.g., ====; ====; ====). However, empirical findings about the impact on the level and distribution of income are mixed. A large series of literature shows that improvement in infrastructure ¨C such as construction of expressways, improving road quality, and equipping rural areas with irrigation and electrification ¨C significantly increased agricultural production and agricultural income (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In contrast, some literature has found the opposite. For example, ==== found that India's national rural road construction program significantly reduced agricultural income by reallocating labor out of the agricultural sector; ==== found that irrigation infrastructure in Nepal did not have a significant distributional effect; and ==== showed that road construction in the Philippines significantly reduced poor people's average expenditure (a proxy for income) and expanded income inequality, while electricity access increased average expenditure but did not have a significant effect on the lowest-income group.====Mixed findings yield unclear implications for governments and institutions to choose among anti-poverty investments. Therefore, understanding the reasons behind the different findings is necessary for relevant policy making. We notice the following facts in the literature. First, the previous literature varies in investment types. Infrastructure investment studied in the literature includes investments in roads, electricity access, irrigation facilities, or other kinds of facilities. Given that types of investment vary, mechanisms to affect income and its distribution could also vary. Second, the previous literature varies by regions. Given that different regions have different institutional backgrounds, ==== levels, natural resources, etc., effects of infrastructure investment are likely to differ as well. In addition, previous studies use different methods or have different variables of interest, such as income, non-rural employment, benefit-cost ratio of infrastructure, etc. These differences may affect the conclusions as well.====Utilizing a comprehensive administrative dataset and the exogeneity provided by China's Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program, this paper investigates which type of infrastructure investments positively affect villagers' agricultural income and reduce inequality among the poor. We also investigate the potential mechanism of the effects. The findings shed light on the design and implementation of policies that aim for pro-poor development through infrastructure construction.====The Targeted Poverty Alleviation program was launched in 2014 in China. It is a set of policies and projects aiming to eradicate poverty through investing in infrastructure, education, technology, etc. in rural areas.==== Infrastructure investment has concentrated on ¡°within-village¡± investment to solve the problem of ¡°last mile¡± connectivity. For example, electricity infrastructure such as transformers and distribution lines are constructed using TPA funds in order to improve rural power supply safety, increase power supply reliability, and increase power capacity. In addition, irrigation facilities are built in the TPA program to improve agricultural production; these include ponds, revetments, dams and weirs. During the period from 2014 to 2018, all funds invested in within-village infrastructure are from the TPA program. This makes the infrastructure investment data from TPA a good measurement for the infrastructure level of the village.====TPA has two critical features different from previous poverty reduction policies in China, which provide us the opportunity to identify the causal effects of infrastructure on agricultural income and inequality.====The first feature of the TPA program is that it targets the poor. The program puts great effort into precise identification of poor people and creates a list of Identified Poor Households (IPHs) all over China. Local governments are required to collect information for the households on the IPH list and to update the information annually. This provides researchers an opportunity to acquire panel data of IPHs since 2014.====The second feature is that it targets the needs of individual poor households and provides policy intervention accordingly. On the household level, the TPA program provides transfers directly from TPA funds to households to meet their livelihood needs, including agricultural development, to encourage IPHs to improve agricultural production. On the village level, the TPA program makes various investments, of which infrastructure is the largest. This includes investment in roads and bridges, educational infrastructure, communication infrastructure, irrigation facilities, electricity infrastructure, etc. Given the feature of targeting, the TPA program tailors the anti-poverty measures based on specific village characteristics, so the infrastructure investments differ across villages in terms of categories, amount, and construction time. In sum, the TPA program provides an opportunity to compare the effects of various infrastructure investments with the same background, because it invested in various infrastructure projects in a large number of similar villages during the same period. It also provides exogenous shocks to ====, which make possible the identification of the causal effect of infrastructure on agricultural income.====We focus on agricultural income, the revenue from agricultural activity, of impoverished households, because agricultural income is one way for poor villagers to develop by utilizing local resources. Migration to urban areas is an effective way to increase total income, but it also faces many problems, such as unstable employment, left-behind children, etc (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In addition, an increase in agricultural income is the key to the success of the Rural Revitalization Strategy of China.==== The Rural Revitalization Strategy aims to stimulate the internal development of the rural areas (====) and the increase in agricultural income is expected to attract migrants back. With more labor and capital, it is hoped that this strategy will finally lead to the development of rural areas.====As we focus on agricultural income, we pay attention to two kinds of infrastructure investments that are important to agricultural production: electricity and irrigation infrastructure. Electricity infrastructure includes grid infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines) and substation infrastructure (e.g., transformers and switches). It is the key to electrification. Access to electricity and the use of high-quality power can promote the income level of rural residents (e.g., ====; ====). ==== found that electrification in South Africa stimulates employment of people living in rural areas, which is a potential channel to influence households' income. ====; ====; ====), improving health (====; ====), and reducing environmental pollution (====).====Irrigation facilities provide better water resources to agricultural production and reduce the dependence on local rainfall (====; ====). Irrigation therefore serves as an important poverty reduction tool (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====), through increasing agricultural productivity, decreasing the risk of crop failure, increasing farm employment, etc. (e.g., ====; ====). Moreover, because water is a key natural resource on which the rural poor heavily depend (====), irrigation infrastructure may have the potential to improve income inequality.====Based on household- and village-level data on income and infrastructure investments through China's TPA, we find that total infrastructure investment does not increase the poor population's agricultural income but has a negative coefficient, although it is insignificant. This means infrastructure in general did not stimulate agricultural activities, consistent with the empirical results of ====. However, we find that electricity and irrigation infrastructure investments increased agricultural income significantly. Moreover, we explore the distributional effect of different types of infrastructure and find that electricity infrastructure does not have a significant effect on the distribution of income, indicating that it benefits the poor evenly. By contrast, irrigation infrastructure reduced agricultural income inequality, indicating that investing in public irrigation facilities not only benefited the whole group of people, but benefited the poorest people most.====We then investigate the mechanisms through which infrastructure affects agricultural income. Different infrastructure may have different impacts on labor participation and the time spent working (====; ====; ====; ====). Previous literature has mainly focused on the potential impact of infrastructure on wage rates, amount of time worked at home and non-rural employment (====; ====; ====), while we focus on the participation (==== extensive margin) and the working time spending in agricultural sector (==== intensive margin). We find that electricity and irrigation infrastructure investments have significant labor reallocation effects. Regarding the extensive margin, both types of infrastructure investments increase the probability of labor participation in the agricultural sector. This indicates that the willingness to participate in agricultural production is significantly stimulated by the provision of necessary agricultural infrastructure. Regarding the intensive margin, we do not find that the amount of time worked in the agricultural sector is significantly increased.====The first contribution of this paper is that we distinguish the effects of electricity and irrigation infrastructure from the total effect of general infrastructure categories. Isolating the effect of agricultural and electrical infrastructure helps explain the mixed findings of previous literature on infrastructure's effects and therefore assists in drawing clear policy implications. The second contribution is that, due to the detailed income data, we can distinguish infrastructure's impact on agricultural income from the impact on total income. The increase in agricultural income is the key for rural revitalization, so it is worthy of specific attention. The third contribution is that, besides the effects on income, we also study infrastructure's distributional effects, to call attention to the poorest people and inequality issues. The concern is that, due to limitations in human capital and resources, the poorest people may not have the ability to take advantage of and benefit from infrastructure investments. If not pro-poor, the growth cannot be inclusive and sustainable.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the datasets. ==== shows the empirical results regarding the effects on income and distribution. ==== explores the mechanism of the income increase. ==== concludes.",Promoting pro-poor growth through infrastructure investment: Evidence from the Targeted Poverty Alleviation program in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001474,2-Dec-21,2021,Research Article,201

This paper provides micro-level evidence to Baumol's entrepreneurship allocation theory and a mechanism to account for the observed negative effect of local government leadership turnover on local economic growth in China.","Political institutions have significant impact on economic growth (e.g. ====; ====; ====), and the turnover of government and the policy uncertainty it results also cause economic fluctuations and affect firm performance (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These impacts are particularly evident in developing countries, where businesses rely on deals with various levels of government rather than rules (====; ====). Much theoretical literature recognizes that the institutional environment and government policies affect growth through the behavior of entrepreneurs (Buchanan,1980; ====, ====, ====; ====), but there has been little empirical analysis (====; ====; ====), cronyism and special deals (====). It is widely accepted that, in addition to the labor market characteristics (====; ====; ====), high savings and capital accumulation (====) and central government's development strategy (====, ====), China's remarkable growth was partly due to highly active local government facilitation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Chinese local governments and officials have the capacity and incentives to allocate resources and award preferable treatments to particular firms (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Within this environment, entrepreneurs must allocate more time to non-productive activities in order to maintain and develop a business-government relationship. Analyzing the resulting changes to the behavior of entrepreneurs is the focus of this paper. By employing a unique matched firm level microeconomic survey data and manually compiled government turnover data set from China, this paper examines the behavior of entrepreneurs and how it is affected by government leadership turnover. This paper provides micro level evidence to ==== classical entrepreneurship allocation theory, the rent-seeking literature, and provides a mechanism to the observed negative effect of local government leaders' turnover on local economic growth in China.====This paper studies how the allocation of time and effort of entrepreneurs is influenced in Chinese regions by the turnover of major political leaders. On one hand, market reforms and the development of the market economy have encouraged entrepreneurs to compete through innovation. On the other hand, entrepreneurs cannot ignore the fact that the various levels of the Chinese government control huge amount of political and economic resources, and government officials have significant discretionary power in terms of resource allocation and market intervention (====; ====). The relationships entrepreneurs are required to develop with officials may benefit the firm by securing more resources and subsidies, or at least prevent the firm from being severely disadvantaged and exploited.====The turnover of local government officials provides a natural experiment for us, as the change of local officials often means a change in the local political ecology. As the old officials leave, the existing relationship of the firm with the government may break down. Especially, under the so-called semi-legal-system of China (====), contract enforcement and property protection depend not only on law but also on people (rule-by-law vs. rule-by-person). Entrepreneurs must spend more time and resources to establish a new relationship. The question is whether these affects can be tested empirically.====It is not easy to quantify the time allocation of entrepreneurs. The lack of empirical studies in this area was mainly due the lack of instrument and data to identify individual behavior such as unproductive entrepreneurship. In this paper, our empirical strategy is first to categorize the entrepreneur's disposable time into work and leisure, then to further disaggregate work time into productive actives, such as everyday management of firms, and non-productive activities, such as managing public relations, entertaining visitors and inspectors, and attending out-of-firm meetings. We source this time allocation data from the ¡°National Survey of Private Enterprises¡±. We have also manually collected information on the turnover of the prefecture level city government officials, and have linked the two datasets together. Thus, we are able to study the impact of government officials' turnover on the time allocation of entrepreneurs. Our results show that the turnover of local officials significantly alters the time allocation of entrepreneurs: they reduce their time on productive activities and increase their time on non-productive activities such as leisure and cultivating relationships. Our results emerge favorably from a series of robust and placebo tests.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. Firstly, it provides micro level empirical evidence for Baumol's entrepreneurship allocation theory. Although there have been some theoretical studies in this area (e.g. ====; Buchanan,1980; ====; ====), there are very few empirical ones, mainly due to data constraints. ==== tested the relationship between institutional quality and the productivity of entrepreneurship, but used macro level data which does not provide direct evidence of entrepreneurs' behavior. ==== show that while a better institutional environment encourages entrepreneurs to substitute more unproductive activities for productive ones, entrepreneurs sacrifice more productive activities for unproductive activities when rent extraction threatens. The present paper investigates how officials' turnover influences entrepreneurs' time and effort allocation between productive and unproductive activities, thus providing further micro-economic evidence for the allocation theory of entrepreneurship.====Secondly, this paper makes an important empirical contribution to the rent-seeking literature, which lacks empirical studies. When the public administration changes, the consequence is similar to a new rent-seeking contest in which resources are allocated by the private businessmen to contesting the rents that the new public administration has to offer. Our empirical questions focus on the extent of distraction of resources and time by private businessmen to rent-seeking. Our empirical results show how the change of public administration evokes a new rent-seeking contest in which time and resources are inefficiently allocated to contesting rents.==== ==== argues that competing candidates and political parties may create new rent-seeking games for campaign contribution. In addition, the change of public administration may evoke new rent-seeking games too. ==== find that there is a negative relationship between gubernatorial turnover and state economic growth in the United States. They believe that the possible explanation is that the change of governors brings more rent-seeking which inhibits growth.====Thirdly, the paper deepens our understanding of current political-business relations in China. Quantifying the effect on the allocation of entrepreneurial time and effort of the turnover in government officials will help us better to understand a phenomenon not only important to China but also to other developing counties. For example, why some autocracies are economically efficient whereas others are inefficient (Besley and ====; ====).====Lastly, it helps us to understand the microeconomic mechanisms of policy uncertainty on growth. For example, there have been some empirical studies (e.g. ====; ====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

In particular, we use the model to characterize the macroeconomic effects and transmission mechanisms of the COVID-19 disease outbreak. Furthermore, we use the model to analyze the economic cost and benefits of containment policy and random testing. We also consider a Ramsey social planner problem to solve for the optimal monetary policy in response to the outbreak.====To bridge the SIR and DSGE models, we assume that the severity of the disease, which is measured by the number of infected individuals, affects the economy through both the demand and supply sides. For the demand side, as in ====We show that both containment policies and random testing are effective means to curb the infected number. The former works through reducing the number of susceptible, while the latter works through discovering asymptomatic individuals. In particular, randomly testing 10% of the uninfected could reduce the peaked value of the infected share by two-third. Furthermore, it is more effective in curbing the infected share if one implements both policies simultaneously. Our result suggests that economic impacts of the two policies differs: containment policy prevents output loss more effectively in the short run, while can lead to slower output recovery if persistently implemented. A random testing policy, in contrast, has minimal short-term impact on output, but can accelerate output recovery.====By comparing the centralized and decentralized equilibria, we find that although the centralized output decreases more substantially during the pandemic, the decentralized output is recovered at a slower rate than the centralized output. Due to the presence of the ====, the decrease in the TFP level leads to a higher wage rate in the short run. The households would, therefore, increase their labor supply in the short run and decrease it in the long run. With this decision, the decentralized output slowly recovers in the long run after the pandemic. However, the social planner allows both the labor supply and investment to decrease in the short run. To this end, the centralized output and employment recover at a much faster rate.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== discusses the related literature. ==== discusses the background of the standard SIR model.

Our results indicate that, in a globalized world, firms' international status, internal networks and input-output linkages all play important roles in determining their exposures to the pandemic.","First detected in Wuhan China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread to many parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared it a pandemic.====In this study, we aim to contribute by empirically examining the above important yet unexplored research questions. Tackling these research issues face two challenges. First, severe health crises do not occur often. While the recent outbreak of COVID-19 is certainly unfortunate, it provides researchers with a rare opportunity to investigate these questions. A second empirical challenge is that it would likely take time for the economic outcomes following a large-scale adverse health shock to fully realize; but during the long-time horizon many other factors can also change, which would then make it harder to distinguish the effect of a negative health shock from the effects of other concurrent changes. To overcome the second empirical challenge, we take advantage of the fact that stock market participants take into consideration future developments in the current pricing of a firm's equity and employ an ==== approach.====Specifically, we examine the ==== effects of two symbolic events in the outbreak of COVID-19: (1) the lockdown of Hubei province; and (2) the containment of the disease in China and its spread to overseas, using a sample of Chinese listed firms. We study both the market responses to the events and the determinants of the valuation effects. Overall, our results suggest that a public health crisis can have significant impacts on corporates, and the effects vary at different stages of outbreak.

We find that the OMBs activities in China experienced an immediate and dramatic drop of 50% during the trough. The businesses had rebounded to around 80% of where they should be seven weeks after the COVID-19 outbreak, but had remained at this level until the end of our time window. We find a larger disruption to the OMBs in urban areas, the female merchants and the merchants who were not grown up in the places where they conducted businesses. We discuss the implications for policy support to the most vulnerable, and highlight the importance to take full advantage of digital development to follow up the informal economy.","Obtaining accurate statistics about the informal economy has become one of the most daunting challenges in most developing countries (====; ====), especially examining the pain they felt at the times of big crisis such as COVID-19 pandemic. Even if the pandemic caused heavy blows to society as a whole, it would hit the informal workers disproportionately. For example, the street vendors mainly work in the services sector, are usually self-employed or informally employed without social insurance, and are mainly in micro and family enterprises. Measuring the size of the informal economy accurately and examining the impact that they felt is important for making effective economic policy decisions. In China, it is becoming possible due to the rapid digitalization of the economy, as paying with digital payment tools has become a daily occurrence. According to People's Bank of China,==== the proportion of adults using digital payments was 82.39% in 2018. Domestic users of Alipay and WeChat Pay, China's two largest digital payment service providers, have exceeded 900 million. People use digital payment tools for online and offline transactions, and even small businesses such as street shops and peddlers have adopted digital payments such as Alipay, WeChat Pay, UnionPay, and others. The accumulation of digital information enables us to largely approximate the size of informal sector and gauge to what extent they have been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.====In China, mobility restrictions like lockdowns and social distancing measures have greatly contributed to the containment of the spread of the disease (====; ====), and the numbers of domestic new cases came under control in March 2020. However, aggressive countermeasures, such as stringent lockdowns, have also imposed tremendous economic costs on the country in the short run. China's economy shrank by 6.8% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction in the past four decades. As a result, vulnerable groups are likely experiencing deterioration of their income and livelihood. China emerged from a two-month containment phase and moved into the mitigation stage by early April 2020.==== In this article, we explore the impacts felt by China's offline micro businesses (OMBs) in the informal sector, which are mainly self-employed in the services sector and not able to work from home.====).====Using weekly data on around 80 million ¡°QR code merchants¡± (==== which is comparable to our sample including around 80 million OMBs. Our sample spans from December 31, 2019 to April 2, 2020 and the corresponding lunar calendar dates in 2018 and 2019. We use the lunar calendar dates to account for the seasonality in economic activities during the Lunar New Year. A notable day in COVID-19 control and prevention was January 20, 2020 (five days before the Lunar New Year), when human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus was confirmed and reported to the public. Thus, we use that day as the start of the outbreak and the event date in the following analysis. We define the periods before and after January 20 (December 26 in the lunar calendar) as the pre- and post-virus periods, respectively. We use the corresponding lunar calendar dates in 2018 and 2019 to define the pre- and post-virus periods.====A simple year-on-year change in OMB activities would lead to mismeasurement of the real economic impacts of the pandemic, because it is likely that the businesses were on a growing or decreasing path relative to the same period last year, if there were no COVID-19 pandemic.==== We first predict the counterfactuals using a machine learning technique and further interpret the difference between the realized and counterfactual results as the causal impact of the pandemic (====). Specifically, we merge OMB data with other economic, population, and geographic characteristics at the Thiessen-polygon level.==== We predict the counterfactual activities of OMBs in the post-virus period in 2020 by modelling the relationship between the activities of OMBs in the post-virus period and the other feature variables. The feature variables include OMBs activities around the same period in the previous year, OMBs in the weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, cross-section data as of December 2019 such as economic environment, population, and geographics, and panel data like meteorological characteristics in 2020. The parameters are from the trained gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model using the data from 2018 and 2019, which reveals the relationship between the activities of OMBs in the post-virus period in 2019 and the feature variables. The difference between the predicted counterfactuals and the actual values in 2020 gives an estimate of the real impact of the pandemic on OMBs.====We find a massive decline in the number and sales turnover of active OMBs in the post-virus period in China. The number and sales turnover of active merchants bottomed out in the second week of the post-virus period, January 31 ¨C February 6, and remained in a downturn for the following three weeks. Relative to the counterfactual level estimated from the machine learning technique, the average weekly drops in the number and sales turnover of active merchants were around 50%, between January 31 and February 20, after which OMB activity started to rebound. As of early April, one month after the trough, OMB activities bounced back to around 80% of their counterfactual levels. In addition, we find that the announcements of government lockdown polies could explain a limited portion of overall decline of OMBs activities, and what matters most may plausibly be the voluntary containment measures.====OMBs in urban areas bore the hardest hit. The largest weekly decline in the number of active merchants was about 54% in urban areas, compared with a 41% contraction in rural areas. In addition, we see a simultaneous contraction of business activity during the entire month of February, followed by a nationwide synchronous recovery starting at the end of February, although there were regional variations in the spread of the virus. Female merchants saw drops of around 53 and 57% in the number and sales turnover of active OMBs during the trough, respectively, and the drops were about 5 and 9% larger than the average for the male merchants. The decrease in economic activities were larger for the outsiders, the owners who were not born in the province where they conducted businesses, with a larger drop of 7% in the number of active merchants than the natives who were managing businesses in their birth provinces. Generally speaking, the outsiders do not enjoy the same social benefits as the natives and are more vulnerable to shocks.====Although there is fast-growing research on COVID-19, as far as we know, our paper is the first to study the impact on OMBs that would be disproportionately hard hit by the pandemic and lockdown measures. Other studies focus on the spread, containment, and economic and political consequences of COVID-19 and previous pandemics, given its significant damage (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== examine how exposure of Chinese registered firms to the Covid-19 shock varied with a cluster index (measuring spatial agglomeration of firms in related industries) at the county level. However, few studies estimate the real impact on hard-hit informal workers that were particularly vulnerable to dramatic collapse during the COVID-19 pandemic.====In addition, we contribute to the broader literature on informal economy. Informal businesses are inherently difficult to identify, because most of them are usually small-scale, frequently family-based, and perhaps low-productivity businesses with much informality and nearly no records of social security. However, informal economy such as OMBs contribute significantly to employment, especially in developing countries (====; ====). Informal workers in the Asia-Pacific region account for nearly 60% of nonfarm employment, ranging from around 20% in Japan to over 80% in Myanmar and Cambodia.==== OMBs in China operate largely in the informal services sector, and most of them could not work from home during the pandemic. We identify informal business in the gig economy by taking advantage of their digital footprints, using data from the world's largest Fintech company.====There are around 80 million offline micro business (OMB) merchants in our data set. With the data privacy issue in mind, we would aggregate the OMB data at an appropriate geographical level. The widely-used delineation based on administrative units, census tracks, and other established areas leads to a great loss of information in our large sample. For example, it would be unfortunate if we assigned 80 million OMB merchants into 2800 counties. A principle of the proposed aggregation method is to start at the lowest possible geographical level and the area could adjust adaptively according to local business activities, namely, the tracts should be densely distributed in the areas with higher population density and level of economic activity, and vice versa. This avoids a substantial increase in the number of initial territorial units, like unified small grid cells, and ensures a closer relationship between the number of OMBs and the characteristics of economic development, population, and geography in every single tract. This ensures keeping information at the granular data to a large extent.====We propose to create Thiessen polygons and assign the OMBs into each polygon. Thiessen polygons, otherwise known as Voronoi diagrams, are an essential method for the analysis of proximity and neighborhood, for example, airtime transfers and mobile communications (====), police enforcement and spatial distribution of crime (====), determinants of HIV infection (====), and traffic crashes (====). The method defines an area around a center point, where every location is nearer to this point than to all the others. In our analysis, each OMB belonging to a specific Thiessen polygon is the closest to its own center point, compared with the distance to any other center point. A key to the delineation of Thiessen polygons is to determine the center point of each polygon. We propose to use bank branches (including self-service branches) as the center of the polygons. On the one hand, the distribution of bank branches is in line with the proposed principle of aggregation, namely, the branches are densely dispersed in areas with active businesses and economies. On the other hand, the bank branches almost cover all the places across the country==== and, given the importance of financial services in business activities, it is reasonable to use bank branches as the center points of the polygons for the data aggregation.====We merge the bank branches within each 500-meter grid cell into one as the center point, by taking the average of their geographic coordinates,==== and establish 138,629 polygons around these points across mainland China. ==== shows an illustration for Chaoyang district in Beijing after being partitioned into 437 polygons, with each red dot representing a bank branch and the lines the boundaries of the polygons. Chaoyang district provides a great visualization of the flexibility of the area of the Thiessen polygon. Specifically, the west of Chaoyang district is a commercial area, with the well-known Sanlitun Street and Central Business District (CBD) being here. CBD is one of the most dynamic business locations in Beijing, where many headquarters of Chinese and foreign companies chose to settle. We see a very dense distribution of the polygons on the west side of the schematic. The east of Chaoyang district largely lies outside the 3rd Ring Road in Beijing, includes many green areas and parks, and is less business-active. The polygons on the east of the schematic are sparsely scattered. The comparison clearly illustrates the advantage of the Thiessen polygons in adjusting the area for aggregating the individual samples adapting to local business activities. We later aggregate the millions of OMBs at the polygon level, and match the other economic, population, and geographic characteristics accordingly.",The informal economy at times of COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001401,23-Nov-21,2021,Research Article,205

Empirical results suggest that EPU can significantly promote sulfur dioxide (SO====) readings in cities experiencing higher ex-ante fiscal pressure, and this effect is more profound during the daytime. Given that SO==== is the main contributor to industrial pollution, and local governments have less incentive to monitor illegal pollutant discharges during the nighttime period, our findings indicate that rising EPU will harm the environment by motivating local authorities to reduce environmental supervision and thus increase industrial pollution. We also find that promoting regional innovation and strengthening external environmental regulations can mitigate the pollution effect of economic policy uncertainty.","Uncertainty refers to an inability to forecast the likelihood of events happening (====). It negatively influences household consumption ====) and reduces firm investments through delays (====), causing economic activities to slow down (====). Among the diverse sources of uncertainty, an adjustment in the economic policies of a central government is a primary cause (====). As a result, economic policy uncertainty (EPU) has become a significant area of research by economists in recent years. Following ==== seminal work, scholars have developed several indexes for country-level EPU using a newspaper-based approach. According to these indexes, some studies have determined that economic policy uncertainty is rising in most countries (S. J. ====). A growing amount of literature subsequently investigated the effect of EPU on economic activities, such as production activities (S. J. ====). Environmental pollution has been identified as an important by-product of economic activities (====), which has become a significant global concern due to its severe long-term consequences. However, to our knowledge, few current studies examine the pollution effect of economic policy uncertainty. This paper attempts to investigate the effect of EPU on industrial pollution in China. More importantly, we seek to explore the underlying mechanism of this effect and propose possible solutions to mitigate the potential pollution effects of EPU.====; ====). As a result, a rising EPU may drive environmental degradation. We call this effect the ¡°monitoring effect¡±. This paper focuses on identifying the existence and dominance of the ¡°monitoring effect¡± to explain why higher economic policy uncertainty may cause environmental degradation.====China's real-time pollution data from 1635 air quality monitoring stations are employed for empirical analyses in this work with a novel news-based EPU index constructed by S. J. ==== from January 2015 to December 2019. Given that sulfur dioxide (SO====) is the main contributor to industrial pollution (Lucas W. ====), this paper mainly examines the impact of economic policy uncertainty on SO==== readings. The interaction term of EPU and city-level ex-ante fiscal pressure is included in each regression to explore the role of fiscal pressure in driving the relationship between EPU and industrial pollution. We control the fixed effects of the station, month and year and city-specific time trends in the empirical models to absorb the heterogeneity of unobserved stations and seasonal, regional, and time variations. In addition, we introduce year-month fixed effects to eliminate the impact of macroeconomic factors on air pollution. The identification strategy of our settings is similar to the difference-in-differences (DID) approach. The obtained results suggest that ex-ante fiscal pressure faced by local governments will significantly enhance the positive effect of EPU on SO==== readings within cities. This finding provides preliminary evidence for the ¡°monitoring effect¡± predictions.====To check whether fiscal pressure induced by rising economic policy uncertainty motivates local governments to loosen environmental supervision, we further analyze the heterogeneous effect of EPU on nighttime and daytime SO==== concentrations. We refer to ==== finding that China's SO==== readings at monitoring stations significantly increased after sunset due to a lack of illegal pollutant discharge detection by local governments at that time. According to this evidence, we infer that local governments effectively monitor and regulate pollutant discharges during the day. Therefore, if local authorities have an incentive to sacrifice the environment under rising fiscal pressure, they are more likely to loosen environmental supervision during the day, resulting in higher production of air pollution during this period. Indeed, we find that the interaction term of EPU and ex-ante fiscal pressure has a more profound impact on daytime SO==== readings than nighttime, which implies that local governments may respond to rising EPU by relaxing environmental supervision. This finding offers additional evidence to the prediction of the ¡°monitoring effect¡±.====We also propose two methods to effectively reduce the pollution effect of economic policy uncertainty to address the harmful consequences of pollution on long-term development (====). Firstly, innovation can mitigate environmental pollution. ==== posit that innovation can provide new technology to reduce pollutant discharges. Moreover, innovation may reduce local governments' economic incentives to develop polluting industries. As technological innovation drives economic growth (====), more innovative cities are more likely to experience higher economic growth and should have lower fiscal dependence on polluting industries. Therefore, greater innovation may restrain the economic incentive of local authorities to develop polluting industries in response to rising EPU. Secondly, external environmental regulation policies can mitigate environmental pollution (====). China's local governments have political motives to reduce pollutant discharges if they are required to improve environmental quality by the central government (Y. J. ====; ====). Therefore, strict environmental regulation policies may increase local authorities' political incentive to curb polluting industries in response to rising EPU.====Based on these arguments, we examine whether the innovation level of a city and external environmental regulations can mitigate the pollution effect of EPU. Our results illustrate that local innovation can reduce the impact of fiscal pressure induced by economic policy uncertainty on SO==== readings. Environmental regulation policies, such as environmental law and the central government's command-and-control policy, can also produce analogous pollution abatement effects. Therefore, if the central government must implement contingent economic policies that increase EPU while simultaneously attempting to prevent environmental deterioration, it should promote regional innovation or implement strict environmental regulation to inhibit the behaviors of local governments to relax environmental supervision.====; ====), few works discuss how EPU affects air quality, which is a significantly negative manifestation of economic growth (====). To address this research gap, we identify the impact of EPU on industrial pollution. Furthermore, we propose a novel explanation of the EPU-pollution nexus from the perspective of local governments' environmental supervision behaviors. Extensive research has addressed the micro-foundations, such as the response of households (====) and firms (====; ====; ====; ====; Z. ====) to EPU changes, while limited attention has been paid to the behaviors of local governments. One exception is the work of ==== work by analyzing the environmental supervision behaviors of local governments in an environment with rising EPU.====Secondly, the results in this paper have some policy implications for China's pollution control practice. China is ranked as one of the most polluted countries in the world, and pollution has already created a significant decline in welfare (====; Y. ====; ====; ====; X. ====). Many environmental regulation policies have been issued by China's central government recently in an attempt to improve environmental quality (J. ====). To enhance the efficiency of pollution control, the causes of environmental deterioration deserve further exploration. China's economy is characterized by regional economic decentralization, and almost all policies made by the central government require local governments to implement them (C. ====). However, local authorities may deviate from their environmental protection responsibilities to maintain their own economic benefits. For example, ==== found that higher fiscal pressure motivated local governments to implement weaker environmental regulations and develop more polluting industries. This paper extends the literature by showing that economic policy uncertainty may motivate local governments to loosen environmental supervision and thus increase industrial pollution. We also identify the role of regional innovation and external environmental regulations in helping restrain local governments from developing polluting industries in an environment with rising EPU. Overall, our findings imply that minimizing economic policy uncertainty, promoting innovation, and strengthening environmental regulations are all beneficial for building an environmentally friendly society.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

For instance, due to the lifelong employment system, when facing severe business difficulties, Japanese firms can't reduce operating costs through layoffs, but rely on bank credit subsidies to maintain the status quo (====; ====). Compared with developed economies, the reasons for the formation of zombie firms not only have aforementioned common features in transition economies, but also their own features. In this paper, we mainly investigate the causal relationship between government financial stress and the formation of zombie firms in China.====More recent attention has focused on the formation of zombie firms in China. Like the factors in developed countries, to protect employment for the government and to cover up non-performing loans for banks also lead to the formation of zombie firms in China (====; ====). Moreover, ==== examines the relationship between comparative advantage and zombie firms, uncovering that firms violating comparative advantage are more likely to become zombie firms. However, the connection between local government and firms is neglected by the literature, especially for the formation of zombie firms in developing countries. As the largest transition economy in the world, it's difficult for enterprises to develop and allocate resources freely without the interference of political arrangements due to special political-economic institutions in China. A vast of research have revealed the collusion issues between local governments and firms in China, which is more prominent in county-level governments that directly supervise firms (====). Accompanied with China's marketization reform, the authority of economic management is gradually decentralized, giving the county government more discretion in approving and managing the corporate operations. Moreover, since firms are the main source of tax revenue for governments, county-level governments usually take non-market actions to protect them to stabilize and improve financial revenue within the jurisdiction. In this way, owing to the protection of local governments, firms with low profitability cannot effectively withdraw from the market and eventually become zombie firms. However, it is difficult to identify the causal relationship between the local financial situation and the formation of zombie firms as they are endogenous to the economic cycle. In this paper, we investigate the causal relationship between financial stress and the formation of zombie firms by adopting the natural experiment of China's province-managing-county (PMC) reform.====Since 2004, China gradually launched fiscal hierarchy reform, named province-managing-county fiscal reform, to straighten out the financial distribution relationship between governments below the provincial level and solve financial difficulties for county governments. While previous literature has not reached a consensus on the role of the reform in promoting county economic growth (====; ====), the impact of the reform on relaxing county government financial stress has been a common view (====; ====; ====). Therefore, we conclude that PMC reform contributes to reduce the encroachment of city-level governments on the financial revenue of county governments, increase their financial revenue, and alleviate their financial stress. In sum, PMC reform provides an excellent opportunity to explore the causal relationship between financial stress and the formation of zombie firms.====Making use of the advantage of PMC reform varied in time and space, we apply the difference-in-differences framework to analyze the impact of fiscal stress on the formation of zombie firms. We find that the probability of formation of zombie firms in reformed counties is significantly lower than that of non-reformed counties after the implementation of PMC reform. More importantly, we perform a variety of additional tests to ensure that our results are robust, such as model specifications and endogenous problems. Moreover, we show that the suppression effect of PMC reform on zombie firms is stronger in counties with low initial economic development levels, more stock of debt, high financial and employment pressure. Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the impact of PMC reform on the formation of zombie firms. The results show that PMC reform directly reduces corporate value-added tax rate. With the decline of tax burden, firms could invest in productivity-enhancing projects, which improve their productivity and profitability. Eventually, the positive changes in firm performance associated with PMC reform inhibit the formation of zombie firms.====This study makes the following contributions to the literature. First, we complement the literature about the formation of zombie firms by using financial reform to clearly identify the causality between the government's financial stress and the formation of zombie firms. A growing body of literature has uncovered the factors leading to the formation of zombie firms in developed and developing countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little evidence from the connection between the financial incentive of local government and the formation of zombie firms. Second, our study contributes to the growing body of literature that examines the effect of PMC reform through illustrating the relationship between the reform and the formation of zombie firms. Although the literature is rich on the macro effect of the reform (====; ====; ====; ====), it lacks research on the impact of the reform on firms, especially zombie firms. Third, we also contribute to the large body of political economy literature that studies the effects of local government-firm collusion. Previous research has established that the collusion of government and enterprises has caused many negative effects, including mining disasters, environmental pollution, and illegal land (====; ====; ====; ====). We provide evidence that the formation of zombie firms is also due to local government-firm collusion.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== discusses the institutional background and research design. ==== describes the sample data and key variables. ==== reports the empirical evidence and robustness check. ==== provides further analyses about the heterogeneous impact and the mechanisms.

The popularity of mobile payments may help alleviate this problem. This paper examines the impact of mobile payments on household consumption in rural China by using data from the China Household ,"; ====; ====; ====), preventive savings (====; ====; ====; ====), insufficient financial supply (====; ====; ====; ====), income inequality (====; ====), and cultural traditions and consumption habits (====; ====; ====) are essential characteristics that work to affect household consumption.====As a developing country, China suffers from high savings and low consumption (====), which has become a significant problem affecting China's economic transformation and upgrading. There is a certain consumption gap between urban and rural households in China. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the per capita consumption of urban households in China was 26.11 thousand yuan in 2018, compared with 12.12 thousand yuan in rural households, which is only 46.43% of the former. Considering the consumption potential and the crucial role that rural household consumption plays in the economy, the Chinese government has attached immense importance to rural household consumption. For example, in 2018, the State Council of China issued a document titled ¡°Several Opinions on Improving the System of Promoting Consumption to Further Stimulate the Potential of Residents¡± in order to address the importance of upgrading rural consumption and narrowing the consumption gap between urban and rural residents.====However, due to the relatively lower level of social security and the higher level of transaction costs, rural residents tend to increase savings instead of consumption in order to cope with uncertain events, such as income fluctuations, unemployment, and medical expenses. Therefore, how to increase rural household consumption has appealed to more concerns. In this paper, we try to determine whether mobile payment, an emerging payment method, can improve rural household consumption in China. The reason why we have focused on mobile payments is that, in recent decades, with the popularity of smartphones and 4G networks in rural China, mobile payments have become an indispensable payment tool for rural households.==== in the first half of 2019, the scale of mobile payment transactions in China reached 166.1 trillion yuan, and the users of mobile payments reached 0.66 billion by the end of 2018.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to empirically examine the role of mobile payments in rural household consumption. Therefore, our findings enrich the literature on consumer finance (====; ====; ====; ====) and the impact of technology finance on household economic behavior (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Second, the abundant information in the data from the CHFS has provided us with fertile ground to determine not only the effect of mobile payments on rural household consumption, but also the possible mechanisms behind it. This unique Chinese setting helps us to thoroughly understand whether we can take advantage of the modern revolution in science and technology to promote rural household consumption, and to see how it works.====Third, this paper supplements the field of inclusive finance and the welfare of socially vulnerable groups in developing countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our heterogeneity analysis verifies the inclusive function of mobile payments, which is necessary and important for us to thoroughly understand a feasible approach to promote rural consumption for other countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== briefly describes the institutional background. ==== outlines the theoretical implications of mobile payments on rural household consumption. ==== describes the data and variables used in the empirical analysis. ==== presents the main results and examines mechanisms and heterogeneity. ==== concludes the paper.",Mobile payment and Chinese rural household consumption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001371,16-Nov-21,2021,Research Article,208

In rural China, persistent gender gaps in educational achievements have been well documented, and show no signs of dissipating (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Of course, gender is not the sole dimension of the educational (and other economic) inequalities that have characterised China's development experience since the late 1970s. Beyond the rural-urban divide, other significant dimensions have included disparities across regions and provinces with different levels of development (====; ====), and across families of different sizes (====; ====) and from different socioeconomic backgrounds (====; ====).====This paper incorporates these multiple dimensions in an exploration of gender differences in the inter-generational transmission of educational attainments between parents and their children in China. The focus on inter-generational transmission stems from a substantive body of theoretical and empirical research that traces back to the pioneering works by ====, ====, ==== and ====, which conceptualise the mechanisms and transmission channels that explain the observed degree of persistence between the economic outcomes of parents and their children. A key finding of these early works is that the transmission of economic inequality from one generation to the next is primarily related to parental investments in the human capital of their children, and the inheritability of ability (which is often much harder to measure). In the context of gender differences, empirical challenges associated with measuring the latter are reduced, given that there is no reason to think that boys would inherit ability in ways that differ from girls. Thus, observed gender disparities in inter-generational transmission of educational outcomes almost certainly reflect gender disparities in parental investments.====Although inter-generational transmission of education attainments has been well documented for a wide range of countries==== ¨C there has been much less done on the heterogeneity of such transimission across different groups within each country, including across genders. One exception is ====, whose analysis of intergenerational education mobility in a number of Latin American countries shows that there is greater mobility for ¡®middle-class¡¯ individuals in older cohorts as well as for ¡®non-top¡¯ class individuals in younger cohorts. Another is ====, who demonstrate that the educational mobility of children with the least-educated parents has worsened for females in India since the 1990s. ==== show that immigrant children from the Mediterranean and Caribbean experience greater downward mobility than native Dutch children in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, ==== focus on Austria, demonstrating that gender differences in educational attainment have diminished across generations in line with rising educational mobility for both genders.====In the Chinese context, while a considerable literature has analysed intergenerational patterns of education attainment, much of it has been confined to either the rural or urban populations. A number of these works have concentrated on the impact of the Cultural Revolution (1966¨C1976) on different members of society and on subsequent generations (====; ====; ====). An overwhelming finding in this literature is that educational opportunities have tended to favour the most privileged members of society across generations, even when policies strived to achieve just the opposite: with people from higher social strata continuing to ¡®out-educate¡¯ those below them. During the reform period, as ====In a paper most closely related to our work here, ==== explore intergenerational mobility in education in China for people born between 1941 and 1990, using the 2008 Rural-Urban Migration in China and Indonesia survey. Using simple bivariate regressions of children's years of schooling on parents' years of schooling, this paper reveals significant differences in mobility (and its converse, persistence) across the rural, urban and migrant populations. In particular, they find greater inter-generational persistence at high levels of education in the urban sub-sample, combined with greater mobility ¨C but especially downward mobility ¨C in the rural one. As a final point in their empirical analysis, they note striking gender differences in inter-generational patterns of educational attainment, with daughter-parent coefficients that are consistently higher than son-parent coefficients in virtually all of the ten age cohorts analysed. Their conclusion, ¡°that compared to men, the educational achievements of women are more tightly bound to their fathers' educational level¡± is essentially our starting point here (====: p. 24).====The paper proceeds as follows.

To assess predictors of poor mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study first implements survey-based measures of health perception biases among Chinese adults during the pandemic. Then, it analyzes their relation to three mental health outcomes: life satisfaction, happiness, and depression (as measured by the CES?D). We show that the health overconfidence displayed by approximately 30% of the survey respondents is a clear risk factor for mental health problems; it is a statistically significant predictor of depression and low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. We also document that these effects are stronger in regions that experienced higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results offer clear guidelines for the implementation of effective interventions to temper health overconfidence, particularly in uncontrollable situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.","As of November 10, 2021, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was responsible for over 250 million confirmed cases and more than 5 million deaths across 196 countries and territories. On that day, China officially counted 110,331 cases and 4,849 deaths.==== Because of the virus's contagiousness and lethality, as well as the many policy measures taken by governments worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly influencing all aspects of society (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), with pervasive negative effects that are likely to continue into the future (====; ====; ====; ====). The numerous sources of this strong psychological effect include fear of the infection's potentially dire consequences, the ¡°cabin fever¡± associated with quarantine, the uncertain economic consequences of the lockdowns, and a flow of negative information on TV and social media. A growing literature has thus begun to assess both the extent of the pandemic-induced psychological distress and the sociodemographic and economic characteristics of those most affected (====; ====).====Despite such growing interest, one crucial aspect has received no scientific attention during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of biased health perceptions and health overconfidence. Economists, and in particular behavioral economists, have taken overconfidence under closer scrutiny mainly ¡°====¡± (====, p.6). In one seminal study of the relation between mental health and ¡°positive illusions¡± ¨C defined specifically as unrealistically positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control and mastery, and unrealistic optimism ? ==== demonstrate that the most realistic respondents (i.e., those with the lowest positive illusion scores) have lower self-esteem and mild or severe depression, implying that positive illusions may improve mental health. ==== similarly shows that extremely confident people tend to be happier than moderately confident individuals, while ==== relate ""intelligence overconfidence"" to better mental health, and ""sports overconfidence"" to higher self-esteem, life satisfaction and less loneliness. Nevertheless, several authors question the generality of this beneficial association between overconfidence and mental health (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), with ==== documenting less outcome enjoyment among recreational basketball players who display overconfidence.====To test this generality, this study is the first to examine the association between biased health perceptions and mental health in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset we use is the ==== which was administered in early March 2020. It is particularly well suited for our research because, although the National Health Commission (NHC) issued guidelines in January 2020 for emergency psychological crisis interventions for those affected by COVID-19, the population's mental health needs were poorly met (====; ====). Moreover, by early March, China had been experiencing the pandemic for around 3?months and had various response tactics implemented for weeks, including quarantine, social distancing, city lockdowns, and community containment, thereby potentially accentuating mental health problems (====). Although China has subsequently managed to control COVID-19¡ªopening up businesses, factory operations, and schools in an effort to revive the economy¡ªwe still witness strong COVID-19 activity and deaths across Europe, the USA, India, South America, and many other countries. Our findings may thus provide important insights for nations fighting the mental health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold: first, we draw on the growing psychological and economic literature to construct an individual measure of health perception biases, and we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates how these biases can affect mental health and life satisfaction. In contrast to the voluminous psychological research on the evidence of overconfidence, the evidence on the association between mental health and overconfidence is thin. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides a first attempt at uncovering the linkage between relative health perception biases and mental health amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, we conduct both parametric and nonparametric assessments of the empirical association between biased health perceptions and mental health. Given the scant and inconsistent evidence of this link in the otherwise rich psychological and economic research on overconfidence, to our knowledge, it is the first attempt to model and empirically test this relation. Lastly, by addressing positive (happiness and life satisfaction, ====; ====), as well as negative (depression, ====) aspects of mental health, we are able to produce a nuanced picture of the connection between health perception biases and mental health.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: ==== outlines our proposed theoretical framework of how health perception biases affect individuals' mental health. ==== describes the data and methods, and ==== reports the results. ==== concludes the paper by reviewing the main findings and outlining their primary implications for policy.","¡°The better you feel, the harder you fall¡±: Health perception biases and mental health among Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001267,6-Nov-21,2021,Research Article,210

The reduction is stronger for females, and there is some substitute effect between husbands and wives. The reduction is also stronger for individuals who are elder and less educated, and who choose lump sums of monetary compensation. Finally, we find no evidence that urban SLR experience stimulates business creation.","The experience of displacement occurs worldwide as a result of gentrification and urban renewal (====). In China, the urbanization process includes inner-city redevelopment and expansion of urban fringe areas (====). The expansion of urban fringe areas is realized by state-led land requisition from farmers (====), and inner-city redevelopment is realized by state-led house demolition in the urban area (==== In July 2014, the central government announced the Shanty Area Redevelopment Project (SARP), which started another wave of urban relocation in hundreds of cities. During the period 2015¨C2018, about 24.42 million new houses were built for relocated households.====This paper studies the impact of urban state-led relocation (SLR) programs on labor market participation. While urban SLR programs generate substantial positive externalities by facilitating inner-city redevelopment, we know little about the impacts on the relocated individuals. At micro-level, individuals' labor market participation affects not only themselves, but also their family members. It has been well documented that the employment status of parents affects their children's school performance and long-run outcomes (====; ====). At aggregated-level, individuals' labor market participation has a direct effect on the equilibrium in the local labor market. Given the large scale of urban SLR programs, the effect is likely to be sizable.====We use the three waves of China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2013, 2015, and 2017 to conduct this research. The survey has a separate session about households' experience of urban SLR. The longitudinal nature of the datasets enables us to control for individual fixed effects. In the 2017 (2015, respectively) wave, about 72% (65%, respectively) of the urban households covered in the 2015 (2013, respectively) wave were successfully traced. More importantly, when a sample household moves to another place or even another city, CHFS would trace it by telephone interview. This feature is critical for our research. For example, in the urban area, about 20% of the renters who were successfully traced from 2013 to 2015 had moved between the two waves.====As revealed by the survey, urban SLR is associated with high compensation values. The compensation can be house compensation, monetary compensation, or a combination of the two. For example, the median compensation value between 2015 and 2017 was 300,000 yuan per household, which was nearly 10 times the per-capita disposable income of urban households in 2015. The 90th percentile was as high as 1,500,000 yuan, which equaled 229,179 U.S. dollars.====). Then it is natural to expect that urban SLR also has a significant effect on adults' human capital development, which largely depends on their participation in the labor market.====This research is conducted through several steps. First, we use the difference-in-difference (DID) approach to examine the effects of urban SLR on the labor market participation of the working-age population (i.e., people between 15 and 64?years old). We consider both the extensive margin and the intensive margin. Second, we test whether the effects differ between males and females, and whether there is a substitute effect between husbands and wives. Third, we investigate the heterogeneity beyond gender difference. For example, we test whether the effects vary with individual characteristics such as age and education level. We also examine whether the effects vary with households' choice of compensation type, which may be house and/or money. Fourth, we examine whether urban SLR experience stimulates business creation. Self-employment features flexible working hours, and is potentially related to entrepreneurship in a country. Finally, we present interesting results based on city-level Baidu Search Index. It is a Chinese counterpart of Google Trend (====). We test whether the index of the keyword ¡°urban SLR¡± (i.e. ¡°chai qian¡± in Chinese) positively predicts the index of ¡°quitting a job without a new offer¡± (i.e. ¡°luo ci¡± in Chinese). The latter is a signal of reduced labor market participation.====Our findings are as followed. First, urban SLR programs reduce individuals' labor market participation, on both the extensive margin and the intensive margin. More specifically, urban SLR reduces the labor market participation rate of urban residents by 6 to 7 percentage points (depending on regression specification), and the reduction is larger for females. Such a magnitude is economically significant; according to CHFS, the average participation rate of the working-age population is about 66 percentage points. On the intensive margin, urban SLR reduces the working intensity of employed females, but increases the working intensity of employed males. Among employed couples, the reduction in wives' working hours is offset by the increase in husbands' hours. This indicates a within-household substitute effect. Second, we find some heterogeneity in the SLR effects that is beyond gender difference. On the extensive margin, the negative effect of urban SLR is stronger for people who are older, less educated, holding rural hukou (though living in the urban area), and married. On the intensive margin, the negative effect is stronger for people with a higher family dependency ratio. The SLR effects also vary with households' choice of compensation package. In particular, the reduction in labor market participation is stronger for people who chose pure monetary compensation, which can be received much sooner than house compensation. Third, we find no evidence that urban SLR experience stimulates business creation. Finally, evidence from Baidu Search Index confirms our finding about the negative effect of urban SLR on labor market participation.====This paper contributes to the literature by documenting the effects of urban SLR programs on individuals' labor market participation. Although such programs are widespread in China, there are few studies on their economic outcomes, especially labor market outcomes. ==== study the effect of rural SLR programs (i.e., land requisition) on farmers' migration behavior and off-farm labor participation. However, urban SLR programs is quite different from rural ones. First, while under-compensating farmers is the norm in the processes of rural SLR programs (====), urban SLR programs are associated with high compensation value. So they have different effects on household wealth. Second, farmers have to find new jobs after land requisition, while urban residents do not necessarily have to. The human capital and skills of urban residents are also different from those of farmers, which translate into different job opportunities after relocation. Third, rural SLR programs sometimes provide land-losing farmers with state-sector jobs or job training service, while urban SLR programs simply compensate urban residents by houses and money.==== For the above reasons, it is reasonable to expect that the labor market outcomes of urban SLR programs are different from those of rural ones.====The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. ==== reviews the literature. ==== introduces the background knowledge of urban SLR programs in China, and then describes our data. ==== displays our major empirical results. ==== conducts robustness checks. ==== concludes.",The effects of state-led relocation on labor market participation: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001243,27-Oct-21,2021,Research Article,211

As a result, demographic dividend is gradually disappearing in developing countries, presenting huge challenges to their success in labor-intensive exports. Will population aging in developing countries, which undermines their traditional export advantages, adversely affect their export upgrading? The answer to this question is crucial for the fate of developing countries: will they fall into the dilemma of ¡°getting old before getting rich¡±? Surprisingly, the relationship between population aging and export upgrading in developing countries has not attracted much attention in the literature.====; ====), are less vulnerable to population aging. For example, ==== demonstrate that there is no strong negative relationship between population aging and economic growth in developed countries possibly because of the more rapid adoption of automation technologies. Therefore, it is more appealing to focus on developing countries to explore the relationship between population aging and export upgrading. However, there is little discussion on this issue in the context of developing countries in the literature. This paper fills the gap and studies the question from the perspective of developing countries.====Based on the data of 116 developing countries from 1996 to 2018, this paper empirically explores the impact of population aging on export upgrading in developing countries. In this paper, export upgrading of a country is measured by quality-adjusted technology complexity of exports, a weighted average of quality-adjusted technology complexity across exported products (====; ====). The measure is ideal as it captures two country-specific sources of upgrading: quality upgrading within products and resource reallocation across products. Due to small within-country variations of population aging, our identification relies on the cross-country variations as in the literature (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, we include the share of religious population in the total population as an additional instrument because it also affects fertility rate (e.g. ====; ====).====Using instruments of population aging, this paper shows that population aging significantly and adversely affects export upgrading in developing countries. More specifically, we find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the aging variable reduces technology complexity of exports by 36.4%. The result is robust to a series of checks, including alternative measures of population aging, alternative measures of export upgrading and exclusion of re-exports. Moreover, we show that the negative impact of population aging is mainly channeled through innovation and human capital. Furthermore, we show that the negative impact of population aging on export upgrading is not present in developed countries and is decreasing in recent years of developing countries. This is possibly due to the inferior institutions and slow adoption of automation in developing countries. Finally, we extend the analysis to a disaggregated level, i.e. country-product level. We show that an aging country indeed exports less of the products with higher quality. The results are consistent with the main analysis at the country level.====Existing studies mainly focus on the impact of population aging on the evolution of a country's comparative advantage (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The studies such as ==== and ==== show that population aging will endogenously lead to the strengthening of capital comparative advantages after introducing the age composition of population into the Heckscher-Ohiln framework. On the contrary, ==== shows that a country with an expansion in life expectancy does not necessarily become a net exporter of capital-intensive products when fertility is endogenous in an open overlapping-generation model. Thus, whether population aging and the evolution of capital comparative advantages are negatively or positively associated is inconclusive. In addition, ==== show that population aging of a country strengthens its comparative advantage in the industries in which age-appreciating skills are more intensively used. Along this logic, ==== confirm that the aging countries are losing comparative advantage in the industries with high dependence on skill adaptability of workers. In general, there is little literature investigating the association between population aging and export upgrading at the country level.====; ====; ====). Another strand of literature emphasizes that some inferior characteristics of developing countries such as less capital resources (e.g. ====), less advanced technology (e.g. ====), and incomplete institutions (e.g. ====), leading to their less flexible adaptability of their industries (e.g. ====). This indicates that the impact of population aging on export upgrading is more pronounced in developing countries. By focusing on developing countries, this paper directly explores the impact of population aging on export upgrading and its underlying mechanisms.====Furthermore, a few studies show that domestic institutions play an important role in shaping a country's comparative advantage (e.g. ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== point out that countries with better institutions have comparative advantages in technology-intensive industries since institutions will endogenously determine the technology adoption of enterprises. ==== find that domestic institutions are a source of comparative advantages of a country even after controlling for the traditional factor endowments. Unlike traditional sources of comparative advantage, they also find that institutional sources of comparative advantage operate through different channels. However, less is known about the roles of institutions in the impact of population aging on export upgrading.

This paper examines the relationship between children's marriage and parents' subjective well-being. Using China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data, we find that parental subjective well-being is positively associated with children's marriage. An examination of the underlying mechanisms shows that, first, children's marriage can significantly enhance parents' sense of security in old-age care and their confidence in the future. Second, the older the unmarried children are, the more anxious the parents who hold stronger traditional ideology will be. Third, parents will increase their consumption expenditure after their children get married; and compared with daughters, sons' marriages have a stronger effect on parental well-being. These findings reveal that parental economic pressure due to China's biased sex ratio and marriage squeeze is relieved after their children's marriage.","To measure individual well-being and social welfare, self-reported subjective well-being has received extensive academic attention. Since ====, ====, ====, ====, ====).====Recent studies have extended the discussion to explore the effect of life events on subjective well-being. For example, it is well known that events such as unemployment, marriage, divorce, widowhood, layoffs, disability, winning a lottery, and the birth of a child influence subjective well-being (====; ====; ====). In fact, parenthood is often considered an important stage in a meaningful and fulfilling life, and the marriage of one's children is, in nature, a critical life event for parents. The aim of this paper is to document this new type of life event on subjective well-being using data from China.====Since ==== first introduced fertility into standard economic analysis, a growing body of studies has explored the effects of static factors, such as the number of children and the gender of a child, on the subjective well-being of parents (====; ====; ====; ====). However, from the perspective of lifecycle models, the utility that parents receive from children changes dynamically in the process of children's growth. In the previous literature, ====Children's marriages can affect parental well-being for a variety of reasons in China. First, parents count on their children's families for old-age care and many other issues(====, ====, ====, ====). Second, in many developing countries, traditional culture believes that children should get married when they reach marriageable age. This cultural concept has gradually evolved into an informal institution recognized by the public (====; ====). The marriage of children often makes parents feel that they have followed these social norms. Third, children, particularly sons, do not easily get married in developing countries due to marriage squeeze and biased sex ratio (====; ====, ====). Therefore, the parents may spend a lot to improve the competence of their children, and the marriage of children relieves the economic pressure on them.====We believe that existing studies have generally not provided compelling evidence on how parental subjective well-being is associated with children's marriage. Therefore, this paper will fill the research gap in the context of Chinese large-scale long-run panel data. A vexed question in discussing parents' subjective well-being and children's marriage concerns the endogeneity caused by unobserved omitted variables, such as parent's characteristics. We adopt the method of event study and control for parents' individual fixed effects to deal with the potential problem. While it cannot make a definitive claim of causality, our paper tries to determine how parental subjective well-being changes around the event of children getting married.====This paper provides direct empirical evidence that parental subjective well-being is positively associated with children's marriage. We also find that children's marriage can significantly enhance parents' sense of security in old-age care and their confidence in the future. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that when children's marital status finally switches from single to married at an older age, subjective well-being of parents who hold stronger traditional ideology will increase from very low to a high level. Finally, we also find that parents' consumption expenditure will increase after their children get married, and sons' marriages have a stronger effect compared with daughters.====The remainder of this paper is arranged in four sections.

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have attempted to stimulate entrepreneurial activities in rural areas by relieving rural entrepreneurs' human and financial capital constraints (====). On the one hand, entrepreneurial activities give rural inhabitants more working autonomy and flexibility, which improves the synergy between entrepreneurial and agricultural activities (====; ====). On the other hand, entrepreneurship creates job opportunities and better uses rural surplus labor (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Scholars have attempted to solve this ambiguity by categorizing different business types, such as transformational and subsistence business (====), and commercial- and social-oriented business (====). Despite this, the job-creating effect of entrepreneurship is still underexplored. For example, little attention has been paid to entrepreneurs' characteristics or the impact of contextual factors on how the motivation to hire employees is formed (====).====The concept of self-identity of entrepreneurs, concerning questions such as ¡°who am I?¡± and ¡°what should I do?¡± (====; ====; ====), emerges from the normative expectations of the ¡°audience¡± in the environment they are embedded in (====; ====). It has been introduced to explain entrepreneurial motivation and behavior patterns because of its substantial impact on individual economic behavior (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Most entrepreneurs wear different ¡°hats¡± and adopt a hybrid identity rather than just a singular role (====; ====), such as academic entrepreneurs (====), religious entrepreneurs (====), and single-mother entrepreneurs (====). However, considering the diverse decision logics and concerns related to different identities, how these identities interact and how entrepreneurs manage the multi-identity are still underexplored (====, ====). ==== categorized the interactions of entrepreneurs' multiple identities into two forms: ==== and ====. When facing incongruence in managing multi-identity, the preferred role of entrepreneurs would be to maintain and ensure by isolating or suppressing the inferior one. For example, academic entrepreneurs use delegating and buffering strategies to avoid any undesirable impact on their academic persona(====) ; corporate founders with hybrid identity tend to suppress the undesirable identity which otherwise would contaminate the legitimacy of the preferred identity (====; ====). However, recent studies have disclosed that entrepreneurs may broaden identity sets and retain hybrid identity, including undesirable identities that may cause incongruence (====). These studies suggested that it may be insufficient to view identity interaction as limited to either setting apart identities or preserving a single one. Instead of simply choosing one or the other, people's way to manage hybrid identity could be more diversified. Thus, we aim to explore how entrepreneurs manage the interaction of incongruent identities and further influence their entrepreneurial decisions and activities.====Focusing on the entrepreneurship of rural political elites in China, we examined the impact of the hybrid identity of village-cadre-entrepreneurs on hiring labor decisions, namely, excessive employment. Under the self-governance system in Chinese villages, village cadres are elected by village inhabitants instead of being delegated by the state; moreover, they are free to start businesses and remain self-employed during their tenure of service (====). When village cadres start their own business, the hybrid identity ====). Moreover, as village cadres receive state subsidies and help implement state mandates, business activities distract village cadres from devoting time and ambition to serve the development of villages and the welfare of villagers. This reduces the legitimacy of cadres' business activities and stimulates distrust and concerns related to village cadres, resulting in decreased support and authority loss of village cadres in rural communities. Residents will experience feelings of injustice and relative deprivation, especially if the welfare generated from entrepreneurial activities (e.g., work opportunities and salary) is distributed improperly by village cadres (====). Therefore, village-cadre-entrepreneurs need to resolve the problem by mitigating the conflict between entrepreneur identity and cadre identity, eliminating the negative impact of the ¡°businessman¡± image on the authority and legitimacy of the ¡°village patron¡± image.====We propose that, to preserve and strengthen the cadre identity and maintain the governance authority, village-cadre-entrepreneurs are motivated to provide more work opportunities. Rather than focusing on the economic logic of entrepreneurship, we reveal the prominence of non-financial incentives of entrepreneurial activities in rural job creation, that is, achieving synergy between different identities and improving rural governance capability. Providing more work opportunities helps cadre-entrepreneurs mitigate the profit-driving ¡°businessman¡± image and diminish villagers' feelings of injustice and relative deprivation as well as build stronger and broader social connections with villagers. Considering the embedded feature of identity, we further address how contextual factors, such as village isolation, lineage group, and regional collective mobilization, shape the relationship between the hybrid identity of village-cadre-entrepreneurs and job creation. We used a nationwide representative sample comprising 4346 rural entrepreneurs and their enterprises and adopted OLS and ==== approaches to test our hypotheses. Results not only elucidate the job-creating effect of village-cadre-entrepreneurs, but also indicate that the job-creating effect will be stronger in less developed and turbulent rural areas such as villages which i) are more isolated from the external environment, ii) have more lineage groups, or iii) are in areas with more collective mobilization.====). We explain the positive role of entrepreneurship in rural job creation through the micro and non-economic mechanism.

Economic booming, as a result of China's reform and open policy since 1978, affects individual risk preferences and decision behavior for those who grew up during the reform process. We find that Reform-and-Opening CEOs, who experience the reform and open-up era early in life, implement more aggressive capital structure policies and maintain higher leverage compared to Planned Economy CEOs. Furthermore, we determine that Reform-and-Opening CEOs tend to conduct debt issuance more frequently to cover financing needs as they can better deal with the liquidity risk of debt financing and confront the pressures arising from frequent monitoring by the debt markets. Using the stagewise regression, we find a cumulative effect of early growth experience. We also use the common trend test and placebo tests to deal with the concern that Reform-and-Opening CEOs pursue significantly more aggressive financial policies relevant to the systematic differences. Additional tests rule out the possibility that our results are driven by ==== competition, state ownership, and educational ideology.","; ====; ====). As an alternative viewpoint from the conventional arguments, recent literature examines how personal early life experiences affect managerial characteristics and financial decisions (====; ====, ====; ====; ====). Specifically, for the generation of the ¡°Depression Baby,¡± it has often been suggested that experiencing a large economic shock, like the Great Depression, has a long lasting effect on their risk attitudes and financial preferences (====; ====; ====). According to ====, firms run by CEOs who experienced financial difficulties save more cash and have significantly lower net debt ratios. ====, ==== further show recession CEOs manage smaller firms, receive lower compensation, and display more conservative styles.==== To address this question, this paper investigates the impact of managers with economic prosperity experiences on corporate financing decisions. We identify a unique and crucial event in China that is likely to be a formative experience in CEOs' early lives: whether they grow up in the reform and open-up era. This experience could cause managers' risk tolerance to select more aggressive financing choices. The existing literature argues that seismic events early in life affect human beings most (====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, personal experiences exert a greater influence on personal decisions than statistically summarized information in books or via education (====; ====; ====; ====).====We examine the effects of early growth experiences on the financial decisions of Chinese CEOs in the context of economic prosperity. Early growth experiences of Chinese CEOs provide a unique and interesting setting to study the above research questions for two important reasons. China's economic reform and open policy since 1978, in which the economic system has transitioned from a central planning economy to a market economy, has been recognized as a marvelous economic development (====; ====; ====; ====). Policy uncertainty and changeable regulations in economic reform (====; ====; ====; ====; ====) lead Reform-and-Opening CEOs, who grew up during the reform and open-up era, to believe that taking on risk helps firms to exploit new opportunities and to have an instinctive self-identity regarding financial aggressiveness. Alternatively, Planned Economy CEOs, who grew up in the central planning era, experienced economic recession. Thus, Planned Economy CEOs tend to prefer self-sufficiency and are less likely to take on risk in their corporate financing decisions. ==== provide evidence that past economic shocks have a long lasting effect on individual risk aversion and deter risky financing decisions. Accordingly, we hypothesize Reform-and-Opening CEOs, who grew up in the reform and open era (a prosperous period), prefer to implement more aggressive financing policies and maintain higher leverage than Planned Economy CEOs, who grew up in the central planning era (a depression period).====In addition, for over the past four decades, China has experienced extraordinary economic prosperity and provided abundant opportunities for the new generation who grew up in such an era. Reform-and-Opening CEOs, who were young adults in the early reform and open era (i.e., a boom period), are profoundly affected by the accelerated transition of China's economic system and its cultural context. ====). Thus, Planned Economy CEOs tend to prefer equity financing to reduce the potential costs of liquidity as the debt becomes due. We hypothesis that Reform-and-Opening CEOs issue debt more frequently than Planned Economy CEOs to cover financing needs and investment opportunities.====In order to identify the role of managers' early growth experiences, we adopt the difference-in difference (DID, hereafter) approach to compare their financing choices before and after transitions from a Planned Economy CEO to a Reform-and-Opening CEO with a control sample of Planned Economy CEOs to Planned Economy CEO transition firms. We find that firms with Reform-and-Opening CEOs express a greater willingness to maintain higher leverage and to fill financing deficits with new debt more frequently. Under their management, leverage ratios are significantly higher compared with their predecessors or successors. Using the stagewise regression, we find a cumulative effect of early growth experience. In particular, we confirm that continuous effects from adolescence to early adulthood have a greater impact on CEOs.====Then, we use several approaches to alleviate the concerns about endogeneity. Apart from using the common trend test and placebo tests to address the potential problems arising from the existence of systematic differences between the treated firms and the reference firms, we conduct a number of subsample regressions to distinguish the early growth experiences interpretation from other explanations consistent with these key results. In order to rule out the possibility that our results are driven by ==== competition, ownership identity, or educational ideology, we examine the effect of CEO's early growth experiences on financing decisions by categorizing the whole samples based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, state ownership, and the economic development level. In summary, our evidence is consistent with the notion that managers' experiences determine the level of debt financing.====Our study contributes to the literature in three ways. Our paper complements the financial economics literature by directly linking personal experiences of economic prosperity to corporate financing decisions. Traditional theories seek to provide the determinants of corporate financing decision based on firm-, industry-, and market-level explanations (====; ====; ====). Our findings emphasize executives who grow up in booming economies pursue significantly more aggressive financial policies than CEOs who grow up in recessions.====In addition, our paper relates to the previous literature emphasizing the influence of economic transition and market reform (====; ====; ====; ====). We make an important contribution to this line of research by exploring how economic transitions and market reform shape Chinese managers' characteristics. This provides a better understanding of the differences in CEOs' financing preferences in emerging market countries with economic reform.====Moreover, we extend the literature on CEOs' early growth experiences by constructing a new method that empirically captures the critical timing of preference formation. Traditional literature in child psychology indicates that most beliefs regarding how society and the economy work are formed in childhood (====; ====), while the literature in social psychology believes that economic and political beliefs are formed primarily during early adulthood (====). Thus, we combine the two types of literature to infer CEOs' likely period of preference formation and find a cumulative effect of early growth experiences. Our approach complements previous methods for concerning CEO experiences.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== develops the testing hypotheses, while ==== introduces the empirical design of our study. ==== provides an analysis of the empirical results. ====, ==== discuss additional robustness tests and alternative extensions of the research issue, respectively.

In the trust game, Singaporean Chinese (SGC) senders were asked to listen to audio clips in which responders with either an SGC or a Mainland Chinese (MLC) accent read a two-sentence script before the senders decided how much money to send. We also used the strategy method to elicit the senders' beliefs about the trustworthiness of responders with an MLC accent versus those with an SGC accent. Contrary to our expectations and the common perception in Singapore, we found that Singaporean senders tended to place more trust in responders with an MLC accent than in responders with an SGC accent. We explain this difference on the basis of the Singaporean senders' beliefs about trustworthiness: they believed that people with an MLC accent would return more money to senders than would the in-group Singaporean counterparts. To bolster our findings, we confirmed in a separate experiment that the difference in response to the accents was not due to the speech rate or vocal pitch.","Discrimination has been studied extensively in the social sciences. Economics is no exception because discrimination creates market inefficiency (====). Early theoretical works in economics categorized discrimination as either taste-based or statistical (====, ====; ====; ====) since the categories have different policy implications.

In this paper, we study discrimination against MLC in Singapore, where people's accents can easily convey their specific group identity.====We employed the commonly used trust game from ==== to quantify the difference in trust among Singaporean Chinese (SGC) subjects (the senders) toward their fellow SGC versus their MLC counterparts (the responders). To mask the purpose of the study, we did not directly inform senders about the group identity of responders. Instead, we asked senders to listen to an audio clip in which a responder read a standard two-sentence script. Each responder's group could be easily determined from his/her accent. We also used the strategy method to elicit the senders' beliefs about the trustworthiness of responders with an MLC accent versus those with an SGC accent.====Contrary to our expectations and the common perception in Singapore, we did not find negative discrimination against MLC. Instead, we found that the SGC senders sent more money to MLC responders than they did to SGC responders in the trust game. The results from the belief-elicitation task showed that the unexpected finding occurred because the SGC senders perceived the MLC responders to be more trustworthy and generous than the SGC responders. We also conducted additional treatment conditions to refute the possibilities that the observed ==== was driven by the difference in SGC and MLC distinct vocal characteristics, including speech rate and vocal pitch.====Our study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, we uncovered evidence that accent operates as a natural marker that is effectively used to identify participants' nationality among ethnically homogenous groups. Unlike previous studies on discrimination that have used obvious markers (e.g., last name or in-person meetings) where the ethnicity of the opponents can be visually identified, we used a less foolproof marker, a vocal clue, to reduce the experimenter demand effect (====).==== This demand effect is especially pronounced in discrimination studies because discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, national origin, gender, and religion is considered socially unacceptable, often illegal, behavior. Another advantage of using accent to convey group identity information is that the anonymity condition can be more tightly maintained than when using names and looks.====Second, the unique environment in Singapore provides a great opportunity to test the statistical theory of discrimination. In statistical discrimination models (====; ====), decision-makers are utility or profit maximizers; differential treatment across groups is a rational response based on decision-makers' belief about each group's relevant characteristics. Given the aforementioned discrimination toward MLC in Singapore, our SGC subjects were unlikely to exhibit taste-based favoritism toward MLC in our laboratory setting (assuming that subjects brought their real-world attitudes to the lab). In this sense, our results align with the theories of statistical discrimination: in an environment where taste-based out-group favoritism could be ruled out, SGC senders, who held a (qualitatively) correct belief about out-group MLC responders' trustworthiness, acted rationally and displayed favoritism toward out-group members (discrimination against in-group members).====Finally, our study also relates to the broader literature investigating how vocal characteristics impact people's perception and decisions.==== Accents often affect people's perceptions of others and, subsequently, the decisions people make in the workplace (====; ====) and criminal cases (====; ====). Accents can even influence people's decisions about the credibility of speakers (====). Beyond accents, vocal pitch and speech rate can change how people perceive the trustworthiness of a speaker: ==== and ==== found that males with lower-pitched voices are perceived as dominant, attractive, and more trustworthy than males with higher-pitched voices. ==== showed that the vocal pitch and speech rate of lawyers presenting in front of U.S. Supreme Court justices affect the outcome of cases. Relatedly, ==== showed that a higher-pitched voice increased risk aversion, while a lower-pitched voice raised risk tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first economics research to highlight the role of accent in conveying group identity information and examine how vocal pitch and speech rate affect trust behavior in a controlled laboratory environment. Our results indicate that, while the accent is an obvious marker for group identification, the vocal pitches and speech rates associated with the accent do not explain the trust differences in the laboratory setting.","Accents, group identity, and trust behaviors: Evidence from Singapore",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001206,23-Sep-21,2021,Research Article,222

This paper examines the long-term effect of a disastrous earthquake on children's educational attainment using China's 2015 Population Census. Our cohort difference-in-differences results show that exposure to an earthquake has an unexpected significant positive impact on girls¡¯ educational attainment in poor counties, but not on boys. We suggest that this surprising educational gain may be attributable to the reconstruction of schools and the reduction in school fees after disaster. In the long run, girls in poor affected counties are more likely to delay marriage, postpone childbearing and become self-employed compared with girls in poor unaffected counties. These findings potentially exhibit the unintended benefits in education from post-disaster interventions in poor areas.","Poor households are disproportionally affected by natural disasters because of their limited ability to cope with risks and to recover from the devastation (====). A growing body of research has shown that disasters can affect short-term economic activities of poor people (====, ====, ====), but less is known about the impact of disasters on their long-term human capital accumulation. This paper answers this question by analyzing the educational impact of China's destructive 2008 Wenchuan earthquake on affected children. This could enable us to shed new light on how the extra resources allocated by the government after a disaster can potentially benefit education for the vulnerable group, and to generalize the setting to other developing countries as well as inform appropriate policy responses.====). Thus, gaining insights into the factors that influence female education can be of general interest because they could potentially help to promote educational equalization in poor areas.====Previous attempts to investigate this topic have been hindered by the lack of data on tracking individuals before and after the earthquake.====We begin our analysis with the cohort DID strategy. Our first difference is that whether a county was affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Our second difference is that within the same county, whether the cohort experienced earthquake at their junior or high school age (hereafter ¡°secondary school age¡±). Our findings show that despite no significant impact was found on boys, girls in poor affected areas at secondary school age experienced an increase of 0.387 years of schooling. Compared to previous studies that investigated the effects of various factors on schooling, the magnitude of our result is larger than maternal income (====) and can be comparable to household educational expenditure (====, ====), institutional reform (====) and school infrastructure construction (====, ====).==== Our results indicate that in areas with unbalanced resource distribution across genders, even policies that are gender-blind can have unintended gender-differentiated impacts on education, benefiting disadvantaged girls and achieving gender equality beyond the public expectations.====At the same time, we find that this group of more educated girls was more likely to get married later, have late childbirth and be self-employed. This is not surprising, as they have been endowed with greater bargaining power in the marriage and labor market (====It is worth noting that the Wenchuan earthquake is unique in its unprecedented post-disaster government support, especially in education. These educational government interventions only aimed at speeding up the reconstruction process and thus were not specifically designed for boys or girls. As such, unlike the aforementioned gender-biased household strategy, this gender-neutral policy is what appears to help change the unequal resource distribution before. Given this, we suggest two possible mechanisms by which the girls could obtain an educational gain after the earthquake: reconstruction of schools and reduction in school fees. First, we find that building more schools can improve girls¡¯ access to school because it shortens the home-to-school distance, and thus, may reduce the demands of physical exertion and lessen security concerns for girls. Second, reducing school fees may also offer girls more schooling opportunities. This is because educational resources could be saved from boys and instead allocated to girls in poor families with strong son preference. We do not disregard possible mechanisms other than the two we propose here, but at the very least, the ways we discover could provide a reference point for future post-disaster interventions in other countries.====Our study contributes to two strands of literature. First, we focus on the long-term educational outcome that, despite its importance in life, has been largely overlooked in literature on natural disasters. One of the few studies that highlighted this topic was made by ====, who argued that the 1970 Ancash earthquake in Peru caused a decline of 0.5 years in the affected children's education. The same is true when examining other negative shocks, such as China's 1976 Tangshan earthquake and Mongolia's extreme weather (====, ====). However, running counter to their conclusion, we find an unexpected positive effect on education after the Wenchuan earthquake, which was largely due to the overwhelming post-disaster measures in China, as we will elaborate in Section ====. This particularly indicates the importance of government support after a disaster, especially in developing countries.====Second, given our focus on female education, this paper also adds to the literature on the educational gender gap. It is a salient common finding that girls¡¯ schooling is associated with social factors, such as maternal education (====, ====) and sibling competition (====), and some macro factors, including the construction of school infrastructure (====, ====, ====, ====) and the implementation of the one-child policy (====). However, the literature has been thin in studying how female education would be affected after a natural disaster. Therefore, our paper provides an additional source that may influence girls¡¯ education and the gender gap in educational attainment.====The article proceeds as follows.

Due to the distinctions of these trends in China, our identification is free of the overestimation issue that the existing studies suffer. Our results are similar to those in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Japan. Holding the age cohort and survey year constant, a one unit increase in log relative size of college workers is associated with about 10 percentage points decrease in college/non-college premium and about 18 percentage points decrease in college/high school premium. We further find that the negative effect is much more substantial among the new entrants (age 25¨C29) than experienced workers (age 30¨C54). By this pattern, we demonstrate that the new labor market entrants are more sensitive to their own cohort size and argue that the confounding ability composition effect should not be a serious issue.",", ====, and ==== have explained the rise as the consequence of an accelerated rise in the relative demand for college graduates and an abrupt slowdown in the growth of the relative supply of college graduates.==== These studies focus on the aggregate trend of the college wage premium that may conceal independent trends by age groups. ==== argue that heterogeneous trends of college premium by age groups may arise if workers in different age groups within the same education group are imperfectly substitutable and the trends of the relative supply of college workers are heterogeneous by age groups. Using data from the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, they demonstrate the imperfect substitution between age groups and attribute the observed relative rise in the college premium for younger workers since the early or mid 1980s to the stagnated growth of the relative supply of college-educated workers among the young during the same periods.==== ==== find that the college premium for younger workers stagnated along with the fast-growing higher education participation rate, focusing on the more recent period from 1994 to 2006 with the U.K. data. However, little evidence from other countries has been added until recently. ==== reveal the heterogeneous trends of the college premium by age groups between 1986 and 2008 in Japan. Our paper adds evidence to this literature by documenting the divergent trends of college premium by age groups between 1995 and 2013 in China, and examines how the college premium is affected by the age group specific relative size of college-educated workers.====Further, the identification for the four countries relies on the relative rise in college premium for younger workers since the early or mid 1980s and the associated relative slowdown in the relative supply of college workers among the young. This timing overlapped with the emergence of skill-biased technological change (SBTC) since the early 1980s with the onset of the computer revolution. And it is suggested that this computer-driven technological change may increase the relative demand for college workers and further increase the college premium among the young in particular (====, ====, ====).==== Therefore, the negative effect of age group specific relative size on age group specific college premium may have been confounded by SBTC and overestimated for the four countries. The distinct trends of college premiums and relative size of college workers during our study period of 1995 to 2013 in China allow for a probably underestimated magnitude of the negative cohort size effects. Finally, China is also worth examining due to its large population and workforce.====The underlying cause of the heterogeneous trends of relative supply by age groups is the non-monotonic increase in the college attendance rate determined by college capacity and birth cohort size. The expansion of college attendance ended in 1965 in the U.S. and 1975 in Japan.==== Therefore, ==== and ==== mainly study the post-expansion period for the U.S. and Japan.==== In China, the growth in college attendance began in 1977 and did not slow down until 2008. This paper studies the period 1995¨C2013 which covers the expansion. Thus, this paper reveals the consequence of an ongoing college attendance expansion, supplementing previous studies on the consequence of past college attendance expansion.====In this paper, we follow the empirical strategy by ==== to construct the college premium and relative supply by age and survey year and further regress the age-year cell-specific college premium against the relative supply. The supply effect on the college premium is estimated to be about -0.1 by our main specification. That implies, when holding the age cohort and survey year constant, a one unit increase in the log relative size of college workers is associated with about 10 percentage points decrease in the college premium. The more comparable result by focusing on the college/high school earnings premium is about -0.18, which is slightly lower than -0.2 in the U.S. and -0.23 in the U.K. while almost the same as the results for Japan and Canada. The negative supply effect in China is so close to the other four countries is remarkable given the very different economic development levels, trends of the college premiums and the relative supply, and higher education expansion phases between China and the other four countries. It is more interesting considering that the estimate of the supply effect should be a lower bound in China and an upper bound in the other four countries.====We further examine the heterogeneous supply effects by age groups and find that the entrant group between ages 25 and 29 is more substantially affected by their relative supply. This finding can be used to address the ability composition issue.==== The ability effect is argued to be more substantial for the older group (====). However, the estimated negative supply effects for the older groups are significantly lower than those for the entrant group. This implies that the ability composition effect is not dominant in the estimated supply effect, even if it may exist to some extent.====These findings contribute to the literature on the returns to education incorporating imperfect substitution between similarly educated workers across different age cohorts by presenting evidence from China, a fast-growing developing country with a large population and workforce. Furthermore, the uniqueness of China's case ensures the empirical analysis is free of the identification issues that the existing studies encounter (====, ====, ====).====This paper also contributes to the literature on the labor market impacts of China's higher education expansion. Using census data sets, applying a difference-in-difference model, and treating the expansion in 1999 as a policy shock, ==== and ==== find that the expansion policy increased the unemployment rate of new college graduates in the short run, but the impact mostly disappeared after 5 years. In addition to the similar short-run unemployment impacts, ==== and ==== further find significant negative earnings impacts of the expansion policy on the young college graduates.==== Using 2002 and 2007 waves of China Household Income Project and Urban Household Surveys 2002¨C2008, ==== demonstrate that the higher education expansion reduced the employment opportunity and earnings for entry-period college graduates but had no significant effect on those incumbent college graduates. These studies reveal a comparable fact as our paper that the labor market new entrants are more easily affected by the increased cohort size due to the higher education expansion. However, they do not extend the analysis from the policy shock effects to the marginal effects of continuously changing cohort size until a recent study by ==== and ====. Since the proposition is also based upon a CES production function, even though slightly different from ====, it's not reasonable to argue that the imperfect substitution among workers of different ages does not hold in China context. The critical difference is that ==== examine how the young cohort size affects the college premium for the senior while our paper studies how the cohort size affects the college premium for the same cohort.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section?==== presents the theoretical model by ====. Section?==== discusses empirical strategy and potential identification issues.

By 2015, the total public investment in agricultural R&D conducted by research institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) system reached RMB 29.3 billion (roughly USD 4.5 billion), almost nine times the agricultural R&D investment in 1990 (RMB 3.8 billion or about USD 0.5 billion) (====).====Did China's large investments in public agricultural R&D and extension help to increase agricultural productivity?

Using hand-collected Chinese genealogy information and a panel of Chinese listed family firms, we find robust evidence that clan culture influences are associated with a significantly higher family ownership concentration. By taking advantage of firm owner birthplace information, we are able to separate the impact of inherited clan culture from that of external environmental factors. To further establish causality, we also employ an instrumental variable (IV) regression strategy and explore the underlying mechanisms.","Among various structures of corporate ownership, family ownership remains the dominant structure for both privately-held and publicly-traded firms in today's business world (e.g., La ====; ====). Family-owned business also accounts for a large share of GDP in many countries and matters significantly for the aggregate economy (e.g., ====).==== Moreover, existing studies also document that concentration of family ownership has important impacts on firm performance (e.g., ====; ====; ====) and other outcomes, such as opacity of information disclosure and insider trading (e.g., ====; ====).====Understanding the determinants of family ownership concentration is thus a research topic of first-order importance. A key question that remains in the literature is whether family ownership concentration is an economic outcome or a result of cultural influences (e.g., ====), capital market imperfections (e.g., ====), and stability of market conditions (control potential) (e.g., ====).====On the other hand, scholars in other disciplines of social science have also proposed a cultural explanation of family ownership (e.g., ====; ====; ====). According to this culture view, on top of economic and institutional factors, family ownership is deeply rooted in clan culture or familism tradition. For example, ==== shows that high concentration of family ownership exists not only in the China mainland but also in other Chinese societies with Western-style institutions, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and is also prevalent among firms run by ethnic Chinese but located in different societies with sharp variations in institutions. Up to date, however, rigorous empirical evidence for this cultural view remains rather limited. The only suggestive empirical evidence comes from ==== seminal work in which the authors document, in the cross-country data, a positive correlation between family ties and a variety of economic outcomes, including the fraction of family control among listed firms.====In this study, we aim to fill the gaps by examining the causal effect of clan culture on the concentration of family ownership using data from China. A clan is a consolidated kin group made up of component families that trace their patrilineal descent from a common ancestor.==== As basic units of cooperation, clans preceded more centralized forms of modern states and existed in all societies historically. Some societies in the developing world, such as those in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia, are still predominantly clan-based nowadays. Moreover, in many other regions that had long exposure to clan influences historically, such as Southern and Eastern Europe, India, China, and Southeast Asia, clans continue to have persistent cultural impacts on social norms and individual behavior even after the emergence of centralized modern states.====As a research topic, clan has been widely studied in various disciplines of social science, including anthropology, sociology, history, and political science.==== Recently, researchers have started examining its impacts on economic outcomes, including sustaining cooperation (e.g., ====; ====), transmission of knowledge (e.g., ====), and female labor force participation (e.g., ====). In particular, a growing strand of literature has also investigated the economic impacts of clan culture, including firm financing, entrepreneurship, and old-age support (e.g., ====; ====, ====), in China. However, to date, the effect of clan culture on family ownership concentration remains largely unexplored.====To identify the causal effect of clan culture on family ownership, we make use of detailed firm-level and prefecture-level data from China. China offers an ideal setting to examine this issue for several reasons. First, China is well known for its long history of clan influences (e.g., ====; ====, ====; ====; ====), making it an ideal candidate for studying this subject.==== Second, although existing studies have investigated firm ownership structures in many other parts of the world, little attention has been paid to China, the second largest economy where private business accounts for a large share of its economy and plays a crucial role in shaping its future economic development (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Understanding the ownership structure of China's private business remains an important yet under-researched subject. The third reason is data availability. With the unique, hand-collected genealogy data for China, we are able to construct a prefectural-level measure of local clan culture intensity and merge it with the firm-level data from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) family firm database.====A key empirical challenge in our study is omitted variable bias. We overcome this challenge using several methods. First, in our baseline analysis, we take advantage of the owner birthplace and firm locality information in the CSMAR data to disentangle the effect of the inherited component of clan culture (i.e., clan culture intensity in owners' birthplaces, or clan culture of origin) from that of external environmental factors by controlling for firm's locality-year fixed effects. Our baseline regression results show that firm owner's clan culture of origin has a positive and significant impact on family ownership concentration. The estimated effect is also economically sizable. A one-standard-deviation increase in the clan culture intensity measure can raise family ownership share by 2.88 percentage points, about 8% increase relative to the sample mean of family ownership share. Evidence from the omitted variable test of ==== further suggests that our baseline results are unlikely to be driven by omitted variables. We also conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness of our results to alternative measures of family ownership and local clan culture intensity, model specifications, and samples used in estimation. Moreover, in the Online Appendix, we also provide some additional evidence using the cross-country data of La ==== and the 2010 China Private Enterprise Survey (CPES).====) and the Xiangshan Academy (====) as the IV. These two academies were respectively founded by two prominent neoConfucian scholars, Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan, and were their primary places of holding lectures on clan-related doctrines. As we shall discuss in more details in ====, ====, both Zhu Xi and Lu Jiuyuan played important roles in the historical development of clan organizations in China. Given that prefectures closer to these two academies were more exposed to Zhu's and Lu¡¯s influences historically and that cultural influences tend to be persistent, we expect stronger local clan influences in these prefectures today. Our relevance test for the IV finds supportive evidence for this linkage in the data. We also conduct various exclusion tests to rule out other potential channels through which the external IV directly affects family ownership. The IV results confirm that stronger clan culture influences indeed cause a higher concentration of family ownership.====We then move one step forward to explore the underlying mechanisms. We propose three possible mechanisms.====Although we have listed these channels separately, we would like to stress that they are likely to be intertwined and are by no means mutually exclusive. The main objective of this study is thus not to rigorously distinguish further these finer channels. Rather, our intended contribution is to empirically identify the causal effect of the clan culture on family ownership concentration. Nonetheless, we do provide some evidence to shed light on these underlying mechanisms. Evidence that is consistent with characteristics of clan culture and theories of family ownership helps us to further establish causality.====For the short-radius trust channel, we are able to provide direct evidence that individuals from prefectures with stronger clan culture do exhibit a higher degree of trust asymmetry (i.e., high trust in family members but low trust in strangers). In addition, we also show that local clan culture has a bigger impact on family ownership in weaker contracting and legal environments or more volatile business sectors, where trust is more needed. To examine the financial resources pooling channel, we explore the role of local ==== and find a more pronounced effect of clan culture in provinces with weaker financial institutions where family funding is more crucial to firms. Moreover, we also use the 2010 CPES data, which contains the information on firm owner's share and the share held by other family members, and show that the relative share held by other family members increases with the strength of local clan culture. Finally, we provide supportive evidence for the amenity potential channel again using the CPES data. We show that, in prefectures with stronger local clan culture, owners feel more obligated to provide employment for their family members.====) and firm financing (====). Second, regional economic development depends not only on clan culture but also on other important factors, such as institutional reforms, openness, local financial development, and geography. As a result, a high clan culture intensity can co-exist with both fast regional economic growth (Guangdong and Zhejiang) and slow regional growth (Jiangxi) if other factors are not taken into consideration. Overall, our objective is not to examine whether clan culture has a beneficial or adverse effect on regional development, and our results are not adequate to answer that macro-level question either. Another caveat is that clan culture can potentially have time-varying effects on firm behavior (====), which are not fully examined in our study due to data limitation. Nevertheless, our findings on the underlying mechanisms do have some policy implications. If a policy objective is to pursue a more diffused structure of corporate ownership, then our results suggest that a sound legal institution and a well-functioning financial market can effectively attenuate the impact of clan culture.====Our work contributes to the relevant literature in the following aspects. First, it contributes to the growing literature on corporate ownership structure, and, in particular, family ownership determination. Existing contributions (e.g., ====; ====; ====) have carefully examined the role of institutions in determining the concentration of family ownership. We add to this literature by exploring a cultural determinant of family ownership and identifying its causal impact. Our findings provide a new perspective to better understand the heterogeneity in family ownership concentration.====Second, our study is also related to a recently-emerged strand of literature that exams the consequences of clan culture (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). While previous work focuses predominantly on economic impacts, we extend this literature by examining the financial consequence of clan culture influences. Our results show that clans can also have a persistent cultural impact on corporate ownership structure. To the extent that clan is a particular form of ethnic organization and there are other kinds of ethnic groups, like caste in India, our study is also related to a broader strand of literature that exams the consequences of ethnic groups (e.g., ====; ====; ====).====Third, our study provides a nice complement to the broader literature on cultural traits and economic outcomes. Existing studies have documented culture as an important determinant of various economic and financial outcomes (e.g., ====; ====, ====, ====; ====; ====; ====). Our findings regarding the impact of clan culture on firm ownership structure line up well with the main theme of this recent ¡°cultural revolution¡± in the literature that stresses the persistent and significant impacts of cultural traits on economic and financial outcomes.====Last, our study is also related to a narrower strand of literature that focuses on the ownership structure of Chinese enterprises. Existing work in this literature has examined the effects of ownership structure on Chinese firms' efficiency (e.g., ====; ====; ====) and investigated institutional determinants of firm ownership (e.g., ====; ====; ====) in China. In particular, ==== and ==== have hypothesized that a strong family orientation in Chinese business is likely due to cultural reasons. We contribute to this literature by providing formal statistical evidence that clan culture has a significant impact on the ownership structure of Chinese private firms.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses our conceptual framework and provides background information on clans and family ownership in China.

Surprisingly, it is evident that online learning time has a significant negative effect for some students in certain subjects. Finally, online education neither widens nor narrows the ==== of students' test scores.","The Internet allows new pedagogical modes to emerge, leading to enormous innovation and expansion during the recent decades. Traditional distance learning, which is mainly based on television and radio programs, provides opportunities to learn from home. However, the difficulty with these methods was that students were not able to interact with other students or ask professors questions, because everything was broadcasted to them. But online distance learning (ODL) overcame this difficulty and improved interactivity for learners, instead of being taught passively (====). In the beginning, online education was just a supplement to formal education. One typical example of online distance learning (ODL) is CALCampus (Computer Assisted Learning Center Campus). In 1995, it began to offer an online school to deliver instruction, learning materials and administration entirely via the Internet, so students and teachers could interact in real time.==== Currently, online education has become an indispensable part of university life (====). In 1993, Jones International University became the first fully web-based university in the US and offered master degree initially.==== Since then, more and more universities have begun to implement completely online degree programs. Nowadays, online degrees are available in 137 popular subjects, with 532 schools for bachelor's degree and 586 schools for master's degree in the US.==== Moreover, it is becoming more popular worldwide. The number of online education users in China has nearly doubled in three years, from 140 million in 2016 to 230 million in 2019.==== In the meantime, people have changed their attitude towards online education for at least three reasons. First, online students have access to courses at any time and at any place, which is more cost-efficient for attending class (====). Second, the same instructional content may narrow the achievement gap resulting from uneven teaching quality. Third, since students can watch online courses repeatedly after school, online education time does not affect their normal learning trajectory (====).====This paper examines the effects of online education time on students' achievement. Although learning time is one of the most critical inputs in the education production function (====; ====) and online education is developing rapidly, there is very limited discussion on this topic in the literature. Previous studies in this field compare the effectiveness of offline and online education but do not arrive at a consensus. Some studies find that online education cannot be as effective as offline education (e.g., ====; ====; ====), while others suggest that online education does not differ considerably from offline education (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== suggests that the observed difference between online and offline education is because of poor use of technology and incomplete analyses. In addition, some scholars have suggested that that online education can be superior to traditional education (e.g., ====).====Studies of learning time on students' achievement have a long history and mainly focus on two aspects: school instruction time and extracurricular learning time. ==== find that all students can benefit from summer school, especially students from middle-class homes. In addition, after-school programs can strengthen students' noncognitive skills, such as responsibility and emotional learning (====; ====). Using instruction time to improve students' academic performance has been a policy issue. For instance, expanded learning time (ELT) is an emerging reform aimed at narrowing the achievement gap by adding hours to the traditional schedule. The assumption here is that more class time will result in higher achievement among disadvantaged students so that they can catch up with their peers. Intuitively, expanded instruction time can allow teachers to impart more knowledge and allow students to better understand lessons, but there is no consistent evidence for this in the literature. Some studies show that additional instruction time can increase all students' achievement (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Others find no significant effect of expanded instruction time on the achievement of some students (e.g., ====; ; ====; ====).====It should be noted that the learning time for online education differs from traditional instruction time. In previous studies, instruction time was mainly determined by the school curriculum, whereby there was no difference in instruction time for different students in the same class, and we are not able to tell how engaged students are during this time. Although students with different abilities and motivations have different ¡°real learning times¡±, they have the same instruction time statistically (====; ====). Online education allows students to choose their learning time, especially when the supervision of teachers and parents is weak. Students can choose their ¡°real learning time¡± based on their own judgment.==== When online education is selective rather than compulsory, especially when it is complementary to offline education, some unobserved variables affect both online education participation decisions and schooling achievements. As a result, the usual OLS estimate is biased and inconsistent. Our context is in references to when, on December 31, 2019, the first COVID-19 infection case was reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, China (====). On January 23, 2020, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic. However, because the lockdown was just before the Chinese New Year when billions of people returned to their hometowns, the pandemic quickly spread across the whole country (====). As a direct result, all schools in China halted offline education and converted to fully online education after the Chinese New Year holiday. The sudden epidemic caused millions of teachers and students to enter online education. This provides us with a perfect natural experiment to identify the effectiveness of online education. Fortunately, we can avoid selection bias since epidemics make everyone participate in online education without a choice.==== (National College Entrance Examination) has a strong effect on students' futures, making graduating students highly motivated to achieve their goals (====), when we control for the students' initial academic performance ¨C the test score exactly before the start of online education, this should be able to substantially alleviate the problem if it cannot completely overcome the endogeneity problem totally.====In this paper, we estimate the impact of online education on students' academic performance using data from 1141 high school students at Grade 12 who were about to attend the ==== in July 2020. Some scholars have studied similar topics and have discussed the relative questions of online education under COVID-19 (e.g., ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== explore an inclusive approach to simultaneous teaching of proximate and online students. They are, however, focus on different problems from our research. This paper aims to answer three questions: (1) How effective is online education? (2) Does the effect differ among students, subjects, and personal characteristics? (3) Is the effect lasting? Our article also provides some guidelines for the development of online courses. At this stage, the efficacy of online courses is limited by equipment, teachers' training (====; ====The estimation results show that, on average, online education has significant but moderate effects on math test scores.==== When the online watching time for math increases by 10%, the score increases by approximately 0.344, holding other factors constant, but watching time has no statistically significant effect on other subjects in both natural sciences and social sciences.==== We also find that online education has a long-lasting effect on math for students among the natural sciences. In contrast, there is no persistent effect on other subjects.====The heterogeneity analysis results suggest that the top-tier students are most positively affected by online education in most subjects. For students with disparate backgrounds, there are also great differences in the benefits of online education. For instance, for students who use computers or tablets in online education, the coefficients are insignificant, implying that different tools may not affect online learning. The distributional effects show that students in the 0.60th to 0.80th quantiles of math can only increase their scores by more than 0.25 with a 10% increase in online watching time. However, for the liberal arts, we find that watching time has a significantly negative impact on student performance.

The literature has found that social trust, a non-institutional factor, is an important factor in disciplining dishonest behaviour and improves the media's incentives to report. In this paper, we develop a model to investigate the dual effects of social trust¡ªbehaviour discipline effect and media enhancing effect¡ªand analyse its interplay with institutional factors on food scandal exposure. The theory is then tested using 2004¨C2011 food event data. The results show that trust has a significant positive impact on food scandal exposure, which implies that the media enhancing effect plays a dominant role in China. However, this effect is weakened in provinces with a higher level of law enforcement and market development, which suggests that institutional factors are a substitute for social trust in affecting food scandal exposure in China.","Media exposure has been credited for playing an important role in disciplining firms' misconduct (====; ====; ====), restoring public confidence (====), and improving state governance transparency (====). This importance is particularly prominent in the food sector in China. After the occurrence of multiple food safety scandals, evidence has been found that food providers are suffering from lower stock prices, reputational ruin and more severe liabilities following the passing of stringent food safety laws (====; ====; ====; ====). Some food safety events, e.g., the melamine scandal in milk powder production and plasticizer in liquor packaging, were disclosed by the media before public intervention. Nevertheless, evidence also shows that exposure to food safety events exhibits significant heterogeneity across regions (====; ====). The question thus arises over which determinants and channels influence the efficiency of media exposure.====In this paper, we focus on the role of social trust on food scandal exposure. In the literature (e.g., ====; ====; ====), social trust is seen as a factor that generates psychological or transactional costs for individuals who engage in opportunistic or unlawful activities and hence dampens moral hazard problems. It is known as an informal factor that interacts with institutional factors and has received continuous attention in the literature (====, ==== for a general review). Despite the prevailing discussion of how social trust may influence a firm's behaviour and its consequent economic outcomes, less attention is given to understanding its effect on media exposure.====Understanding the relationship between social trust and media exposure presents some difficulties. One stems from the complexity of social trust that affects both media reporting behaviour and the behaviour of economic agents, which in turn determines the number of scandals that the media can disclose. Another difficulty is the potential interaction of social trust with other factors, particularly the institutional factors that also affect the likelihood of media exposure. The multilayer impact of social trust, which intertwines with other factors, suggests that both theory and proper empirical design are needed to better understand the relationship between social trust and media exposure.====In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to investigate how social trust interplays with institutional factors to influence the exposure of food safety scandals, which are a function of the underlying frequency of food safety incidents and the media's willingness to report on them. To understand the occurrence of food safety incidents, we specifically model the behaviour of food producers, who choose between producing safe or unsafe products, taking into account the potential legal and social costs. In addition, we specifically model the behaviour of media, which chooses between reporting or not reporting food safety incidents. We identify two effects that social trust may play on media exposure: (1) the firm behaviour discipline effect that increases the firm's social cost and hence reduces the likelihood of food safety scandals and (2) the media enhancing effect that raises the media's reporting benefit and hence increases its incentive to disclose food safety events. The overall effect of social trust on media exposure is thus ambiguous and depends on which effect plays a dominant role. We further show that institutional factors, i.e., the degree of law enforcement and market development, increase the potential legal ramifications of misconduct and make the media enhancing effect of social trust weaker. These factors are thus substituted with social trust in influencing the likelihood of scandal exposure.====To test this theory, we combine the media data collected in ====, which provides statistics of food safety incidents reported in national and local news between 2004 and 2011, and the provincial index of social trust, which is based on the results of approximately 4600 responses to a 2000 survey of more than 15,000 managers from 31 provinces in the Chinese Enterprise Survey System (CESS) conducted by ====. We find that the media enhancing effect plays a dominant role in China, manifesting a positive relationship between social trust and food scandal exposure. Heterogeneity analyses further show that the positive impact of social trust is weakened in provinces with a higher degree of law enforcement and a higher degree of market development. The results thus confirm the substitution between social trust and formal institutional factors in affecting food scandal exposure in China.====The present paper bridges the literature on social trust and media exposure. Exhaustive literature is devoted to studying the role of social trust in facilitating cooperation in networks of civic engagement and hence improving economic performance (====; ====; ====). Several studies have examined how social trust affects firms' behaviour and information disclosure. For instance, ==== report that social trust is negatively associated with the risk of collapse. Companies in areas with high levels of social trust are less likely to hide their internal bad news. Jha (2019) found that firms headquartered in more trustworthy regions are less likely to cheat by misrepresenting financial information and have more readable annual reports. Regarding media exposure, the literature shows that it plays a similar role to social trust in affecting corporate behaviour. ==== find that public perceptions about risks may be amplified by media exposure, generating profound social and political impacts. ==== find the media's significant influence on food scandals in financial markets. ==== argues that media bias exists in China and exhibits two dimensions of heterogeneity: central/local and political/economic. ==== study social trust and corporate misconduct and find that the negative relationship between social trust and corporate misconduct is more significant in high media coverage regions. Our paper contributes to these works by developing a theory that reveals the causal relationship between social trust and media exposure in an environment in which media may be biased or reported events may be subjectively selected.====The present paper also contributes to the extant studies on the interaction between social trust and formal institutions. Both theoretical and empirical research has recognized the two-way effects of these factors in affecting economic activity (====). However, the relationship between these factors is not conclusive. For example, ==== establish a theoretical model on the effects of trust and legalization on economic growth. In this model, trust is important only when the contract between the parties is incomplete, which suggests a substitution effect between social capital and regulation. Similarly, ==== demonstrates that in the absence of restraint mechanisms, society places more emphasis on trust. However, theoretical works show that institutions work better in a society with a high level of trust, which suggests that informal and formal institutional factors are complementary (====; ====). The present paper shows, both in theory and with Chinese data, a substitute relationship between social trust and institutional factors. The substitution stems from the fact that social trust and institutional factors play a similar role in affecting the expected loss accrued by a firm's misconduct.====The structure of the paper is as follows. In ====, we present a simple theoretical model to show different impacts of social trust and its interaction with other factors to influence the likelihood of food scandal exposure. Then, we derive possible hypotheses for testing. In ====, we present the empirical strategy and the sample. ==== shows the empirical results, and the final section delivers conclusions.====In this appendix, we investigate the firm's behaviour in a simple dynamic setting, where the firm lives for an infinite horizon. In each period, the firm decides whether to provide safe or unsafe food (==== or ====). If the firm chooses to provide safe food (====), its long-run profit, written in a recursive form, is:====where ==== denotes the discount factor of the firm. We can easily derive that the long-run profit for the firm choosing to provide safe food is====If the firm chooses to provide unsafe food (thus saving cost ====), depending on whether media will report the incident, two consequences may arise: on the one hand, the firm may suffer a legal cost, which reduces the present profit to ====(1???====); on the other hand, if the bad behaviour is disclosed by the media, i.e., with probability ====(====,?¡¤), it will entail a loss in future profit due to the social cost of punishment (?====(====)).

Armed by the method of Dekle, Eaton, and Kortum (2007, 2008) to quantify the individual countries' responses to the ¡°China (trade liberalization) shock¡± at equilibrium, we could check the extent to which global welfare benefit from the import tariff reduction after China's entry into the WTO. The quantitative results show that, both China and the RoW benefit from Chinese participation into the WTO, with estimated welfare gains falling in a range of [1.4697%, 3.8743%] and [0.0743%, 0.1015%], respectively. That is to say, about 58.24% of total benefits extracted from China's accession into the WTO worldwide flow to countries other than China under perfect competition; while under monopolistic competition, the whole world enjoys a 0.1571% welfare increases if firms' entry is restricted, of which 42.64% are injected into the RoW, an equivalent amount of 23.3903 billion US dollars. Since allowing for firms' entry and exit would lead to adjustments in both aggregate price indices and government tariff revenues, welfare gains of the world significantly increase (0.2474%), but these adjustments would slightly distort the welfare changes for other countries in the sense that only 36.50%, which is equivalent to 32.1008 billion US dollars, overflow to the RoW. As a result, some countries gain more, while some less.","China has become an increasingly important participant in worldwide trade of merchandise goods over the past two decades, as the growth rate of its trade volume has far outpaced the growth rate of the RoW. Much of this growth in trade share is attributable to China's accession to the WTO in 2001, followed by the gradual decrease in tariffs among other reforms in the 2000s.==== Although such trade-liberalizing event has aroused widespread attention, studies using the standard quantitative trade model that specifically designed to evaluate the impact of China's trade liberalization on global welfare is surprisingly thin.====) and such tariff reductions by China upon her accession into the WTO are widely viewed as Chinese unilateral trade liberalization==== (====), we, therefore, mainly focus on the unilateral tariff reduction upon China's WTO accession in this paper. All the quantitative results strongly confirm the conventional wisdom that China's accession into the WTO is globally beneficial and win-win. Also, our study provides further quantitative evidence for the positive impact of trade liberalization.====In regard to the theoretical setup, we first get started from the simplest quantitative trade model possible, the Armington Model, to briefly describe our quantitative implications. Then, we work on more general frameworks by capturing the comprehensive effects of China's accession to the WTO, to show how the accompanied tariff changes affect a country's overall welfare across different models. Since there is no consensus on which types of model are superior to others in the literature (====), we conduct our analysis on the basis of both perfect competition model and monopolistically competitive model, two mostly commonly used market structures for the quantitative analysis. To be specific, we augment the framework of ==== and ====With respect to the simulation part, we quantitatively estimate each individual trading nations' welfare gains, in terms of changes from the current equilibrium, utilizing the approach proposed by (====, ====). Their approach allows us to calibrate our model based on the actual production and trade data, with a particular virtue that we do not have to make the unrealistic assumption on the equality of bilateral trade costs.==== In regard to the terms-of-trade effect, similar with the standard trade theory, our quantitative results show that, China would experience terms-of-trade losses after its WTO accession, but her trade partners would gain by improvements in terms-of-trade under all cases. Meanwhile, the tariff revenue effect, which captures the fluctuations in a country's real income in response to changes of the tariff revenue collected, increases welfare for all countries that trade with China. In particular, such positive tariff revenue effect dominates other negative effects in China due to the strong import growth after China's entry into the WTO. As for the firm profit effect and the firm mass effect, both of them are generated by resources adjustments across multiple sectors, which would have ambiguous influences on any single country's welfare gains and this is in line with the study in (====). Overall, China's integration into the worldwide economy system has a positive effect on both the welfare of China and the global welfare. Specifically, after China's entry into the WTO, the cumulated welfare gains for the world as a whole have increased about 0.1424?%?~0.2474% during 2001¨C2006 across various models, of which 36.5%?~?58.24% spill over to the RoW, an equivalent amount of 28.3897¨C32.1008 billion in the current US dollars. Moreover, our quantitative results are robust to a battery of robustness exercises including adopting different methods to deal with the ¡°trade imbalance issue¡±, considering other countries' tariff reduction and accounting for the impact of other non-tariff trade costs. All these robustness checks further support our quantitative analysis that both China and the RoW as a whole benefit from China's accession into the WTO. In other words, China's WTO accession is a win-win to the global economy.====Our paper adds to the growing but surprisingly rather sparse body of studies that quantify the welfare impacts of China in a full-fledged quantitative trade framework. To the best of our knowledge, the following two are the extant researches mostly related to our study. ==== quantify the global welfare impact of China's integration to world trade and advances in technology in a multi-country quantitative Ricardian-Heckscher-Ohlin model and find significant welfare increase of a large majority of countries. ==== examine China's gains from WTO accession under a monopolistically competitive setting as in ==== and their quantitative analysis shows that the gains of the import sector are larger than that of==== the export one. We contribute to this strand of literature by conducting quantitative analysis both in the perfect competition model as in ==== and the monopolistic competition framework as in the ¡°new¡± new trade theory. This can help to check the extent to which the world gains from the import tariff reduction upon China's entry into the WTO across various assumptions on technology and market structure.====Besides our method used in this paper, another popular method for evaluating the welfare effects of the Chinese tariff reduction is the so-called Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) model (e.g., ====; ====, ====; ====); (ii) it relies less on specifying a vast number of parameters (==== In addition, since our general equilibrium framework is derived based on the classical trade theory, the quantitative method in this paper lies on solid micro-theoretical foundations. To be more specific, for instance, we don't need to impose the usual Armington assumption that each country only produces one specific good, while this assumption is standard in CGE models.====The remainder is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical setup under various assumptions on the technology and market structure, in which we also detail and demonstrate how to compute and decompose the general equilibrium welfare effects of tariff changes. Section 3 introduces the data and the calibration of the main parameters. Section 4 reports and compares the quantitative results under different model settings and presents a wide range of robustness checks as well. The last section concludes.====Throughout the quantitative analysis in the main text, we follow ==== and ==== to address the ¡°trade imbalance issue¡± by first purging the original data from aggregate trade imbalances based on the above theoretical setup and then use the purged trade data to conduct all subsequent analysis. In the first step, we introduce the aggregate trade imbalances as nominal transfer into the budget constraint and then allow them to change exogenously. Then, Eqs. ====, ==== and ==== become:====where ====?=?¡Æ====¡Æ====???¡Æ====¡Æ==== represents the net export value and is taken from data. Using Eqs. ==== ====, ==== and ====, we can then solve for the general equilibrium by setting ====¡ä = 0 while keeping all tariffs unchanged and obtain the trade matrix without aggregate trade imbalances using these general equilibrium effects ====. With this purged balanced trade data, we can then conduct the welfare analysis in the second step using our theoretical framework. Similar process of the elimination of aggregate trade imbalances are adopted in the two settings under monopolistic competition model (Melitz Setting).",How China's accession to the WTO affects global welfare?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001061,26-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,229

Does trade liberalization contribute to the gender inequality in local labor market in the developing world? We exploit China's trade liberalization during 1990 and 2005 to answer this question.====The literature has extensively examined economic consequences of trade liberalization worldwide. Beyond China, researchers have exploited episodes of trade liberalization in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Vietnam (====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). An emerging literature has studied economic consequences of China's trade liberalization by examining effects on firm performance (====; ====; ====), wage inequality (====), skill premium (====; ====), education (====; ====; ====), migration (====), health (====), and labor market outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====).==== We contribute to the literature by demonstrating that the reduction in import tariff explains approximately two thirds of the increasing gender gap in LFP in China.====Our identification strategy is essentially a difference-in-differences one. The primary data sources are the 1990, 2000, and 2005 waves of the China population census. The three census waves allow us to observe individual LFP status before and after the two waves of tariff reduction in China. We apply the Bartik approach (====), which has been widely used in recent studies (====; ====; ====; ====, ====The preferred estimates suggest that a one-percentage-point reduction in import tariff reduces LFP rate by 0.085 percentage points for males and 0.269 percentage points for females, enlarging the gender gap in LFP by 0.184 percentage points. The results are robust after we control for prefecture-level trends of LFP between 1982 and 1990. We also conduct placebo tests examining the effect of import tariff on LFP prior to tariff reduction, and do not detect the gender-differential effects. Our identification is robust to potential non-parallel trends.====We examine the robustness of results controlling for contemporaneous confounding events. During our study period, 1990¨C2005, China's trade liberalization changed in multiple dimensions. ====a shows that when China reduced its import tariff in 1990¨C2005, other countries also lowered tariffs towards Chinese exports. The United States granted China permanent normal trade relations upon China's WTO accession in 2001, which reduced the uncertainty of U.S. tariff on Chinese exports (====), and foreign entities were allowed to invest in certain industries in China (====). Inside China, state-owned enterprises offer generous fertility benefits for female employees, while private enterprises are much more demanding for working mothers; the privatization of the SOEs may have gender-differential effects on LFP. We find robust effects of import tariff on the gender gap in LFP when controlling for all these confounding events.==== and ====Why does increased import competition enlarge the gender gap in LFP? ==== shows that female-intensive industries experienced larger reduction in import tariff than male-intensive industries; thus, the competitive pressure is stronger for females than males.==== The heterogeneity analyses indicate that the comparative advantage of females in household production may provide females a better alternative when they do not work. The census collects data on reasons for non-working, by which we consistently observe three statuses when people do not participate in the labor force: housework, retirement, or school attendance. We find that for people of aged 26¨C50, import competition makes it more likely for females to quit the labor force for housework than it does for males. For people of aged 41¨C50, import competition makes it more likely that females quit the labor force for early retirement than it does for males. School attendance is a reason for the gender-differential effect on LFP for people aged 16. We also explore the role of social norms. Echoing the findings of ====, our findings suggest that import competition tends to deepen the pre-existing gender gap in LFP.====We then probe the effect of import tariff on local industries. We find that import competition induces a contraction of female-intensive industries relative to male-intensive industries. Within each industry, import competition reduces the ratio of females to males. Overall, import competition induces both between- and within-industry changes in gender composition.====Our findings are closely related with three recent works on trade liberalization and China's labor market (====, ====; ====). Firstly, using Urban Household Surveys for 1998¨C2009, ==== find that import competition reduces the wages of urban workers, especially for job entrants. We examine LFP rather than wage, and use nationally representative census data that cover both urban and rural areas. We complement ==== by studying the effect of import competition on the extensive margin of labor supply, with a particular focus on the gender-differential effect.====Secondly, our findings are consistent with ====, who find a buffering effect of the household: When one household member suffers from a negative shock induced by import competition, other members increase their labor supply. Results in ==== may be a potential mechanism behind our findings. We find that female-intensive industries experienced larger reduction in import tariff than male-intensive industries. Thus, the competitive pressure is stronger for females than males, resulting in more females quitting the labor market. By ====, when the wife quits the labor market, the husband would be more likely to participate in the labor force, leading to a further expansion of the gender gap in LFP.====Thirdly, ==== examine effects of trade liberalization on prefecture-level employment and industrial outcomes in the long run by using data from both population and industrial censuses. ==== have made an important contribution that import competition can boost employment in the long run. ==== stress the changes in female intensive sectors, sectoral gender segregation, gender discrimination, technological upgrading and economic development as the potential mechanisms. Complementary to the long-run perspective of ====, we identify a ¡°medium-run¡± effect of import competition on the gender gap in LFP. Import competition enlarges the gender gap in LFP a few years after the shock, but the effect may not persist in the long run.====Our study contributes to the understanding of the changing gender gap. Although women are catching up with men in educational attainment (====), the gender gap in the labor market persists (====; ====; ====; ====). ==== are the first to identify the causal effect of import competition on the gender gap in LFP. Although ==== find that reduction in import tariff reduces the gender gap in LFP in Brazil, we find that reduction in import tariff increases the gender gap in LFP in China. One reason for the heterogeneous effects is that tariff reductions in Brazil are larger in male-intensive industries, but those in China are larger in female-intensive industries. The difference in gender-intensity of the industries that experienced tariff decline may explain the opposite gender-differential effects in the two studies. Although the main findings differ, both ====). A recent study on Mexico highlights the formalization of jobs: Mexican tariff cut increases the probability of working formally for both men and women, and the effect size is larger for men (====). The estimates of ==== capture the short-run negative effects of trade liberalization on the gender gap in formal employment. Both ==== and our study find that trade liberalization leads to an expansion of the gender gap and regard labor reallocation as a mechanism, but we have different focuses. While ==== focus on the gender gap in formal employment, we focus on the gender gap in LFP.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the data and empirical specification. ==== presents our main empirical results. ==== discusses mechanisms of influence. ==== concludes.",Import competition and the gender gap in labor force participation: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001073,26-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,230

We apply the difference-in-differences approach to the up-to-date China Customs data on imports disaggregated by eight-digit HS product category and source country. We find large reductions in the value and quantity of imports from the US and an almost complete tariff pass-through onto import prices. These results remain robust to extensive changes in the specification and in data sample and to a variety of placebo tests using processing imports or exempted products that were originally included in the tariff lists but removed before implementation.

Similar to recent findings in the US (====, ====), our estimates suggest limited terms-of-trade gain due to China's tariff hikes.","During the 2018¨C2019 trade war between China and the United States, China openly adopted a ¡°tit-for-tat¡± strategy in response to the US tariff increases. Each wave of the punitive tariffs by the US were followed by China's retaliatory tariffs on a range of US products in equal measure.==== While there have been numerous empirical studies on how the American punitive tariffs affect its imports and prices, less is known about the impact of China's retaliatory tariffs.====This study complements existing studies by estimating the trade and price effects of China's retaliatory tariffs on imports from the US. Specifically, we utilize monthly Chinese import data at the most disaggregated product level (i.e., the eight-digit Harmonized System code, henceforth HS-8) from January 2017 to May 2019 to investigate how US exports respond to Chinese tariffs, as a whole and separately by each consecutive wave. For ease of comparison, we closely follow ==== by regressing year-on-year changes in import value, quantity, and price on the year-on-year changes in import tariffs.====Our study on China's retaliation makes a few novel contributions to the expanding literature. First, we are concerned about the impacts of Chinese tariffs on the targeted US goods compared with imports of the same goods from other sources, whereas existing studies (in particular, Table 3 of ====) compare the targeted US goods to the same US goods exported to other destinations. Our data is more suited to studying the impact of ==== tariffs on ====) and (====) to improve identification. Finally, a significant advantage from using detailed Chinese customs data is precision; the tariff codes can be perfectly matched with the import data at the eight-digit HS level. Since the HS codes are harmonized across countries at only the six-digit level, using US exports will be less precise.==== Moreover, as importing countries collect tariff revenues based on reported quantities and volumes, the numbers reported by importers are often considered more accurate than those reported by exporters (====).====Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, we find a sharp decline in the value and quantity of imports from the US due to China's retaliatory tariffs. In our benchmark specification, we estimate that a 1% increase in import tariff induces a 1.6% decrease in import quantity and value, keeping other factors unchanged. This estimation, however, does not account for the zeros in the import data. We then adopt an inverse hyperbolic sine transmission of import value and quantity, and the tariff elasticity increases to 5.7, indicating that a 1% increase in tariff leads to a 5.7% decrease in import quantity. This estimate is in line with ====Second, like the US case studied by ====, ==== and ====, we find little evidence that US exporters would lower their pre-tariff prices when faced with China's retaliatory tariffs. In fact, for all the major rounds of retaliation, the evidence consistently indicates complete tariff pass-through onto the import price, implying that Chinese firms and consumers almost entirely bear the retaliatory tariffs.====Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneous impacts of China's retaliatory tariffs across products, along various dimensions. First, we classify products by the Broad Economic Classification (BEC) into consumer goods, intermediates, and capital goods. Tariff pass-through is complete for consumer and capital products and more than complete for intermediate inputs. Second, there are substantial variations across ==== in their quantity and price responses to the trade shocks. The largest import item, soybeans, which accounts for about 14% of China's imports from the United States, has been hit hardest by the retaliatory tariff with a large reduction in import volume. By contrast, another major import item, automobiles, has been barely affected, probably due to the suspension of tariffs on American cars. In addition, soybeans, timber, and paper products exhibit incomplete pass-through, while other products exhibit nearly complete, or even more than complete pass-through. Although the decline in import value and quantity tends to be larger for products with high import share from the US, the price pass-through pattern does not seem systematically related to US dependence due to the lack of statistical precision. The final dimension of heterogeneity that we explore is the ownership of importing firms; our results show an interestingly incomplete pass-through for imports by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), but not by foreign-invested firms or private ones.====Finally, with detailed information on the source of imports, we examine the extent to which the Chinese tariffs on US products have caused trade diversion. Focusing on the three largest waves of tariff hikes in 2018, we show evidence of trade diversion to Brazil for soybean products, South Africa for metal goods, and Germany for wood products.====Our study provides new evidence on how the US exporters responded to China's reciprocal retaliation in value, quantity, and price. While the evidence on the US side has been rich and consistent, little is known about the response from China. One exception is ====Our finding of large quantity reduction and complete tariff pass-through is in line with the existing studies for the US (====, ====, ====). Notably, ==== find that the tariff pass-through onto retailing prices is incomplete, although the pass-through onto import price is nearly complete. Thus, the incidence of tariff has largely fallen on US retailers who have lowered their profit margins. The rising tariffs also exert uneven impacts across regions. For instance, ==== document that the rising import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties. Furthermore, they show that other countries¡¯ retaliatory tariffs have mainly affected tradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties. Similarly, ==== finds that Chinese retaliation has depressed growth in the consumption of new automobiles across US counties, which, in turn, led to a decline in employment growth, particularly for counties more exposed to Chinese tariffs.

In this paper, we answer these questions by exploring the Poverty Alleviation Coordinator (PAC) system in the Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) program in China and investigating the effects of the PAC system on poverty alleviation.====The PAC system is an institutional arrangement for the TPA program in China, which was initiated in 2013, with the aim of eliminating extreme poverty by 2020 with no one left behind. At the beginning of the TPA program, poor households were identified and a list of identified poor households (IPHs) was formed. The PAC system was then established to better reach the IPHs. The PACs are local government officials who ¨C in addition to their regular duties in various departments ¨C are assigned to specific impoverished households. They are required to pay regular home visits to the households. Through the home visits, the coordinator can verify and keep updated about the household's economic status, figure out the household's needs, and coordinate related policy resources accordingly. Given these roles of the PAC system in the TPA program, this paper is in line with literature on targeting efficiency and tools of poverty-reduction and growth-boosting aid programs.====Previous literature shows that general poverty-reduction aid programs rarely reached the poor because of the problems of asymmetric information and corruption (====£» ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== documented that foreign aid had only a small effect on poverty reduction and approximately half of Africans still lived below a $1.25 a day poverty line even with huge foreign aid; ==== showed that only about 1.69¨C5.25% of foreign aid was given to the poorest 20% of counties in any given year. ==== and ==== showed that China's rural minimum living standard guarantee program (Dibao) reached nearly 75 million poor recipients during 2007¨C2009 but had large inclusion and exclusion errors. To address the targeting problem, a large literature has explored potential optimal targeting rules, including government and NGO implementation (====), proxy means testing (====; ====), community-based methods (====), self-targeting and top-down screening and enrolment (====), etc. Through identifying and excluding ineligibles from the list, the PAC system reduces the inclusion error and therefore improves the targeting efficiency of the TPA program. Therefore, by studying the PAC system, our paper contributes an alternative targeting tool.====; ====) do weekly home visits to participating households. During the visits, they offer guidance to participants on running a business, mastering skills, engaging in remunerative jobs, obtaining social support, developing healthy habits, forming positive attitudes, etc. Academic studies investigating the effects of home visits have focused on the message, money and coaching involved. ==== studied the role of home visits in the Graduation program in Burundi (also known as ====) and found that training and coaching are imperative for achieving change, because they deliver both money and message to the participants. ==== studied the impacts of the Chemen Lavi Miy¨° (CLM) program in Haiti and concluded that home visits were ranked as medium importance in the package of support, because home visits allow the participants to gain new knowledge related to nurturing care, particularly in relation to health, sanitation, and nutrition, which is important knowledge for human capital accumulation.====The PAC system in China also utilizes a home visit approach as the channel for poverty alleviation, but it is distinguished from previous programs studied in the literature by its unprecedented scale and its institutional arrangements. This study will shed light on the success of poverty reduction interventions on a national scale. In addition, previous programs that have adopted home visits paid little attention to the households' specific needs and the relationship between the staff and the participants, which is at the heart of the success of home visits (====). Therefore, our paper also contributes to the literature by addressing the role of the quality of matching between the coordinators' resources and the households' needs.====Our work draws on two features of the PAC system in China. First, the comprehensive dataset allows us to link the PACs' characteristics with the causes of households' poverty. The PACs differ in departments, positions, government levels, etc., so they have different information and resources. The impoverished households differ in poverty level and cause, so they have different needs. The two-sided heterogeneity allows us to construct a matching quality index to gauge the delivery of needed assistance. Second, the PACs in a particular department are randomly assigned to poor households. This provides the researchers a unique opportunity to examine the causal effect of a good match between PACs and impoverished households on poverty alleviation, which is understudied in the literature.====Utilizing ====, we find that households whose PACs are a good match to their needs and those whose PACs are at a higher position have a larger income increase after the program. Through analyzing households' different income sources, we investigate the potential channels of the increased income; we find that home visits work mainly through increasing labor supply incentives in the impoverished households.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Moreover, the relationship between relative welfare poverty and happiness has been rarely studied, particularly given that the decline of poverty seemed not bringing a significant increase in happiness in China. This research gap is noteworthy because enhancing the subjective well-being of the people is crucial to a nation's sustainable economic development. On the basis of the micro-level data from China General Social Survey, this study puts forward a welfare approach to analyzing the relative multidimensional poverty and then determines the link between relative welfare poverty and individual happiness. Our results show that 1) relative welfare poverty has not declined significantly and 2) there is a significantly happiness-reducing effect of relative welfare poverty.",").====Despite the great poverty achievement, China does not seem to have experienced a significant increase in its people's happiness. ==== document the decreasing happiness of China's urban residents during 1990 and 2000. ==== show that in China the happiness levels decreased substantially in the initial stages of rapid growth but then recovered slightly thereafter. Overall, China ranks low in happiness in an international perspective (====).====The factors contributing to the low level of happiness in China vary. Some scholars claim that happiness is affected by relative instead of absolute income (====; ====). Other scholars argue happiness is multidimensional and cannot be simply explained by single-dimensional income (====). As suggested by ====).====The fact remains that enhancing the health and well-being of every individual is a pivotal challenge to all countries (====). In an era when China transforms its poverty alleviation strategy, it is essential to clarify the relationship between relative and welfare poverty and happiness so as to be purposely addressed in the policy arena. The problem is that research on happiness in China centers either on the single dimension of income poverty (====; ====; ====) or multidimensional poverty measured using an absolute approach (====). In contrast, studies on the relative welfare poverty are almost missing that little is known how relative welfare poverty may affect happiness.====Basing on the micro-level data from China General Social Survey (CGSS), we put forward a method to assess relative welfare poverty and then explore its connection with individual happiness. Our contributions are twofold. First, from a methodological point, we identify individuals living in relative welfare poverty by applying the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Thus far, research on multidimensional poverty in China generally adopts the absolute approach developed by Alkire and Foster (AF approach) in 2007 and 2011, which is also termed absolute multidimensional poverty (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In order to compute relative poverty in a multidimensional respect, the traditional approach such as 50% of the medium income does not work since it focuses on continuous variables such as income. Therefore, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is proposed to calculate the relative welfare poverty based on individual welfare information.==== Second, we investigate the effect of relative welfare poverty on happiness in China. Our results reveal that relative welfare poverty is significantly and negatively associated with happiness. The effect of poverty on each dimension of the welfare index is also significantly negative. This has policy implications that to promote the population's happiness, not only income matters, but also other factors, such as political participation, social opportunity, economic condition, living condition, health, and social protection should all be considered.====The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. ==== reviews related literature. ==== details the data and method. ==== presents the empirical results, and ==== concludes.",Measurement of relative welfare poverty and its impact on happiness in China: Evidence from CGSS,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2100105X,24-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,233

Furthermore, it analyzes how IOp differs between the rural- and urban-born, and how IOp changes across birth cohorts and with age. We use 2002, 2013 and 2018 data from the Chinese Household Income Study and focus on income inequality among working-age persons. We find that IOp in China declined, especially between 2013 and 2018. In 2002 the large contributors to IOp were region, hukou type at birth, and parents' characteristics. In 2018 the contributions of region, hukou type at birth and parents' occupation had decreased, but that of parents' education had increased. We find that IOp is larger among those born in rural than urban China. Furthermore, IOP's contribution to total inequality within each birth cohort is highest earlier in individuals' work lives and declines with age. IOp is higher for older than younger birth cohorts, reflecting that younger cohorts have benefited from increased opportunities associated with China's reforms and opening up.","There are now many studies of income inequality at the household level in China. Most show that inequality was rising until around 2008, then levelled off or declined. This inequality has been associated with various underlying factors such as the rural/urban divide, education, the unequal distribution of property and assets, and government transfer and tax policies, to mention a few. In this paper we look at underlying factors through a different lens: the inequality of opportunity (IOp).====While the literature on income distribution and inequality now has a long history, the literature on IOp is young. Much of the work on this topic is inspired by Roemer's (====) observation that some inequality is due to factors under the control of the individual because of his or her ==== and ====, and some inequality is due to factors that are beyond the individual's control, that is, ==== and ====. The first reflects inequality for which people can be held responsible, and the second reflects inequality for which they should not be held responsible. This raises an empirical question: How much of observed inequality in income is due to circumstances and opportunities, and how much is due to efforts and choices? The answer to this question is of clear policy relevance. If a large share of income inequality is due to circumstances, then an argument exists for policy interventions.====The empirical literature on IOp is now extensive and includes some studies of China. The Chinese case is interesting for several reasons. China is a country that has experienced rapid economic growth. Rapid economic growth can expand opportunities and open pathways for greater economic mobility. Also, China is an interesting case because it has been characterized by substantial barriers to mobility between the rural and urban sectors. These barriers are associated with the household registration or hukou system. Over time China has adopted a series of policy reforms to reduce the extent of hukou restrictions. In principle, then, opportunities for China's rural population should have increased, causing a decline in IOp.====Our analysis makes several contributions. First, our period of study is longer and more recent than that of previous studies of IOp in China. We analyze changes in IOp between 2002, 2013 and 2018, spanning a longer and more recent time frame than previous studies of IOp for China. These years saw not only substantial economic growth and reforms reducing hukou barriers, but also structural changes following China's accession to the ====, a major expansion of tertiary and secondary education, the Global Financial Crisis, China's large economic stimulus response to that crisis, and a substantial broadening of China's social welfare system. Also, in the latter part of this period China began a transition from rapid economic growth to a ¡®new normal¡¯ characterized by slower growth. Our analysis provides new information about how IOp in China has evolved in the context of these changes.====Second, we examine the heterogeneity of IOp among different groups. We investigate IOp for rural versus urban groups, where rural and urban are defined by hukou at birth. Some existing studies also examine IOp separately for China's rural and urban populations (e.g., ====; ====; ====). These studies differ from ours in that they use current hukou, not hukou at birth (an exception is ====). Use of hukou at birth is preferred, because the analysis can then reflect opportunities to change hukou, which have increased in China over time.====We also examine IOp heterogeneity among different age groups and birthyear cohorts. This analysis sheds light on whether IOp in China changes systematically with age, and whether IOp differs between younger and older cohorts. Ours is one of the relatively few analyses for China of IOp by birthyear cohort.====Most studies of IOp use individual earnings as the target variable. The broader literature on income distribution, however, generally uses household income per capita as the target variable. Use of household income per capita makes sense for studies of inequality because individual welfare depends not only on the individual's earnings but also on the income and economic arrangements of the household. Such is the case, for example, if household members share income, engage in joint income-earning activities such as family farming or small businesses, or allocate labor interdependently so as to maximize household income.====The use of household income per capita also makes sense for studies of IOp because the returns to individual circumstances can depend not only an individual's earnings but also the income and economic arrangements of the individual's household. For example, individual circumstances such as parental education can affect one's opportunities for marriage and household formation, which in turn influence the income and economic arrangements of an individual's household. In such situations, using individual earnings as the target variable for IOp analysis could omit important facets of the inequality of opportunity.====Such is likely the case in China, where the economics of the individual and the household are often closely intertwined. In China a large share of the population depends on income from family farming and other household businesses. Studies report that marriage choices in China are influenced by given individual circumstances such as parents' education, parents' occupation, and hukou (see, for example, ====). We note that the interconnection between individual circumstances and household outcomes is not unique to China. ====In view of these considerations, we use household income per person as the main target variable in our analysis. Nevertheless, for the base analysis we also present estimates of IOp for individual income. Comparison of the IOp estimates for household versus individual income yields some insights regarding the choice of target variable for IOp analysis.====We conduct our analysis using repeated cross-section data from the 2002, 2013 and 2018 rounds of the China Household Income Project (CHIP) surveys. In order to exclude the effects on inequality of choices regarding schooling and retirement, we restrict our sample to working-age individuals. As a consequence, our findings differ somewhat from studies of the whole population.====Turning to results, we find that IOp in China has declined. The decline is especially marked from 2013 to 2018. Furthermore, we find that the circumstance variables that are the most important contributors to IOp have changed. In 2002 region, hukou type at birth, and parents' characteristics were the largest contributors. As of 2018 the contributions of region, hukou at birth and parents' occupation had decreased, and that of parents' education had increased.====With respect to heterogeneity of IOp, we find that IOp is larger for the rural-born than for the urban-born. Furthermore, the importance of IOp declines with age, that is, as members of a particular birthyear cohort age, the proportion of within-cohort income inequality that can be attributed to IOp decreases. We conclude that IOp is indeed heterogeneous among groups; however, such compositional differences do not explain the decline in China's overall IOp. Instead, the decline is mainly associated with declines over time in the IOp of individual circumstance variables such as hukou type at birth and region, as well as some decline in between-group IOp.====We begin in ==== with a selective review of relevant literature. ==== discusses our methods and data. ==== reports our base results. Here we discuss changes in total inequality and IOp for China as a whole and examine the importance of the different circumstance variables. In ==== we present alternative results using individual income as the target variable and discuss how the choice of target variable affects the results. We explore heterogeneity of IOp based on hukou type at birth in ==== and based on age and birth cohort in ====. In ==== we sum up the study and draw some lessons.","Inequality of opportunity in household income, China 2002¨C2018",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001024,21-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,234

Only housing with better schools after reassignment witness a price premium. Low-priced and small houses earn more than 1000 yuan/m====, whereas high-priced and large houses are not significantly affected. The results demonstrate that future policies should ensure the rights of low-income groups to attend high quality primary school and guard against the gentrification of low-priced houses.","When public educational facilities are extremely scarce, housing often becomes the major intermediary mechanism for residents to obtain access to an educational facility. Residents are required to attend public primary schools near their houses in accordance with the Nearby Enrollment policy. As a result, houses that have access to institutions offering high-quality education are in greater demand and therefore cost more. The huge price premium brought about by better educational resources means that the local financial investment in public education is ==== of schooling (====). The capitalization effects of educational resources reflect the allocation of public goods and represent local residents' purchasing costs for public goods.====The capitalization effects referred to here can be examined from different perspectives, including the quantity (====) and quality of neighborhood education resources (====). Because people are more concerned with the quality of the specific school they will attend than the number of schools available to attend, the quality of educational resources has far-reaching significance on the development of humans and society. Hence, increased attention and relevant research on the quality of educational facilities are needed.====Notably, investigations of such capitalization effects in previous studies have been subject to endogeneity and estimation bias, caused by omitted variables and self-selection during the project placement and residential location (====; Livy & Mitchell ====). Some studies have improved these problems by using boundary fixed effects (====; ====; ====; ====), and difference-in-differences (DID) (====; ====). But the application of methodology and characterization of heterogeneity among the submarkets can still be improved. The validity of DID needs further explanation and verification, and the variation of the capitalization effects under different situations needs to be further depicted.====Therefore, this study viewed the school district adjustment (SDA) of public primary schools in Hangzhou, China in 2012 as a case to explore the capitalization effects of educational resources. It contributes to previous research by (1) emphasizing the changes in education quality brought about by policies and measuring the price effects of education quality within a policy context, (2) considering the issues of endogeneity and using effective tools to accurately identify the capitalization effects, and (3) depicting the variation of capitalization effects within different submarkets, to get a detailed policy evaluation and well-directed policy implication to tackle educational dilemmas.====This paper is structured as follows: In the first part, we introduce the purpose of this work.

Our preferred specification instruments farmers' decisions of participation in insurance by village-level intensities of promotional activities and controls for province fixed effects. We find crop insurance participation significantly reduces pesticide use intensity. The reduction effect is greater for smaller plots, older farmers, and farmers who are more risk averse.","The intensive use of pesticides in agricultural production poses a significant challenge to food safety and environmental sustainability in many countries. The intake of food associated with excess pesticides may cause a wide range of illnesses, such as acute headaches, cancer, and impaired fertility (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, excess pesticides from the application process could spread throughout the environment via the biological life cycle by contaminating air, soil, and water (====; ====). A large number of countries currently make considerable efforts to reduce pesticide use intensity.==== Managing intensive pesticide use is particularly challenging in developing countries such as China. A quarter of developing countries increased their pesticide use intensity from around 2000 to 2009, with most of them experiencing a double-digit annual growth rate (====).====Our paper examines how pesticide use intensity changes as an unintended consequence of crop insurance in China. Crop insurance could change pesticide use intensity due to moral hazard. Participation in crop insurance encourages farmers to take more risks, thus they use more risk-increasing inputs and less risk-reducing inputs. With fiscal subsidies, crop insurance is quickly expanded to support agricultural production. The number of farmers participating in crop insurance increased from 49.81 million in 2007 to 180 million in 2019.==== The fast uptake of crop insurance in China necessitates an investigation on its possible impact on pesticide use intensity.====Thus far, the empirical findings on how crop insurance affects pesticide use intensity are mixed. Although many researchers find crop insurance reduces pesticide use (====; ====; ====), many others find null or even positive effects of crop insurance on pesticide use intensity (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In addition, only a few studies have examined the effect in China. We provide a detailed review of the related literatures. The effect of crop insurance is rather heterogeneous for different chemicals in different places. Therefore, to obtain a fuller understanding of the unintended effect of crop insurance on pesticide use, context-specific studies need to be conducted.====We use micro data from eight Chinese provinces to explore the effect of crop insurance participation and find that purchasing crop insurance significantly reduces farmers' pesticide use intensity by half. We also find that the reduction effect is greater for smaller plots, older farmers, and farmers who are more risk averse. To control for endogeneity in the decision of crop insurance participation, we utilize an exogenous variation in the average intensity of village insurance promotional activities as an instrument for crop insurance decisions and control for province fixed effects. This effect is robust to different model specifications and sample restrictions.====Empirically understanding the moral hazard effect of crop insurance on pesticide use intensity is vital to the future development of China in a number of important fields, including agricultural production, food safety, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, many other developing countries are also undergoing rapid growth in the intensity of pesticide use, as well as attempting to establish crop insurance programs to help farmers manage production risks. The Chinese experience at the very least could be useful for developing countries to determine the possible effect of crop insurance programs on pesticide management.====The reminder of this article is structured as follows.

Applying the generalized difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) method, we find that LERs are effective in reducing border pollution: the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH====?N) of the border counties are 21.78% and 39.51%, less than that of the interior counties. We document that the effectiveness of LERs in reducing border pollution can be attributed to the fact that LERs require local governments to make collective decisions in fighting livestock pollution. Further heterogeneity analysis finds that the reduction effect of LERs on border pollution is greater in the downstream border and underdeveloped areas. Our paper implies that the externality of border pollution can be internalized through collective decision-making between local governments.","Rivers flow from upstream to downstream, the pollutants, but water pollution consequences by upstream areas are always borne by downstream neighbors, resulting in border pollution¡ªan excess of water pollution at the boundaries of administrative areas. Border pollution is prevalent in both developed and developing countries, resulting in considerable negative health impacts and substantial welfare loss for people who live in regional borders (====; ====; ====) since those people are more vulnerable to pollution, and bear a disproportionate environmental burden. Well-designed environmental regulations offer a vital pathway to reduce border pollution (====). However, there is little systematic knowledge about the effectiveness of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction in developing countries, let alone in the rural areas of developing countries. Considerable evidence has shown that most border regions in developing countries are rural areas with lower income (====). Understanding the role of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction in rural areas is beneficial for low-income people's social welfare enhancement (====). In this study, we take advantage of the livestock environmental regulations (LERs) in rural China as a quasi-natural experiment and use the generalized difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) model to investigate the effect of environmental regulations on border pollution.====LERs, a range of environmental regulations launched by China in 2006 to reduce livestock pollution in rural areas, provide us a perfect setting for evaluating the effect of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction. This setting is attractive for the following three reasons.====First, most border pollution occurs in developing countries, especially in rural areas of developing countries (====). China, in particular, is the world's largest developing country, with 576.61 million rural people. Billions of people are suffering the worst health burden from severe border pollutions in China (====). The border pollution control performance of LERs in China can offer valuable suggestions for other developing countries.====Second, China is the world's largest livestock producer. Livestock production in China has been found to be a major cause of water pollution, reported being the source of 46.7% of the total chemical oxygen demand (COD), 19.6% of the total nitrogen, and 37.9% of the total phosphorus in Chinese watercourses in 2020, which is higher than that from the industrial sources (====).====Third, different from individual-based and size-based LERs in developed countries, LERs in China are place-based and require the whole county as a unit to implement regulations coherently, not independently (====). Under LERs in China, the local governments can no longer act independently to fight pollution as they do in other environmental regulations; they are required to make collective decisions to reduce livestock pollution in the whole county. Therefore, the spatially differentiated implementation of LERs within a county is not allowed: the county government cannot implement more and stricter LERs in border areas. Thus, polluting livestock farms cannot relocate to the county border, which is beneficial to border pollution reduction. By conducting a quantitative analysis of the border pollution control effect of LERs, we show the effectiveness of mitigating border pollution through well-designed environmental regulations (====). Theoretically speaking, Coasian bargaining can mitigate border pollution, but in reality, it is difficult to achieve (====; ====). Our empirical findings highlight that LERs, as well-designed environmental regulations with collective decision-making, are conductive to border pollution reduction and offer another pathway for reducing border pollution, which has tremendous policy implications.====In general, we will make four main contributions to the literature. First, our study provides the first rigorous quantitative estimation, to our knowledge, of the effectiveness of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction in the rural areas of developing countries. Existing work mainly focuses on border pollution in developed countries (====; ====) or city areas (====; ====; ====). Little empirical knowledge exists in the rural areas of developing countries, despite the tremendous policy implications. Compared to developed countries, the welfare loss from water pollution is more severe in developing countries. For example, about 2.3 billion people worldwide are suffering from water-related diseases, of which 2.2 billion are in developing countries (====). Compared to non-rural people, rural people are more likely to locate in border areas and bear most of the environmental burden of border pollution (====). To fill in this gap, we study the border pollution control strategy in rural China¡ªthe world's largest developing country with nearly 50% of rural people.====Second, our paper contributes to the debate about the political economy of ¡°centralization¡± versus ¡°decentralization¡± regimes. Decentralization is often blamed for border pollution (====), while it is unclear whether a centralized regime can offer a solution to border pollution reduction (====). The existing work mostly focuses on the effect of centralized policy on economic development. Most studies regard the centralized regime as a major contributor to China's substantial economic success since the centralized government can guarantee that local governments follow the uniform rules across the country. However, little systematic knowledge is known about the impact of centralized regimes on environmental protection. Our paper complements this knowledge by showing that centralized regimes can help local governments make collective decisions and thus is effective in border pollution control.====Third, we add to the long-standing debate on the effectiveness of environmental regulations on border pollution reduction. Most studies contend that environmental regulations will lead to higher border pollution. For example, ==== found that due to the less stringent environmental regulations in Hebei province than its neighbors, polluting firms tend to concentrate close up to border counties than in interior ones in Hebei province. ==== identified the impact of the ¡°Tenth Five-Year Plan¡± environmental regulation on border pollution. They found strong evidence of border pollution: 20% more water-polluting activities occurred in downstream counties than in upstream counties. ==== took the ¡°Clean Water Act¡± in the U.S. as a quasi-natural experiment to identify the impact of environmental regulation on border pollution and found the ¡°Clean Water Act¡± leads to a 4% increase of water pollution in downstream states. However, some studies argue that environmental regulations can reduce border pollution. For example, ==== found that China's target-based environmental regulations make the polluting firms in upstream produce 57% less water pollution than their downstream counterparts. ==== found that the ¡°Twelfth Five-Year Plan¡± environmental regulation in China has reduced the ammonia nitrogen (NH====-N) of the boundary by 0.356?mg/L more, compared to the non-boundary. Our paper complements this controversy by showing that a well-designed environmental regulation with collective decision-making can offer a solution to border pollution reduction.====Our paper also makes innovation in methodology. We employ the generalized DDD method to prevent the results from being affected by endogenous problems (====; ====). All individuals in the treatment group in traditional DDD have to implement the policy simultaneously, but the implementation time of LERs in different counties is not consistent. Therefore, we use the generalized DDD method for analysis.====The paper is organized as follows. ==== describes border pollution and LERs in China. ==== lays down the theoretical framework and related hypotheses. ==== introduces the data and method. ==== provides the main results. ==== reports the results of heterogeneity analysis. ==== concludes.",Border pollution reduction in China: The role of livestock environmental regulations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000997,14-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,237

The number of migrants reaches 492.76 million in 2020, which is 34.9% of the national population and an 88.5% growth from 2010; one quarter of them are cross-province migrants (====).==== City governments have been implementing various policies to reduce migration barriers and to attract immigrants, particularly, skilled workers (====). Many determinants of city attractiveness, or urban amenities, such as weather, air quality, access to and quality of public services, become increasingly important for location decisions of migrants and firms and for urban public policy making. However, few studies available in China quantify the value of urban amenities in a unified framework. The aim of this paper is to provide the first, theory-based quantification of people's willingness-to-pay for urban amenities in Chinese cities. The results provide a ranking of cities in terms of the quality of life and will be very informative for migrants and city governments.====Quality of life refers to ¡°the satisfaction that a person receives from surrounding human and physical conditions¡± (====). Different from individual satisfaction derived from private consumption, quality of life reflects people's value for ¡°social goods¡±¡ªquasi-market and non-market goods (====). It is considered an economic good and varies largely across locations (====; ====). Urban amenities, which are location-specific goods and services that make cities attractive for living and working, are the primary determinants of quality of life in cities (====; ====). Urban amenities can be natural (nice weather, good air quality), human-made (museums, restaurants, public services), or social (tolerant social milieu, safety); they can also be utility generating to households (consumption amenities) or productive to firms.====Quality of life in cities affects directly not only individual well-being, but also location choices of households and firms, and therefore, urban growth (====; ====; ====). Take American cities as an example, cities with rich consumption amenities and nice weather also have high population density and high growth in population, employment, and housing value and rents (====; ====, ====). Both the general public and policymakers have been paying increasing attention to urban quality of life in China.====In contrast, many empirical studies have estimated the quality of life in cities of many other countries, including Canada (====; ====), England (====), Russia (====), Germany (====), Italy (====), and notably the USA (====; ====; ====; ====, ====, ====; ====; ====; ====). These studies are well grounded in the commonly accepted theory of spatial equilibrium developed by ==== and ====.====; ====).====The purpose of this paper is to apply the Rosen-Roback framework and hedonic models to quantify the quality of life in Chinese cities. We use the 2005 1% Population Intercensus Survey data, the only available micro dataset so far containing both labor income and housing costs information for all cities in China, and city amenity data to estimate the compensating differentials in wages and housing prices and rents for 287 prefecture-level cities. We then compute and rank the quality of life index for these cities. Following ====, we select three types of amenities: climate, environmental quality, and urban conditions (city characteristics). We find that the quality of life varies tremendously across cities. In general, cities with a high quality of life index are provincial capitals or the cities with nice weather, good air quality, and accessible public transit. The quality of life index is positively associated with the self-reported subjective well-being of urban residents, suggesting that urban quality of life to some degree measures happiness in cities. Not surprisingly, our ranking of quality of life in cities is very different than those not based on the economic theory.====Our findings have important public policy implications for city governments. As human capital is crucial for urban growth (====), many city governments in China have been striving to attract high-skilled workers but their policies are rather simple and narrow. The main policies are relaxing residence (====) restrictions and offering lump-sum housing or relocation subsidies (====). Since high-skilled workers have higher willingness to pay for urban amenities, our study suggests that local governments can attract talents by improving city amenities, particularly educational and public transportation services and environmental qualities.====The next section introduces briefly the intuition of the Rosen-Roback spatial equilibrium model and outlines the steps for the empirical implementation. ==== describes the data and ==== specifies the empirical models. ==== presents our evaluation and ranking of quality of life in Chinese cities and ==== concludes.",Quality of life in Chinese cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21001000,14-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,238

However, given the increase in the opportunity costs of agriculture and the high cost of AMS, further study is needed to determine the relationship between AMS and smallholder farmers' exit from agricultural production. In this paper, data from the China Family Panel Survey collected in 2017 and 2019 are used to investigate this issue. Our findings show that the development of AMS reduces the probability that smallholder farmers exit from agricultural production though land abandonment, but increases the probability through land renting-out. Further analysis shows that with the emergence of large farm operators and the increase in land size rented by large farm operators, the development of AMS induces smallholder farmers' exit from agricultural production through both land abandonment and land renting-out. We also find that AMS can increase the market demand for land transfers and the marketization of land rentals, and as land markets develop, AMS induce smallholder farmers' exit through the abandonment of fragmented and distant land plots.","Agricultural mechanization services (AMS) have developed rapidly in rural China since 2004 (====). Several studies have proposed that these services significantly improve farm productivity (====; ====), outsourcing some of the labor-intensive aspects of agricultural production not only reduces the unmanageable sunk costs of machinery for smallholder farmers (====). As mechanization inputs are usually expensive, specialist service provision has been identified as the best way forward (====).====). In contrast, the market for AMS is still underdeveloped in many African countries, such as Nigeria, even though governments there have subsidized tractor services through direct sales (====). ==== pointed out that 65% of the farm power in sub-Saharan Africa was provided by humans due to the shortage of machinery. In addition, a lack of private service providers makes AMS inaccessible to smallholder farmers, and the noncompetitive markets operating in these countries are incapable of reducing the price of AMS by imposing efficiency, and therefore fail to increase demand.====In the 2019 No. 1 Central Document, the Chinese central government identified developing social services in agriculture and accelerating the modernization of smallholder farms as important steps to consolidate and improve the basic management system in rural areas. In China, the world's largest rural-urban migration flow (====) and the reforms made to the ==== system in 2000 (====; ====) have dramatically increased the opportunity costs of engaging in agricultural production (====). Rapid rural-urban migration not only encourages smallholder farmers to rent out their farmland (Feng et al., 2010; ====; ====), but also induces land abandonment (====; ====). To consolidate the basic management system, it is considered important to develop AMS to reduce agricultural labor costs and increase farm productivity (====; ====), which may relieve the tendency of farmers abandoning the operation of their own contracted land..====However, the literature has not attended to the burden that AMS place on smallholder farmers. It seems that the high cost of mechanization services will force smallholder to abandon mechanization services (====). Moreover, large plots of land are crucial for ensuring that the machines can accomplish agricultural tasks at greater operational scales (====). In other words, AMS provide fewer benefits to smallholder farmers than to large operations. Additionally, data from the China Agricultural Products Cost-benefit Compilation of Information reveal that the average cost of mechanization services in grain production was 142.79 yuan/mu in 2016, but the net production profit was negative. On the one hand, the high cost of AMS reduces the smallholder farmers' adoption of the service (====). On the other hand, the high opportunity costs of engaging in agricultural production for smallholder farmers encourage them to migrate and then rent out or abandon farmland (====). If there is lacking well-functioning land markets and enough labor forces, abandoning farmland will become a common phenomenon (====; ====). Together, these factors increase the likelihood of farmers' exit from agricultural production.====The development of AMS can boost market demand and cultivate large farm operators. In today's China there is an emerging agrarian class (====, ====). Farm households and other entities with high agricultural capacities tend to rent farmland and engage in land scale management. Clearly, the development of AMS ensures that machinery can accomplish tasks at a lower cost for large farms (====). Meanwhile, the emergence of large farm operators can increase land rents through demonstration effects or by setting reference points in the markets (====; ====). As a result of the low operational profits from agricultural production and the high cost of AMS, renting out farmland or exiting from agricultural production is more economical for smallholder farmers who are in the process of migrating to cities.====To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between AMS and the tendency of smallholder farmers to exit from agricultural production has not been fully studied. Most researchers believe that developing AMS benefits smallholder farmers and promotes modernization in agriculture, and thus do not consider that social services in agriculture can encourage smallholder farmers to exit from agricultural production. This paper (i) examines the effects of AMS on farmers' exit from agricultural production and (ii) investigates the effects of AMS under well-functioning land markets in China. We also explore whether the development of AMS increases the market demand for land transfers and what kinds of land plots are abandoned with the development of AMS.====The statistical analysis presented in this paper is based on data from the 2017 and 2019 waves of the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) conducted by Zhejiang University. Through this analysis, we make two major contributions to the literature. First, this is a novel exploration of whether developing AMS can eliminate smallholder farmers from agricultural production, which is conducive to clarifying the natural laws of ==== and to correcting incorrect or overconfident judgments about Chinese agriculture. Second, our analysis aids in the understanding of farmers' behavior in response to the interaction of agricultural factor markets. It is well known that the development of AMS can reduce land abandonment. Unexpectedly, however, it also causes land abandonment in villages with large farm operators. The interaction of land markets and social service markets results in fragmented and distant land plots being ignored by markets during the process of agricultural modernization.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== reviews the development of AMS and the trends of smallholder farmers exiting from agriculture in China. ==== proposes a theoretical framework for our study. ==== presents the data, the variables, and the estimation strategy. ==== provides the main findings of the study and reports on robustness checks. ==== summarizes the main findings.",The paradox of developing agricultural mechanization services in China: Supporting or kicking out smallholder farmers?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000985,14-Aug-21,2021,Research Article,239

Compared with the control firms, the treated firms became more capital intensive but had declines in labor share in value added and average wage. We also find that the employment adjustment is associated with increase in the share of skilled workers in terms of engineers and technicians, but not workers with a college degree or higher."," The effect of investment tax incentives on firm investment is expected to be positive, whilst its effect on firm employment is not clear.====; ====), whilst the labor market effect of the VAT reform is understudied. This paper aims to fill this gap.====To examine the causal effects of tax incentives for firm investment on labor market outcomes, we utilise the VAT pilot reform in 2004 to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. Using a comprehensive data set on Chinese manufacturing firms during the period 1998¨C2007, we take advantage of both the industrial and regional variations of the VAT pilot reform to identify the causal effect on firm-level labor market outcomes. The treatment group is composed of firms in the pilot regions and industries that are eligible for claiming the tax incentives and the ineligible firms constitute the control group. We find that the VAT reform had positive and statistically significant effects on firm investment and capital¨Clabor ratio but a negative and statistically significant effect on employment, controlling for firm fixed effects and firm size. The treated firm also tended to have declines in average wage and labor share (i.e., the sum of wage bill and supplementary compensation to value added). We further find that the treated firms had significant increase in the shares of skilled labor, especially engineers and technicians, but not workers with a college degree or higher. These results suggest that in addition to investment, firms responded optimally to the tax reform by adjusting their labor inputs. Our findings are robust to a battery of robustness checks, including controlling for other policy changes and additional controls, and using different subsamples and alternative specifications.====Our study is closely related to ==== and ==== which examine the effect of the same VAT reform on investment, productivity, and exporting of Chinese firms.==== This paper differs from theirs by carefully examining the VAT reform effect on a wide range of firm-level labor market outcomes, including the number of employees, average wage, labor share in value added, and the different shares of skilled workers (engineers, technicians, and workers with a college degree or higher). We shed light on the important aspect of the VAT reform on firm-level labor market outcomes. To respond to the tax incentives for capital investment, firms also adjust their employment, wages, labor share, and the composition of labor inputs.====This paper also contributes to the literature in the following aspects.

Previous research has established the adverse effects of air pollution on health. However, most studies do not focus on the simultaneous effect of indoor and ambient air pollution nor its health risks to the older population. This study examines the impact of exposure to both indoor and ambient air pollution for the same individuals over time on mental health by using a nationally representative longitudinal survey for middle-aged and elderly individuals in China. We find that both indoor and ambient air pollution have an adverse effect on elderly mental health and significantly increases the likelihood of having depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the effect of indoor and ambient air pollution is associated more with less educated and females.","The adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution has drawn worldwide attention. A recent report shows that at least 95% of the world's population breathe air containing dangerous levels of pollutants (====). According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), ambient air pollution is related to 4.2 million deaths every year.==== On the other hand, even today, there are around 3 billion people who reply on solid fuels (e.g., wood, animal dung, charcoal, crop wastes and coal) as their major sources for cooking and heating. This causes 3.8 million deaths from illnesses attributable to indoor air pollution.====China has experienced rapid economic growth since the 1980s. However, this rapid industrialization has been accompanied with tremendous environmental degradation. In 2016, the WHO identified China as the world's deadliest country for ambient air pollution.==== Around 83% of the Chinese population are exposed to air that is considered either unhealthy or unhealthy for sensitive groups. Almost half of the population in China experiences levels of PM2.5 which are above the highest threshold in the United States.==== Recent studies show that ambient air pollution causes the deaths of around 1.2 million (====) to 1.6 million (====) people every year in China. On the other hand, in China, indoor air pollution also imposes a great risk to health. A recent report shows that about 1.2 million premature deaths in China are linked to indoor air pollution (====). Moreover, in 2013, people from developing countries accounted for three-quarters of the mental, neurological, and substance use disorder burden, and China alone accounted for 17% of the global burden (====). Therefore, it is important to understand whether air pollution matters for mental health, especially for the susceptible population of older adults.====The current study contributes to the literature by providing some of the first evidence on how ==== indoor and ambient air quality affects the mental health of older adults.==== Existing literature considers either the effects of ambient air quality or household air quality on mental health, but not both effects simultaneously. For instance, ====, ====, ====, and ==== focus on ambient air quality====; ==== and ==== examine the effect of indoor air quality.==== While indoor air pollution might be another important determinant for mental health when investigating the effect of outdoor air quality (and vice versa), we are among the first to examine the mental health impact of ambient air quality while controlling for a measure of indoor air quality.====Second, there is limited knowledge about the potential effects of indoor air pollution on mental health, except for ==== and ====.==== Different from these studies, which used single cross-sectional data to examine the effect of indoor air pollution, we address the potential problem of omitted variables, which are simultaneously correlated with indoor (or ambient) air pollution and mental health, by using panel data at an individual level. The panel structure of our data allows us to account for potential confounders by controlling for an array of time-varying variables and relying on within-individual comparisons using individual fixed effects.====Third, a previous study has found that ambient air pollution has no statistically significant effect on mental illness in the elderly population in China (====).==== In the current study, we adopt data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative survey that focuses on middle-aged and elderly Chinese, and find that PM2.5 has a statistically significant effect on elderly adults.====Finally, the effect of air pollution on mental health in the elderly is extremely important from a policy standpoint; indeed, it is particularly significant in the context of rapidly aging societies. Given that researchers have provided evidence on how depression incurs substantial societal costs (====) and lower quality of life (====, ====, ====), the findings of the present study provide policymakers with a better understanding of the benefits and costs of protecting the environment, especially in countries with rapidly aging populations.====Why does air pollution, both indoor and ambient, matter for the mental health of older adults? Globally, PM2.5 is the sixth highest risk factor for death in 2016 (====). Biomedical literature shows that air pollutants such as particulate matter 2.5?¦Ìm or smaller can penetrate the respiratory system, travel deeply into the lung and heart, and enter the blood circulatory system, even the brain. In addition to the particulates contained in the ambient air, household use of solid fuels generates a high degree of particulates, which are hazardous to health. In addition, deteriorated lung function, which makes it harder to filter out polluted air, and a more compromised immune system make the elderly more susceptible to air pollution. Existing studies find that PM2.5 triggers or exacerbates anxiety through inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain (====, ====) and reduced immune system function (====, ====), which could lead to occurrence of depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep impairment (====, ====).====We examine the effect of an extremely harmful ambient air pollutant¡ªPM2.5¡ªand indoor air pollution simultaneously on elderly mental health by using a longitudinal survey in China that ran in 2011, 2013, and 2015. Ambient PM2.5 is collected from satellite-based data released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Exposure to indoor air pollution is measured by whether a respondent lived in a household that used solid fuels for cooking. There are two major challenges in the current study regarding the impact of air pollution. First, there could be potential confounders correlated with indoor or outdoor air quality and correlated with mental health, for instance, better educated, wealthier, or more risk averted respondents may live in areas with better environmental conditions. Second, residential sorting that households may respond to air pollution by moving to places with better air quality or environmental conditions. To address these concerns, we explore the longitudinal feature of our data together with the unique household registration system that restricts migration in China.====The panel structure of our data enables us to address the two empirical challenges mentioned above by controlling for various time-varying omitted variables and relying on within individual comparisons. First, we collect various information on city-wide time-varying socioeconomic conditions to account for local time-varying omitted variables. Second, we use individual fixed effects in the empirical analysis to address bias through time-invariant omitted variables, such as individual characteristics of heterogeneous responses to pollution. Changes in air quality during the interview month has little to do with the characteristics of individual respondents. In addition, the system of household registration imposes constraints on migration in China.==== Our identifying assumption is that exposure to PM2.5 and indoor air pollution is as good as random after controlling for these factors.====Using a longitudinal data with individual fixed effects and controlling for a wide range of time-varying variables, we find that both indoor and ambient air pollution have adverse effects on mental well-being and the likelihood of having depressive symptoms. These results are robust even when addressing the potential confounders across different model specifications. Supplementary to the existing literature that finds adverse effects of ambient air quality on young adults, the current study uses high-quality data of Chinese residents aged 45 and older to show that both indoor and outdoor air pollution also have adverse effects on mental health for senior adults and the elderly. We further investigate the heterogeneous effects of air pollution across different socioeconomic spectra. We find that there is a larger impact of PM2.5 for less-educated respondents. Furthermore, our results across gender suggest that PM2.5 is associated with mental well-being in females but not in males, while the use of solid fuels for cooking is associated with the probability of having depressive symptoms in females but not in males. This gender result of indoor air pollution on depressive symptoms is consistent with the explanation of social factors. Finally, we find that both indoor and outdoor air pollution have adverse effects on both middle-aged adults and the elderly.====The rest of the current study is organized as follows. Section?==== explains why does air pollution affect mental health of the elderly, and describes background of air pollution in China. In Section?====, we present data of elderly health and mental health measures and air pollution data. Section?==== discusses the identification strategy.

The results show that firms in more corrupt regions are less likely to engage in cross-province M&As. Further analyses reveal that the effects of local corruption on the probability of cross-province M&As are stronger when corrupt officers have greater impeding benefits or lower impeding costs. Meanwhile, Both ex-ante intervention and ex-post punishment are?important channels through which corrupt officers hinder firms' cross-province M&As. Moreover, informal institutions, such as social capital and informal networks can help to alleviate the negative impact of political corruption on firms'?cross-province M&As.Our findings show that in the context of highly government intervention, cross-province M&As not only cannot be an effective channel to shield from expropriation, but are themselves highly distorted and lead to significant economic efficiency losses.","Political corruption is always a focus for economists and policy makers (e.g., ====; ====). However, extant literature rarely discusses the relationship between political corruption and firms' M&A decisions. Early studies mainly exploit the cross-country M&A setting and investigate the relation between the level of target country's political corruption and the bid premiums (====; ====). More recently, ==== provide the first country-specific evidence.==== Focusing on the cross-state M&As in the U.S., ==== mitigate the problem that cross-country findings are subjected to different socio-economic conditions across countries. Specifically, ==== find local corruption increases firm acquisitiveness and facilitates cross-state M&As in that corruption motivates acquiring firms to relocate assets from the high to low corruption areas, thereby shielding their liquid assets from expropriation by local officials. However, their conclusions derived from the developed capital market might not be generalized to the emerging markets with high level of government intervention. Facing the ¡°visible hand¡± and corrupt officials with almost unconstrained power, it is less likely for the local firms to successfully escape from the expropriation.====Therefore, aiming to add different evidence and mechanisms sourcing from different institutional background, we revisit the relationship between political corruption and firms' cross-province M&A behavior using Chinese data. China presents a unique and useful setting for three reasons. First, political corruption is pervasive in China. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index 2002¨C2016 by Transparency International, China has ranked around 70th in the world for corruption for a long time. In China, cases of unscrupulous officials and abuse of power are surprisingly common.==== Concurrently, Huachen and FAW, who is the undoubted industry leader, are competing intensively. Given the competitive landscape, the acquisition is very crucial for Huachen to survive the challenging stage. Unfortunately, the acquisition fails to complete due to the strong interventions and impediment from the Liaoning Provincial government and the Shenyang Municipal government.====Consistent with the above anecdote, using the full sample of proposed acquisitions by firms listed on China's two mainland stock exchanges (i.e., Shanghai and Shenzhen) from 2007 to 2016, we find that the level of local corruption is negatively associated with the probability of cross-province M&As, which contradicts ====¡¯s findings. Specifically, our DID test shows that firms in provinces highly affected by anti-corruption campaigns (i.e., more corrupt provinces) have experienced a greater increase in cross-province M&As than those in less corrupt region. This result indicate that corrupt officers set less hurdles for cross-province M&As as the anti-corruption campaign unfolds and consequently, firms' tendency to acquiring cross-province targets suppressed by local political corruption previously are largely released. The result holds after we control for firms' exposure to the cross-province business operation as well as including year, province and firm fixed effects at the same time. Furthermore, we conduct a series of robustness checks. First, we validate the parallel assumption of our DID tests and also perform the placebo analysis. Second, to further help mitigate the unobservable province-level omitted variables concerns, we rerun our baseline test using the subsample firms whose headquarters are located near the borders of neighboring provinces. Third, we enlarge our sample to all A-share listed companies regardless of whether they are engaged in an acquisition and use logit/probit model to reexamine our results. Altogether, the findings remain unchanged in these robustness analyses.====To shed some light on the potential mechanisms of how political corruption affects corporate cross-province M&As, we first explore a set of cross-sectional heterogeneity. If the political corruption indeed reduces the likelihood of cross-province acquisitions, we predict the effect be more pronounced when corrupt officers' impeding benefits (costs) are higher (lower). That is, in our DID framework, we expect to observe firms who have higher capacity to pay bribes (i.e., more impeding benefits for the corrupt officials) or lower ability to deter rent-seeking (i.e., less impeding costs for the corrupt officials) will experience a relative larger increase in cross-province M&A probability afterwards. We use firms' growth opportunities and bankruptcy risk as proxies for corrupt officers' impeding benefits. To capture corrupt officers' impeding costs, we rely on the dependence degree of corporate economic activities on local government, such as the nature of property rights and marketization degree of acquirer's headquarters. The results of cross-sectional analyses are consistent with our conjecture that the increase of cross-province M&A probability are larger for firms with higher growth opportunities (====), firms with lower bankruptcy risk (====), state-owned firms (====) and firms registered in regions that are less economically developed (====). These results confirm the importance of corrupt officers' impeding incentive in shaping the negative relation of corruption on the probability of cross-province M&As.====We further discuss the channels for corrupt officers to impede cross-province M&As. On the one hand, we find a significant decrease in the time required to complete M&As (====) and the risk of M&As (====) as well as a significant increase in the performance of M&As (====) after the anti-corruption campaign. Such effects are especially stronger for the non-local M&As compared to the local M&As. On the other hand, we show that, after a successfully completed cross-province M&A, the acquiring firms are exposed to significantly increased tax burden and remarkably decreased bank loans and government subsidies. Such effects are especially stronger in the high-corruption regions compared to the low-corruption regions. These results suggest corrupt officers impede cross-province M&As through both ex-ante intervention and ex-post punishment. As for the ex-ante intervention, the investigations or the tacit approvals from multiple government departments are the essential premise for the non-local M&As in China. Therefore, corrupt officials can intentionally extend the acquisition completion time by ¡°buck passing¡± and this will largely increase the risks and uncertainty of cross-province M&As as well as dampening the M&A performance, which consequently discouraging companies located in their jurisdictions to propose cross-province M&As. With respect to the ex-post punishment, because the Chinese government has a handful of economic resources needed for business operations, the purposely resource reduction towards cross-province acquiring firms consists of a strong deterrent to the rest of companies who may want to engage in non-local M&As in the future.====At last, we exclude some potential alternative explanations, namely the unwilling to leave hypothesis and the ==== pressure hypothesis. More importantly, we further explore the role of informal institutions on the relationship between political corruption and the probability of cross-province M&As. We find that the probability of cross-province M&As increase relatively less when firms are registered in regions with high social capital (i.e., the social trust and clan) and when firms have informal social networks (i.e., the nonlocal independent director). These findings imply that the cross-province M&A demands of these companies are relatively less depressed by political corruption, and the informal institution can make up for the weakness of the formal institution to a certain extent and help companies to achieve long-term development.====Our paper contributes to the literature from three perspectives. First, our findings add on to the literature studying the relationship between political corruption and firms' M&A activities. Prior research are mainly cross-country studies and focus on the effects of the local corruption on firm targetiveness. We differ from these studies by providing country-specific evidence and focusing on the impact of the acquiring firm's local corruption level on its cross-region M&A decisions. The closest paper to ours is ====, who provide the country-specific evidence of the relationship between political corruption and cross-region M&As for the first time, using data of the cross-state M&As in the U.S. However, we alleviate the potential endogenous concern by taking advantage of the external shock brought out by the anti-corruption campaign in China. More importantly, our findings are opposite to ====, thus emphasizes the role of different institutions on the mechanisms and directions of the relationship between political corruption and cross-region M&As. This paper therefore complements to ====, as well as serving as a valuable reference point to China, and other emerging markets and transition economies in which the institution is different from that of the US where the market dominates.====Second, we provide and test the mechanisms of political corruption and cross-province M&As. On the one hand, we provide extensive cross-sectional evidence, showing that the net benefits grabbed by corrupt officials constitute an important factor on the negative relationship between political corruption and cross-province M&As. On the other hand, we explicitly point out the mechanisms of how corrupt officials obstruct cross-province M&As from the perspectives of ex-ante intervention and ex-post punishment. Therefore, we extend the literature on the role of political corruption in cross-province M&As.====Third, we discuss the roles of social capital and informal social network. The ¡°China Miracle¡± occurred in the context of imperfect formal institution, and the informal institution is regarded as a great contributing factor to this success. To this regard, this discussion not only is helpful for understanding the role of informal institution in the economic transition in China, but also provides important lessons to other emerging markets and transition economies which also lack perfect formal institution.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops two competing hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data, sample, and variable construction. The main results are presented in Section 4. Additional tests are reported in Section 5.

The reform moving the RMB to a managed float system caused significant revaluation of the RMB. Using the regime shift in the RMB exchange rate as a policy experiment, we empirically investigate the influence of the wealth effect on the transaction outcomes of Chinese foreign buyers in Singapore's private housing market. In a difference-in-differences (DID) setting with the unit housing price as the dependent variable, we find significant price premiums of 3.42% in housing purchases by Chinese foreign buyers relative to other foreign buyers after Chinese foreign buyers experienced positive income shocks in 2005. The unit housing price outcome shows incremental effects, which are associated with the WTP by Chinese foreign buyers, rather than the quantum effects associated with consuming more housing (buying multiple houses or a larger house) after experiencing wealth effects. We find evidence suggesting that price premiums are correlated with conspicuous motives, where Chinese foreign buyers show stronger preferences for housing units with more visible attributes, such as high-floor units, large units and luxury (more expensive) units, where the premiums paid by Chinese foreign buyers are estimated at 11.0%, 7.25% and 4.62%, respectively, for these units relative to the prices paid by other foreign buyers.====The results withstood a slew of robustness checks, which include using placebo time for the treatment shocks, controlling for the spatial-selection bias, seller and buyer selection bias, and with counterfactual tests using other non-Chinese foreign buyers. We also test for heterogeneity in the outcome and find significant conspicuous motives among Chinese foreign buyers who are owners or occupiers, but not among those who purchase for investment purposes. To signal housing wealth, we do not just use ¡°have¡± and ¡°have not¡± a house in our identification; instead, conditional on having purchased a house, we show that more visible houses either have unique attributes (for example, high-floor units, large units or more expensive units)==== or are in limited supply; and that the signaling effects are enhanced in high-income neighborhoods and in neighborhoods with a large enclave of China's residents in Singapore.====We next subject our results to various falsification tests to rule out alternative explanations, such as nationality bias, ethnicity affinity, local information disadvantages, superstitious beliefs, immigration and safe haven motives. The results survive all the tests, and we find that the coexistence of wealth effects, WTP and a strong preference for housing with visible features by Chinese foreign buyers relative to other foreign buyers support the claim that income elasticity shocks induce positive housing consumption, especially buying units with conspicuous features.====Our paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we provide new micro evidence to support the existence of wealth effects on housing consumption, which adds to the macro evidence that shows cross-country variations in housing prices and consumption by ====. There are other studies that show significant wealth effects associated with changes in housing and stock prices that increase consumption (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, the early results are mixed with respect to the magnitude and the causal direction of the housing wealth effects, i.e., there are potential endogeneity concerns. Some studies challenge the identification issue of wealth effects in early empirical studies (====; ====; ====). More recent studies use micro evidence to test compositional effects in wealth changes on household consumption decisions (====; ====; ====). We address potential endogeneity concerns by using the RMB reform as an exogenous policy shock in the DID setting and disentangle differential housing purchase behaviors between Chinese foreign buyers who experience positive wealth effects and other foreign buyers who are not affected by RMB changes. Our research is related to the transmission of wealth shocks to international housing markets and indirectly adds evidence to the literature on financial liberalization and foreign capital flows (====; ====).====; ====; ====; ====; among others).==== Other studies find evidence of cross-sectional differences in consumption behaviors by race (====; ====), age (====), and gender (====), but linking consumption behavioral changes to income shocks is not obvious in early studies. Various policy shocks are used in the early studies, for example, ==== use the government's cash disbursements as income shocks to Singaporean citizens and find that such shocks have positive effects on consumption based on a unique dataset on credit and debit cards. In our study, we use the RMB appreciation after the reform to show how income shocks triggered positive WTP (intensive margin) among Chinese foreign buyers for housing with visible attributes.====Third, we shows evidence on the transition channels of income shock and conspicuous consumption motives. Current studies find significant cross-sectional variations in the consumption of luxury and visible goods (such as jewelry, clothing and cars) by race (====; ====) and by housing type (====). However, consuming luxury and visible goods alone may not reveal a signaling intention, as argued by ====, but simply show a preference for high-quality goods. By investigating the WTP of Chinese foreign buyers for ¡°visible¡± attributes relative to other foreign buyers, we show that income elasticity (wealth) shock influences consumption behaviors by increasing consumption for goods with unique attributes (scarce in supply).====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background institutions of the exchange rate reforms in China and foreign buyers in Singapore's residential market. Section 3 describes the data and empirical design; Section 4 presents the empirical results on the wealth effect, WTP and conspicuous consumption motives. Section 5 provides further robustness tests on selection issues, falsification tests on alternative explanations (nationality bias, information disadvantages, superstition beliefs, and immigration and safe haven motives), and evidence on the consumption elasticity and anticipation effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Section 6 presents the conclusions.====We collect data from the World Bank on Indonesian (IDR) and Malaysian (MDR) exchange rates against US (USD) and Singaporean (SGD) currencies around the 2005 policy experiment. According to ====, there is no significant appreciation in IDR and MYR against SGD around the policy experiment in the year 2005. Meanwhile, unlike the significant appreciation of CNY against USD, we find a trend of long-term appreciation of IDR and MYR against USD. Hence, for Indonesian and Malaysian buyers, there is no concurrent appreciation for these currencies around the 2005 reform to contaminate our baseline findings.====As a robustness test, we find there is a co-movement between the treatment group (which is identified as the rich Chinese households) and the control group after controlling for the household demographic and economic characteristics, as well as the regional and time fixed effect.

Only through production can human beings overcome scarcity. The most striking feature of an affluent society is that it can mass produce not only the final consumer goods but also all the means of mass production, such as raw materials, ====, machineries, energy, and transportation infrastructures.==== or Washington consensus.====That the Arrow-Debreu framework is only about resource allocation but not about production is a fundamental insight. However, in this article I would like to push this insight further to shed some new light on why and how production, or mass production in particular, emerged and mushroomed in the 18th¨C19th century England, the 19th¨C20th century United States, and 20th-21st century China but not in other parts of the world that shared similar geographic or ====, such as the 18th¨C19th century Netherlands, 19th¨C20th century Mexico, or 20th-21st century India.====More specifically, while Coase and Wang have pointed out in their article the limitation of the Arrow-Debreu paradigm, they have not gone far enough to provide an answer to their insightful question regarding why China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse and the largest trading partner of most countries in the world in merely 40?years.====To proceed, we need first to point out that their insight about the limitation of the Arrow-Debreu paradigm is in line with Ronald Coase's (====Coase's classic argument (answer) to this fundamental question is that firms emerge because they can internalize and reduce the transaction costs of the market, which may be too high for individuals to overcome but can be overcome collectively by an organized group of individuals. In other words, firms will not emerge if market transaction costs are too small or nonexistent; and hence the optimal size of the firm must be proportional to the size of the market transaction costs.====But such a theory of the firm, as insightful as it is, cannot explain the English Industrial Revolution, nor can it account for the miraculous growth of China, such as the emergence of Huawei and Alibaba.====But to explain the emergence of large factories based on the Coase transaction theory, one would have to assume or hypothesize that the magnitude of market transaction costs had increased so dramatically in 18th century England that it became profitable for capitalists to dramatically expand the scale of production to internalize (or reduce) the ever increasing market transaction costs. This assumption would then also imply that the lack of industrialization in poor developing countries must be due mainly to the ==== of colossal market transaction costs, thus making the emergence of large firms unnecessary or not worth the while to internalize the supposedly ¡°tiny¡± or ¡°negligible¡± transaction costs.====Obviously, such implications make no sense. In fact, market transaction costs right before and during the British Industrial Revolution had been declining dramatically and persistently thanks to the great voyages pioneered by European powers during colonization and the consequent rapid buildup and expansion of the English shipping infrastructure and distribution networks, as well as to the rapid development of the English credit and ==== institutions to raise capital to finance wars (Pomeranz, 2000). Yet, despite the centuries of persistent and rapid reductions in market transaction costs for domestic and global trade and commerce, the size of English firms kept increasing instead of decreasing, contradicting what the Coase theory would have predicted.====In contrast, market transaction costs are formidable in poor developing countries due to the lack of political stability, social trust, basic infrastructure, and distribution networks, let alone the credit system to facilitate long-distance trade; yet no large firms have emerged to internalize such large transaction costs.====Why? Because the fundamental nature of the firm is NOT only to internalize market transaction costs, but also to increase the scale of production through organization and the division of labor, which are limited by the extent of the market (====). That is, the fundamental determinant of the size of a firm is the size of the market, not the size of the market transaction costs. In fact, when market transaction costs are large, the market is small, so the scale of production must be necessarily small as well. English firms enjoyed access to a global market paved by its predecessors including the ocean empires of Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, as well as by the powerful English navy, chartered oversea companies, and parliamentary mercantilist industrial policies.====So, large English firms emerged in the late 18th century to meet the demand of the expanding global commerce, not to internalize the supposedly increasing international transaction costs in trade. In contrast, firms in today's developing countries are confined to their anarchic and isolated local markets consisting of poor villagers with limited purchasing power due to the lack of powerful market creators.====In other words, the absence of large firms or the lack of incentives to adopt mass-production technologies or to form industrial clusters in agrarian societies is not because market transaction costs are so low such that there is no need for firms or industrial clusters to emerge (as implied by the Coase theory). Rather, if mass-production firms and supply chains do not exist in poor countries, it must be due to the lack of a mass market itself because of prohibitive transaction costs¡ªe.g., due to the lack of political stability, social trust, a credit system, distribution networks, and transportation infrastructure. ====.====Hence, the emergence of large firms and industrial clusters has always been a response to and the consequence of the emergence of a large market, which was true in 18th¨C19th century England, in the 19th¨C20th century United States, and also in post-1978 China.====In short, the lack of firms by no means implies the lack of market transaction costs, but rather ====.====Therefore, to explain the Industrial Revolution in general (or the lack of one in some countries) and the rise of China in particular (or the persistent ==== in Egypt and India), one must first explain the emergence of the mass market itself in the 18th century England or 20th century China.====In this article, I will take the stand that the so-called ¡°market¡± is a fundamental public good that provides the platform for commerce and trade to take place. This platform evolves in distinct stages and has three pillars to support it: political stability, social trust, and infrastructure. As I point out in my recent book (====), ¡°====.¡±====Therefore, the lack of industrialization in any nation seems on the surface to be due to the lack of mass production or mass supply (as Coase and Wang pointed out in their article), but is in fact due to the lack of a mass market, which in turn is due to the lack of market creators, as we will see below.====Clearly, since the mass market is a public good to support mass production, the state is then one of the most critical creators of the mass market. That is, creating a market requires state capacity and appropriate industrial policies.====The government sets the stage (platform) so that actors (firms) can play. Industrial policies are crucial because the mass market has internal spatial-temporal structures. Hence, creating a mass market is like synthesizing a high-dimensional chemical compound; it requires not only key ingredients but also correct steps or the right procedure. As I point out in my book (====), ¡°====¡±====Industrialization is a lengthy process that unfolds sequentially in history. It can be divided into several key stages: (i) proto-industrialization; (ii) first industrial revolution; (iii) second industrial revolution, and (iv) the welfare stage based on an affluent society that can mass produce everything. Each stage requires its corresponding platform and associated social-political-economic infrastructure for larger and more sophisticated firms and industrial clusters to emerge.====More specifically, proto-industrialization features massive numbers of workshops in rural or urban areas with small-scale production of basic consumer goods for long-distance trade; the first industrial revolution features mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods for domestic and international markets, based on the large-scale factory system; and the second industrial revolution features mass production of the means of mass production, especially of capital-intensive heavy industrial goods such as machinery, equipment, energy, and infrastructure.====The first stage is very primitive but extremely important, yet it has been largely ignored by development economic theories and theorists. During this primitive, initial stage, rural farmers or poor households in urban areas use their spare time to manufacture simple products to engage in long-distance trade. This primitive concentration and specialization of idle labor raises incomes and nurtures the formation of an increasingly unified market with primitive production networks while also developing industrious spirits and labor skills.====During the second stage, large-scale factory systems become prevalent in ==== such as textiles, processed food, toys, and furniture. This mass-production stage is labor intensive and export oriented, which benefits from poor countries' comparative advantage in organized cheap labor. Mass production in this stage is profitable only because proto-industrialization in the initial stage created a large enough market and distribution networks for light consumer goods as well as the associated income level or purchasing power.====Finally, the expansion of light industries and distribution networks in the second stage facilitates the formation of more-sophisticated and large market demand for heavy industrial goods¡ªsuch as trucks, automobiles, highways, railroads, coal, steel, metals, electricity, power plants, machinery, refined oil, chemicals, and all sorts of heavy equipment. This occurs not only because the income of workers becomes high enough to purchase big-ticket items such as automobiles, but also because mass production of heavy industrial goods is profitable only after light industries and their associated supply chains and distribution networks create a mass demand for machinery, advanced transportation, and other heavy industrial goods. In other words, heavy industrial goods are capital intensive and must also be mass produced on a large scale to be profitable, which requires a market that is far more massive, far more sophisticated, and far more unified than the mass market for light consumer goods.====The essence of this sequential developmental process is to gradually deepen and expand the size of the market to support the mass production of more and more sophisticated and capital-intensive industrial goods and thus fully exploit the economies of scale. This sequential process overcomes the problems associated with technology barriers and the lack of skilled workers and savings and organizational capital encountered by many developing countries at various developmental stages. Through this developmental process, the industrial structure and networks becomes more and more specialized, roundabout, and capital intensive.====In what follows, I will discuss in detail how a mass market to support mass production was created step by step in China after Deng Xiaoping's economic reform, and make some comparisons to the experience of other successful or failed nations in their attempt at industrialization, including the English Industrial Revolution itself.",China's industrial revolution: A new perspective,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000894,24-Jul-21,2021,Research Article,245

Our findings survive the consideration of selection bias, omitted-variable bias, and spatial correlation. Policy implications of our findings are also discussed.","Place-based policies that target underperforming regions have been a subject of much discussion among policy-makers and scholars (====; ====). On the other hand, ====, among others, theoretically shows that such policies can be a sign of waste. An additional concern about place-based policies is that they can generate large distortions in economic behavior (====). Despite theoretical accounts of the costs and benefits of place-based policies, empirical works quantifying the impact of such policies on economic behavior are relatively scarce.====Cancellation of China's national poverty counties program (NPC), a place-based policy, provides an opportunity to quantify the impact of a place-based policy's (1) implementation and (2) winding down on the economic behavior of county governments. In the 1980s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, but it is now one of the best performers in reducing poverty. The NPC has been pivotal in reducing poverty since its implementation in 1994. NPC counties have continued to be lifted out of poverty in recent years, and as a result, the program has been gradually eliminated since 2016.====Cancellation of the NPC (CNPC) provides us with unique regional variation, together with time variation arising from its execution, to estimate its impact on local governments' economic behavior. In particular, we estimate the effect of CNPC on local governments' fiscal expenditures.====To do so, we use county-level data from 2014 to 2018 to empirically investigate the extent to which changes in fiscal expenditure are due to CNPC. The data cover all NPC and contain information about fiscal revenue and expenditure, economic development indicators, industrial structure measures, etc. It should be highlighted that to establish a causal relationship between CNPC and fiscal expenditures, our priority issue is to tackle the estimation challenges caused by the endogeneity of fiscal expenditures. First, an issue of reverse causality may bias the estimation. CNPC may have caused fiscal expenditure changes but alternatively could have caused excess fiscal expenditures or deficits, and the associated demand for transferred income from the central government may have caused delays in CNPC. Second, an issue of joint determination may also bias our estimation. Both CNPC policy and fiscal expenditures can be jointly influenced by an unobserved superior factor such as regulatory power.====Our empirical strategy, a staggered difference-in-differences (DD) estimating framework, shares most advantages of using panel data and, therefore, might mitigate the above concerns. First, the reformed counties¡ªcounties that have implemented CNPC policy¡ªare selected based on external criteria in cases where less than 2% of the population (or 3% for western regions) lives below the poverty line, defined as a per capita annual income of about US$333. Hence, the time-varying nature of our DD setting ensures that the counties that implemented CNPC later and counties that never implemented CNPC are valid counterfactuals for what would have happened to earlier implementation in the absence of the CNPC reform. Second, we control for both county-fixed and year-fixed effects so that time-invariant differences across counties and differences across years (changes over time) are controlled for.====We find that the implementation of CNPC policy reduces a county's fiscal expenditure-to-GDP ratio by an average of 3.78%. This effect is unchanged when fiscal expenditure per capita or fiscal expenditure-to-revenue ratio, two alternative measures, is used. However, the implementation of CNPC has almost no effect on a county's per capita GDP or industrial activities statistically. These findings firmly indicate that the cancellation of NPC has changed the county governments' fiscal expenditure behavior while it has never transmitted to aggregate ====. On top of that, because the NPC played an important role in fostering poverty alleviation and economic development, the potential negative consequences of CNPC were once regarded as the major concern in the policy-making process. Our results show that no side effects of CNPC policy on economic conditions have been found. These findings can further contribute to the policy debate.====Because of data limitations, in this paper, we are unable to distinguish the channels through which CNPC reduces fiscal expenditure levels. We are unable to provide detailed information on exact categories of overall reductions in fiscal expenditure. However, to support an interpretation of the above findings, we shed light on two plausible channels. First, we propose that the decrease in fiscal expenditure is generated from waste (active or passive waste) of public spending. Second, based on the established theory ==== effect, we propose an explanation of the presence of the ==== effect.====This paper fits into a broader literature on place-based policies and public spending patterns. For example, the social value of place-based policies (====), the incidence and efficiency of place-based policies (====), and the waste in public purchases of goods and services (====) have been discussed in the literature.====Our paper contributes to a large literature on the effect of Chinese county-level policy reforms on socioeconomic outcomes.

However most analysis incorporates theoretical models based on the Institution-Based View or, to a lesser extent, the Resource-Based View (RBV). These highlight the importance of the macro (country) and micro (firm) level, while largely ignoring the meso (industry) level. In addition, although investments are known to have several different motivations, stimulated by quite different factors, analysis tends to focus on aggregate FDI flows. We contribute to the literature by proposing an ¡®industry-based view¡¯ of FDI which takes account of heterogeneity across industries and FDI motivation. We apply this framework to Chinese OFDI in Europe, differentiating both in terms of investment motivations and sectoral characteristics at (meso) ==== level and at (micro) firm level, in home and host countries. Using logistic and multinomial logistic models, our analysis confirms that different types of Chinese FDI (in terms of motivation) are stimulated by different industry-level characteristics in both home and host countries.","In the early years of this century, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China has rapidly become an important global phenomenon - the fourth most important source of FDI in 2019, after Japan, the US and the Netherlands (====). Although there has been extensive work on FDI by Chinese (and other Emerging Market) firms (see work by ====, ====, ====, ====), many unanswered questions remain. This paper seeks to shed light on underexplored aspects of the phenomenon, focusing on Chinese investment in Europe, where it has been widely spread across the economy. High-profile examples include Geely' s acquisition of Volvo (cars) (====), Zoomlion' s acquisition of Cifa (concrete machinery) (====), and Kuka' s acquisition by Midea (robotics) (====). In spite of the recent conclusion of the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), such Chinese FDI has sometimes been controversial (====; ====). More detailed analysis can also help to inform the wider policy debate, by providing a better understanding of the different sectoral factors that impact on the motivations of Chinese firms who invest in the EU.====The key novel aspects of our approach are, firstly, we highlight the important mitigating effect of FDI motivation. Although it is now many years since ==== highlighted that a variety of motivations underlie FDI, analyses which differentiates between them is quite limited (====; ====; ====; ====). Most research on the determinants of FDI looks at aggregate figures. These include investments with quite different underlying motivations. The fact that results of such empirical research are sometimes conflictual may be due, in part, to a failure to fully account for this heterogeneity (====).====Secondly, we highlight the importance of sectoral differences to FDI motivation. As underlined by ====, although analysis of the determinants of FDI is extensive, it has tended to focus on the macro and micro levels. There has been very little analysis of OFDI (either from China or elsewhere) at the meso level of industrial sectors.==== This is despite the fact that, building on the work of ====, it is widely accepted that the decision to invest is affected, not only by home (and host) institutions and firm-level resources, but also by the characteristics of the industry in which the firm is nested (e.g. ====). Indeed, this was the basis for of the ¡®strategy tripod' s; approach to understanding FDI proposed by ====. Nevertheless, the industry-level factors which may impact on firms' s; FDI decisions have rarely been explored in depth.====The failure to consider industry differences in most work on FDI is problematic. Large sectoral variations could be expected in the importance of different factors of production, not least technology, while governments' s; industrial policies tend to focus on promoting certain ¡®strategic¡¯ industries (====). Indeed, the few studies that have analyzed FDI across industries have highlighted important differences, especially in relation to the impact of FDI on host countries (====; ====).====This paper seeks to contribute to these gaps in the literature by exploring FDI at the meso level, highlighting how the motivations behind Chinese OFDI are affected by the industrial context of the firm. Specifically, we address the interactions between industry-level characteristics in home and host countries and the motivations for FDI. For reasons of feasibility and data availability, the characteristics we explore are not exhaustive or, indeed, symmetrical across home and host countries. Our core objective is to draw attention to the pertinence of an industry-level approach to analyzing FDI motivation and lay the groundwork for future research exploring a wider range of industry characteristics and country dyads.====The paper is structured as follows. Firstly we will explore the key theoretical approaches to FDI, especially Chinese FDI and highlight the potential of better incorporating an ¡®industry-based' s; view in this context. We then summarize the key insights, as well as inconsistencies, which emerge from existing empirical analyses of aggregate FDI from China and into the EU. Drawing on work exploring FDI motivation and sectoral factors which may impact it, we propose a series of hypotheses on the interactions between FDI motivation and industrial characteristics. We present the data and methodology used to test these hypotheses and the results of our analysis. We conclude the paper by highlighting the key findings which emerge from this work, their policy implications and the further research avenues which they open, in addition to highlighting some research limitations.","One country, many industries: Heterogeneity of Chinese OFDI motivations at meso level",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000900,21-Jul-21,2021,Research Article,247

Using 2010, 2012, and 2014 panel data from the Mutual Aid Fund for Poverty-Stricken Villages in China, we obtained results indicating the impact of land transfer on multi-dimensional poverty, based on the generalized propensity score method. The research results are as follows: (1) The intensity of rural households' land transfer in poverty-stricken villages remains low, at only 14.54%; however, it demonstrates an increasing trend. (2) When the intensity of land transfer is continuously enhanced, the multi-dimensional poverty of rural households in poverty-stricken villages decreases. (3) Rural households' land transfer in poverty-stricken villages can reduce multi-dimensional poverty by improving their savings behavior. ¡°Precautionary savings motivation¡± is an important land transfer mechanism affecting rural households' multi-dimensional poverty in poverty-stricken villages.","; ====).====With the continuous improvement of China's rural land contract system, especially the comprehensive acceleration of the ¡°three rights division¡± reform as the institutional basis of agricultural modernization, land transfer plays a more important role in poverty alleviation and development. Moreover, it has become an important method to promote the reduction of rural household poverty (====; ====). This leads to realistic and important questions with significant research value for China, such as, if China uses the multi-dimensional poverty standard, can land transfer eliminate multi-dimensional poverty? What is the possible mechanism of action?====Many scholars believe that income change is a reflection of poverty level change, and the impact of land transfer on poverty reduction is also reflected in income change (====; ====; ====; ====). Since the beginning of the 21st century, the income of farmers in China has been growing slowly, and the role of land in farmers' income is becoming increasingly obscure. The land system under the household contract responsibility system is controversial. Many scholars have proposed improving the land system by strengthening land transfer (====; ====). ==== concluded that both renting into and out of land scenarios have significant positive effects on net income. Additionally, some scholars found that land transfer was more beneficial to farmers who transferred out of land (vs. into land) to increase their income. However, ==== concluded that land transfer increased farmers' income who transferred into land. Moreover, several scholars further analyzed and identified that land transfer was beneficial as it increases farmers' agricultural operating income, per capita rental land income, and per capita employment income (====; ====).====In addition, some scholars believe that the change in poverty is not only reflected in the change in income; thus, the poverty reduction effect due to land transfer should be studied from multiple dimensions (====; ====; ==== analyzed and concluded that encouraging free land transfers and having a system that constantly improves land property rights were effective methods used to alleviate long-term poverty (====). Marketing land transfer can promote the transfer of land to more effective land managers, enhance land managers' incentives for a long-term land investment, and result in additional transaction income thus producing a productive income effect and achieving the poverty reduction goal (====; ====). Some scholars have also identified that, in addition to the productive income effect, land transfer also has a relatively large nonproductive income effect, which can further reduce poverty (====; ====).====). However, this study investigates the poverty reduction effect of land transfer intensity, which is a 0¨C1 continuous variable. As such, PSM is no longer applicable, and the existing method needs to be improved (====). Fourth, differences exist between sampling farmers in developed areas and those in poor areas, implying that farmers, as a group, are not homogeneous. For example, farmers in poor areas depend more on land. Few scholars have conducted in-depth and detailed studies on rural land transfer's poverty reduction effect in poor areas.====Therefore, based on the above research findings, this study constructs a Ramsey¨CCass¨CKoopmans growth model of the agricultural sector, which includes land transfer characteristics, by analyzing the production and consumption behaviors of farmers and investigates the theoretical basis of the impact of land transfer on multi-dimensional poverty, under a steady equilibrium. Furthermore, to verify the theoretical inferences, this study constructs a matching empirical analysis. We use 2010, 2012, and 2014 tracking panel data from the Mutual Aid Fund for Poverty-Stricken Villages in China to estimate the intensity of land transfers. This study covers five provinces: Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Hunan, and Gansu, with 10 counties and cities, covering 1128 farmers from 50 poverty-stricken villages. We also obtain multi-dimensional poverty indicators using the entropy method. Moreover, we obtain the estimation result of the land transfer impact on multi-dimensional poverty, based on the generalized propensity score method.====Compared with previous research, this study primarily contributes to the following. First, we attempt to integrate land transfer into the Ramsey¨CCass¨CKoopmans growth model for the agriculture sector, as an endogenous variable, under the classical growth framework of new classical economics. Subsequently, we innovatively discuss the impact of land transfer on multi-dimensional poverty, which enriches theoretical research on land transfer's poverty reduction effect. Second, previous studies have largely considered farmers only in terms of ¡°whether involving land transfer or not,¡± which is a binary discrete variable. However, in this study, this variable is treated with a 0¨C1 continuous variable, considering that farmers may transfer only a part, rather than all, of their land. We design the formula of ¡°land transfer intensity¡± to measure the intensity of rural households' land transfer, which effectively solves for missing rural households' partial land transfer.====Third, we used the Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) in this study to account for shortcomings of previous models and methods in dealing with endogeneity issues and the application of PSM only to the case where the core variable is a binary discrete variable. This method can effectively accommodate a situation in which the core variable is a 0¨C1 continuous variable. Moreover, we analyze the impact of rural household land transfer intensity in poor areas on multi-dimensional poverty, which optimizes the ==== and method used in previous studies. Fourth, considering the regional heterogeneity of farmers' land transfer influence, this study adopts the panel data from the Mutual Aid Fund for Poverty-Stricken Villages in China, which has strong representativeness and high credibility. This study's conclusions and suggestions provide not only ideas and methods for farmers' land transfer in poor areas but also references for those in other provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) of the same character.====The remainder of this paper is principally arranged as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed analysis of the land transfer mechanism affecting farmers' multi-dimensional poverty. Section 3 specifies the sources of survey data, accurately identifies the land transfer situation of poverty-stricken village farmers, and designs and calculates the formula for ¡°land transfer intensity.¡± Section 4 constructs an econometric model using GPS and selects relevant variables to analyze the multi-dimensional poverty experienced by rural households in poverty-stricken villages, with varying intensities of land transfer. Section 5 analyzes the estimation results and presents the robustness test and heterogeneity analysis. Section 6 provides the mechanism analysis and discusses the possible mediating effects in the estimation results. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the research conclusions and proposes relevant suggestions.====Step 1: Effectively estimate the conditional distribution function that corresponds to the intensity of rural households' land transfer in poverty-stricken villages. The distribution of rural households' land transfer intensity in poverty-stricken villages is biased, and a logit distribution function can be used to describe this special distribution feature. This study then further assumes that for any observed poverty-stricken village farmer ====, the conditional expectation formula of the continuous treatment variable ==== can be obtained, as long as the covariates ==== are given:====where 0?¡Ü?====(====)?¡Ü?1. ====(?) is further assumed as a cumulative distribution function of the logit distribution, as shown in Eq. (A.2):====Eq. (A.2) is a nonlinear equation. Using the fraction logit model proposed by ====, to obtain the probability density of land transfer intensity. Furthermore, ==== can be obtained based on the quasi maximum likelihood estimation. The formula is as follows:====After obtaining ====, we can calculate the probability density (GPS) of the corresponding land transfer intensity of the rural household ====, as shown in Eq. (A.4):====Step 2: We list the conditional expectation formula of the outcome variable ====, and express it as a function of land transfer intensity ==== and its probability ====. The following is the formula:====Step 3: ==== can be obtained using Eq. (A.5), and the response function (known as average dose-response function) corresponding to the land transfer intensity of rural households in any poverty-stricken village can be acquired using ====:====where ==== represents rural households in poverty-stricken villages and ==== represents the density function of ====. ==== represents the expectation corresponding to the outcome variable when the land transfer intensity of rural households in poverty-stricken villages takes any ====, where step length is set as 0.01, ====?=?0, 0.01, 0.02¡­, 0.99, 1. Notably, a difference exists between ==== and ====. ==== is the intensity of land transfer, based on the step length set, whereas ==== is the actual intensity of land transfer. Therefore, part of ==== can be easily found to be consistent with ====, and part of ==== does not exist. If it exists, the corresponding GPS can be obtained, based on ====. If it does not exist, the corresponding GPS can be obtained based on ==== in the counterfactual framework.====Simultaneously, Eq. (A.6) has shown the average impact of different land transfer intensities on multi-dimensional poverty. This means that we can then compare the multi-dimensional poverty of rural households in poverty-stricken villages under different land transfer intensities. The following formula is used:====Eq. (A.7) is commonly called a treatment effect model. Based on the research needs of this study, we can compare the average impact on rural households' multi-dimensional poverty in poverty-stricken villages, when land transfer intensity is 0 and when land transfer intensity is not 0. In short, we will specify the situation in Eq. (A.7) in which ==== is equal to 0 and ==== is not equal 0. Eq. (A.7) then becomes Eq. (A.8):====Eq.

By linking to Google Patents, we compile a comprehensive set of patent quality indicators. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 1995 to 2010, we find that the effect of the implemented patent subsidy policies on quantity, as well as various quality metrics of patents, was significantly positive. Moreover, the explanation power of subsidy policies on both patent quantity and quality diminished as time goes by. We also find that the effect of these policies depended on the growth rate of experienced innovators rather than entrants. Since the implemented policies we study in this paper were designed to focus on subsidizing expenses incurred during the patenting process, our results show that the provided partial funding led the way for improving China's patent quality.","From the perspective of public policy, if the impact of subsidy policies on the quality of patents can be estimated more accurately, then it will be much more useful for policymakers to understand the effectiveness of the implemented policies and design ones that raise the quality of patents and nurture creativity. We find that the implemented patent subsidy policies were designed to only subsidize expenses incurred during the patenting process and did not cover R&D expenditures during the pre-patenting stage. Thus, is it possible that such partial funding implies the possibility of local governments only leading the way for improving patent quality rather than being the main driver?====Why do we care about the resulted Chinese patent quality in China's effort to promote technology innovation? First, patent quality indicators are important metrics of invention outputs besides patent quantity measures. Patent quality can help reveal research efficiency, and provide more insights for innovation capacity, technological change, and productivity growth. If the quality of Chinese patents has kept pace with the increase of its volume, then it is possible that China is transforming herself from a technological follower to a technological leader and is achieving its goal of catching-up with developed countries. Second, some assert that although China is ramping up its patent applications, their value is questionable. As a matter of fact, unlike other patent offices which have well-documented data on patent qualities, CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Administration, previously known as SIPO) releases very limited information for the quality of its patents. If we can provide some remedies to these data drawbacks, then the question over Chinese patent quality can be better addressed. Third, it is obvious that innovators have to confront much higher uncertainty and use more research input to produce patents of good quality. Therefore, to reduce the market failure in innovation, more incentives should be given to the quality of patents, rather than the quantity of patents.====This paper makes two key contributions. Our first contribution is to provide a multi-facet toolbox for assessing China's patent quality based on a unique and comprehensive database. By linking the Chinese patent database (released by CNIPA, 1985¨C2012) with Google Patents database==== containing forward citations and claims, our database not only overcomes the shortcoming of CNIPA data, but also allows us to analyze multiple patent quality metrics. We build upon ==== and separate the quality of patents into technological quality (including forward citations, claims, and the number of inventors) and economic quality (including withdrawal rate and renewal rate). Our second contribution is to evaluate the impact of patent subsidy policies on the quality of China's invention patents using two-way fixed effects regression as our identification strategy. Based on provincial panel data from 1995 to 2010, we find that the effect of patent subsidy policies by provincial governments on the technological quality of Chinese patents was significantly positive, whereas the effect on the economic quality of Chinese patents was inconclusive. Moreover, we find that the overall effect of patent subsidy programs on patent quantity and quality growth diminished as time goes by, indicating that the effect of the implemented programs on the growth of patenting innovation was not long-lasting.====We also made two discoveries in this paper. Our first discovery is to find the relative importance of the dynamic effects of government subsidy. We separate the impact of government subsidy programs into short-run adjustments (or shocks) and long-run (or persistent) impacts. We find that it takes time for the effect of subsidy programs to stabilize. Short-run adjustments on both quantity and (technological) quality takes at least five years to approach the long-run impact. Our second discovery is to find the special role played by experienced innovators in China. Our results demonstrate that the effect of patent subsidy policies on the technological quality of patents depended on the growth rate of experienced innovators, rather than the growth rate of entrants. Our discoveries pointed to the possibility of the government only leading the way for building innovation capacity. The enduring growth in quality originated more from the innovators themselves, especially experienced innovators.====We contribute to an important stream of research on examining patent quality by providing a comprehensive set of useful measures for Chinese patents. Since Chinese patent data have no commonly used indicators of patent quality, several attempts have been made to reflect the quality characteristics of Chinese patents using other metrics. The pioneering work of ==== used patent grant rate to show the dynamic changes of Chinese invention patent quality from 1998 to 2006, while ==== analyzed the invention patent quality of Chinese industrial enterprises using the number of nouns in patent claims. Some studies were based on patent renewal period data to track the economic value of Chinese expired invention patents, such as ==== and ====. Studies that used forward citations were compiled from patents filed abroad. From the PATSTAT database, ==== used the number of forward citations received by 155 Chinese leading universities from 1991 to 2009, and ==== used citation lag of a small stratified sample of China's invention patents with priority years between 2000 and 2010. However, we think that adopting a simple quality indicator of patents or relying on a selected sample of patents filed abroad is not sufficient to provide information about the overall quality features of inventions in China. To reduce the measured variance in quality and overcome the drawback of Chinese patent data, we collect information on claims and forward citations using Google Patents. In addition, we use multiple indicators, including the number of inventors, withdrawal rate, and renewal rate, to analyze the dynamic quality features of Chinese invention.====We also contribute to another important stream of literature focusing on the influence of government subsidy on the explosive surge of patents in China. Previous studies have found that the explosion of patent filings at CNIPA was driven by factors other than underlying innovative behavior (====; ====), including government subsidies that encourage patent filings directly (====; ====). Similar results were found using Chinese industrial enterprise patenting data (====). Although ==== found that subsidy programs promoting research excellence were a significant driver of patent quantity and quality, their study covered only the top 155 universities in China. Unlike the prior studies which largely focused on the impact of patent subsidy programs on the rise of patenting volume, this paper provides a systematic framework to investigate whether and how the patent subsidy policies influence the quality of patented innovations in China. Thus, we fill the gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive examination of the influence of policy on patent quality.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section?==== reviews the measurement of patent quality and shows the summary statistics of the quality features of invention patents in China.

We estimate the impact of the railway on domestic trade through forward linkages using an Eaton-Kortum model with county-commodity level data in Shandong and Hunan provinces in 1933. We show that the railway significantly decreased the trade cost and improved bilateral trade in Hunan and Shandong provinces. In particular, for every 10% decrease in geographical distance, the value of bilateral trade increased by 8.98%. In addition, our results on the existence of provincial border effect in Hunan and the disappearance of it in Shandong, imply that the emergence of railway contributed to the removal of provincial border effect. Furthermore, we find that counties with railway connections had higher per capita output, especially for those with a larger manufacturing sector. Our results echo those found in Andrabi and Kuehlwein (2010) and Donaldson (2018) for British India and P¨¦rez-Cervantes (2014) for the US."," However, scholarly studies using more refined data report mixed messages. For instance, the seminal and influential contribution of ==== showed that in contrast to the impression of the populous, the economic gains from the railway in the US were very limited. More recently, ==== quantify the historical impact of railroads on US agricultural sector in 1890 using the market access approach and find that the value of agricultural land increased by 60% between 1870 and 1890 for areas connected to railroads. ==== shows that railroads increased US output by 9% in the 19th century mainly due to trade cost reduction. Using archival data from colonial India, ==== finds that real agricultural income in districts connected to the railroad network rose by approximately 16% on average between 1870 and 1930.====Railroad construction started in China in late imperial time as a combined effort of the government led self-strengthening program and market investment driven by commercial interests. By the end of the Qing dynasty, several important railways had been constructed in China proper, such as the Peking-Mukden line, the Peking-Hankow line, the Canton-Kowloon line, and the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria, etc. However, despite the handsome profit earned by the railway companies and dramatic change of lifestyle along with the introduction of the railroad, early observers and researchers showed pessimism and claimed that either the reduction of transport cost brought by the railroads was less than anticipated or the role it played in economic development was limited. For instance, ==== and ==== compare the economic impact of railroads between the West and East Asia and find that railroads in China were unsuccessful by a large count. Recent studies using the market access approach also indicate that the role of railroads in modern China was limited (====; ====).====After the downfall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, a small but significant modern sector based on factory production started to grow at rates well over 2% and lasted until the Japanese invasion of 1937 (====). This industrialization centered on the treaty ports and several important open cities in China. Railway investment finds its way to fill the gap between those treaty ports and vast hinterland where both input materials and final product demand rested on. Indeed, several authors find that railroad infrastructure contributed to the development of industries and regional economy (====; ====; ====). It should be noted, however, that the forward linkages of railroads may crucially depend on the development stages. For instance, ==== estimate the distribution of welfare effects of domestic trade between treaty ports in 1904 and find that the differences in productivity across regions were relatively low in the 1900s. However, what has been less clear is whether the forward linkages in the subsequent periods were more pronounced and went beyond the treaty ports and open cities, particularly during the 1930s when the industrial sector flourished. The current paper aims to fill this gap.====Despite some sporadic scholarly efforts on railroads' impact on interregional trade and intra-provincial trade in China, quantified conclusions can hardly be convincingly inferred due to the lack of rigorous approaches in the existing literature. For instance, some of these quantitative analyses abstracted away railways from transportation networks by merely viewing them as a dummy variable or some lines in space (====; ====; ====; ====). Earlier works using non-structural models and insufficient control variables made the estimated coefficients vulnerable to the counter-argument.====This paper explores the effect of railroads on intraregional trade using a modified ==== model (henceforth referred to as the ====-==== model). In the empirical part of the paper, we compile bilateral commodity-level trade data from the Industrial Gazetteer of China series (====) in 1933 (====) to estimate the coefficient of comparative advantages in these two provinces. The 1930s saw a boom of both governmental and scholarly efforts in social economic surveys. Unfortunately, domestic trade data was scarce throughout the Republican era. The ====, as a rare exception, published in October 1935 by the Ministry of Industries (==== was involved in the compilation of Hunan and Shandong provinces in which county-level pairwise trade statistics at commodity level is reported. The trade report of Hunan and Shandong provinces even listed the name of bilateral trade goods, trade values, the origin and destination information which enables one to fit a commodity level trade model.====Using an ====-==== model of Ricardian trade, we estimate the effect of railway on county-commodity level trade. In particular, we construct a least-cost spanning network to generate the least-cost routing between any two counties in the study. Our study is among the first ones using a rigorous quantification approach to shed light on the role of the railway in modern China when market-driven industrialization began to takeoff. Our model is robust against the variations of a range of settings (such as tariff liberalization or road construction) in which the welfare benefits of trade-cost-reducing policies might be sought.====Our theory based empirical analysis of Hunan and Shandong provinces offers the following conclusions. First, the railway decreased the bilateral trade cost. Compared to alternative modes of transportation, such as waterway and road, the railway played an important role in reducing effective distance. Second, the railway facilitated bilateral county-level trade. In particular, for every 10% increase in geographical distance, the value of bilateral trade decreased by 8.98%. The bilateral trade activity in counties with railway connections was significantly higher than that of counties without the railway. Third, in contrast with the claims in the existing literature that the role of the railway in promoting inter-provincial trade was limited, our findings show that a clear provincial border effect existed in these two provinces, especially the border effect in Hunan. Fourth, we show that railways substantially raised welfare which is defined as the per capita output at the county-level, and this is particularly pronounced for counties with higher shares of manufacturing.====This paper contributes to a rich literature concerned with the transport cost. The theoretical models on the effect of transport cost on trade can be traced back to ==== provide a Ricardian comparative advantage foundation for the decades-old gravity models and gained tremendous popularity in the trade literature. The trade cost then has been often examined in subsequent theoretical modeling attempts such as ====, ====, ====, 2011), and ====. In the empirical literature, disproportionately more research quantified the impact of international transport cost reduction on international and domestic trade (e.g., ====; ====, ====, ====; ====; and ====). There are, however, several noteworthy papers that study the impact of domestic transport cost variation on interregional and international trade including ==== and ====.====This paper also contributes to a growing literature on the estimation of the economic effects of large infrastructure projects. For example, ==== estimates the impact of electrification on labor force participation in South Africa; ==== estimate the effect of dam construction in India on agriculture; and ==== estimates the effect of the US interstate highway system on the skilled wage premium. Earlier literature, beginning with ==== and ==== use calibrated general equilibrium models to study the impact of railways on the antebellum US economy.====The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data, and in particular, our construction of a least-cost spanning network inclusive of all transport means. Section 3 presents an ====-K gravity model and the empirical specifications.

We introduce a newly developed method, that is, bunching estimation based on ","This study investigates the distortion of government disclosure on air pollution and further explores underlying political incentives that drive such distortion. The literature thoroughly evaluated the effects of environmental pollution on individual health, firm behavior, and social welfare.==== However, an emerging body of studies documented that environmental data disclosure has been manipulated. ==== is among the first to document the manipulation of air pollution data in China, and ==== further quantify the degree of manipulation with a censored maximum likelihood approach. Recently, ==== examine the effect of automatic air pollution by monitoring the reported PM10 concentrations in China. From the great progress in identifying the manipulation of air pollution, the present study attempts to complement the literature by evaluating the potential role of political incentives. In addition, our work furthers the understanding of how the evaluation mechanism of governance shapes government environmental information disclosure.====China provides us a unique opportunity to investigate local government incentives for environmental protection. First, its environmental pollution is severe and has significant heterogeneity. Although China has experienced rapid economic growth in the past decades, 57 of the 100 most polluted cities in the world in 2018 are located in China.====). Although economic growth remains the most important objective for the central governments, China has highly focused on the issues of environmental protection and green gross domestic product (GDP).====The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) began publishing the daily air pollution index (API) of major cities in 2000. Then, the API was introduced into the performance evaluation of local governments in 2003. In particular, by defining a day with API equal to or less than 100 as a blue sky day, cities with at least 80% blue sky days in a calendar year are qualified for the ¡°national environmental protection model city¡± award (====), which is in turn helpful for government leaders' promotion.====). Therefore, examining whether distortions exist in environmental information disclosure of local governments is ultimately an empirical issue. Moreover, we believe that the answer to this question is fundamentally important to economists and policymakers given the externalities of public environmental information.====Recently, ==== and ==== examine the discontinuity of API data distribution and find supportive evidence for the manipulation in the air quality data in China. However, their estimations are based on ====, who aims to evaluate the discontinuity of variable distribution at the aggregation level. The McCrary test can neither identify causality without a counterfactual benchmark nor estimate the magnitudes of distortion (i.e., the agencies' behavior distortion because of institutional notch). Thus, we imply that examining the potential distortion across different regions and times is less flexible. Accordingly, without a precise estimation of behavior distortions of agencies at the individual level, we are prevented from further investigation on the underlying driving forces of government information distortion.==== Specifically, the bunching approach estimates counterfactual distribution using samples from the bunching range, exploiting the incentive for bunching created by discontinuities in the choice set.==== We present strong evidence that a significant distortion exists in the API data with bunching estimation and subsequently calculate the distortion value of each city. Through a series of sensitivity analyses, we prove the robustness of the estimated value of distortion.====To gain a better understanding of the distortion of air pollution data, studying the incentives of local governments is necessary. The literature argued that politicians' behaviors often fail to maximize social welfare but instead reflect their goals and aspirations to maximize personal utility, consolidate power, or enable political promotion (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; (====)). Excessive emphasis on economic growth in the performance evaluation criteria of the local government leaders in China leads to distortions when local government leaders compete for promotion. Therefore, political promotion is considered an important force in understanding the behavior of local governments to push economic development and cause damage to the environment (====; ====; ====; ====; (====)). Combining the above arguments, we expect that exploring the effect of political promotion incentives on the manipulation of API can reveal the underlying mechanism behind the distortion.====In Chinese cities, mayors have the primary responsibility for the economic development and environmental governance of the cities. In an implicit rule, a mayor's probability of being promoted to a high-level position will significantly decline if the mayor has reached 57?years old (====; ====Last, we explore the effects of the 2008 political performance evaluation reform and the 2013 air quality data disclosure policy reform on the distortion caused by political promotion. In 2008, the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) was elevated to become the MEP (the predecessor of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment [MEE]), a component of the State Council. Since then, the central government has issued a series of regulations on environmental protection. The weight of environmental assessment indicators begins to constantly increase in the assessment standards for the promotion of government officials (====; ====). We expect that the 2008 reform may significantly increase the distortion in data manipulation caused by promotion incentives. Since 2013, China launched a nationwide, real-time air quality monitoring and disclosure program, which is a milestone in the progress of China's environmental regulations covering 98% of its population. The program aims to build an efficient, scientific system to monitor air quality and to publicly disclose data in real-time. This new program is fundamentally different from the previous API reporting system because the MEP could directly access and control the new monitors. Moreover, data are directly transmitted to MEP's information center in real-time to avoid manipulation by the local government. Government officials will face severe punishment if air pollution data manipulation is found in the city. Thus, we expect that the 2013 reform may significantly reduce the distortion in disclosed information of local governments. We separate the sample by these two reforms and conduct the same RDD method. We find that the political performance evaluation reform increases the API distortion induced by promotion incentives. However, the data disclosure reform significantly alleviates the distortion caused by political promotion incentives.====We contribute the literature in two ways. First, this study adds to the literature on government officials' incentive mechanisms. We reveal the positive effects of political promotion incentives for local government leaders on the distortion of air pollution data, which deepens the understanding of the effect of political promotion evaluation criteria on local government leaders' behavior. Thus, we complement the literature on the economic consequences of local politicians' incentives by highlighting the potential effects on environmental information disclosure (====; ====). Notably, such incentives are an important issue in China and other developing markets worldwide.====Second, we present strong evidence that disclosure policy with high costs could significantly discipline the government's incentive to manipulate air quality. Specifically, we show that the reform of ambient air data disclosure policy with high frequency in 2013 significantly reduces data reporting distortion, which offers a clear policy implication for regulators concerned with disciplining local governments' behaviors. That is, an efficient institutional design should better shape governmental agencies' decisions and behaviors, correcting the biased incentives of local government leaders.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 thoroughly describes the background. Section 3 explains the data. Section 4 discusses the bunching estimation and our methodology. Section 5 analyzes the empirical results and checks the robustness, and Section 6 evaluates the effects of a new policy on air quality data disclosure.

We identify significantly negative effects of gestational typhoon exposure on the educational attainment and annual income in adulthood, which also exhibit a significant gender ==== favoring the male. Despite the small culling effects from pregnancy failure and infant mortality, gestational typhoon exposures increase the probability of having a younger sibling and shorten the subsequent birth interval. Typhoon damage to the health and economic abilities of adults, as well as the local economy indicates a channel of household economic status for the reduced long-run socioeconomic outcomes.","Natural disasters, such as droughts, earthquakes, and tsunamis, have been documented to have both short-term and long-term effects on various health indicators (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Recently, research has paid more attention to the economic and health impact of tropical cyclones (typhoons====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Research on the health consequences of tropical cyclones is becoming more relevant because global warming is projected to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones considerably in the coming decades. ¡°Super¡± tropical cyclones are likely to become more common and cause a great deal of damage to the economies of coastal areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. People in developing countries along the western coast of the Pacific Ocean, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and China, may suffer more severe consequences from tropical cyclones than people in developed countries because they rely more on agricultural income and are less protected by social welfare systems. Further exploration of the effects of tropical cyclones in developing countries would be valuable to help policymakers address the growing threat of tropical cyclones to public health.====This paper examines the long-term effects of typhoon disasters on the socioeconomic outcomes of individuals born in the coastal provinces of East and South China in 1963¨C1993. We measure the typhoon damage using a constructed damage index based on the estimation of maximum wind speeds induced by typhoons. The empirical results indicate that gestational typhoon exposure has a significant negative effect on educational attainment and income in adulthood. The long-term effects were mostly caused by typhoon exposure during the 9?months before birth, and we do not see significant postnatal effects during infancy. This pattern highlights the vital role of fetal development for the long-run human capital accumulation. Mortality selection was documented in studies in developing countries (====; ====; ====), which may bring in bias in the estimated effects on the outcomes of survivors. This study finds average mortality selection at most moderate from pregnancy failure or early deaths, so endogenous sample selection is not likely a problem for the causal inference. Heterogeneity analysis shows that girls are more vulnerable to gestational typhoon shocks in terms of income in the long run.====Exploration into the mechanisms reveals evidence for multiple channels. Unlike studies from other developing countries, we do not find a strong culling effect from pregnancy failure==== or infant mortality. The higher probability of having a younger sibling and the shortened birth intervals induced by gestational typhoon experiences may result in sibling rivalry in resource allocation through a quantity-quality trade-off. Besides economic and health shocks to adults in the households, damages to the local economy during the fetal period also threaten the long-run well-being of the newborns.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following aspects. First, most literature attempts to identify the health effects of typhoons by comparing the individual born in the regions within a certain distance along the typhoon path and the individual born outside the typhoon-affected region. This paper, however, measures the typhoon damage based on the estimation of maximum wind speed induced by typhoons (====). This method enables a more accurate estimation of the effects of typhoons because the measure considers more comprehensive factors that influence the typhoon intensity, such as the moving speed of the typhoon center, the encountering angle, the maximum wind speed radius, and the latitude wind speed. Second, we examine the contemporaneous health effects as well as the long-run socioeconomic effects by employing various data set. In this way, the channels for the long-run effects of typhoon exposure can be more thoroughly studied. Third, we document a higher long-run sensitivity in girls towards in utero typhoon exposures. This gender inequaltity in long-run outcomes probably reflects gender disparity in household resource allocation after shocks from natural disasters.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== briefly introduces the literature on tropical cyclones and provides a background of typhoons in China; ==== describes the data and variables; ==== presents the empirical methods, discusses the empirical results, provides robustness checks; ==== explores the underlying mechanisms; ==== concludes the paper.",Long-term effects of early-life exposure to tropical cyclones,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000808,13-Jul-21,2021,Research Article,252

We combine data on power plants' industrial output with information on wind direction and speed to proxy for air pollution, and find that air pollution from neighboring power plants indeed has significant negative effects on local public health. The resulting treatment costs are also enormous. Our findings shed light on the necessity of intergovernmental cooperation in environmental governance.","Since air pollution is a major health threat to people worldwide, estimating its effect on mortality is fundamental to environmental policymaking. Recently, a nascent strand of literature has investigated the effects of the cross-border externality of pollution on overall mortality (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In comparison, however, research on such effects on mortality due to specific diseases is still in its infancy. Yet these effects are of great policy interest for disease prevention and control. In this article, we focus on the mortality rate associated with two of the most sensitive diseases to air pollution¡ªrespiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases (====; ====; ====) and examine the spillover effects of air pollution from coal-fired power plants in neighboring areas on local public health.====China currently faces numerous environmental challenges (====; ====). Fewer than 1% of its 500 largest cities meet the air quality standards suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) (====), and 99.6% of the Chinese population reside in areas with fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations above the WHO guideline of 10?¦Ìg/m==== in 2003 (====). Given the country's environmental degradation, public health policies for disease prevention and control are required. Accordingly, a comprehensive examination of the spillover effects of air pollution from coal-fired power plants¡ªa major source of pollution¡ªon local public health is a significant government and policy concern that warrants substantial research attention.====We assemble a dataset covering 161 counties called disease surveillance points (DSPs) in China in 2004 and 2008. It includes public health data extracted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and data on the air pollution generated by neighboring power plants (within 50?km of DSPs). The key to accurately estimating the spillover effects of air pollution is to construct an appropriate measure of cross-border externality¡ªthe air pollution from power plants transported by wind. Pollution levels depend not only on the scale of poisonous gases emitted by power plants in neighboring areas, but also on wind patterns, including the speeds and directions. Note that air pollution from neighboring areas will affect local public health only when the wind speed is moderate, and the prevailing wind direction is toward the area. We use the industrial output of coal-fired power plants in neighboring counties to measure their toxic gas emissions and calculate the downwind frequency¡ªthe proportion of the number of days per year in each county during which the wind is blowing at moderate speed downwind. By using the downwind frequency as weights, for each DSP, we employ the weighted output of power plants in neighboring counties to proxy for the cross-border externality of the air pollution.====On this basis, we find that the air pollution transported by wind from neighboring counties significantly affects the health of the population in DSPs: a 1% increase in the weighted output of neighboring power plants results in 0.108 and 0.042 extra deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, respectively, per 1000 population.==== The results are robust to several important concerns for identification including avoidance behaviors and potential measurement errors. We conduct a series of placebo tests to strengthen the identification: by adjusting for the dependent variable of public health as deaths due to transport accidents, by adjusting for the industrial output of coal-fired power plants as that of hydroelectricity power plants, or by adjusting for moderate wind speed as low or high wind speed. The results corroborate the main findings. With regards to the heterogeneity, the negative health effects are more significant for men, young, and older groups, as well as people living in poor areas. By translating the point estimates into magnitudes, the results indicate that during 2003¨C2017 the DSP counties were exposed to 2.254 million tons of SO==== emissions from power plants in neighboring areas, resulting in 2,517,000 and 979,000 extra deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, respectively. The related treatment costs were 1058.46 billion RMB (151.21 USD) for cardiovascular diseases and 468.50 billion RMB (66.93 USD) for respiratory diseases, accounting for 13% of the revenue of coal-fired power plants and around 10% of the treatment costs due to pollution from local sources.====This article contributes to two strands of literature. First, several previous studies have recognized that coal-firing is a major source of pollution in industrial production (====; Zhang and Crooks, 2012; ====) and daily life (====, ====).====Second, government intervention to protect the environment is based on the premise that the market cannot effectively internalize the negative externality of pollution, which is mainly driven by the free-riding behaviors of agents including local governments. A typical case is that governments in upwind or upstream areas free ride by moving pollution downwind or downstream.==== Our article advances our understanding of the role of the government, indicating that better cooperation between local governments and coordination between the central and local levels are necessary to achieve good environmental governance.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on China's air pollution, especially spillover pollution from power plants. The research design, data, and measurements are introduced in Section 3, and Section 4 presents the empirical results.

Employing the variation of fine rates under One-Child Policy for excess birth in different regions as instrument to address the endogeneity of whether having siblings, we find that sibling's role mainly focuses on shaping people's social preference that subjects with siblings demand less as responders in ultimatum game and behave more cooperatively in sequential prisoner's dilemma. This conclusion survives through several robustness checks. Our further result suggests that more sibling interactions and less parental expectations are two potential mechanisms through which siblings play a role in making people more prosocial. Our findings point to a positive externality along with Two-Child Policy which is widely neglected in both policy evaluation and relevant theory such as quantity-quality theory, and provide implications for the fertility policy such as the recent Three-Child Policy in China and beyond.","Since late 1980, China imposed the One-Child Policy to restrict the number of children of majority couples to one. This policy left many families to have only one child.==== The policy has also induced many social problems such as high sex ratio (====; ====; ====), rapid increase of aged population (====), and heavy pressure in elderly care (====). Besides these, being the only one in the family with access to all the resources available without the rivalry from siblings, only children are often regarded as selfish, unable-to-share, isolated, and socially challenged individuals (====), and this has deepened people's doubts and worries. In fear of the ¡°only child syndrome¡±,==== some employers even included requirement such as ¡°no only children¡± in job advertisements. It is also reported that crime rate of only children has been increasing and their criminal age has been decreasing (====), with a juristic case that a first child in China dropped her newly-born sibling downstairs to death just in fear of losing central position (====).====; ====), more siblings after the new policy may lower the average quality of children as resources are diluted. Second, a child with siblings may be more prosocial living in an environment with more interactions with brothers or sisters because sibling relationships provide rich opportunities for learning patterns of loyalty, helpfulness, and consideration (====; ====; ====). In these two, the first one is more obvious and it has been tested both theoretically and empirically. However, although the second one suggests a positive externality induced by Two-Child Policy, it is often neglected and has yielded inconsistent empirical results. Therefore, differences in behaviors between children without siblings and those with siblings deserve serious research attention in order to fully understand the profound socioeconomic implications of the universal Two-Child Policy.====Previous literature has shown both theoretically and empirically the negative relationship between number of siblings and people's academic achievement (====; ====; ====). There is also a growing body of literature focusing on the behavioral consequences of not having siblings (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, conclusions of the relationship between being an only child and one's behavioral outcomes vary based on different measures, samples and empirical strategies. Most of this research remains on the revelation of correlation and to our knowledge there has been few research efforts to carefully explore the causal relationship between having siblings and behaviors. One leading paper exploring the causal impacts of being an only child is Cameron et al.'s ====, major, ethnicity, province and other socioeconomic background information. Adopting the local fine rates of excess birth as instrument to address the endogeneity of fertility decision, we test the impacts of siblings on people's social, risk and time preferences. We also use different samples for robustness checks. We further conduct heterogeneity analysis across birth order, gender, mother's education level and sibling size. Then we explore the potential mechanisms.====We mainly find that subjects with siblings demand less as responders in ultimatum game and behave more cooperatively in sequential prisoner's dilemma. In addition, we find the impact of siblings is larger for non-first-born subjects and subjects with multiple siblings. We also propose two mechanisms through which siblings play a role in making people more prosocial. Our further results validate that more sibling interactions and less parental expectations are two potential mechanisms. This paper mainly contributes to this subject matter in the following three aspects. First, we explore the causal relationship between sibling and people's social preference, risk attitude and time preference. This adds to the literature in which few works in this aspect do careful causal inference. Second, this paper suggests a positive externality brought by having more children, which is often neglected in research related to family size. Third, this study provides a discussion on the mechanisms of the impacts of siblings on decision making. Finally, with the carrying out of Two-Child Policy, newly bring up of Three-Child Policy, and an increasing attention on one's sociability and cooperation skills, the results provide implications to fertility policy in China and other countries.====The rest of paper is organized as follows.

Consequently, the domestic value added content of its exports has increased over time. Still, value added includes profits, which are partly earned by foreign capital owners, many of whom have set up operations in ","; ====; ====; and ====).====In this period, Chinese standards of living have improved considerably. It is widely believed that its export performance has played a crucial role in this development (====; ====). Different from the existing literature that investigates the role of exports in Chinese GDP (====; ====; ====) or learning-from-inward FDI (====; ====), which are notoriously hard to estimate. We only focus on the Chinese GNI generated on Chinese territory, and ignore the part of GNI that is due to Chinese outward FDI.====; ====; ====; and ====). This was partly due to the active promotion of the processing exports activities mentioned above. By design, these rely heavily on imports, rather than on materials, parts and components, and services supplied by domestic firms. The accumulated empirical evidence suggests that DVA's share in China's exports started to increase quickly (====; ====; ====; ==== and ====). ====, who analyzed firm-level data, attributed the marked change to the development of technological and organizational capabilities in China, as a consequence of which firms can produce previously imported intermediate inputs in-house, or source these from domestic suppliers. ==== found evidence for similar trends in the processing exports sector in specific. Using Chinese customs data, they show that Chinese activities have shifted from the ¡°Pure Assembly¡± to the ¡°Import & Assembly¡± type of export processing, which implies that export processing firms in China have become active in a much broader range of activities than before, including logistics and quality control.====The second problem is the difference between DVA and national income (or, at the economy-wide level, between GDP and GNI). Value added is assigned to the country in which production factors are employed, whereas income is assigned to the country of which the owners of these production factors are citizens. Living standards in China are determined by Chinese GNI rather than by Chinese GDP. The GNI and GDP embodied in Chinese exports are expected to be very different. China's export promotion policies attracted a lot of inward FDI as a consequence of the attractiveness of its processing exports regulations. ==== report that slightly more than 80% of processing exports in 2007 were by foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs, including wholly foreign-owned firms, equity joint ventures and contractual joint ventures), while this share was close to 55% if all exports are considered (====).==== The value added of these firms contains profits, which the FIEs can repatriate. ==== find that close to 15% of China's DVA in exports does not add to its GNI. ====, using slightly different data (for 2007 as well), arrive at a share of 12%. Since 2006, however, the share of FIEs in the value of Chinese gross exports has slightly declined.====The dynamics of DVA shares and of FIE shares in exports call for a longitudinal analysis of national income contained in Chinese exports. How did China's export-promoting policies affect national income in the period of rapid international fragmentation of production processes leading to the global production network? After having addressed this question, we decompose the changes to obtain insights into the empirical magnitudes of various drivers of change. The data needed to conduct such a study are basically those used by ==== and ==== for 2007. These are high-quality input-output (IO) tables that explicitly make the distinction between the processing exports parts of industries and regular parts of these industries, which is required to arrive at meaningful results. We use the so-called tripartite input-output tables for 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017 constructed by ====, ==== and ====. Next to these tripartite input-output tables, the estimation of GNI in Chinese exports requires data on investment by firms categorized by ownership (e.g. domestic enterprises vs. FIEs) and assumptions on returns to capital.====The paper proceeds as follows. ==== explains the IO framework that we adopt to measure Chinese DVA due to Chinese exports, and the methodology to account for the differences between national income and this DVA in exports. ==== gives a detailed description of the data sources. ==== provides the empirical results. In ====, we quantify the contributions of changes in several exogenous variables to see which tendencies have had the most important effects on changes in the share of Chinese GNI in its exports in the decade between 2002 and 2017. ==== focuses on the relative importance of exports in generating China's GNI in the same period. ==== concludes.====To explain our estimation process of national capital income in more detail, we start at the industry level and begin with the introduction of some variables. We denote the proportions of foreign-owned capital in the capital stocks of DEs (domestic enterprises) and FIEs (foreign-invested enterprises) in industry ==== by ==== and ==== respectively. The capital income-output ratio of DEs and FIEs in industry ==== are labeled ==== and ====, respectively.====Taking processing exports as an example, the estimation process is as follows. Denote ====as the output share of FIEs in processing exports.

To illustrate the mechanisms underlying the effects, we propose a theoretical framework that highlights the effects of human capital in the financial sector on mitigating the ==== between financial intermediaries, households, and firms. Using the Chinese National Economic Census in 2008 and the Industrial Enterprises Database over 2011¨C2013, we find that the financial sector's human capital plays a significant and positive (negative) role in short-term (long-term) debt and this effect is more pronounced for firms with greater information asymmetry. Further analyses demonstrate that the baseline findings are consistent with the credit supply hypothesis. Our study indicates that human capital in the financial sector strengthens its renegotiation capacity for corporate borrowing, which is consistent with China's financial repression policy and leads to increased exposure of firms to credit and liquidity risks.","Debt maturity plays a significant role in credit and liquidity shocks faced by firms and has important effects on their investment behaviors and operating performance (====; ====; ====; ====). The increasing availability of micro-level data and rapid developments in quantitative methods have allowed economists to infer the determinants of corporate debt maturity from the credit demand side, highlighting the characteristics of firms and institutional environments.====A small but growing number of studies have examined how credit supply shocks affect corporate debt maturity. For example, ====Our study investigates how human capital in the financial sector affects corporate debt maturity. Our analysis is motivated by two emerging and impressive features worldwide. First, there is a secular decrease in corporate debt maturity. ==== point out that the proportion of male (female) Harvard graduates employed in the financial sector increased from 5% (20%) in the 1970s to 15% (23%), while ====, ==== find a U-shaped pattern in the relative education level of the financial sector. However, much less is known about the connection between these two emerging features.====; ====; ====; ====; ====), suggesting a positive relationship between the financial sector's human capital and corporate debt maturity. For instance, ==== illustrates that underinvestment behavior caused by the conflict of managers and shareholders can be controlled by issuing short-term debt that matures before growth options are exercised, while ==== and ==== find a significantly negative impact of managerial ownership on corporate debt maturity. Therefore, if human capital in the financial sector improves the efficiency with which short-term debt can reduce agency costs, firms would demand less short-term debt, suggesting that corporate debt maturity would increase. In this study, the channel of agency costs is called the ¡°credit demand hypothesis.¡±====Second, based on the theory of debt maturity focusing on information asymmetry, short-term debt is an efficient tool for monitoring the moral hazard problem of firms, which makes lenders detect firms' opportunistic behaviors and punish them by liquidation or renegotiation (e.g., ====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====), indicating a negative relationship between human capital in the financial sector and corporate debt maturity. For example, ==== states that insider banks can acquire information on the state of a firm's projects by using monitoring activities and emphasizes that short-term debt contracts are more favorable in a bad state.==== argues that lenders choose the monitoring intensity to gather information on the states of projects and underlines that financial intermediaries have some advantages in monitoring firms, explaining the stylized fact that financial intermediaries usually hold short-term debt. Hence, if human capital in the financial sector helps mitigate information asymmetry, the decreasing monitoring cost of short-term debt would reinforce the preference of financial intermediaries for short-term debt, suggesting that corporate debt maturity would decrease. In this study, the channel of information asymmetry is called the ¡°credit supply hypothesis.¡±====In this study, we argue that the information asymmetry channel dominates the effects of human capital in the financial sector on corporate debt maturity.==== As discussed by a large branch of the existing literature, firms' financial constraints are universal because of imperfect capital markets (e.g., ====; ====), suggesting that the financial sector plays a leading role in negotiating debt contracts.==== As human capital in the financial sector increases, firms' bargaining power in capital supply strengthens. Meanwhile, given that capital suppliers have a preference for short-term liabilities contracts to control default risk (====), more short-term debt would be provided by financial intermediaries in the presence of the moral hazard problem that comes with decreasing monitoring costs. In particular, ==== find that agency costs are not responsible for the decrease in the debt maturity of U.S. firms but that information asymmetry plays a critical role. Overall, we deem that the credit supply hypothesis rather than the credit demand hypothesis dominates how the financial sector's human capital affects corporate debt maturity.====), human capital in the financial sector reduces monitoring costs, leading to an increase in the marginal revenue of short-term debt contracts. Therefore, the second prediction of our model is that the financial sector's human capital is positively associated with a firm's short-term debt, while its effect on a firm's long-term debt is ambiguous.====To test the key predictions of our theoretical framework, we use two large databases in China. The first is the 2008 Chinese National Economic Census (NEC) collected by the State Council of China. These data, which cover all non-farm firms, contain detailed information on workers' educational backgrounds at the firm level. By exploiting the data, we construct a measure of the financial sector's human capital across Chinese prefecture-level cities. The second is the Chinese Industrial Enterprises (CIE) database for 2011¨C2013. These data, manually collected by China's National Bureau of Statistics, include all state-owned and non-state-owned firms with sales above 20 million RMB and provide detailed information on each firm. When conducting our empirical analysis, we match the city-level measure of human capital in the financial sector with the data on industrial enterprises.====In our empirical analysis, the financial sector's human capital at the city level is measured by the average years of schooling of a worker in the financial sector over that of a worker in the non-farm sector excluding ====, while corporate debt maturity is measured by the ratio of debt with different maturities to total assets. We find that a firm's leverage and short-term debt significantly increase as the financial sector's human capital increases, but its long-term debt significantly decreases, consistent with our theoretical predictions. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in the financial sector's human capital decreases the ratio of long-term debt to total liabilities for Chinese industrial firms by 0.65%, explaining 6.43% of the average value of the debt maturity structure.====Moreover, the effects of the financial sector's human capital on corporate debt maturity are stronger for firms with more severe information asymmetry, such as private and smaller firms. Additionally, along with increasing human capital in the financial sector, the social saving rate increases and the cost of debt decreases, meaning that the mismatch between a firm's asset and debt maturities becomes more serious. Overall, our findings support the credit supply hypothesis, which is consistent with the financial repression policy in China.====Our study contributes to the existing literature in several ways. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore the effect of the financial sector's human capital on corporate debt maturity. Most previous works investigate the determinants of the corporate debt maturity from the perspectives of firm characteristics (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====), industry environments (e.g., ====; ====; ====), and institutional differences (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). In particular, studies on the importance of financial development use market size indicators as their measurement items (e.g., ====; ====). In contrast to these works, our research introduces a novel dimension from the viewpoint of human capital and provides strong evidence for the key role it plays.====Second, our study explains why firms use more short-term debt than long-term debt. Using data on U.S. industrial firms, ==== find a remarkable decrease in short-term corporate debt over 1976¨C2008, especially for firms with relatively severe information asymmetry and new firms issuing public equity. However, demand-side determinants are insufficient to account for the trend, making it crucial to examine supply-side factors. Considering that the share of high-skilled workers in the financial sector is rising across economies (====), we argue that increasing human capital in the financial sector¡ªa supply-side determinant¡ªcontributes to the decline in corporate debt maturity. More importantly, consistent with ====, our results confirm that the debt maturity theory focusing on information asymmetry, rather than agency costs, better explains increasing short-term debt.====Third, our study examines the issue of corporate debt maturity from the perspective of corporate financing decisions, which provides a micro-level mechanism to analyze the impact of the financial sector's human capital on the real economy. A growing branch of the literature explores the pattern and real economic effect of human capital flowing into the financial sector. Some studies investigate whether the allocation of human capital to the production or financial sectors matters to the real economy (e.g., ====; ====; ====), while others describe the effect of the financial sector's human capital in the United States and other countries (e.g., ====; ====, ====). We use Chinese data to demonstrate the negative relationship between human capital in the financial sector and corporate debt maturity, especially for firms with high information asymmetry.====; ====; ====), most studies of human capital examine its role in the industrial sector (e.g., ====; ====).====In this study, we investigate the role of human capital in the financial sector. Our estimation results demonstrate that the financial sector's human capital improves its efficiency of mobilizing capital and reduces the cost of monitoring activities, leading to a significant increase in a firm's leverage and short-term debt. More importantly, its importance is heterogeneous across firms with different information asymmetries. Overall, our findings verify the credit allocation effect of human capital in the financial sector, which shapes the preference of capital suppliers for short-term debt.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework to clarify the mechanisms underlying the effects of human capital in the financial sector on corporate debt maturity. Sector 3 describes the data and variable definitions. We present our empirical results in Section 4. In Section 5, we test the mechanisms underlined in our theoretical model.

Thus, it is important to understand whether the relationship found in the literature between housing wealth and entrepreneurship holds in China.====Second, exploiting rich household-level information in the CHFS, we provide new evidence for several potential channels through which housing wealth shocks affect household entrepreneurship decisions in the biggest developing country in the world. Existing literature mainly focuses on the collateral channel that housing capital gains provide additional collateral to obtain a business loan. We present evidence for the collateral channel exploiting the unique institutional features in China. In addition, we show evidence that housing capital gains can influence household risk preference and awareness of financial knowledge.==== All of those are potentially important factors in household entrepreneurship decisions.====Empirically, it is challenging to identify the causal impact of housing wealth changes on entrepreneurship. There exist both household-level unobservables (e.g., risk preference) and regional unobservables (e.g., ==== shocks) that could bias the estimates. The identification strategy we take is to directly estimate the impact of household-level housing capital gains net of maintenance and upgrading expenditures on entrepreneurship decisions in a lagged dependent variable model. We control for a rich set of household attributes including housing and non-housing wealth and city by year fixed effects. Most important, we instrument for housing wealth changes with an instrument of structural breaks in city housing price trend. We also conduct robustness checks with alternative definitions of entrepreneurship and alternative instruments. These identification efforts allow us to draw careful conclusions based on our estimates and to compare and reconcile research results based on data from other countries and China.====We reach several conclusions. First, we find that housing capital gains significantly increase households' propensity of becoming entrepreneurs. A 10,000 RMB increase in housing wealth increases the propensity of households becoming business owners by about 0.7 percentage points in IV estimation. Housing capitals gains boost business entry but do not have significant effects on business exit. Second, we provide evidence for several underlying mechanisms that housing capital gains alleviate household credit constraints, reduce risk aversion and increase awareness of financial information. Third, the impact of housing wealth changes is heterogeneous across demographic groups.

However, there are no consistent mechanisms to measure the impact of homeownership on wealth inequality. Based on data from 1995 to 2018, this paper finds that the expansion of the homeownership rate in urban China was an equalizing force in the distribution of wealth from 1995 to 2008, driven by the increased homeownership and housing acquisition of low- and moderate-income households (LMIs) during the era of housing reform in the 1990s. The forces were exogenous and dominated by a redistributive logic. In the post-reform era after 2008, the decline in the homeownership rate led to a concentration of wealth distribution that was driven by the widening wealth gap between owners and non-owners, which represented an endogenous market force. The results indicate that there was an apparent discontinuity of the trends of homeownership and wealth inequality because new immigrants could not afford the price of housing in the cities. The wealth position of the middle and lower classes (mainly new immigrant non-owners) was crippled, not only by the inaccessibility of homeownership, but also by the reinforcing effect of the increase in housing prices. This study reveals the different mechanisms of homeownership on wealth inequality and the policy implications for the redistributive effects of the allocation of housing resources.","China has generated enormous private wealth alongside rapid economic growth since 1978. By Piketty's measurement, private wealth in China was relatively limited in 1978, accounting for about 100% of national income, but it has grown rapidly in 2015, accounting for over 450% of national income (====). However, to date scholars have not agreed on a unanimous explanation for China's wealth growth (====; ====). As we all know, the distribution of private wealth in urban China went through complex dynamics, far from a simple increase. Especially the reform of the urban housing system implemented in the 1990s and the increase in private property may have played an important role. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the relationship between homeownership and private wealth.====In addition, we also find that the process of accumulating wealth contributed to the equalization of wealth distribution before 2008, but wealth inequality decreased before the dramatic increase since 2008. Income inequality has continued to increase albeit at different rates, but the homeownership rate had been growing rapidly, before a subsequent downtrend. The turning points of these three trends all occurred somewhere around the middle of the first decade of the 21st century. What has been the driving force behind these dynamics? Have there been any potential causal relationships between these three dynamics? By viewing the housing ==== as a public-to-private wealth transfer in the 1990s, was homeownership an equalizing force in the distribution of household wealth during China's transition period when both redistributive policies and market factors played a role? Will different income groups among Chinese LMIs benefit from the reform? Did Chinese LMIs suffer as a result of an increasingly market-oriented housing regime due to housing price bubbles? In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions to understand the evolution of wealth inequality during China's economic transition and urbanization process.====Specifically, the main findings and supplementary contributions of this article are the following.====First, compared to the attention the existing literature gives to the issue of income inequality in China, we focus on China's wealth accumulation process and wealth inequality. We find that, since 1990, the trend of wealth inequality in China has not been consistent with income inequality, while income distribution still exerts a positive impact on wealth distribution.====Second, this paper contributes to existing studies on household wealth inequality in urban China by constructing a longitudinally comparable data series using two major survey datasets, and discusses the relationship between homeownership and wealth inequality in urban China. This paper tests the impact of homeownership on wealth inequality and explains the underlying mechanisms in specific periods. We find that endogenous wealth accumulation was not a major source of wealth distribution during the period when urban China transitioned from a redistributive economy to a market economy, while in the post-reform period, the level of income inequality has had an increasing impact on wealth distribution.====Finally, our third contribution is to explain the reasons for wealth disparities between homeowners and non-owners, and we find that wealth disparities increased under the effect of capital gains, but this problem was alleviated by a higher homeownership rate.====The rest of the article is arranged as follows.

However, the industry-level view, specifically the relation between industrial policies and M&A waves at the sectoral level, has remained rather unexplored. This article contributes to fill this gap by empirically investigating the relation between selective industrial policies and M&A waves at the ==== level in China. Referring to the four Five Year Plans covering the period 1996¨C2015, we explore whether being identified as an emerging sector in these plans generates positive or negative changes in the number of M&As. We reiterate the analysis according to the different types of M&As (vertical, horizontal or conglomerate) and the different natures of the acquirer (SOEs or private). Our results suggest that policies can differentially affect M&A waves according to the type of M&A. Moreover, while private firms are more responsive to both horizontal and vertical integration in emerging sectors, SOEs are more prone to engage in vertical M&As. We discuss the possible rationales behind the different behaviors. We also draw general policy implications on strategic industrial policy and market restructuring.","Mergers and acquisitions (M&As hereafter) have been widely studied in the economic literature. Many scholars have focused on firm-level advantages or disadvantages originating from M&As (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, and so on), and other researchers have focused on the role of managers and other stakeholders in promoting or hampering biddings (====; ====; and many more).====The role of M&As in transforming the structure of a sector, however, has been less explored. In particular, there is little empirical evidence on the linkages between industrial policies and M&A waves. Nevertheless, the topic is relevant in particular in the context of emerging countries with strong industrial policy apparatuses, since the possibility of driving M&As can become a powerful means to promoting structural change.====We aim to fill this gap by studying the case of China. Since the introduction of the open door policy in 1979, China has used selective industrial policies to promote the development of specific sectors, territories and technologies (====; ====; ====; ====). Selective policies targeting sectors in particular have nurtured the growth of specific productions, technologies, national champions, etc. (====; ====; ====; among others), and their importance is currently acknowledged outside China (====).====More generally, Chinese policymakers have been pushing a structural change of their economy, identifying specific sectors within the Five Year Plans (FYPs hereafter), China's main policy documents. Chinese policymakers themselves recognize the role of M&As in transforming the features of firms and markets, up to the point that ==== waves are explicitly encouraged in FYPs for particularly relevant sectors.====). This happens because, after selective identification in the FYP, a whole range of encouraging policies follows (====; ====; ====). In the case of emerging sectors, policymakers use this scheme to promote a systemic shift of the economy towards frontier-technology productions (====; ====; ====). In our view, therefore, the selective identification in the FYP acts as a signal that in the forthcoming years, these sectors will be at the core of the structural transformation of the economy. Although single actors do not know, since the beginning, what specific measures will be taken to promote these sectors, the sole identification of emerging sectors may, henceforth, be able to spread positive expectations in relation to those sectors and produce a reorganization in the markets via M&As.====; ====The paper is structured as follows: the next section reviews the relevant literature on M&As.

Using ASIF panel data representing the activity of manufacturing firms for the period 1999 to 2008, this paper assesses the employment effects of SEZs according to firm births, relocation, expansion, and firm closure. By matching counties with future SEZs as comparison groups, the difference-in-differences estimates show that SEZs significantly increase employment in rural counties due to the creation of new firms and the expansion of existing large firms; in contrast, SEZs fail to promote firms to move in and restrain firms from moving out. Further, data analysis reveals significant regional heterogeneity, with the employment effects of SEZs on firm entry strongest for the eastern coastal region. Finally, we confirm that SEZs tend to reduce local industrial agglomeration in the eastern and central regions.","It is estimated that by 2018 more than 2200 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) had been established in China. In contrast to older, more highly controlled economic structures, SEZs have been the most comprehensive place-based policies to promote the local economy. While existing evidence indicates that SEZs do lead to net job growth (e.g., ====), a pressing question is whether SEZs create more jobs by encouraging new start-ups or by attracting relocated jobs from other locations? Also, do job changes of this nature lead to industrial agglomeration?====To address these questions, this paper constructs panel data of manufacturing firms from the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) representing the period 1999 to 2008. We decompose net job change into different categories: new startups, relocated firms, existing firms, and firms that at some point during the period under review exit the market. A difference-in-differences (DID) empirical strategy is employed to analyze rural counties; Counties with provincial SEZs are chosen as treated counties. Then, two steps are implemented to determine the control counties. First, for each examined county, we define control counties as those with future SEZs three years later within the same provinces. Second, a logit model is used to predict the probability of having an SEZ within the treated and control counties; the control counties with low probability are then dropped. Our baseline DID estimates indicate that the presence of SEZs significantly increases jobs in both new startups and in existing large firms; conversely, the SEZs had a negative impact in terms of move-in firms relocating from other locations.====This paper explores whether the employment effects of SEZs vary by region. It should be noted that the baseline results may mask the heterogeneity of the employment effects of SEZs, which may vary with local and regional productivity, demand, labor costs, and ====. Nonetheless, findings indicate that SEZs in the eastern and central regions of China appear to have a stronger impact on employment in new startups and existing firms in comparison to the western region, with the eastern region demonstrating the most robust effect on employment. In addition, the negative employment effects for relocated move-in firms were found to be stronger in the central region. The final phase of this investigation examines whether the presence of SEZs increases industrial agglomeration. By constructing a Krugman Specialization Index to measure the level of industrial agglomeration, we confirm that SEZs tend to reduce local agglomeration in the eastern and central regions.====This paper contributes to the literature regarding place-based policies in general and China's Special Economic Zone policy in particular. The most related work is ==== who show that SEZs significantly increase village employment and they argue positive employment effect results from new entrants. In terms of employment results, however, the findings reported herein diverge from their work in two areas. First, we differentiate new start-ups from newcomers that relocated from other locations. Second, this paper explores regional variation in the effects of SEZs. Given the overwhelming presence of SEZs across regions, it is more important for policymakers to evaluate regional heterogeneity than to evaluate overall effects. Although previous literature also finds that SEZs promote new startups, the evidence regarding regional heterogeneity is insufficient. Our findings fill this gap by pointing out that this effect is not ubiquitous and appear to be stronger in the eastern and central regions. These findings also complement a strand of literature emphasizing that the effects of place-based policies may vary according to local conditions (e.g., ====; ====; ====).====Other studies on the economic consequences of SEZs in China include the net employment effect (e.g., ====; ====), productivity (e.g., ====; ====; ====), income inequality (e.g., ====). There are a number of scholarly reports that have addressed employment decomposition. ==== indicate that state enterprise zones in the U.S. have a positive impact on the outcomes of new establishments but on a negative effect on the outcomes of already existing establishments. Other studies looking at place-based policies include state enterprise zones (====; ====; ====), Federal Urban Empowerment Zone (====); and the Tennessee Valley Authority (====), to name a few.====This paper contributes to the literature regarding the firm and industrial relocation. Although firm relocation is widely considered to be an effective industrial policy in China, little is known about the size and determinants of firm relocation using micro-level data. ==== report that in the U.S., interstate manufacturing relocation occurs less frequently, and when it does, smaller entities tend to be involved, implying that encouraging firm relocation may not be a successful approach in the U.S. ==== find that regional relocation policies in Japan attract low-productivity firms. Recently, ==== indicate that in Poland, distance is the important determinant for firm relocation. Using ASIF data from 1998 to 2008, ====This paper contributes to a small, but growing body of research on the dynamic process of industrial agglomeration. ==== show that in the U.S., the dynamic change in industrial concentration is reduced by firm births and reinforced by firm closures. In the context of China, ==== find that the presence of state-owned enterprises as an indicator of local protectionism tend to reduce industrial agglomeration. ==== shows that globalization leads to a higher level of agglomeration for export-orient and foreign-invested industries. Our empirical results reveal that SEZs reduce industrial agglomeration in the eastern and central regions of China, but less so in other regions.====This paper is organized as follows: ==== presents a simple model to guide our empirical work. ====, and empirical results are presented in ====. ==== concludes this paper.",Job creation or job relocation?

Using within-county variations in daily weather between 1996 and 2012, we find that daily temperature and precipitation have non-linear effects on county-level economic outcomes. An additional day with an average temperature above 20?¡ãC reduces county-level GDP by 0.05% to 0.08%, and the detrimental effects tend to intensify when the temperature rises. The precipitation does not have robust effects on county-level GDP. By examining the effects of daily weather on primary, secondary, and tertiary ====, we find that the primary industry is the main channel of the negative impacts of high temperatures. Heavy precipitation is inclined to harm agricultural output, especially grains and oil crop yields. Besides, we discover heterogeneous responses to weather extremes across counties and find suggestive evidence of adaptation.","Climate change is a common concern of humankind. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change documents substantial variations in the frequencies of extreme weather events since the second half of the 20th century due to global warming (====). These changes in the worldwide climate have profound influences on human society.====This paper focuses on the economic impacts of two critical weather variables: temperatures and precipitation. Empirical studies have found that extreme temperature and precipitation adversely affect the economy through many channels (====). For example, labor productivity and working hours decline on scorching days (====; ====). Extremely high temperatures reduce crop yields (====) and the total factor productivity (TFP) of agriculture and manufacturing firms (====; ====). Precipitation significantly affects economic growth (====). All these studies confirm that the economic outcomes in a region are affected by the local temperature and precipitation.====Similar to the global trend, the climate of China has changed remarkably in the past several decades. Some studies have examined the effects of weather on several specific crop yields (====; ====), agriculture production (====), and the output of large manufacturing firms in China (====; ====Our study finds that high temperatures have significant adverse effects on county-level GDP. Relative to a day with an average temperature in [10, 15)¡ãC bin, one day with an average temperature in [20, 25)¡ãC, [25, 30)¡ãC, and?¡Ý?30?¡ãC bins reduces county-level GDP by 0.05%, 0.08%, and 0.08%, respectively. Other temperature bins do not have significant effects on GDP. These results are robust to various robustness checks. Relative to a day with zero precipitation, moderate daily rainfall in the (15, 20]mm bin has significant positive impacts on GDP. But the effect is not robust. Other precipitation levels do not show significant effects on GDP.====We find that the primary industry is the dominant channel for the effects of temperature and precipitation. The negative impacts of [25, 30)¡ãC and?¡Ý?30?¡ãC bins on the value added of primary industry are 2.8 and 4.1 times their impacts on the county-level GDP. Intensive precipitation over 35?mm significantly reduces the value added of primary industry. Further investigation shows that high temperatures and extreme precipitation substantially lower the output of grains and oil crops. In contrast, almost all the temperature bins and precipitation bins do not significantly impact the secondary and tertiary industries.====Counties with different characteristics respond very differently to high temperatures, suggesting they have heterogeneous adaptabilities. The GDP of counties that frequently experience extreme heat is not significantly impacted by high temperatures above 20?¡ãC, while counties with fewer scorching days are affected considerably. The result suggests that more experiences of extreme heat nourish greater adaptability. High temperatures over 20?¡ãC significantly hurt non-agricultural counties' primary industries, but the damaging effects of high temperatures are weaker and statistically insignificant in agricultural counties. Our analysis verifies that outputs of grains and oil crops of agricultural counties are less vulnerable to high temperatures. Our data support the following explanation for the heterogeneous effects: agricultural counties have much higher rural investment, more farm machinery, and more agricultural labor than non-agricultural counties. These inputs are essential to adaptation, as found by ====.====Our study contributes to the rapidly growing literature on the relationship between weather and economic performance. We are the first to thoroughly study the non-linear effects of daily weather on China's aggregate economic outcomes and the outputs of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.==== Moreover, our study digs into different agricultural products, large manufacturing firms, and heterogeneous counties to unveil the mechanisms behind the effects. Quantifying the impact of weather conditions on economic output in China has significant policy implications because the results reveal the counterfactual benefits of tackling climate change. Heterogeneous effects of daily weather on different sectors imply that future industrial restructuring could partially counteract the adverse impacts of climate change on the overall economy. Industrial policies could smooth industrial restructuring and help to alleviate the damaging effects of climate change. The heterogeneous effects on different counties validate the importance of adaptation measures such as agricultural investment. In addition, our comprehensive study of China, the largest developing country, could help evaluate the economic losses of weather extremes in other developing countries and has substantial policy implications for them.====The effects of weather on agricultural production have been intensively studied in the literature. ==== provide a comprehensive summary of the studies. We only highlight the most relevant papers here. ==== and ==== study the effects of weather on corn, soybeans, rice, and wheat. Compared with their studies on specific crops, our research focuses on the aggregate value of agricultural outputs. We identify agricultural production as the main channel for weather extremes' effects on county-level GDP. In addition, we decompose the aggregate impact on agriculture into effects on grains, oil crops, cotton, and meat, each of which includes several agricultural products. Highly consistent with related studies (e.g., ====; ====; ====), our study confirms the relationship between agricultural outputs and temperatures is non-linear, and high temperatures significantly reduce the yields of grains and oil crops. ==== find that high temperatures seriously harm China's agricultural TFPs, labor and fertilizer usage, and agricultural yields. Their study provides complementary evidence that high temperatures in China significantly hurt agriculture.====There are a few studies on weather and industrial output. Researches using aggregate data have mixed findings on whether high temperatures are detrimental to industrial output. ==== does not find a statistically significant effect of temperatures on manufacturing outputs in twenty-eight Caribbean countries. ==== find industrial losses from high temperatures only appear in poor countries. ==== do not find statistically significant evidence of temperatures affecting non-agricultural production. There is a clear result difference between studies using aggregate data and studies using firm-level data. At the firm level, ====, ====, and ==== all document significant detrimental effects of high temperatures on industrial output. ==== find that extreme heat has substantial adverse cumulative effects on Chinese exporting firms. Our result is consistent with studies using aggregate data. We find that almost all temperature and precipitation bins do not significantly impact the value added of secondary industry or the gross output of large manufacturing enterprises. Our result difference with ==== and ==== may be attributed to numerous efficient firm entrants in our extended data period. Our data spans from 1996 to 2012 (17?years), while their data covers 1998 to 2007 (10?years). According to their firm-level data, the number of firms in 1999 is around 160 thousand. The number rapidly grows to 330 thousand in 2007 and keeps increasing after 2007. ==== find that entry accounts for over two-thirds of total TFP growth in Chinese manufacturing firms. ==== find that entrants have higher initial productivity than incumbents in China's liberalized industries. Numerous efficient firms appear in our sample between 2008 and 2012, and they tend to be less affected by high temperatures. Our study would lead to a different policy recommendation on manufacturing firms from what firm-level studies would recommend. It is crucial and also debatable which result is more reliable.====Studies investigating the effects of weather on the tertiary industry are scarce. ==== find that high temperatures adversely affect workers' productivity in call centers. ==== show that bank workers in Japan have the highest productivity when outside weather is less attractive. These two papers focus on specific firms. Using aggregate data from more than 180 economies, ==== find that the value added of services sector is not significantly affected by temperature increase. Our study finds the same result as ==== using county-level value added of tertiary industry in China.==== study how annual average temperature and average precipitation affect the growth rate of GDP per capita of Chinese counties and calculate the cumulative effects of weather in the medium run (five years and ten years). The study also explores the possible channels of weather on economic growth. Highly consistent to ====, it finds weather affects the growth rate of agricultural output, labor productivity, and investment. Different from studying the long-term growth in ====, this paper emphasizes how daily weather conditions, especially the weather extremes, impact the economic output in the short run. We find the primary industry is the dominant channel for the effects of weather extremes. The two papers' empirical findings provide very different but complementary angles to see the impacts of weather conditions on the Chinese economy.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the conceptual framework to show how daily weather affects daily and annual economic outputs and sets up the empirical strategy. In Section 3, we introduce the data and provide summary statistics. Section 4 reports the main results, various robustness checks, and the channel of the results. Three extensions of the main results are shown in section 5.

The central government has launched a series of policies addressing environmental pollutions.====). But taking firm heterogeneity into account, firms may respond differently to environmental policies. In this paper, we provide evidence that low-productivity firms are more likely to exit when exposed to strict environmental policy, which contributes to aggregate industrial productivity. Thus the cost of environmental policy could be lower than previously understood.====Earlier studies using region- (country, state, city) or industry-level data to estimate the effects of environmental policies (i.e. ====; ====; Levison and Taylor, 2008; ?====; ====; ====; ====; ====, etc). However, using aggregate data might be problematic. First, it cannot distinguish between firms covered by a particular policy and those exempt ones, which would lead to aggregation bias (====). Second, these aggregate-level studies ignore heterogeneous responses of firms to environmental policy and its implications on aggregate productivity. In this paper, we utilize Chinese firm-level data to explore how emission intensity varies across firms and how firms with different productivity or emission intensity respond differently to strict regulation. We then explore the implication of this heterogeneity on aggregate industrial productivity.====We describe a model with firm heterogeneity, exit, entry, and endogenous pollution abatement. In the model, firms differ in productivity, which leads to different pollution emission intensity, and firm dynamics.====Then we turn to test predictions of the theoretical framework. Using Chinese firm-level emission and production data, we find evidence that firms with higher productivity have lower emission intensity. The emission intensity of firms with the productivity below 10 percentile is 5.26 times larger than firms with the productivity above 90 percentile. Then, we use the Annual Survey of Chinese Industrial Enterprises (CIE) data to investigate the impact of environmental regulation on firm dynamics. To address potential ====, we explore a quasi-experimental environmental policy and conduct a triple difference strategy, which allows us to control for unobservable confounding factors (e.g., industrial and regional characteristics). The results show that polluting firms in cities with stricter environmental regulations have a higher probability of exit. We conduct various robustness checks, such as using several alternative measurements of polluting industries, applying different model specifications, examining parallel trend assumption. The results are quite robust.====To further explore firm heterogeneity, we refine our specification by interacting the triple interaction term with firm productivity type. The empirical estimates show that stricter environmental regulation induces firms with lower productivity to exit. We also find similar results for firms with higher emission intensity, which is consistent with our previous finding that low-productivity firms tend to have higher emission intensity.====To quantify the additional effects of environmental regulation on aggregate industrial productivity through reallocation, we decompose the change in aggregate TFP into five terms (within-firm, between-firm, covariance, entry, and exit) and investigate the impact of environmental policy on each term. We also apply a measure of misallocation (====) to investigate the effect of environmental policy on reallocation. The results show that strict environmental policy increases aggregate TFP through the firm exit channel and helps to reduce misallocation.====Our paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, combing with the firm-level emission and production data, we provide empirical support for firms with higher productivity having lower emission intensity in China. Second, in calculating firm productivity, we estimate production function based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator of ====. To obtain reasonable estimates, we incorporate the effect of environmental policy into estimation since firms' input demand may shift with environmental policy. Third, the detailed firm-level data enable us to explore how the policy effects vary across firms. We provide a unified set of estimates of the effects of environmental regulation on firm exit, entry, and the consequent impact on aggregate outcome (aggregate TFP and misallocation) and estimates of all these help to fully characterize the underlying costs/benefits of environmental policy.====This paper adds to the plant/firm-level studies examining the effects of environmental policy on firm activities and performances, such as firm location, investment, firm productivity, and employment. ==== utilizes county-level variation in regulatory stringency to investigate the effect of Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) on firm location choices. It finds that polluting industries reallocate production away from more regulated counties (non-attainment counties) to less regulated counties (attainment counties). ==== find that rather than traditional investments, new plants subject to strong regulation in non-attainment areas do higher up-front investments. ==== shows that firms in more polluting industries invest more in countries with less strict environmental policies. ==== find that strict environmental regulation induces a negative impact on firm productivity in polluting industries. ==== uses the United States worker-firm data and finds that the average transition cost in a regulated sector induced by strict environmental regulation (CAAA) is about 20% of a worker's previous earnings. ==== study environmental information disclosure in China and find this policy can increase both profitability and innovation.====This paper contributes to the literature examining the effects of the Two Control Zone policy. ==== examine the policy effect on exports and show a relatively negative effect on exports of polluting industries in the treated cities. ==== investigates the policy impact on infant mortality and it finds the infant mortality decrease by 21% in the targeted cities. ==== find that cities with strict environmental regulations attract less foreign direct investment. ==== show achievements in emission reduction target will bring negative impacts on GDP growth. Our results suggest that strict environmental policy induces some negative effects (in this paper it causes some firms to exit), however, the exit of unproductive firms can also bring benefits to aggregate outcomes. Neglecting these effects may overestimate the negative impacts of the TCZ policy.====Our paper also adds to the literature on the incentive of local government in addressing environmental pollution. ==== find aged cadres (over 57) with higher education are more willing to address environmental pollution since they are not likely to be promoted thus help to address environmental protection.

Using a large and representative sample of Chinese individuals, we explore the effects of social media browsing and social media communication on users' life satisfaction. The results show that while social media browsing has a strong negative impact on users' subjective well-being, there is no significant impact generated by social media communication. The relative income and social comparison are the main drivers of the result. The negative impact of social media browsing is more pronounced for low-income people than for high-income people. We do not find support for other possible mechanisms like information cocoons of information fragmentation.","Our brains are wired to make social connections (====; ====; ====). With the rise of social media, human beings are interconnected more than ever before. Social media increasingly penetrates every aspect of our lives. In 2017, people in China spent, on average, 20?min a day browsing and 7?min communicating with others on social media from the Chinese Time-Use Survey (CTUS). In the US, 62% of adults use social media as the primary access to news (====). As of 2016, the average user spent 50?min a day on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger (====).====Since social media plays an increasingly significant role in our lives, it is natural to expect it might influence our well-being (====; ====). Recent discussion has thus far focused on the potential negative impacts of social media use on well-being. ==== find that a higher intensity of Facebook use will subsequently lead to lower happiness. ==== use data from the Gallup Survey and Facebook accounts and find that Facebook use is overall related to lower mental and physical health. Most of the previous studies on this topic are from psychology or communication study (e.g., ====; ====; ====). In the economics literature, the recent experimental study by ==== provides a comprehensive set of results on the impacts of Facebook use on subjective well-being and news knowledge, and political polarization. They find that social media use crowds out face-to-face social interactions and lowers subjective well-being by creating feelings of loneliness and depression. Social media also increases political polarization by raising exposure to polarized news and attention to politics.====Previous studies on the impact of social media on individual well-being typically utilize a survey on users of social media or experimental data obtained using university students as subjects. In this paper, in contrast, we depart from the existing studies by using a unique nationally representative dataset with more than 10,000 observations from the Chinese Time-Use Survey (CTUS). The dataset captures the amount of time people spend on various activities on a typical day. To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first dataset obtained from a time-use survey with specific variables capturing participants' activities on social media. Our study is unique because it is the first one that uses a large-scale nationally representative survey to the best of our knowledge. We also combined CTUS data with the data obtained from the China Household ==== Survey (CHFS). This has enabled us to obtain rich information on the social-economic background of the respondents. The advantage of using this time-use survey data is that it provides a large and representative sample of the Chinese population so that we can complement the results of the existing study by comparing the estimated marginal effects of social media on subjective well-being in different countries (the US and China), and across different population samples (student versus general population).====There are two potential roles of social media platforms, namely as the ==== and the ==== To the best of our knowledge, previous studies usually do not differentiate the two roles or focus on one of the functions in isolation and do not include them in a unified framework and compare their impacts. Our data set allows us to create two separate variables: ====, defined as the time spent on browsing friends' updates, news and other information on social media, and ====, defined as the time spent on messaging, online chatting, and communicating with various people from their social networks on social media. The former is the catalyst for the ====, while the latter is the catalyst for the ====. By teasing out these two functions, we can evaluate the relative importance of each of these functions. Thus, the research question of our study is mainly three-fold.====First, do social media users also suffer from the negative welfare impact of social media in China? Second, is there heterogeneity of the negative impact of social media in different sub-groups of the population? Third, is the negative impact mainly driven by browsing or communication using social media?====Consistent with the existing evidence on the relationship between social media use and well-being, we also find that social media use lowers one's subjective well-being in China. Interestingly, we can show that the damage to subjective well-being is more pronounced in the low-income than the high-income group, and the negative impact is mainly attributed to social media browsing rather than social media communication.====Our results show that social media use lowers subjective well-being, and the negative impact is mainly from social media browsing. In contrast, the coefficient for social media communication is usually not statistically significant. Other things being equal, one hour increase in the amount of time devoted to social media browsing leads to a 0.178 reduction in life satisfaction on a 1¨C5 scale, while the coefficient for social media communication is usually not statistically significant. Our result on social media browsing is quite comparable to the result in ====, we employ an instrumental variable (IV) estimation using the average time spent on social media in the local area (county) as our instruments. Social media allow users to check their social media sites anywhere, anytime, and the social-media use of other people, especially publishing or forwarding posts, can affect an individual only through individual browsing or communication on social media. As a placebo test, we show that other alternative formats of browsing, e.g., reading hardcopy prints or reading on other non-social media, has no significant impact on people's subjective well-being.====We then explore four possible mechanisms or explanations for the adverse effects of social media browsing. First, we examine the potential role of social comparison in which people compare their life with others when they read news and social media updates by friends. We do find evidence that the negative effect of social media browsing is more pronounced with low-income people, suggesting that the adverse impact may be more substantial for people in a disadvantageous socioeconomic status. We also find that low-income people are adversely affected by news reading or contents posted by opinion leaders or strangers.====Second, we study the ¡°information cocoons¡± mechanism, which implies that social media browsing may lower one's subjective well-being by locking users in the information they are more inclined to believe. We exclude the information cocoon effect by showing that social media browsing does not ¡°crowd out¡± browsing from other information sources. This result is similar to the conclusion in ==== in that social media use does not crowd out the browsing of news from traditional channels.====Third, we explore whether the information fragmentation effect may be a source of the negative impact of social media use on happiness. Information fragmentation is a social issue caused by the explosion of information on the Internet and the expansion of social media (====; ====). The information fragmentation may severely distract people's attention and can lead to problems like information overloading, lack of concentration, and fear of missing out (====). We investigate if this can cause the negative impact of social media use on individual well-being. Our results suggest that information fragmentation does not lower subjective well-being but improves it instead by providing opportunities for relaxation and entertainment, especially when individuals are working or spending a considerable amount of time waiting for something.====Fourth, we study the ¡°crowd-out effect¡± mechanism in which social media use may crowd out when people engage in face-to-face social interactions or outdoor activities. Our findings on this mechanism are a bit mixed. While social media use does lower functional face-to-face interactions and outdoor activities, it seems to ¡°crowd in¡± face-to-face interactions. We conjecture that this difference is mainly caused by the difference between the features of Facebook and WeChat. Specifically, Chinese people use WeChat as their primary messaging application more often than Facebook, and many face-to-face activities are usually scheduled via WeChat than Facebook.====The primary contributions of our paper are the following. First, we use a novel nationally representative data set to study the impact of social ==== on subjective well-being. Second, we differentiate the impact of social media browsing and communication and find the former is a more prominent driver of the negative impact than the latter. Third, we examine different mechanisms through which social media browsing negatively influences subjective well-being. Our results show little support for the information cocoon mechanism but suggest that social comparison and relative income play crucial roles in exerting the negative impact of social media browsing.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== covers the related literature.

Then, we build an 80-genaration overlapping generation (OLG) model by modeling the UE-BMI at both aggregated and individual levels. The baseline model is calibrated and solved to be consistent with our projection, where UE-BMI's gap will bring visible pressure on China's fiscal budget in the next decades. In our policy experiments, our simulation under different fertility scenarios reveals that increasing fertility cannot effectively reduce the gap of the UE-BMI. Meanwhile, a low fertility in the future will induce a permanent welfare loss of households. Increasing the employer contribution rate or canceling the personal accounts of the UE-BMI could relieve the gap issue. However, the existence of crowding-out effects may potentially prevent the government from applying these reforms.","Population aging and increasing longevity pose threats to the solvency of public healthcare systems in different countries (====). As a main result of aging, the rising old-age dependency ratio may increase people's burden related to caring for their elderly parents. Aging also causes long-term fiscal gaps in public healthcare systems with respect to the projected growth of healthcare expenditures related to population aging (====). China has been an aging society since 2000, and the country's aging is accelerating at a high speed; the proportion of the population over the age of 65 has grown from 7.4% (2000) to 8.23% (2010). This growth is intuitively related to the high growth speed of China's national health expenditure. The national health expenditure in China increased from 124.5 billion in 1993 to 1165.6 billion in 2012 (in real terms). These numbers reflect a growth of 12.5% per annum, which is higher than the 9.9% per annum growth of China's GDP (====). The growth rate of health spending per capita from 1995 to 2016 was 10.25% in China. This growth rate is much higher than the 2.92% growth rate in high-income countries, the 5.55% in growth rate middle-income countries, and the 1.46% growth rate in low-income countries (====). This relation can be partially attributed to the growing middle class and the senior population in China. With more affordable biomedical technology and medical services in urban China, these groups prefer Western medicine and demand more and better medical services (====, ====). The rapid aging in China has promoted research on the reforms of China's healthcare systems. Nevertheless, few studies have addressed the effects of population aging on the gaps in the public healthcare system in China, which is the focus of this paper.====Worldwide, the main developed countries have suffered from similar problems caused by aging. In 1987, Auerbach and Kotlikoff (====) proposed the multigeneration overlapping generation (OLG) model to evaluate the impact of aging in the United States. In recent decades, this framework has become a main tool by which to discuss social security reforms related to demographic changes. As applications under this framework, there is a large literature that analyzes the impacts of pension reforms in the U.S. and other countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The healthcare system is another important member of the social security system, in addition to pensions. Multiperiod OLG models can also assess the reforms of healthcare systems under population aging. In the U.S., this approach is applied in computing the transitional dynamics and welfare implications associated with a potential elimination of Medicare (====). The effects of aging on healthcare spending and financing are quantitatively evaluated as well (====). Recently, this framework has also been implemented in the assessment of institutional reforms, e.g., the Affordable Care Act (ACA) reform (====; ====; ====) in 2006. However, we must see that the number of studies about the financing of healthcare systems with multiperiod OLG models is still relatively small when compared with the amount of research on pension reform. However, this lack does not reduce the importance of this issue (====).====; ====; ====). However, few studies have paid attention to the health expenditure effects in the context of population aging using multiperiod OLG models.====There are two major health insurance programs in China: Urban Employees Basic Medical Insurance (UE-BMI), which covers urban employees, and Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URR-BMI), which covers rural residents who were previously covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) before and unemployed urban residents. The UE-BMI covers less than 25% of the total population, but it accounts for 60% of the health insurance expenditure (==== provides a forecast of the revenue and expenditure of the UE-BMI social pooling account. ==== introduces the setup of our 80-generation OLG model. ==== and ==== detail the calibration strategy and policy experiments. ==== contains the conclusion and discussion.====The cohort-component method is the most commonly used technique to project future population size (====). The cohort-component method is adopted here, too. Because net immigration into China is negative and negligible, we take the migration from rural areas into urban areas into account, instead of international immigration. Initial populations are grouped into cohorts defined by age, sex and status (in rural or urban areas), and the projection proceeds by updating the population of each age- sex- and status-specific group according to assumptions about three components of population change: fertility, mortality, and migration. Each cohort survives forward to the next age group according to assumed age-sex-status-specific mortality rates. Migration can be accounted for by applying age- and sex-specific net migration rates to each cohort as well. The size of the youngest age group is also affected by the number of births, which is calculated by applying assumed age-specific fertility rates to female cohorts in the reproductive age span. An assumed sex ratio at birth is used to divide total births into males and females.====To obtain highly accurate data, our projection is based on population data by age¨Csex-status profile, which can be found in Tabulation on the 2010 Population Census of the People's Republic of China. The parameter used in our population projection are listed as follows.",Population aging and its effects on the gap of urban public health insurance in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2100064X,9-Jun-21,2021,Research Article,266

With such information, principals can either impose stronger financial incentives or try to ¡°trigger¡± agents' positive reciprocity by offering a higher fixed rate. Theory suggests that principals who believe in agents' reciprocity would personalize offers so that reciprocal agents increase their effort beyond the self-regarding benchmark. Using a lab experiment, we test the behavior of principals and agents. Our experimental market witnesses significant wage personalization when reciprocity information is available. However, agents' effort levels and principals' payoffs are lower under wage personalization, compared with the sessions where principals cannot personalize offers. Our structural analysis shows that, under wage personalization, agents expect higher fixed wages and reciprocate higher wages less. Information about agents' individual reciprocity is more correlated with the expected wages, rather than the strength of reciprocity toward higher or ====. Principals grant higher fixed wages to workers with lower wage expectations, but because principals cannot personalize offers effectively according to the strength of reciprocity, the performance of wage personalization is limited.","With the increased availability of detailed individual-level information, personalization has become an important topic in many dimensions of our daily life. In consumer goods markets, personalized products or product recommendations have been well documented (====). Personalized medicine has also received considerable attention (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Even in labor markets, anecdotal evidence shows that firms actively screen their potential workers and make personalized offers. A recent research report by Glassdoor (====) found both ¡°explained¡± and ¡°unexplained¡± increases in the average hiring time for US job seekers. Interview methods that have become more popular include background checks (25% in 2010 and 42% in 2014) and personality tests (12% in 2010 and 18% in 2014)¨Call of which contribute significantly to lengthening hiring time. Many research institutions in China in recent years have also been reported to use a ¡°Yi Ren Yi Ce¡± policy==== when recruiting highly qualified scholars. These policies open the possibility of wage personalization at different levels of recruitment, and yet the flexibility of such a policy also receives heated debate.==== In this paper, we consider behavioral measures that contain reciprocity information: If an agent is reciprocal enough, will the principal choose to ¡°trigger¡± her reciprocal response by using a ¡°kind¡± wage offer?====To address this problem, we first construct a theoretical model to illustrate features of wage personalization. In our setting, a principal is allowed to select a combination of a fixed rate and a piece rate for an agent. The agent tends to care about the principal's profit and positively (negatively) reciprocate if the wage offer becomes higher (lower) than the agent's expected wage level. Such wage level is modeled using a reference point parameter. Facing a self-regarding or less reciprocal agent, the principal's optimal strategy involves using a piece rate with only the minimum level of the fixed rate. However, she may use a contract with a higher fixed rate to achieve a better economic return if she expects that agents will positively reciprocate her offers.====Next, we use a lab experiment to test the potential effect of personalized contracts. Given that organizations have rich information on employees' reciprocal motivations, they have incentives to use such information to induce employees' strategic responses. We adopt a two-stage experimental design: At the first stage, a reciprocity response curve for each agent is elicited using a trust game (====).==== Players do not interact and no feedback is provided at this stage. Participants then enter into the second stage, learn detailed instructions of the contract game, and play for another 15 rounds with randomly rematched partners. In half of the sessions, each principal in the contract game can personalize their wage offers based on the individual-level reciprocity measure (the ¡°individual information¡± treatment). In the other half of the sessions, each principal can only observe the average reciprocity information for all agents in the session (the ¡°social information¡± treatment), so that such personalization is impossible. Principals with more accurate individual-level reciprocity information may benefit from personalized offers.====Our results find evidence of above-minimum fixed wages and wage personalization. A significant portion of principals uses higher-than-minimum fixed rates. In the individual information treatment, principals offer a higher fixed rate and a lower piece rate to a more reciprocal agent. Yet principals' payoff becomes lower in the individual information treatment, compared with that in the social information treatment.====To understand the impacts of agents' wage expectations, as well as their relative strength of reciprocity, we use structural models to calibrate the two reciprocity-related parameters. We explore how measures of reciprocity information are correlated with these two parameters and how principals can best-respond based on the reciprocity information they receive. Our structural estimations show that agents expect higher wages in the individual information treatment, and also reciprocate higher or ==== more weakly, compared to the social information treatment. We find that the information about individual reciprocity obtained by the principal is significantly and negatively correlated with the agents' wage expectations, but not the strength of reciprocity. That is, agents who appear more reciprocal have a lower wage threshold for reciprocating positively, but they are not more sensitive to wage increases relative to that threshold.",Reciprocity information and wage personalization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000638,5-Jun-21,2021,Research Article,267

A simple model demonstrates that for these reasons, rural-to-urban migrants are less likely to own housing units in cities and as a result accumulate less ","The household registration (hukou) system is one of the most important institutional arrangements in modern China. Its effects on individual behaviors and outcomes have been studied extensively, especially in terms of ====, welfare access, and labor market outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new approach and examine the effect of hukou status on decisions and outcomes in the urban housing market.====In the past few decades, China's urbanization has had two salient features. First, there has been a massive rural-to-urban migration (====). Hundreds of millions of rural people moved to cities without being able to convert their hukou status. As a result, in any Chinese city today, a large number of urban residents still have rural hukou, which has a wide range of implications about their access to local services and opportunities. Second, China's urban housing market has experienced a rapid price appreciation (====). Nationally, the average residential housing price increased from 1948 to 7614 yuan per square meter from 2000 to 2017, and this growth was much faster in larger cities.==== Thus owning housing properties has become the most important way of accumulating household wealth for urban families in China.====We argue that for three key reasons, urban residents with rural hukou are less likely to become homeowners than comparable residents with local urban hukou. First, rural hukou status implies higher uncertainty, which is a result of job instability for adults, a lack of educational resources for their children, and limited access to social benefits. Second, rural hukou status implies limited access to subsidized ==== loans. Third, rural hukou status implies limited access to subsidized home ownership opportunities that are available to residents with local urban hukou. We propose a simple model to clarify the conditions under which all three reasons lead to a lower probability of becoming a homeowner and in turn accumulating less wealth.====We use the 2013 China Household ====This paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, it contributes to the literature on housing demand. A large body of research on housing demand focuses on how income uncertainty affects tenure choice. In the early theoretical work, ==== and ==== show that a higher income uncertainty reduces housing demand. Consistent with the theoretical prediction, subsequent empirical research generally finds that more income uncertainty reduces housing demand and the probability of becoming homeowners (====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These existing studies use a variety of measures of income uncertainty, including the share of the female spouse's earnings in family income (====, ====; ====; ====), the probability of becoming unemployed (====), and whether a married couple has the same occupation (====). Unlike the previous research, we employ a unique institutional factor in China, the hukou system, to measure uncertainty. Because one's hukou status is related to access to secure jobs, public schools, and social welfare, rural hukou workers are highly unsure whether they can continue to live in the cities in the future. We take advantage of this unique source of uncertainty and examine its impact on housing tenure choices in cities.====Second, this paper contributes to the wealth inequality literature. Rising wealth inequality has been an important social problem around the world and has attracted much scholarly attention (====). A large body of literature addresses the wealth inequality issue in developed countries, including the U.S. (====; ====; ====; ====), Denmark (====), and Sweden (====). Since the market-oriented reforms in 1978, wealth inequality in China has been rising too. According to ====, the top 10% of people in the wealth distribution in China owned 40% of the total wealth in 1995, and this number had risen to 67% in 2015. ==== conclude that net housing wealth explains a large part of the rising wealth inequality in urban China. However, little is known about how and to what extent the hukou system affects the wealth inequality in urban areas. Our results suggest that hukou status contributes to wealth inequality through its impact on homeownership. That is, rural hukou workers have lower homeownership rates in cities and thus they accumulate less wealth amidst the background of rapid housing price appreciation.====Third, our study adds to the literature about the socio-economic consequences of hukou. Existing studies have found that the hukou policy leads to low educational attainment among the rural population (====) and low cognitive task performance of rural migrant students (====). It also creates wage discrimination in the labor market (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), and causes productivity losses (====). Our research provides insight into how the hukou policy affects households' housing tenure choice and in turn, wealth inequality in urban China.====The paper is structured as follows: ==== details the institutional context of this study. ==== presents the theoretical model of housing tenure choice. ==== describes the data and empirical specifications. ==== presents empirical results. The final section concludes.====To simplify notation, we define ====?=?====???====???==== and ====?=?====(1?+?====)???====(1?+?====). We assume ====?>?0 (i.e., one cannot borrow more than what is needed to finance the housing purchase) and ====(====)?>?0 (i.e., there is an expected gain from owning housing properties because otherwise the housing and mortgage markets would not exist). The consumer's optimization problem can be rewritten as follows:====The first-order conditions are given by:====where ====¡ä is the consumer¡¯ marginal utility from the numeraire good when income is ==== and ====¡ä is the consumer¡¯ marginal utility when income is ====.====Combining the two first-order conditions, we obtain ====[====¡ä(====???====(1?+?====))]?=?0. Since ====¡ä?>?0 and ====(1?+?====)?>?0, it follows that ====(====¡ä====)?>?0. Recall that ====?=?(1?+?====)====?+?====. This implies that ====. Given that ====(====) is an increasing function, we know ====. That is, when a consumer's optimal level of investment in housing is higher, her expected wealth is higher. Intuitively, this is easy to understand. A dollar saved in period 1 can be either put in savings to earn a fixed rate of return ==== or invested in housing. If in optimal conditions a consumer invests an extra dollar in housing, it must be true that she expects to have more wealth by doing so. Therefore, if anything increases a consumer's optimal level of housing investment, it also increases her expected wealth.====Proof of (1):====From the first-order conditions, the comparative statics result for ==== is given by the following equation:====where ====?=?[(1???====)====¡ä¡ä?+?====¡ä¡ä]====[====¡ä¡ä(====(1?+?====)???====)====]?+?====(====¡ä¡ä====)====[====¡ä¡ä(1?+?====)====]???====[====¡ä¡ä====(1?+?====)] is the determinant of the Hessian matrix==== We assume that the second-order conditions hold, so ====?>?0. Since ====¡ä¡ä?<?0 and ====?<?====, (====¡ä???====¡ä) is also positive. Thus, ==== has the opposite sign as the expectation term ====[====¡ä¡ä(====???====(1?+?====))].====Note that the expectation is over the random variable ==== (housing price appreciation rate). Following ====, we define the coefficient of absolute risk aversion ==== and let ==== be the value of ==== when ==== makes ====???====(1?+?====)?=?0. From the first-order condition, we know ====[====¡ä(====???====(1?+?====))]?=?0. We can rewrite it as ====. Under the assumption that the coefficient of absolute risk aversion ==== is decreasing with wealth ====, whenever ====???====(1?+?====)?>?0, ====; whenever ====???====(1?+?====)?<?0, ====. Thus, ====[====¡ä¡ä(====???====(1?+?====))] is positive, which implies that ====. Given that ====, it follows immediately that ====.====Proof of (2):====From the first-order conditions, the comparative statics result for ¦Ë is given by the following equation:====We know that ====?>?0, ====¡ä?>?0, ====¡ä?>?0, ====¡ä¡ä?<?0, ====¡ä¡ä?<?0, ====?>?0, ====?>?0, and 1?>?====?>?0.

Employing household panel surveys between 1989 and 2011 and exploiting variations in time intervals between the first and second child, we find that spacing births at longer intervals significantly increases female labor market participation. The effects of birth spacing are robust to various examinations that consider nonlinear specifications, selection on observed and unobserved variables, and the plausibly exogenous instrument. The heterogeneous analysis suggests that the effects of birth spacing are more pronounced in women with a daughter as the first birth, women with late first birth, and less-educated women. We examine potential mechanisms and document that women with longer birth intervals are likely to invest more in continuing education and have better health status.","Fertility timing is commonly considered to be a key determinant for female labor participation, and its importance for labor supply has been widely discussed by both policymakers and scholars. In contrast to the extensive literature on the relation between first-birth timing and female labor market outcomes (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====), only a handful of studies have investigated the potential impact of birth spacing on female labor market outcomes (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====).====Besides, none of the existing studies focus on the impact of birth spacing between the first and second child in explaining Chinese female labor market participation. Under fierce competition and insufficient protection in China's labor market, the opportunity cost of a second birth is dramatically increasing for females in the form of job loss. Investigating how birth spacing affects female labor market participation is vital for understanding the role of postponing birth in mitigating penalties for motherhood and designing government policies to promote China's female labor participation rate. In this paper, by taking advantage of China's one-child policy (OCP), we shed light on the causal effect of birth spacing on female labor market participation and identify its potential mechanisms.====Birth spacing is an essential fertility choice that affects female labor market outcomes. First, spacing births at long intervals may help women make more investments in continuing education, which could improve female labor market outcomes through the mechanism of human capital accumulation (====; ====). Second, the current literature has shown that a markedly short birth interval is associated with increased risk for maternal health (====), suggesting that spacing birth at long intervals may promote female labor market outcomes because of its positive impact on mother's health. Third, since closely spaced births tend to increase the health risk for children (====), a relatively long birth spacing may promote female labor participation for its contribution to children health.====This paper compiles panel data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) with the OCP penalty multiplier from ====, which is defined as the multiplier (years) of annual household incomes for one unauthorized birth at the provincial level (====). The sample used in this study is limited to women with only two children in urban sites because the OCP was strictly enforced for urban residents. Following the previous literature (====; ====; ====Our empirical results suggest that spacing births at longer intervals positively affects female labor market participation. On average, delaying a second birth by one year would significantly increase the probabilities of participating in the labor market by 11.51 percentage points for married women in the urban area. The positive effect of birth spacing is robust after performing various robustness checks that consider nonlinear specifications, selection on observed and unobserved variables, and the plausibly exogenous instrument. Also, we find that the effects of birth spacing are more pronounced in women with a daughter as the first birth, women with late first birth (age > 23?years), and less-educated women (education < 9?years). Moreover, in the analysis of mechanisms, we document suggestive evidence that women with longer birth intervals tend to invest more in continuing education and have better health status.====This paper contributes to the current literature on the role of female fertility decisions in explaining labor market outcomes. A wide range of studies has documented that childbearing reduces women's labor supply and wage rates due to career interruptions, which implies the enormous opportunity costs of childbearing, including foregone investments in human capital and possible skill depreciation (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Also, researchers have devoted increasing attention to exploring the impact of parenthood timing on female labor market performances. The existing literature has shown that postponing motherhood positively affects mothers' subsequent labor market outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====). Our work provides additional evidence to supplement previous findings regarding the role of fertility timing in labor market behaviors (====; ====).==== show that birth spacing significantly increases test scores for older siblings. ==== demonstrates that a longer birth interval increases female labor market participation and incomes over a long period after the second birth. Our study identifies the causal impact of birth spacing on female labor market participation in China, which makes a valuable contribution to the literature on how the time interval between the two children affects female's labor market outcomes. We also reveal that women's education and health are the primary mechanisms that drive the main results.====Third, our work contributes to the burgeoning literature on empirical strategies. ==== and ==== adopt biological fertility shocks, such as miscarriages and stillbirths between the first two live births, as the IVs to solve endogenous issues in birth spacing. This identification strategy is widely used in previous studies to examine the effect of first-birth timing on female labor market behaviors (====; ====). However, using biological fertility shocks is problematic because these events may be nonrandom and associated with certain unhealthy behaviors, which directly affect female labor market outcomes through their impacts on health (====Finally, this study complements the existing literature by investigating the effects of birth spacing on female labor market outcomes in developing countries. The current studies have well documented the positive role of birth spacing in female labor market behaviors in developed countries (====; ====). In contrast, few studies focus on how birth spacing affects female labor market outcomes in developing countries. As empirical evidence may vary across countries due to institutional differences (====; ====), our work provides a valuable supplement to the empirical literature. Besides, this paper augments the current understanding of female labor supply in China (====; ====; ====; ====), economic reforms (====), social norms (====), birth quantity (====), first-birth timing (====), childcare and eldercare support (====; ====), etc. However, little research shed light on examining the impact of birth spacing on female labor supply in China.

Subsequently, government spending on healthcare increased significantly. Simultaneously, public hospitals experienced rapid expansion. This study empirically examines whether supply-induced demand existed for public hospitals during the expansion process, based on hospital longitudinal data from 2007 to 2016, which is matched with individual patient data. We found that medical expenditure increased rapidly, while the quality of medical services did not change significantly during the hospital expansion. In addition, due to the price regulation of medical services, public hospitals mainly passed on the costs of expansion by inducing hospitalization and diagnostic over-testing. Furthermore, supply-induced demand was more obvious in diseases for which doctors had more asymmetric information. Based on the evidence provided in this study, the expansion of public hospitals has resulted in a waste of healthcare resources and a rise in the healthcare burden on patients. This has certain implications for further deepening the reform of public hospitals.","Notes: The data is from the China Health Statistical Almanac; the number of hospitals is standardized, based on the value in 2007, in ====b.====Behind this fact are two opposing hypotheses. First, the increase in demand for healthcare services has stimulated supply, which may exist in a relatively competitive healthcare market. Unfortunately, China's healthcare market is relatively monopolistic, with large public hospitals often having extreme monopoly power at the regional level (====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Correspondingly, public hospitals are less prone to mergers and acquisitions, and public hospital expansion is more driven by government policy. The different motivations for public hospital expansion may influence the final impact of the expansion on the healthcare market. Clearly, research in this area is still very sparse. As such, this study further expands the empirical research on the excessive medical behavior of public hospitals in China.====This study also makes marginal contributions to the empirical testing of SID. Early empirical studies examined PID through the ¡°availability¡± effect, assuming that an increase in the physician population ratio would lead to a decrease in the average income of physicians that would incentivize physicians to provide more services. Generally, these studies conclude that availability is positively associated with utilization (====; ====; ====; ====). There are few studies in this field in China. Based on provincial data, ==== investigated the impact of the entry of for-profit hospitals on medical expenditure. ==== studied the effects of increased supply of medical resources and induced demand on the rise of medical expenditure. However, the drawback of these studies is obvious, namely that the large supply is probably due to the large demand. It is difficult to distinguish whether demand stimulates supply or supply induces demand, especially under price regulation. Recently, empirical research has focused on the changes in medical service utilization following exogenous demand effects or reductions in physician payments (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Similar to above literature, this study uses ratings shocks to empirically examine changes in the behavior of medical institutions during the expansion process. Here, ratings shocks are main supply shocks faced by healthcare institutions, and we also provide evidence to avoid being affected by changes in patient demand, thus identifying SIDs.====Additionally, this study complements existing research by identifying the different manifestations of SID, based on the unique price regulation system in China. Hospitals must follow government-guided pricing standards when setting prices for their medical services and drugs (====; ====; ====; ====). The purpose of price regulation is to maintain fairness in access to medical services by reducing the price of basic medical services, usually below marginal cost. In compensation, the government provides subsidies for public hospitals, and also enforces strict barriers for entry into the medical market. However, government subsidies of public hospitals have gradually decreased after the medical marketization reform to account for less than 10% of the medical revenue of hospitals. Public hospitals have to set high prices for other services to maintain a reasonable revenue, especially for drugs and technological diagnostic tests, such as CT and MRI scans. The distorted incentive mechanism caused by price regulation may undermine the efficiency and fairness of the healthcare system. Therefore, price regulation has long been criticized for excessive medical treatment in China (====; ====; ====). The latest literature mainly used micro-data to examine the excessive medical treatment of hospitals in the context of some recently adopted policies (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These policies (i.e., drug-percentage policy, or zero-markup on drugs) attempt to reduce the overuse of drugs in hospitals. These studies found that in hospitals, substitution existed between diagnostic over-testing and drug over-using. This study examines SID during the hospital expansion and finds a similar phenomenon: when hospitals are controlled for the percentage of drug expenditure, SID is mainly manifested by excessive diagnostic testing.====The remainder of this study comprises five sections: ==== briefly introduces the ratings system of public hospitals in China, while ==== discusses data and variables. ==== describes the study's empirical strategies. ==== presents the empirical results.

Instead, government-led pro-poor policies must be instituted by providing employment, education, training and other opportunities to the disadvantaged groups, in addition to the usual social assistance.","). This is why the ==== stated that the poverty target of the MDGs would not have been realized if China was excluded. Relative to China's contribution to global growth, which fluctuated around 30%, China's achievement in the fight against poverty is indeed a true miracle.====As a consequence, it can be stated that China had already eliminated abject poverty, using the 3% threshold set by the World Bank.==== The COVID-19 pandemic will not affect this statement. In view of such an historical achievement, two important questions arise. First, how did China win the battle against abject poverty? More precisely, what roles did growth and income distribution play? Addressing this question is of utmost importance to the development community in general, and developing economies in particular. They are interested in learning from China. Additionally, in view of the debate following the publications of (====; ====), answering this question is also of some theoretical significance (see the next Section).====The second question is related to relative poverty. Since abject poverty was expected to be eradicated, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held on October 28¨C31, 2019, China announced a strategic change: in the future targeting relative poverty rather than absolute poverty which has been targeted since mid-1980s. Such a strategic change also appeals for evaluations on the roles of growth versus redistribution. If growth played a dominant role in contributing to China's poverty reduction miracle, one naturally would ask: Can China continue relying on growth to combat relative poverty or shall China focus on income inequality instead?====While there are previous attempts to investigate the roles of growth versus income inequality in reducing absolute poverty in China, little is known about these roles when relative poverty is considered. As a matter of fact, the literature on estimating relative poverty in China is rather recent and scarce. ==== is one exception who estimated relative poverty in China at the national and provincial levels, concluding that relative poverty had been rising in China as well as in every province. Another exception is ====. They focused on relative poverty in urban China, which is found to have been rising steadily. In particular, the poverty rate under the relative poverty line of 60% median income tripled from 1988 to 2013, reaching 20% in 2013.====It is important to point out that official poverty statistics at the provincial level has not been released to the public, hindering investigations into poverty determinants beyond the individual or household level. This prompts scholars to estimate absolute poverty using non-official data. For example, based on 1988, 1995 and 2002 data from China Household Income Project, ==== estimated absolute poverty for rural China only. Taking advantage of grouped income data, ==== estimated national and provincial poverty rates from 1978 to 2014. They found that the China's poverty rate dropped to a negligible level of 1.85% in 2013 from a high level of 88.32% in 1981. Similarly, poverty was prevalent in all provinces in the early 1980s. But 21 provinces managed to eliminate abject poverty by 2013. Inland provinces, however, still faced challenges in poverty eradiation.====Given the above discussions, this paper focuses on evaluating the roles of income growth and income inequality in affecting China's absolute and relative poverty, making contributions to the relevant literature in the following aspects====:====First, we estimate both absolute and relative poverty for a majority of Chinese provinces and for the period of 1978¨C2018, using grouped income data that are published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. As mentioned earlier, these provincial estimates covering such a long period, particularly regarding relative poverty, are lacking. Second, for the first time we evaluate the roles played by growth versus income inequality in affecting relative poverty in China. As reviewed in the next Section, although there are previous attempts to assess these roles, they mostly focus on absolute poverty, not relative poverty. Third, and related to the second contribution, we introduce panel-VAR modelling including the ==== to the poverty research literature. We will also discuss why the conventional poverty decomposition technique is not applicable when relative poverty is considered. Fourth and finally, we undertake a comparative study, highlighting the different roles played by growth versus income inequality in affecting absolute and relative poverty. This will facilitate derivation of policy implications, helping China prepare for the next battle against poverty.====The remaining contents of the paper are arranged as follows: ==== provides a brief literature review, focusing on the determinants of absolute and relative poverty. The analytical frameworks of data generation, poverty estimation, poverty decomposition and panel-VAR modelling will be outline in ====. ==== presents and discusses empirical results.

We specify alternative measures of human capital and apply them to an enhanced growth model, which we estimate parametrically, nonparametrically, and with a threshold model. Our results show that economic convergence is pronouncedly conditional on human capital across all measures. The positive ¡°benefit of being backward¡± due to lower initial income is almost trumped by the negative impact of low levels of human capital in the poorest areas.","Economists have long realized that the effects of human capital on growth and convergence are more complex than originally recognized, for example, in the pioneering paper of ====. Among the most important challenges are to assess, separately, the impacts of human capital, (i) indirectly, on convergence from low initial levels of GDP and, (ii) directly, on the GDP growth rate itself. Resolving these complications begets another challenge: to evaluate the effects of human capital across alternative measures of it. This paper attempts to reconcile these unresolved inconsistencies by comparing the estimated impacts on growth of alternative human capital measures under alternative working mechanisms.==== In 2014, GDP per worker in the richest provinces/municipalities, such as Jiangsu and Tianjin, were about four times those in the poorest provinces such as Gansu and Yunnan. This disparity is also apparent in regional aggregates, with the coastal region enjoying both a higher level and a stronger rate of growth of GDP per worker, and the west region falling farther behind (====; ====).====In our approach to understanding the impacts of human capital on growth and convergence, we compare the results of applying two education-based human capital measures and a novel income-based comprehensive measure. These measures are: (i) the proportion of workers graduated from high school or above; (ii) workers' average years of education; and (iii) human capital stock per worker constructed using the Jorgenson-Fraumeni (J-F) framework. The J-F approach not only accommodates heterogeneous labor but also incorporates many aspects of human capital accumulation beyond formal education.====When using these measures to explain how human capital has affected regional economic growth and inequality in China, our work follows the theoretical underpinnings of ==== and complements and extends the empirical results reported in ====. An advantage of our one country, provincial-regional approach is that estimation results are less likely than cross-country studies to be confounded by unobserved differences in unmeasured human capital quality and by neglected heterogeneity in institutions across observations (e.g. ====).====, ====, and ====. However, the effect of human capital only takes the simple functional form specified in the canonical neoclassical convergence model when average years of education is used. We find that average education has the strongest effect on convergence in the early stage of development, while high-skilled human capital exhibits the largest effect in more advanced stages of development.====More complex modeling is required to capture both the operating channels and the mechanism of human capital's effect on growth when the measure of human capital goes beyond average schooling years. Recognizing this complexity is the key to resolving important puzzles that have hindered our understanding of the growth process. We construct a general model that allows two mechanisms through which human capital affects economic growth: (i) indirectly through convergence toward an equilibrium growth path and, (ii) directly on the growth path itself. The rate of convergence, as well as the marginal effect of human capital on growth can vary among human capital thresholds. This setup helps uncover the whole picture of how human capital affects growth and convergence. For example, our understanding of the ability of low-income regions to catch up with their high-income counterparts is highly dependent on how we measure human capital. High-skilled human capital appears to matter more for more developed regions, while the comprehensive J-F measure discloses a critical input into the ability of poor regions to converge (relatively) toward their high-income counterparts. We also find strong evidence that the mechanism of human capital's impact on growth changes across different human-capital threshold levels.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== briefly reviews relevant literature. ==== introduces the human capital measures and describes the data. ==== lays out the traditional convergence model and demonstrates how its implications vary across different measures of human capital. ==== discusses the human capital threshold effect on convergence speed; and ==== presents semiparametric results of the impact of various human capital measures on growth and convergence.

To cope with this, China implemented the ¡°selective two-child¡± policy in 2013, followed by the ¡°universal two-child¡± policy in 2016. The ¡°selective two-child¡± policy stipulates that couples can have two children if one of them was an only child (from 1-OC family), while the ¡°universal two-child¡± policy stipulates that all household can have two children.====The most well-known theory in economics to understand the number of childbirths is ==== and ====. Assuming that parents treat their children equally, and that families face budgetary constraints, more children generally mean lower quality education and lower per capita family resources received by each child, leading to a decline in the quality of their human capital. The elasticity of the number of children and their education quality differs depending on their parents' income. Generally, income-quality elasticity amongst low-income families is more significant and that of quantity is smaller, but with increased income, quality elasticity may decrease and that of quantity increases, thus the tendency of change in quantity and quality is usually opposite (Becker and ====; Becker and ====). Therefore, low-income parents tend to have more children than to improve child quality; but for higher-income parents, the opposite is more likely to be true. The theory is often referred to as the quantity-quality trade-off theory, or simply the Q-Q trade-off theory in the literature. In developing countries where public goods such as education and health care are in short supply and families are more likely to be financially constrained, the Q-Q trade-off is often more pronounced.====Further, in China, a widespread intergenerational exchange has been well documented (====; ====; ====), manifested in the financial support provided by working adults to the elderly, and the service support provided by the elderly to the working adults, otherwise known as ¡°intergenerational nurturing¡±. An increase in the number of children may expose families to further resource allocation trade-off. Two children may increase the probability and duration of intergenerational care provided by the elderly, thus may increase the economic transfer from working adults to the elderly. Meanwhile, an increase in the number of children may reduce family financial support for the elderly, possibly requiring the elderly to provide counter-support downwards, thus creating intergenerational competition. With an ageing population, attention to family economic transfers to the elderly is important for their welfare.====).====This paper contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, the literature that examines the quantity-quality trade-off (Q-Q trade-off) theory has found mixed results; some papers support the Q-Q trade-off theory (====; ====; ====), whilst others do not (====; ====; ====; ====). Studies using Chinese data mostly support the Q-Q trade-off hypothesis (====; ====; ====; ====) except ==== and ====. The Q-Q trade-off theory has two implications, a decrease in child numbers increases their quality, and the other is that an increase in child numbers decreases their quality. Due to the long-standing OCP in China, empirical studies have mainly focused on the first implication, studying whether family planning policies for fewer children improve the quality of children, and rarely discuss the changes in intra-household resource allocation behavior from an increase in the number of children. Although ==== examined whether family planning relaxation policies reduce the quality of children, they mainly affect rural households, which may be quite different from urban households. Using twins data, ==== were clear in its identification strategy, but limited in its sample in mostly rural areas and in specific families. This paper provides new evidence of the Q-Q trade-off theory for urban households when the family control policy is relaxed.==== found that having more children leads to a reduction in time available for home educating, resulting in lower achievement. This paper examines the financial resource mechanism of Q-Q trade-off. The possibility of having another child reduces the financial investment in the human capital of the current child, which in turn reduce the future quality of children.====Third, this paper contributes to an extensive literature on family intergenerational relationship. Both the altruistic motive (====; ====) and the exchange motive (====; ====) have been suggested to understand intergenerational transfers. Both explanations have been supported in the empirical literature. ==== focused on the pattern of private transfer payments in South Korean households, finding that the elderly spent much time caring for their grandchildren, and that financial support provided to the elderly by working adults was likely to be influenced by exchange motives such as paying the elderly to care for their grandchildren.====Similar findings have been observed in China. For example, ==== also made a similar finding and stressed that this finding remained true regardless of whether the child is a son or a daughter. ==== further added that the working adults did not increase the probability of financial support to the elderly because the elderly care for their grandchildren, but the amount of financial transfer was significantly increased.====Further, researchers have also studied the transfers amongst three generations. ==== proposed that upward and downward transfers across generations characterized intergenerational transfer in households; elderly in more impoverished financial situations received financial assistance from their children, and it was also prevalent that the elderly provide financial assistance to their grandchildren. ==== noted that there was a competition between the elderly and the grandchildren in the context of limited family resources. If the elderly did not provide care for their grandchildren, families might sacrifice intergenerational support for the elderly in order to increase financial commitment to the increase in children. Contrastingly, for those elderly who do care for their grandchildren, as their caregiving tasks increase with the increased number of grandchildren, the adults may compensate for that commitment by increasing the intergenerational transfer. Similarly, ==== found that the input given to the generation of one's grandchildren had a significant positive effect on the intergenerational financial support of the rural elderly. This paper extends the impact of the Q-Q trade-off on the literature of intergenerational transfers. Since the ¡°selective two-child¡± policy may put additional demand on family's financial resource and caring time, and thus understanding the change pattern of intergenerational resource allocation will further our understanding of both the Q-Q trade-off theory and the intergenerational transfers.====Finally, understanding family's trade-off between child quality and quantity is also essential for a wide range of public policies.

Considering there is no perfect market in the real world, firms do have an optimal level of leverage, and there is a link between leverage and firm value (====).====To maximize its value, a firm will adjust its capital structure toward its target leverage level when the benefits outweigh the costs of making the adjustment (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Essentially, capital structure determines a firm's cost of capital, which contribute to a firm's decision in making corporate investment (e.g., evaluate net present value of a project). However, target (optimal) capital structure is not static. It may change over time due to exogenous events, such as economic and stock market conditions. Hence, a firm needs to make adjustment toward its target capital structure. If the realized capital structure is too high or too low, it means a firm make sub-optimal corporate investment decisions. Hence, it imperative to examine the determinants on the capital structure adjustment speed (====; ====). Therefore, the determinants related to the costs or benefits of capital structure adjustment attract much scholarly attention. As ==== note, the dynamics of capital structure is ¡°perhaps the most important issue in capital structure research today.¡±====Many theoretical and empirical studies examine the internal factors related to managerial-shareholder agency problems or financial constraints on capital structure adjustments (====; ====). In addition, a growing body of literature demonstrates the impact of ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== and ==== suggest that compared to formal institutions, informal institutions require a long time to develop, but they significantly affect an economy's socio-economic evolution and consequently shape firm behavior. However, few studies examine how ==== institutional factors affect the dynamics of firm capital structure.====This paper examines how social trust, as an informal institutional factor, impacts firms' capital structure adjustments. Previous studies on social trust consider it a means for maximizing long-term benefits between parties (====) and a foundation for market transactions (====). ==== suggests that social trust is an important lubricant for economic development. Several other studies suggest that social trust is a catalyst for economic growth (====; ====; La ====) because it enhances human capital (====), and improves corporate investment and trade (====) at the economy-wide level. At the firm-level, the literature documents that social trust enhances informal financing (====; ====; ====; ====) and lowers transaction costs (====). Collectively, these studies suggest that social trust has economy-wide and firm-level impacts. Our study fills a gap in the literature by advancing our understanding of the relationship between social trust and capital structure adjustment decisions.====We conduct our analysis using a sample of Chinese firms. The Chinese environment is interesting for three reasons. First, as defined in ====, there are two types of trust: generalized and personalized. The former is a set of beliefs about the behavior of a random member of an identifiable group of individuals, while the latter is related to how one person interacts with another specific person to whom he or she has already had a relationship. The literature on social trust (e.g., ====; ====) focuses more on generalized trust. Due to the influence of Chinese Confucian culture, social trust in the Chinese context does not necessarily refer to generalized trust; it includes personalized trust as well. Interestingly, ==== report that trust among Chinese citizens is generally low in a 40-country study but according to the World Value Survey, trust among Chinese respondents is the second highest in the world. We attribute the difference due to the different focus on generalized and personalized trust in these studies. Different from previous studies, Chinese survey data are available to disentangle social trust into generalized trust and personalized trust. Thus, we motivate our study by examining the impact of generalized versus personalized trust on capital structure adjustment in the context of China.====Second, with history spanning more than 5000?years, China has a long tradition of local languages and culture that has evolved into social norms. This socio-economic evolution with different social norms shapes local practices and social trust (====; ====). Thus, we expect to find that social trust across different Chinese provinces is heterogeneous but within a single institutional environment (====), which means that the samples exhibit a high degree of variation in social trust levels across regions and relatively homogenous elements in other aspects. Hence, our methodology is different from studies regarding the institutional determinants of capital structure dynamics (e.g., ====) because we exploit variation in the strength of the institutional environment within a single country and therefore circumvent the problem of correlated omitted variables that plagues cross-country studies.==== In contrast, the State Council issued ¡°Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Further Doing a Good Job in Private Investment¡± to continue to ease firms' financing issues.==== Collectively, some firms continue to use debt, suggesting that they are slow adjusting downward to their optimal capital structure while other firms face difficulty in obtaining debt, indicating that they are slow adjusting upward to their optimal capital structure. Hence, the capital structure dynamics is a major economic development issue in China. Our findings for the impact of social trust on capital structure dynamics, in part, help to explain why the slow adjustment to optimal capital structure exists in China.====Generalized trust refers to the trust between strangers. We argue that high generalized trust leans toward more to reduce information asymmetry between strangers, which makes it easier for strangers to make financial contracts and lowers borrowers' financial constraints. The generalized trust serves as social capital that allows a firm to obtain financing. Thus, when a firm is located in a high generalized trust environment, all else being the same, it has lower financial constraints and adjusts to its optimal capital structure faster. Personalized trust is trust between parties that have had previous interactions (such as neighbors, colleagues, friends, relatives etc.). If a manager seeks ==== at the expense of shareholders, he or she suffers reputational capital loss and will be penalized in a high personalized trust environment. In this regard, personalized trust leans toward more to mitigate agency conflicts between managers and shareholders. Thus, agency problems are alleviated, which leads to faster adjustment toward optimal capital structure. While our arguments related to generalized and personalized trust suggest different channels of impact for capital structure adjustment, they lead to the same result¡ªfaster adjustment when a firm is located in a high generalized or personalized trust environment.====By leveraging the availability of generalized and personalized trust metrics in China, we find that, as expected, when a firm is located in a high social trust region (either generalized or personalized trust), it adjusts faster toward its target capital structure. Moreover, in the subsample analyses for the transmission channels, we document that the impact of generalized trust on the adjustment speed is magnified if the firm already had stringent financial constraints, but it is not related to the severity of a firm's agency problems. In contrast, the impact of personalized trust on the adjustment speed is more salient for firms with less-severe agency problems, but it is not related to a firm's financial constraints. Hence, generalized and personalized trust impact capital structure adjustment through different channels. Additional analysis suggests that the impact of social trust on capital structure dynamics is primarily through debt rather than equity. Furthermore, we find that when a firm is located in a weak formal institutional environment, the impact of generalized trust on the adjustment speed strengthens, suggesting that formal institutions and generalized trust are partial substitutes. Interestingly, the substitution effect of formal institutions and personalized trust is weak.====We make three contributions to the literature. First, we advance the literature on the dynamics of capital structure. We find that in addition to internal and formal external institutional factors (====; ====; ====; ====), an informal external institutional factor, the social trust level (both generalized and personalized) in which a firm located, plays a role in the speed of adjustment toward a target capital structure. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to document the impact of social trust on the adjustment speed toward a target capital structure, and in the process, we disentangle the impacts of generalized and personalized trust.====Second, we enhance the understanding of the impact of the informal institutional environment. Although several studies demonstrate the importance of social trust for promoting economic development across countries (====; La ====; ====) and managerial agency problems (====; ==== and ====, ==== into a unified framework on the impact of social trust, transmission mechanisms, and the relation between formal institutions and social trust by carefully examining the impacts of generalized and personalized trust.====Third, our findings based on generalized and personalized trust have implications for countries that have sociological characteristics similar to China. For instance, we expect Japan, South Korea, Italy, and France¡ªcountries that have a strong Confucian or family-centric culture¡ªwould exhibit similar characteristics of generalized and personalized trust as we find in China. Thus, our findings carry implications for these countries in terms of firm behavior toward capital structure adjustment and other corporate policies through the lens of social trust.====This table presents the definitions of all variables.","Generalized trust, personalized trust, and dynamics of capital structure: Evidence from China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000584,24-May-21,2021,Research Article,274

The pseudo panel enables us to control for cohort-specific heterogeneities when estimating the Mincer equation, and the results show that individual circumstances play a prominent role in determining income advantage. Counterfactual analysis further reveals the importance of cohort-level circumstances: individual circumstances account for less than 10% of the observed income inequality, whereas equalizing both the individual circumstances and the cohort fixed effects reduces income inequality by 30%. Among the individual circumstances we examine, gender and paternal characteristics contribute more to income inequality than does hukou of birth. Subsample analysis shows that China's western provinces exhibit the highest inequality of opportunity and that the inequality of opportunity among younger cohorts is smaller than that among older cohorts.","Popularized by Roemer, among other economists, the notion of equality of opportunity¨Calso known as luck egalitarianism¨Cprovides the norm of a morally fair distribution of resources with which an individual should be endowed (====).==== Underlying this notion is the idea that the part of inequality in outcomes that is attributed to circumstances is unjustifiable (====, ====; ====; ====, ====; ====). Theoretical studies have shown that an unequal initial endowment can result in inefficient resource allocation and a waste of human capital (====; ====; ====). Empirical findings, though not conclusive, suggest that inequality of opportunity may hinder economic growth in the long run (====; ====).==== Faced with the rising income inequality worldwide, both economists and policy makers have realized the importance of leveling the play field for national and global development (====; ====; ====).====Although China ranks among the economies that have achieved the fastest growth rate in recent decades, it still faces the challenges of inequality of opportunity. For example, the rigid son preference leads families to allocate resources toward boys (====).==== Moreover, the initial gap can be further enlarged through intergenerational transfer (====; ====; ====; ====).====Using a nationally representative household survey ¨C the China General Social Survey (CGSS) ¨C this paper studies the degree to which the observed income inequality in China can be attributed to unequal opportunity. Following the literature that draws on ==== conceptual framework to study inequality of opportunity (IOP), we categorize the factors that could affect individuals' advantage: those that are at least partly subject to individuals' volition and choice (effort variables); and those that are due to circumstances beyond their control (circumstance variables). Adopting the parametric approach proposed by ====, we estimate the Mincer equation, regressing individuals' advantages on both the effort and the circumstance variables. We then use the point estimates to conduct a counterfactual analysis on the changes in income inequality when all the individuals in the sample share the same circumstances. The difference between the actual and the counterfactual income inequality provides a measure of IOP of China.====Among the studies that use the parametric method to measure IOP, the majority estimate the Mincer equation by OLS due to the lack of longitudinal household surveys, especially in developing countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).==== ==== prove that in the presence of the issue of omitted circumstance variables, the IOP index calculated from OLS estimates of the Mincer equation is a lower-bound estimate of the true measure. A small number of recent studies draw on longitudinal household surveys to measure IOP and argue that the fixed-effects estimates produce an upper-bound estimate of the true IOP, assuming that all the circumstances are time-invariant. The upper-bound interpretation stems from the fact that all the individual fixed-effects are equalized in the counterfactual calculation, but they could include factors that cannot be considered circumstances (====, ====; ====; ====).====The pseudo panel, constructed from repeated cross-sectional surveys, provides an upward correction of the current lower bound and reduces the risk of overfitting to some extent.==== ==== suggests defining cohorts with fixed membership and aggregate individual observations at the cohort level, so as to track the cohort fixed effects when the genuine longitudinal household survey is not available. The pseudo panel consists of cohort means. Deaton shows that the within estimators of the pseudo panel are consistent, once corrected for the measurement error. Realizing that typical efforts to address the downward bias by essentially increasing the number of types examined could result in upward distortion due to the overfitting issue, ==== argue that the best model specification should balance the two sources of bias. By introducing the cohort fixed effects, the pseudo panel model can explain more heterogeneity in the outcome variable, while being more parsimonious than the model in which the full set of interactions of variables defining the cohort explicitly enters. ==== use the cross-validation method to find the best model specification, which may lie somewhere between the most parsimonious model, in which all the circumstance variables enter linearly, and the fully interacted model. The pseudo panel, by its construction, stands in the middle ground, thus providing a model that could be closer to the best model specification, in the sense of ====.====Our list of effort variables consists of education, work experience in the nonagricultural and formal sectors, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) membership. The circumstance variables include gender, hukou at birth, and a set of paternal characteristics that existed when the respondent was age 14. As some of the effort variables and all the circumstance variables are time-invariant, the cohort within estimator does not identify the coefficients of these variables. Therefore, we further apply the Hausman-Taylor estimator to the pseudo panel sample to estimate the coefficients of observed time-invariant covariates in the Mincer equation.====We find, according to the estimates of the Mincer equation, that the circumstance variables have a greater impact on individuals' income advantage than effort variables have. Counterfactual analysis shows that equalizing only observed individual circumstance variables brings about a very limited reduction in income inequality; however, there is a significant drop in income inequality when we equalize both observed circumstances and estimated cohort fixed effects, indicating the important contribution from cohort-level circumstances to the observed income inequality. In our discussion in Section 4, we further decompose the full sample by region and by generation to study the spatial and generational variation of IOP in China. The results show that the western provinces have higher IOP than the eastern and central provinces and that the IOP of younger cohorts is lower than that of older cohorts. We also find heterogeneities in the contributions of individual circumstances to income inequality across subsamples.====Our analysis based on the pseudo panel estimates ¨C which allows us to distinguish between individual and cohort circumstances ¨C enriches the literature that studies the inequality of opportunity in China. The previous research focuses primarily on the contribution of individual circumstances. ==== were the first to measure IOP in China between 1989 and 2006, using the OLS estimates of the Mincer equation. Their results show the significant effect of parental characteristics on income inequality. ==== find that the hukou system is the most important circumstance determining the inequality of opportunity in education in China. Similar to ====, we find that gender and paternal attributes contribute more than hukou of birth to the observed income inequality. Moreover, our results suggest that circumstances at the regional and temporal levels have a stronger influence than individual circumstances have on China's current income inequality.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first introduce the conceptual framework; we then discuss the identification strategy and describe the data. In Section 3, we present the pseudo panel estimates and the results of the counterfactual analysis for the full sample. In Section 4, we discuss the variations in IOP across regions and across age cohorts.

In this study, we build a conceptual framework to clarify the critical role of local land supply in relation to fiscal expenditure on R&D. We treat the establishment of China's nine Land Supervision Bureaus in 2006 as a quasi-natural experiment, and run a difference-in-differences regression to identify causality. The results show that local governments allocate more fiscal expenditure to R&D in response to land-use supervision, which monitors illegal land granting behaviors, and this effect is stronger in cities where leaders have higher political career incentives and cities with greater ====. Moreover, we find that land-use supervision increases the probability and scale of firms' access to government subsidies for R&D; thus, enhancing regional innovation capacity. Our findings document that China's land resource is a curse for its innovation-driven growth as it impedes local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D.","Innovation is an important driving force for long-run economic growth (====; ====). However, economists generally agree that the market fails to provide sufficient quantities of research and development (R&D) as it has some characteristics of a public good (====). In particular, R&D activities inherently entail market failures due to incomplete appropriability of the returns, so private firms invest in R&D activities below the socially optimal level, leading to the necessity of government funding (====; ====; ====). In the past decades, substantial studies have investigated the effect of public R&D support programs on private R&D (====; ====; ====), but little is known about the determinants of local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D. In this study, we emphasize the important role of land supply using a quasi-natural experiment in China.====; ====; ====). On the other hand, because China follows a unitary communist system with a multi-layered tournament-based organization (====; ====; ====; ====), local governments cannot affect macroeconomic policies made by the central government.====Given that public R&D support programs have a significant and positive effect on private R&D (====; ====; ====) and land supply plays an important role in economic growth (====; ====; ====), we focus explicitly on the critical role of land supply as a driver of local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D. Specifically, because land supply reduction impedes local economic performance (e.g., ====; ====; ====), bureaucrats tend to mitigate this negative shock to their promotion opportunities by enforcing fiscal incentives for R&D, which can promote economic growth by increasing innovative activities (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Therefore, we build a simple conceptual framework to clarify this mechanism, and hypothesize that decreasing land supply significantly strengthens local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D.====To identify the causal effect of land supply on fiscal incentives for R&D, we exploit the establishment of China's Land Supervision Bureaus (LSBs) in 2006. Specifically, the Chinese State Council set up nine LSBs to prevent local governments from granting land illegally, suggesting that the establishment of the LSBs provides a plausibly exogenous variation in land supply. Treating this reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we conduct a differences-in-differences (DID) regression, which explores two-dimension variations, that is, the distance from cities to the LSBs and the year before and after 2006. Using the data of prefectural-level cities from 2004 to 2009, the dependent variable is the ratio of fiscal expenditure on R&D to total fiscal expenditure.====Subsequently, we examine whether the effect of land-use supervision varies with the degree of ==== and the political career incentives of city leaders. First, given that local governments are endowed with greater financial autonomy under higher fiscal decentralization, we expect to observe a stronger effect. On the other hand, if city leaders face a higher promotion probability, they would pay more attention to economic performance, so we predict a stronger effect. Further, based on two sets of firm-level databases, we explore how land-use supervision affects the probability and scale of firms' access to government subsidies for R&D. Finally, we discuss the effects of land-use supervision on regional innovation capacity and the efficiency of fiscal expenditure on R&D.====This study makes three major contributions to the literature. First, unlike previous studies that have explored the effects of public R&D and R&D tax incentives on private R&D (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), we emphasize that local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D are endogenous. Second, our study contributes to the literature on the determinants of regional innovation capacity, such as labor protection (====; ====), gender diversity (====; ====), and financial constraints (====; ====). Our study extends the literature by exploring how regional innovation capacity might be influenced by land supply, which is an important but rarely examined factor. Third, our study supplements the literature focusing on the existence of natural resource curses (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Whereas previous studies have provided contradictory evidence from different perspectives (e.g., economic growth and fiscal efficiency), we argue that land resource abundance is a curse for local governments' fiscal incentives for R&D that impedes innovation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the institutional background of land development and the establishment of LSBs in China is introduced.

Taking a difference-in-differences approach, we find that receiving online education during the COVID-19 lockdown improved student academic results by 0.22 of a ====, relative to pupils without learning support from their school. Not all online education was equal: students who were given recorded online lessons from external higher-quality teachers had higher exam scores than those whose lessons were recorded by teachers from their own school. The educational benefits of distance learning were the same for rural and urban students, but the exam performance of students who used a computer for online education was better than those who used a smartphone. Last, while everyone except the very-best students performed better with online learning, it was low achievers who benefited from teacher quality.","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated unprecedented public-health concerns. Many countries have imposed lockdowns in order to reduce social contact and contain the spread of the Novel Coronavirus (====; ====; ====). As part of lockdowns, the closing of schools has created considerable challenges for teachers, students, and their parents.==== This lost time at school may well have an adverse impact on children's educational outcomes and their future well-being (====; ====; ====; ====). To help mitigate the effect of physical closures, many schools have provided online lessons to their students.====We here evaluate the effectiveness of distance delivery of education on student academic outcomes, using administrative data on Ninth Graders from three Chinese Middle Schools in the same county in Baise City. These three schools (which we will call Schools A, B, and C) administered different educational practices over a seven-week period from mid-February to early April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown. School A did not provide any online educational support to its students. School B used an online learning platform provided by the local government, which offered a centralized portal for video content, communication between students and teachers, and systems for setting, receiving, and marking student assignments. The students' online lessons were provided by School B's own teachers. School C used the same online platform as School B over the same period, and distance learning was managed by the school in the same fashion as in School B. The only difference between Schools B and C is that, instead of using recorded online lessons from the school's own teachers, School C obtained recorded lessons from the highest-quality teachers in Baise City (these lessons were organized by the Education Board of Baise City). For students in the Ninth Grade, all Middle Schools in the county had finished teaching them all of the material for all subjects during the first five semesters of Middle School (from September 2017 to January 2020). Schools B and C then used online education during the COVID-19 lockdown (from mid-February to early April 2020 in the final (sixth) semester) for the revision of the material that had already been taught, to help Ninth Graders prepare for the city-level High-School entrance exam at the end of the last semester in Middle School. After the COVID-19 restrictions were loosened, all Middle Schools in the county reopened on April 6==== 2020. On April 7====, Ninth Graders were told that the local Education Board had scheduled exams to take place from April 9==== to the 12==== in each of the subjects that they had been taught in Middle School. The exam in each subject was the same for all Ninth Graders in each of the Middle Schools in the county.====The different educational choices made by the three schools during the COVID-19 crisis offer a natural experiment to identify the causal effects of online education on student academic performance. Our difference-in-differences (DID) estimation reveals that online learning during lockdown improved student performance by 0.22 of a ====, compared to that of students who received no learning support from their school. The quality of the lessons also made a difference: students who had access to online lessons from external best-quality teachers achieved 0.06 standard-deviation better exam results than those whose lessons were recorded by teachers from their own school. The effects of online education were the same for rural and urban students, but were more effective for students who used a computer as their learning device than for those who used a smartphone. We then show that the benefits of the distance learning in Schools B and C were not equally distributed by student quality: quantile DID estimates show that low-achieving students benefited the most from distance learning, with there being no impact for the top academic performers. As such, online delivery of education helped narrow the achievement gap between struggling students and their higher-achieving peers during the COVID-19 lockdown.====We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, there has been little quantitative research on the educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.==== Using survey data from Arizona State University, ====, Primary-School students in Belgium experienced significant learning losses in standardized tests administered after the COVID-19 school lockdown, as compared to the previous cohort. ==== show that students in the Netherlands made little or no progress when learning at home during an eight-week lockdown, with the learning loss being the largest among students from disadvantaged families. Moreover, ==== use high-frequency internet search data to show that the rise in the demand for online resources is substantially higher in high-SES than in low-SES areas. During lockdowns, remote learning is probably the only way to tackle the disruption in classroom education (====).==== However, there is not yet any empirical evidence on the impact of different types of online education on student performance when schools are physically shut under human-mobility restrictions.==== Using data on students from China's Middle Schools, we here present novel evidence on the causal impact of online education on student academic performance during the COVID-19 crisis, and ask whether some groups of students did better than others.====We second add to the experimental evidence on the effects of instruction models on student performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). There are two common features in the existing work: the analysis first compares the relative effects of face-to-face, fully online, and blended learning, and second is carried out for post-Secondary education. The calculation of the absolute effects requires information on a fairly rare reference group: students who receive no learning support from an educational institution over the period but take the same exams as the other treated students. Our data here include students from a Middle School who received no learning support from their school during the Chinese school shutdowns, but who took the same exam as the other students immediately after returning to school once the COVID-19 restrictions were released. The comparison of these students to the online-learning students in the other two Middle Schools provides causal evidence on the absolute effects of online education on the exam performance of Middle-School students.====Last, we provide new evidence on the effect of teacher quality on student achievement. Previous work such as ====; ====; ==== and ==== has underlined that better-quality teachers in conventional classrooms improve student outcomes. We extend this literature to online education, and ask whether students who received the online lessons recorded by external higher-quality teachers made more academic progress than did those whose lessons were recorded by their own teachers (with all other aspects of online education being managed identically).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Of all the social changes, later and lower rates of marriage of the general population have drawn increasing academic attention from demographers, sociologists, and economists. In 2007, the term ¡°leftover women¡±==== began to be disseminated by the state media in China to label women who are aged 27 or above, well-educated, but never-married from the traditional and conservative gender perception. The ¡°age threshold¡± then was reasserted by the All-China Women's Federation (a government-sponsored mass organization) in their official report of the 2010 ====.==== Since then, mass media both within China and overseas have covered ¡°leftover women¡± as a new social phenomenon.====Two seemingly paradoxical phenomena in the marriage market have surfaced, distinguishing China and other East/South Asian societies from those in the West. First, unmarried women and ¡°surplus¡± men co-exist. Between 1980 and 2010, the age at the first marriage among urban women has risen from 23.9 to 25.1.==== By the end of 2000, 12.7% of urban women aged 20 or above, which is the legal age for marriage, had never married. This share had then increased to 16.2% by the end of 2010, although there were 0.7 million more unmarried men than unmarried women of the same age cohort in cities. This trend is particularly concentrated among women in their late 20s or 30s. Between 2000 and 2010, the non-marriage rate of urban women aged 25¨C29 increased from 26.8% to 30%, while there were 0.24 million and 0.26 million ¡°surplus¡± urban never-married men of the same age cohort respectively in 2000 and 2010. Similar observations have also been documented in other East and South Asian societies (====). By contrast, there is a positive impact of women's scarcity on the likelihood of their marriage in the U.S. (====) and other developed countries (e.g., ====).====Second, women's education negatively relates to the probability of marriage in China (====) and could even make parents ¡°compensate¡± their daughters' better education by dowry in other Asian contexts (e.g., India in ====, ====), while there is no such correlation in western countries (e.g., the U.S. in ====) although women's pre-marital education exhibits positive causality with post-marital surplus in terms of spousal education and income (e.g., the U.S. in ==== and the UK in ====). By the end of 1987, 13.3% of urban women aged between 25 and 34, namely the main cohort for urban women and who had ==== higher education, had never married.==== This percentage remained at 13% in 2000, but quickly rose to 20% in 2005. By contrast, among urban women of the same age cohort but without tertiary education, the rates of singleness were 4.73%, 7.5% and 8.48% respectively in 1987, 2000 and 2005 censuses, which are 33%¨C50% lower than those of the better educated women. When looking at the composition of the never-married, 9.2% (about 10%) of never-married urban women in the 25¨C29 age cohort in 1987 have completed at least college education.==== It grew to 33.6% in 2000 and then, more quickly jumped to 53.2% in 2005. Similar observations can also be seen in all other cohorts. 15.7% of couples (including those having been divorced) have better educated wives than husbands in 2000, but this share decreased quickly to 10.4% in 2005 along with fast urbanization (which increased by a similar size ¨C 6.77 percentage points ¨C over the same period). By contrast, in the U.S. 30% of couples born between 1957 and 1964 have more educated wives than husbands (====).====Given these paradoxes, we are interested in: 1) which women have never married, i.e., an ensemble portrait of those labelled as ¡°leftover¡±?; 2) what explains women's later and less marriage while they gain increasing independence in career and education in a gender ideological context that has remained largely traditional?====The present study adds to the literature in the following ways. First, capitalizing two national surveys, we investigate the effects of a rich bunch of determinants of women's marriage entries that have been documented in theoretical or empirical research in western countries, such as education, income, jobs, personality, leisure activities, physical attraction (anthropometrics as well as a unique objective indicator for beauty), family ====, and conditions of the local marriage markets.====The existing literature ascribes less marriage of well-educated women in Asian contexts to substituting more education and career opportunities for marriage/fertility under ==== rational agent model (e.g., Taiwan in ====), squeezing marriage markets under educational assortative mating (e.g., China in ====), and paradoxical marriage values such as unwavering desires for family formation and increased personal freedom (====). We hope to add to this debate with causal estimates from transitional societies such as urban China.====Second, we offer a new mechanism underlying the impact of women's (higher) education on their marriage entry from perspectives of conservative gender norms. We conceptualize and quantify those norms going beyond gender roles and framing differential social spheres that are proper for each gender, as suggested by ====.====Lower fertility and associated family changes in western societies are attributed to ideational/attitudinal changes towards more equal gender roles in household production in ¡°the second demographic transition¡± since the mid-1960s (====). However, the developing world has not witnessed revolutionary changes in gender ideology, especially in East and South Asian countries where conservative norms and culture have been persisting (====). This trend is similar to, if not severer than, that in other South/East Asian societies such as India (====), Japan and South Korea (====).====We test for the impact of the patriarchal gender norm on marriage via women's education. This norm began to take shape upon the success of Confucianism in ==== times (202?BCE ¨C 220?CE) and has since then been underlying the family system and women's position in it in many conservative societies. That is, while men were seen as the core of the family, loyalty and devotion were viewed as the virtue of women, whose key responsibilities lie in family reproduction, child-bearing and rearing. For ¡°family-oriented¡± women, knowledge was a useless addition rather than a ¡°virtue¡±. Therefore, well-educated women were believed to form a challenge to male superiority and may even cause disorder of family life.====The existing literature shows indirect and suggestive evidence regarding the influence of cultural background on family life in both western and Asian contexts. ==== find that a one percentage increase in the live birth rate of women under age 20 in American teen women's national origin relates to a 2.3 percentage increase in their probability of being a teen mother. ==== shows that Japanese mother-son transmission of gender attitudes affects sons' marriage. She also finds that the U.S. born East Asian husbands spend more time on housework than East Asian husbands born in other countries, and Asian women married to men from countries having higher women's labor force participation rates than that of the U.S. in 1985 experience a 25% drop in their housework time. Similarly, ==== find that Chinese urban men raised by non-working mothers tend to hold traditional gender ideology in that they tend to be averse to having working wives and are less willing to engage in housework than those with working mothers in childhood. The study indicates that the conservative gender norm supported by urban husbands with non-working mothers accounts for 8¨C13% of the reduction in their wives' labor force participation rates, compared with urban women married to husbands raised by working mothers. ==== suspect that it is the persistent traditional gender role division that underlies the diverging directions of the association between educational attainment and family formation. That is, as individuals gain more education, whereas men are more likely to marry, the likelihood of women's entry into marriage decreases.====Despite substantial improvements in their socioeconomic status, women in East and South Asian societies are still confronted by the patriarchal, patrimonial, patrilineal, and patrilocal organization of family life (====; ====; ====). The clearly defined and firmly entrenched patriarchal ideology holds the key to understanding the paradoxical phenomena in East/South Asian marriage markets and explaining why they are different from western societies.====Our analyses find an educational ¡°discount¡± rather than ¡°premium¡± for women's likelihood of marriage formation in urban China, which seems to sharply contrast the empirical findings and theoretical predictions based on the western world. This is ascribable to a ¡°dual role¡± of women's education ¨C as an advantage that brings about a within-marriage surplus identified in the existing theoretical and empirical literature and as a disadvantage that hinders a woman from becoming a ¡°desirable wife¡± in the patriarchal cultures. The latter dominates decisions of marriage formation even where westernized lifestyle has gained much popularity, implying the real-life impact of persist traditional gender norms.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section describes datasets and variables. ==== sets up the analytical framework. ==== presents the results. ==== wraps up with our discussions.","Love, life, and ¡°leftover ladies¡± in urban China: Staying modernly single in patriarchal traditions",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000444,24 April 2021,2021,Research Article,278

Specifically, we investigate the impact of PM==== concentration on job location decisions of Chinese college graduates at the beginning of their professional careers. The results indicate that a 10-unit increase in PM==== concentration raises college graduates' probability to leave their current city by 10% point. We also find larger impacts on graduates from elite colleges and less polluted hometowns. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model in which the location choice of college graduates depends on their wage payment and air pollution. Our findings supplement existent literature in documenting important ways in which air pollution may associate with the loss of highly-educated talents.","Air pollution imposes a substantial health and economic burden on many livings globally, especially in developing counties. Indeed, anecdotal evidence supports a link between serious air quality and brain drain. It is reported that talented professionals in cities in developing countries, such as Beijing and New Delhi, are planning to leave due to the chronic air pollution problems and, therefore, firms have had difficulty in hiring or retaining talents.==== Despite that the impacts of air pollution on various outcomes including infant mortality (====; ====), housing markets (====; ====), labor supply and productivity (====; ====), defensive expenditure (====), and healthcare spending (====) are often discussed, less attention has been drawn to the potentially harmful effect of pollution on migration of highly-educated talents.==== In today's knowledge economy, talented individuals make exceptional contributions to propel the knowledge frontier and spur economic growth. The implications of losing the ¡°Best and Brightest¡± are profound, touching everything from economy to politics and culture.====The purpose of this paper is to quantify the migration response of talented professionals to air pollution in China. Our focus on job location decisions of college graduates in China provides an ideal setting to examine this research question: First, college students are key components of the nation's human capital, which allows us to skip the intractable step of selecting those who are highly educated. Official grouping of colleges mainly based on their quality also helps us to test whether the negative impact of pollution is larger for graduates from elite colleges.==== Thus, studies on the linkage between air pollution and talents' migration decisions are more achievable because of this geographical overlap.====The data link remote sensing PM==== concentration with four waves of Chinese College Student Survey (CCSS) from 2012 to 2015.==== CCSS is the first and most comprehensive large-scale national data on college graduates, which was conducted by China Data Center of Tsinghua University in Beijing. Air quality data comes from Global Annual PM==== Grids derived from satellite data by ====. With the reliable data, we are able to theoretically and empirically investigate (1) whether, and if any, to what extent PM==== intensity affects college students' decision to leave the city their colleges locate in, and (2) the differential effects regarding to colleges with different qualities, hometown with different pollution levels as well as time period before air pollution becomes a public concern.====We first build a simple theoretical model in which the location choice of college students depends on their utility from local wage payment and dis-utility from air pollution. We therefore predict that college graduates are more likely to leave the city in which they graduate due to severer air pollution. Moreover, in view of the generally higher earning capacity of graduates from elite colleges, their utilities are more impaired when faced with higher levels of pollution exposure. The effect of air pollution on college students' relocation upon graduation is consequently stronger for elite college graduates than those from non-elite colleges.====To test our theoretical predictions, we employ a linear probability model to study the effect of PM==== density on college students' probability to leave their college city. We find that higher PM==== concentration is associated with greater probability for college graduates leave their college cities. Our baseline results show that a 10-unit increment in PM==== density increases the probability to leave by a 10 percentage point. This effect is equivalent to 17.9% given the average 56% leaving probability for college students. In addition, following the strategy widely adopted in economic literature (====; ====We then study heterogeneous effects of students from colleges with different qualities, hometowns of different pollution levels as well as impacts before and after 2012. We find that graduates from colleges with higher quality¡ªe.g., 985 colleges¡ªare more sensitive to degradation of air quality, compared with their counterparts from non-985 colleges. Furthermore, we find that the effects of air pollution are pronounced in college graduates from less polluted hometown. We also find the effects of air pollution on the outflow of college graduates to be much stronger after 2012, when PM==== became a focus of public concern and government action. These results are also robust to alternative measures of college graduates' relocation and air pollution as well as to reconstruction of samples.====This study makes several contributions. First, this paper is broadly related to a large body of research in economics on air pollution and its negative impacts on a variety of economic outcomes, including health outcomes (====, ====, ====), life expectancy (====; ====), labor supply (====) and labor productivity (====; ====). In particular, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that individuals engage in protective actions in response to announced risks (====; ====; ====). Our conclusions confirm previous findings that in reaction to information on the risks associated with air pollution, people alter their behaviors not only in short-term ways, such as buying face masks and reducing outdoor activities, but also in long-term ways such as migration. In a general sense, the potential socio-economic cost of air pollution might be under-estimated without considering its impact on talents.====Second, a large literature in both sociology and economics explores the determinants of individual migration decisions, and these studies focus heavily on factors such as labor market demand (====), wages (====), quality-selective immigration policies (====), and climate change (====; ====).==== There is also some evidence indicating that environmental pollution is a significant driver behind decisions to relocate (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; Tan-====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Existing studies generally focus on the effect of air pollution on migration of low-income floating migrants (====), homeowners (====; ====; ====), or nationally representative households (====; Tan-====), and consistently find that pollution level is a determinant of migration decisions, but not as prominent as other socioeconomic factors, such as wage, housing price, etc. Relative less attention, however, has been drawn to the reactions of highly educated group, i.e., college graduates. College students are key components of the nation's human capital, which allows employers to skip the intractable step of selecting those high-quality labor forces. Graduation from colleges also bestows superiority in the labor market, and graduates' decisions to migrate become much more likely to be influenced by air pollution. We use a novel and comprehensive dataset of college students to study the relationship between work location choices and air quality in the city. The rich data on school and student characteristics allow us to test whether there exists heterogenous impact of pollution on graduates from elite colleges, cleaner hometown, different graduate year and gender, etc.====Another contribution of our paper is from the identification perspective. Migration is an extremely costly and complex behavior; thus, many confounders may bias the estimate of migration decision determinants. Migrating to other cities is usually associated with additional job searching, social interaction destruction, and lower income levels (====; ====). Most of the existing studies focus on long-term movements without accounting for these migration costs (====; ====; ====), and the estimates are prone to be biased downward by unmeasured joint determinants of air pollution and migration. Our focus on college students, at the beginning of their professional careers, is advantageous because in their final year before graduation, students have to seek a job, choose the job location and migrate accordingly. The migration incurs relatively less cost, and the set of confounders is likely to be smaller. We also use upwind pollution and ventilation coefficient as instrumental variables (e.g., Tan-====; ====; ====) to further address this endogeneity issue.====Moreover, the detailed information of the survey dataset opens up the possibility of a richer set of findings than most previous research. We utilize the full array of information in our dataset to find, for example, the mechanisms of education quality and hometown pollution levels in promoting migration, the decision-making window of migration, and the effect of destination air quality in prompting movement. Such comprehensive evidence is rare, and the large-scale talent loss of air pollution is highly relevant for policy making, such as incorporating environmental factors in the talent introduction policies of local government.====In conclusion, we contribute to the literature by introducing air pollution as an important determinant for migration of high-skilled workers at the early stage of their professional careers.==== Talented professional is a powerful force that maintains cities' competitiveness and contributes to economic growth.==== Now, the cost of losing the smartest brains is salient for developing countries such as China and India (====). It is important for policy makers in all potential sourcing regions or countries that is suffering from losing talents¡ªsuch as China and India¡ªto be aware of the trade-off between pursuing resource-intensive growth and human capital-supported sustainable development.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Yet, the non-infrastructural outward foreign direct investment (FDI) from China to BRI countries, which varies quite substantially across different sectors and different countries, has not yet received much attention. In contrast to some recent studies showing that the massive initiative has increased China's total FDI outflows to fellow BRI countries, in this paper, based on our sector-level difference-in-differences models, we find that effect to be statistically insignificant. Yet, at the same time, we provide empirical evidence on the sectoral pattern of China's outward FDI before and after 2014 indicating that China's FDI outflows to BRI countries have significantly increased in sectors characterized by overcapacity and contributing to pollution in China, thereby demonstrating that China's BRI-driven outward FDI has been very selective in terms of sectors. We confirm these findings with a variety of robustness checks and show that it is BRI countries with relatively low institutional quality that have been more likely to receive these types of FDI from China. We thus speculate that Chinese firms have been motivated to place FDI investments in BRI countries for the sake of alleviating China's own overcapacity and pollution problems. Our findings lead us to suggest that, although these sectoral patterns are consistent with the different ==== in which China and its fellow BRI-identified countries find themselves, Chinese investors and host country governments should be more concerned with the potential for unwanted side-effects of the FDI investments so that the mutually beneficial effects of the BRI can be sustained into the indefinite future among all countries involved.","Since its launch in late 2013, the BRI has been prioritizing infrastructural construction to enhance the economic ties between China and the other countries involved in this initiative. According to the estimates of ====, the BRI-driven infrastructural investments will reach $2 trillion USD by the 2030s. However, the scope of this massive initiative is far wider than that, especially since outward foreign direct investment (FDI) to the BRI region is indeed an explicit objective of the initiative. Recent studies, such as those of ====, ====, ====, ====, and ====, have shown that, even just since its inauguration in late 2013, the BRI has already increased FDI outflows from China to other BRI countries by between 20% and 50%. Regardless of the reliability of these findings, which is to be thoroughly discussed below, considering both the projected substantial growth of the BRI in general and of its FDI in particular, and yet also the concerns (to be identified below) that have been raised about it, the BRI initiative in general and the determinants and effects of BRI-driven FDI in particular, both from China to other BRI countries, and from these countries to China, deserve serious attention.====In light of the importance of understanding China's FDI outflows to BRI countries, our analysis proceeds in the following two steps. First, we apply a suitably adapted sector-level difference-in-differences (DID) model which demonstrates empirically that, contrary to most existing estimates, China's FDI outflows to BRI countries have not increased overall. In doing so, we thoroughly explain why our results are both different from and more trustworthy than the more positive results shown in previous studies. Second, we apply some variants of the traditional DID model, including a triple difference model, to the available FDI data at the country-sector level and find that China's FDI outflows to BRI countries have indeed increased since 2014 in sectors characterized by overcapacity and pollution problems in China, despite finding no overall increase in China's outward FDI to BRI countries. In addition, for robustness purposes we both repeat the triple difference estimation with some alternative sets of BRI countries and some alternative identifications of sectors characterized by overcapacity and pollution, and we also make use of the variations with respect to overcapacity and pollution across different Chinese provinces. All these estimation results confirm that Chinese firms have indeed been more willing to place FDI investments in overcapacity-related and pollution-related sectors in BRI countries after 2014. Moreover, we also make use of some additional interaction terms involving institutional quality measures, which lead to findings suggesting that it is the BRI-identified countries with lower institutional quality that have become most susceptible to China's outward FDI in overcapacity-related and pollution-related sectors since the inauguration of the BRI in late 2013.====). We suggest, however, that Chinese investors and the governments of FDI-receiving countries should be more careful to avoid the potential for unwanted side-effects of the FDI investments. Only in this way, can the BRI be sustainable and mutually beneficial to all countries involved in it for a long time to come.====The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. We begin in ==== by providing background information on the BRI, China's outward FDI, and their relationships with overcapacity, pollution and other economic concerns in China. ==== reports our data sources, identification strategies and the empirical results identifying the aggregate and sectoral patterns of the FDI outflows from China to fellow BRI countries.

However, little is known about the cyclical pattern of mortality in developing countries. Using China's city-year data, we find that the total mortality in China also exhibits procyclical fluctuations. In exploring the mechanisms, we find that air pollution is one of the reasons for procyclical fluctuations in total mortality. Specifically, economic booms lead to severe air pollution, worsening human health and thus increasing death rates. Moreover, we find that changes in lifestyles may not be an important reason for procyclical mortality in China.","). Inspired by ====, however, many studies have shown that physical health instead deteriorates in good times. Such studies include those conducted by ==== and ==== for the United States, ==== for Sweden, ==== for Norway, ==== for Japan, ==== for Spain, ==== for Germany. Overall, these studies have documented that mortality, measuring the most severe negative health outcomes, is procyclical. That is, mortality rates tend to rise (fall) during periods of macroeconomic upturns (downturns). In the literature, however, there is little empirical evidence on the cyclicality of mortality in developing countries.====We then explore the mechanisms for the procyclicality of total mortality in China. In explaining why mortality rises during economic upturns, prior studies have emphasized the role of changes in individuals' lifestyles, hereafter referred to as the lifestyle-changing hypothesis (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====; ====; ====). Specifically, during economic booms, the opportunity cost of leisure time increases, making it more expensive for individuals to engage in health-promoting activities (e.g., regular exercise). In addition, when the economy is doing well, the workforce may experience increased workloads coupled with work-related stress, which could negatively impact health.====However, changes in individuals' lifestyles may not be the most important causes of procyclical mortality. First, the labor force accounts for little of the periodic pattern of deaths (====). Because their lifestyles are most likely to be influenced by economic fluctuations, changes in lifestyles in response to labor market conditions are less likely to be an important reason for procyclical mortality. Second, previous studies have often questioned the direction or intensity of behavior changes associated with obesity, physical activity, and alcohol use (====; ====). For example, unhealthy behaviors (e.g., binge drinking) have been found to increase during economic booms (==== ====), as well as during economic recessions (====; ====). Similarly, although individuals may spend less time improving health during good economic times than in bad economic times, some studies also suggested that individuals are happier and have less work-related stress in these periods (====).====In this paper, we propose that air pollution, which is positively related to economic activities, is also responsible for the procyclical fluctuation in total mortality in China (hereafter referred to as the air-pollution hypothesis). On the one hand, China has experienced phenomenal economic development since the reform and opening-up policy in 1978. However, this progress has been driven in part by fossil fuels, which have had deleterious effects on the environment (====; ====; ====; ====). Using a simple career-concerns model, for example, ====As a result, China has ranked first globally for emissions of almost all air pollutants in recent years. The 2016 ==== report released by Yale University shows that China's air quality ranks second to last in the world.==== ====. The increase in income per capita from $5870 in 2012 to $7820 in 2015 indicates that air pollution has been severe in the past few years. Using China's city-year data, we draw scatter plots for each of three air pollutants (PM2.5, O====, and CO) versus GDP growth rate. In Fig. A1 of Appendix A, China's environment deteriorates with its economic development.====Additionally, environmental pollution has detrimental effects on human health (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Using data from the 1981¨C82 recession, for instance, ==== found that a 1% decrease in air pollutants would reduce the infant mortality rate by 0.35%. ====; ====). In China, more than half of the 10 diseases with the highest mortality rates have been associated with air pollution.==== Fig. A2 of Appendix A depicts scatter plots of total mortality rate versus each of three air pollutants by using China's city-year data. A clear positive relationship exists between air pollutants and total mortality rate.====Because pollution levels are highly correlated with economic growth and total mortality, they may act as a mediator to explain why China's mortality fluctuates procyclically; that is, rapid economic development causes severe air pollution, and the latter deteriorates human health and thus increases death rates. To test the air-pollution hypothesis, we follow the strategy proposed by ==== to compare the coefficients on the business cycle measure (i.e., GDP growth rate) between models without and with pollution controls. Using the instrumental variable (IV) estimation, we find that adding pollution controls to the basic model not only substantially reduces the coefficient of the GDP growth rate but also makes it nonsignificant. Most notably, the GDP growth rate coefficient becomes negative when we include a composite measure of air quality in the basic model.====To provide more evidence for the air-pollution hypothesis, we further discuss mortality rates in regions with different levels ====, of different demographic groups, and of various causes of deaths. In general, we reach a similar conclusion that air pollution plays a key role in the procyclicality of mortality. As a comparison, we also empirically test the lifestyle-changing hypothesis. We collect per capita annual expenditure on three commodities (e.g., tobacco) and two leisure activities (e.g., exercising) to roughly measure individuals' lifestyles. Following the same strategy, we find that changes in individuals' lifestyles may not be an important reason for the procyclical fluctuation in total mortality, although it holds for specific regions, demographic groups, and diseases. Therefore, environmental pollution is a mediating factor explaining the procyclical fluctuation in total mortality in China.====This paper potentially makes three contributions to the literature. First, we extend the research on the cyclicality of mortality in developing countries. Due to the lack of data, the literature has paid little attention to the cyclicality of mortality in developing countries, which account for a large proportion of the world population and have experienced higher growth rates than developed countries over the past few decades. To fill this gap, we use annual data of Chinese cities to examine the cyclicality of mortality and find that the procyclicality in total mortality also exists in China.====Second, our study provides a reasonable explanation for the procyclicality of mortality in China. To the best of our knowledge, only a few papers have examined the relationship between economic growth, pollution, and individual health (====; ====; ====). However, ==== focused only on infant mortality in the United States, and ==== estimated the effects of GDP per capita and air pollution on infant life expectancy and cardiorespiratory mortality in China. Extending their studies, we focus on overall mortality and investigate mortality rates of four demographic groups and six causes of death in China. Unlike their studies, the purpose of our paper is to confirm that air pollution works as a mediator to explain the procyclical fluctuation in mortality. Admittedly, our paper is similar to that of ====. Using US data, they found that the inclusion of air pollutants attenuates the procyclicality of total mortality by 17%. We posit that compared with the United States, China provides a more suitable setting to test the air-pollution hypothesis because China has become one of the most polluted economies in the last decade. Moreover, in contrast with ====, we examine the impact of PM2.5 on human health, which is of interest because PM2.5 is the main cause of health deterioration in China.====Third, although many papers have argued that changes in lifestyles can explain the procyclical fluctuation in mortality, direct empirical evidence for these changes is scant. Our paper is one of the first to empirically test the lifestyle-changing hypothesis by controlling for per capita annual expenditures on three commodities and two leisure activities in the basic model. We find that changes in individuals' lifestyles are probably not the primary reasons for procyclical fluctuations in total mortality in China.====This study is presented as follows. ==== describes data sources and model specifications. ==== reports the baseline results and performs heterogeneity tests and robustness checks. ==== tests the lifestyle-changing hypothesis proposed by the literature. ==== concludes the paper.",Air pollution and procyclical mortality: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000432,22 April 2021,2021,Research Article,281

The results reveal that married couples tend to be less satisfied with their marriage if the wife earns more than the husband. Moreover, it seems that the drop in the husband's marriage satisfaction matters more for the drop in the couple's overall marriage satisfaction. By exploring the difference between husbands and wives in their attitudes in terms of economic contribution and housework contribution, we confirm that husbands may have a specific self-image regarding the traditional gender division norm, and can also respond to the wives' gender role preference.","Many previous studies have examined the link between gender norms and behavioral outcomes. Gender norms have been used, for instance, to understand the labor force participation decisions of women (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Despite the fruitful studies mentioned above, few efforts have been made to understand the relationship between gender norms and marital outcomes. More importantly, among a paucity of works that study the relationship (e.g., ====; ====), few of them articulate how gender identity plays a role in building the relationship.====This paper aims to examine the association between the traditional gender division norm ¡ª ¡°men are breadwinners, women are homemakers¡± ¡ª and the marriage satisfaction of each gender in the same marriage using the Chinese data. For this particular research purpose, we construct a couple-level dataset based on the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey data. We approach the research question by studying the behavioral outcomes of different genders within the same marriage when a norm deviation takes place. We choose the situation where the wife earns more than the husband (i.e., a reversal of traditional gender roles) as the norm deviation of our interest. The results reveal that, compared with couples in which the wife does not earn more than the husband, couples in which the wife earns more than the husband tend to be less satisfied with their marriage. Moreover, it seems that the drop in the husband's marriage satisfaction matters more for the drop in the couple's overall marriage satisfaction. We then propose a gender-identity explanation for such results.====We first conceive the gender-identity explanation in light of the gender identity theory initiated by ====, ====. We claim that, on the one hand, both genders in the same marriage can perceive a diminished self-image, and hence feel less satisfied with the marriage. On the other hand, when the norm deviation happens in marriage, the maladaptive behavior of one gender can dissatisfy the other.====To better understand the role of gender identity in building the relationship between the norm deviation and marriage satisfaction, we explore the difference between husbands and wives in their attitudes in terms of economic contribution and housework contribution. We find that compared with couples where the wife does not earn more than the husband, within the couples where the wife earns more than the husband, (1) husbands are less satisfied with their wives' housework contribution regardless of the wives' economic contribution, (2) wives are less satisfied with their husbands' economic contribution regardless of the husbands' housework contribution, (3) husbands do not value their wives' economic contribution differently, and (4) wives do not value their husbands' housework contribution differently.====We also consider an alternative explanation concerning the time constraint that each gender within the same marriage may confront. Specifically, it is likely that, when the wife earns more than the husband, the husband is less satisfied with his marriage because he finds it more difficult to reach a desirable time balance if he has to do the housework left by his wife. We perform regressions by gender considering a relaxation of the time constraint (i.e., the presence of elders who could help with the couples' housework burden) and find that the relaxation does not change the results. This implies that the evidence we find does not support the alternative explanation.====The current study makes two research contributions. First, this paper makes it clear how gender identity plays a role in building the link between gender norms and marital outcomes. Although the previous studies have done a fair bit of work to establish the association, the mechanisms are not well understood. We fill the gap by examining each gender's attitudes towards the changes in household labor division in response to the norm deviation. Several features of the CFPS data allow us to perform the examination properly. On the one hand, the CFPS data contain abundant subjective information, including the most important ones ¡ª satisfaction with spousal housework contribution and spousal economic contribution. On the other hand, the CFPS data have the dual-information structure which makes it more advantageous to perform the couple-level analysis (====). In comparison, the one-answer-for-all survey data (e.g., the American Time Use Survey, and the Chinese General Social Survey) used in most previous studies include subjective information from only one gender per couple.====Second, this paper contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between gender norms and marital outcomes by providing new evidence from China. On the one hand, existing literature that examines the relationship generates inconsistent results. Specifically, ==== find that (1) in couples where the wife earns more, both the husbands and the wives are dissatisfied with the marriage, and (2) the wives tend to do even more housework to compensate for the husbands' unease. These findings support the gender-identity explanation. In comparison, ==== find that (1) in couples where the wife works longer hours in the labor market, the situation dissatisfies the wives but not the husbands, and (2) the wives' dissatisfaction from working longer hours than their husbands is significantly alleviated by an increase in the husbands' time spent doing household tasks. These findings support the perception-of-fairness explanation. This paper, however, finds that (1) in couples where the wife earns more, only the husbands are dissatisfied with the marriage, and (2) although the husbands tend to take up part (but not all) of the household chores transferred from the wives, the wives do not seem to put significant value on the husbands' housework contribution. These findings still run in favor of the gender-identity explanation. On the other hand, the role of the traditional gender norms in shaping the marital outcomes in China needs further efforts. China is experiencing an increasing divorce rate (from the year 2013 to the year 2018, China's divorce rate==== increases from 2.57¡ë to 3.20¡ë). In parallel, China's gender norms are getting more traditional. As evidence shows, the percentage of the Chinese respondents to the World Values Survey that agrees with the claim that ¡°If a woman earns more money than her husband, it's almost certain to cause problems.¡± is 23.9% in 2013 and 26.7% in 2018. These facts combined may imply that, in China, the more traditional the gender norms the more probable the marriage dissolution, considering that the Chinese couples have an increased likelihood to be dissatisfied with their marriage when the wife earns more than the husband. By investigating the relationship between gender norms and marriage satisfaction, this paper echoes the literature==== which explains the increasing divorce rate in China from the perspective of evolving gender norms.====This paper also adds to the happiness economics literature on gender differences in subjective wellbeing. Existing literature has found that men and women differ in their satisfaction towards life or marriage and suggested that gender norms may help explain the difference. For example, ==== find that employed women are not more satisfied with life in communities where the gender wage gap is smaller, which suggests that norms regarding the appropriate relative pay of women compared to men are shaping gender differences in well-being. Similarly, ====, ==== find that part-time women are more satisfied with working hours than full-time women and that women's life satisfaction is increased if their partners work full-time. In comparison, men's life satisfaction is unaffected by their partners' market hours but is increased if they are working full-time themselves. Additionally, ====Furthermore, this paper is related to the economics literature on the relationship between gender norms and female labor force participation. A remarkable change in the female labor force participation rate is observed in many countries. More recent literature resorts to gender norms in explaining such a phenomenon. For example, ==== and ==== and ==== find that gender norms have a significant impact on female labor force participation. ====This paper is also related to the sociology literature that studies the determinants of household labor division. While numerous papers were explaining the household labor division using the exchange-bargaining theory, a growing number provides evidence that is opposite what exchange-bargaining theory predicts but supports the role of gender norms. For example, ==== and ==== find that women tend to compensate with more housework when their earnings exceed the husbands'. Moreover, ==== finds that any norm deviations in terms of either wives' relative earnings or husbands' relative participation in housework increase the risk of divorce. The findings of this paper also support the role of gender norms in the household labor division.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== describes our data source and the analytical dataset we created. Some descriptive results generated from the analytical dataset are also included. ==== reports our empirical results. ==== concludes the paper.",Gender norms and marriage satisfaction: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000456,20 April 2021,2021,Research Article,282

Empirical studies, which conduct rigorous estimations of impacts, can evaluate existing policies and create valuable insights into helpful solutions to economic problems and promote evidence-based policy design.====There are surging research interests in place-based policies as a result. For instance, ==== look into the effect of state aid on capital accumulation. They find that firms receiving the subsidies experience faster growth in output, employment, and fixed assets but slower advent in TFP than those without the benefits. ==== investigate the Regional Selective Assistance program and present positive employment and investment outcomes. The policy impacts, however, are only notable on small firms but virtually zero among large corporations.====Research efforts on the Chinese economy also receive attention, but most of the papers concern the impact of economic zones or industrial parks. For example, ==== research China's economic zones and uncover the policy's all-around positive influences on production and a stimulus for firm entry. ====Although promising research has flourished, identifying the policy's average treatment effect is challenging for several reasons (====): Finding comparable non-treated areas as the counterfactual may be hard. Spillovers and displacement effects may happen to nearby non-treated areas, disqualifying these areas as the proper counterfactual. The treated areas may be affected by other policies on occasions. Lastly, there may be relocations of subjects (e.g., firms), which are the policy's targets, across the treated and non-treated areas. This paper adds value to research on place-based policies in China, as we work within the data constraints and handle these matters prudently.====This study also adds to the economics literature on public policies for industrial transformation and development. The free market is subject to sources of market failures whose presence can cause inefficiency and pose severe obstacles to the economic growth, especially in underdeveloped regions, and the government's strategic planning often involves resource reallocations to address the failures and improve the efficiency (====; ====). Good policies can play vital roles in shaping the development and promoting industrial transformation (====; ====). Our paper offers insights into how the government may facilitate industrial transformation through a place-based policy in the context of resource depletion.====Before proceeding further, the term ==== is worth a clarification. For empirical studies on the Chinese economy, researchers typically associate that word with prefecture cities, the second-level administrative divisions. Nonetheless, the RECT (Resource-Exhausted City Transition) program is not exclusive to prefecture cities. The State has implemented it on a stand-alone third-level unit in some cases (e.g., Leiyang city, Hengyang City; and Dongchuan district, Kunming City) or entire prefecture cities (e.g., Zaozhuang City) in others. In this research, although the empirical analyses always take county-level locations as the geographic units for methodological consistency, the general discussion still uses city this term to be coherent with the program name.====The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. ==== introduces the RECT program with an emphasis on its policy instruments and program objectives. It also presents the background of resource-exhaustion and economic challenges happening in China's mining towns and locations. ==== describes the data and discusses the criteria for choosing comparable subjects. ==== lays the empirical methodology out and communicates how the research handles the main issues for identification. The next three sections present the empirical results and analyses. ==== focuses on firms' performance and analyzes the channels through which the policy affects the production and output. ==== emphasizes the industrial upgrade and investigates the transformation mechanism. ==== addresses heterogeneous over several dimensions of firms and locations. ==== concludes the findings and remarks about the aspects on which the policy may have done well and the areas for which the government may need to retreat. It also sheds light on future research directions.====The total output cannot always be explained by all factor inputs, that is, there is a ¡°surplus¡±. Since then, literature admits the TFP is the ¡°surplus¡± after deducting factors' contribution. A growth accounting exercise is intended to break down the growth of output into the growth of the factors of production, including capital, labor, and productivity. To estimate the TFP, estimation usually starts from the production function. We deliberate the data limitations==== and decide to use the Solow residual (====).

To assess if the investment channel is quantitatively significant, we build a standard model with three broad sectors, but instead add an investment production function employing factors from all three sectors. Moreover, we incorporate investment-composition technological change by allowing the productivities of the three sectoral inputs to evolve over time. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy from 1981 to 2014 and perform counter-factual experiments accordingly. We find that investment-composition technological change accounts for 33.1% decline in employment share of agriculture, 36.0% increase in employment share of manufacturing and 31.5% increase in employment share of services over the period. The magnitude of this effect on the share of services keeps growing, particularly after 2000. Our findings are not unique for China, but also apply to other economies experiencing the ¡°servicification¡± of investment."," Traditional wisdom considers changes in the sectoral composition of consumption as the main driving force of such transformation, while assuming that investment is only composed of manufacturing goods (====; ====; ====).==== If consumption is the only source, countries with high investment rates should witness a slow and prolonged process of structural transformation.====In fact, the acceleration of the rise of services occurred not only in China, but also in many other countries in the past decades, and the sectoral composition of consumption was unlikely to be able to fully account for such transformation. For example, the output share of services increases by 23.3 percentage points from 1970 to 2012 in Japan, 20.1 percentage points from 1985 to 2014 in Korea, and 25.2 percentage points from 1981 to 2014 in China. We later show that changes in the sectoral composition of consumption only push the share rising by 10.6 percentage points in Japan, 15.0 in Korea, and 20.0 in China.====To account for the process of structural transformation and particularly the accelerated rise of services, we highlight the role of the ¡°servicification¡± of investment. The ¡°servicification¡± of investment represents the tendency that the value-added of services accounts for a growing share of investment goods in many countries. It is to a large extent driven by the technological change that requires more service inputs to produce the investment goods. The major form of such investment-composition technological change is the development and deployment of information technology, which promotes investment in intangibles that are produced primarily in the service sector.====). The report also emphasizes the contribution of the information and telecommunication technology. For example, it notes that data plays an increasingly important role in smart manufacturing.====To quantitatively investigate the role of the ¡°servicification¡± of investment as a driving force behind the structural transformation, we adopt the standard framework of ==== with three broad sectors, but instead assume that investment is produced using outputs from the three sectors as inputs. This input-output structure allows us to easily disaggregate investment into sectors.==== We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy. The model successfully mimics the process of structural transformation in China. We find that the changes in relative input prices are not enough to explain the changes in the sectoral composition of investment. Investment-composition technological change that requires more service inputs to produce investment goods is a major force. If held constant, the transformation out of agriculture and the rise of services will be much slower. We find that investment-composition technological change accounts for 33.1% decline in employment share of agriculture, 36.0% increase in employment share of manufacturing and 31.5% increase in employment share of services over the period.====The ¡°servicification¡± of investment pushes the rise of services mainly after 2000. Before 2000, its effect on the share of services is limited. But from 2000 to 2014, it increases the output share and the employment share of services by 4.2 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points respectively, close to 4.1 percentage points and 8.7 percentage points from 1981 to 2014. The investment channel is much more important than the consumption channel, because the changes of sectoral output shares caused by the changes in the sectoral composition of consumption are less than half a percentage point. Thus, we highlight the role of investment in understanding the catch-up of services in China.====We further assess the role of investment channel by assuming that the investment goods entirely source from the manufacturing sector. This alternative model performs much worse than our model. It fails to reconcile the moderate decline of manufacturing with the rising investment rate. In particular, the model predicts steeper curve of the manufacturing share, and accordingly, cannot mimic the rising trend of services in China. Without structural change in investment, the alternative model also predicts a steeper decline of the investment price, which reflects the role of the ¡°servicification¡± of investment in keeping the investment price from falling. Traditionally, the literature argues that labor market wedges are an important driver behind underdeveloped services in China. We also find that wedges cannot fully account for that.====Our paper is connected to a large body of literature on structural transformation. Our model incorporates the standard mechanisms of structural change: the price effect driven by uneven sectoral productivity growth (====; ====) or capital deepening under different sectoral technology (====; ====); and the income effect due to non-homothetic preferences (====; ====; ====). These models focus on the sectoral composition of consumption, but we emphasize the role of investment. ==== and ==== also note that the investment channel is important. In their models, the sectoral composition of investment is affected solely by the relative price of inputs. In contrast, our investment production function incorporates technological change that shifts the relative productivities of sectoral inputs, which turns out to be the other important force behind the ¡°servicification¡± of investment. Moreover, we present a full-fledged model with endogenous investment decision to conduct quantitative analysis on the role of such technological change in structural transformation.====Several papers also study China's structural transformation and pay particular attention to imperfect factor markets (====; ====; ====; ====). We embed in our model reduced form labor market wedges and intertemporal wedges. Some papers distinguish between state and non-state sectors, which is a key feature of China's economic transition (====; ====), but in this paper, we still focus on three broad sectors. ==== explains the rise of the service sector in China by focusing on the consumption side and examining disaggregated service industries. In contrast, we investigate the role of changes in investment composition.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: ==== presents key facts about the sectoral composition of investment, ==== develops the baseline model, ==== calibrates the model to Chinese data, ==== presents numerical results, and ==== concludes.",Servicification of investment and structural transformation: The case of China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000390,7 April 2021,2021,Research Article,284

In this paper, I compare the empirical performance of these two mechanisms in the Chinese context by developing an empirical model and applying it to college admissions in Guangxi, Hebei, and Sichuan provinces. Then, I conduct counterfactuals to empirically compare the BM and DA in these three provinces for given years. I find that not only is the BM superior to the DA in terms of total welfare but also that most students receive lower utility after the switch from the BM to DA.","On June 6¨C8 every year, approximately ten million high school seniors take the college entrance exam (Gaokao) in China. For most of these young adults, the exam is the most important they will ever take, and its results will have a profound influence on the rest of their lives. In each Chinese province, there is a ¡°student placement office¡± (====) that ranks the students in the province based on their exam results and asks them to submit their college preferences. Each college has an admission quota for each province. The offices use a variant of either the Boston mechanism (BM, the sequential mechanism or Shunxu Zhiyuan) or the deferred acceptance mechanism (DA, the parallel mechanism or Pingxing Zhiyuan) to assign students to colleges according to their exam-grade-based ranking, their preferences, and the admission quotas.====Under the BM, students' first-choice colleges are critical. If a student is rejected by the first-choice college, she will probably be assigned to a substantially worse college or even have no assignment. Thus, students must pick their first choice carefully, and many complain about the risks in the decision-making process. By contrast, under the DA, if a student is rejected by one of her choices, the next choice will be considered. Since a student's admission is guaranteed only if the exam score is above the cutoff threshold==== for one of the colleges in the preference list, students feel safer under this mechanism. In addition, the BM has inferior theoretical properties: the DA is Pareto optimum for college admissions in China,==== while the BM is not. Furthermore, the BM is not strategy-proof. Under the BM, students strategically select their preferences; hence, the true college preferences cannot be determined directly from the data. Due to these drawbacks, the BM was abandoned in China.====However, the three disadvantages of the BM mentioned above can be called into question. First, both mechanisms assign the same number of students to colleges, and the admission quotas of the colleges remain the same under the two mechanisms. If the preferences of students are sufficiently homogeneous,==== exchanging assignments between two students would harm one of them. Thus, not all students would benefit from the switch from the BM to DA ¡ª at least some of the students will sacrifice other benefits to enjoy the safety of the DA. Second, although the DA is Pareto optimum, it may not yield the highest social welfare when preferences are cardinal, that is, when students are able to not only prefer one college to another but ==== prefer one college to another. To the best of my knowledge, the general performance of the DA under cardinal preference has not been studied. ====, ==== have demonstrated that the DA is not the best mechanism when no priorities exist or when the priorities of students are coarse. Third, although under the BM the true preferences cannot be learned directly from the data, we can still learn the preferences after constructing a model of the mechanism. Therefore, the following questions arise: can we estimate colleges' quality (or more accurately, their attractiveness) by using manipulated preference data under the BM? Can we compare the empirical performance of the BM to that of the DA in China? Can we estimate the welfare loss (or gain) for an individual student when the mechanism switches from the BM to the DA?====In this paper, I develop a model of the BM to recover the true college preferences of students and then perform welfare analysis. To the best of my knowledge, current models in the empirical literature (====; ====; ====; ====) follow coarse school priorities. Such schools do not differentiate between some of the students; thus, many students share the same priority. In this case, the number of priorities is small. For example, ==== used only three different priorities for all students. However, in the Chinese case, priorities are strict: colleges differentiate students based on their scores, and each student has a unique rank. In this case, the number of priorities is large. The large number of priorities can make the existing models computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. In addition, the models in the literature require the preference data of individual students (that is, micro data). However, in college admissions in China, such data are highly confidential. For example, ==== used such micro data, but they anonymized the names of the provinces due to the sensitivity of the data. The use of micro data also restricts the future reusability of the model because the micro data are not always available. I develop a model that can handle such strict priorities and make estimates using public data: the admission quotas and cutoff thresholds of the colleges.====I estimate the model using public data from the provinces of Guangxi, Hebei, and Sichuan and conduct counterfactuals calculating social and individual welfare under the DA. In these three provinces for the given years, the students apply to colleges after receiving their scores and are assigned to colleges based on the BM. I find that total welfare under the DA is 1.73%¨C6.63% lower than that under the BM. The welfare loss from switching from the BM to the DA is a consequence of the cardinal preferences, given that the DA is the Pareto optimum.==== I also find that the cutoff thresholds under the BM are looser than those under the DA. Many provinces switching from the BM to DA saw stricter cutoff thresholds after switching.==== This change reveals the cost of students' enjoying increased safety under the DA: It becomes more difficult to receive admission if one's rank is not competitive. Intuitively, ¡°good¡± students benefit from increased safety under the DA, while ¡°bad¡± students suffer from stricter cutoff thresholds. However, how good should a ¡°good¡± student be? According to my results, only 0.64%¨C10.65% of students above the key cutoff threshold==== benefit from mechanism switching in Round 1 admission; most students suffer from switching.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows, I review the literature in ====.

In this paper we analyze the impact of HPR on real estate developers and consumers and how their responses affect equilibrium housing prices and sales. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of the HPR by estimating a structural model of housing demand and supply using project level sales data on newly constructed condominium units sold by developers to individual buyers in five large Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuhan,==== and conduct counterfactual analysis to quantify the contributions of various factors to the market outcome and examine the associated welfare implications.====; ====). On the demand side, we treat projects as differentiated products and apply a discrete choice model to describe households' home purchase decisions. On the supply side, our baseline model assumes that real estate developers compete with one another by playing a standard Bertrand pricing game on offered residential projects. We also experiment with alternative assumptions on firms' conduct: assuming the market is more competitive or less competitive than the baseline model. Supply and demand jointly determine the housing market's equilibrium price and quantities. Following the comparative static analysis approach of ====, we estimate the equilibrium model using data from pre- and post-policy periods, respectively, and then evaluate changes in the estimation results and their implications.====Our estimation results show that the overall housing demand in most cities becomes less price elastic after the policy intervention, which suggests that the policy might meet its goal of driving out speculative investors in the housing market. Also, our estimation results in the real estate developers' cost structure suggest that they are eager to sell homes more quickly through lower pricing, which might indicate that they face tighter financial constraints after HPR is implemented. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that the implemented HPR may lead to substantial ==== loss because it changes the structure of demand and hence developers' incentives. Alternative policies that keep the structure of demand unchanged, such as a random lottery, would improve consumer and social welfare in some cases. The findings shed light on how to design housing market interventions that are effective without incurring significant welfare loss.====Our study contributes to the literature on HPR (or other policies) in housing market. Existing studies on HPR in China or cooling measures in other countries mostly focus on its overall effects on the equilibrium outcome, i.e., housing price and sales quantity (====; ====; ====), and very few look at the impact on supply and demand separately (except ====). The general finding is that implementing HPR immediately ¡°freezes¡± the housing market: the quantity sold is reduced sharply and the price increase is slowed down in the short run. For example, ==== use regression discontinuity to find that HPR in Beijing caused a 17¨C24% decrease in resale price and a 50¨C75% reduction in transaction volume. ==== use regression discontinuity method and find that cooling measures in Singapore reduce housing price by 10¨C15%. ==== investigate the effect of HPR on housing prices in Guangzhou, using a hedonic housing price model. ==== is among one of the few that have looked at the effect from both demand side and supply side in four cities. They measure the effect of HPR on supply using government land auction data and a difference-in-differences approach. They find that HPR works mainly through demand but not through the land market or developer supply response because there is no change in land prices or the number of land auctions. Our study differs from theirs by uncovering the intermediate channels on how consumers and firms adjust their behavior in response to policy change, which in turn affects housing market prices and quantity sales.==== developed a sorting model of household discrete choices of residence to describe household preferences for school and neighborhood attributes.

Financial constraints affect firm growth in both developed and developing countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====This paper investigates the policy effects of the VAT reform on firms' financial constraints and potential mechanisms of the impacts using China's Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF) data from 2000 to 2009. We focus on China because it is the largest developing country in the world, and because firms in China are facing unprecedented financial and operational crises caused by domestic and global economic pressures in recent years. Globally, unexpected slowing down in the global economy has weakened the positive effects of opening-up on easing firms' financial constraints in China. Domestically, the high growth rate is no longer sustainable, and traditional sectors undergo transformation and upgrading. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the government to improve financing conditions and alleviate firms' financial constraints. Many policies are introduced, and many measures are taken in response to the situation. For example, the production-based value-added tax (VAT) transformed into a consumption-based VAT system step by step from 2004 to 2009. Under the new tax system, the purchases of fixed assets could be deducted from the final product before paying VAT. The reform generated tax incentives for fixed asset investment (====; ====), which could be served as collaterals for external financing. On the other hand, the reduction of tax liability brought additional operational cash flows to firms, leading to lower demand for external financing and decrease of financing cost. The increase of fixed assets and incerement in cash flows caused by the reform may lessen financial constraints for firms. In sum, the VAT reform provides an excellent opportunity to identify tax deduction's effectiveness in alleviating firms' financial constraints.====To identify the causality between VAT reform and firms' financing constraints, we employ the widely-used quasi-experiment method by exploiting four VAT reform waves. Within each year, eligible firms for the VAT incentives are treated as the treatment group and ineligible firms in the same year as the control group. Following ====Our main results are quite robust to many other specifications. For example, we address the following concerns. (1) The entry and exit of firms would cause the problem of sample selection. (2) The ====This study makes the following contributions to the literature. First, we complement the literature by clearly identify the causality between tax deduction and financial constraints using the VAT reform in the world's largest developing country to construct the DID estimation. Although, in theory, the relationship between tax deduction and financial constraints has been analyzed in detail and in depth, only a few empirical works focus on the causality rather than correlation between them. Other studies focus on heterogeneous effects of tax deduction reform on innovation and investment between more financially constrained and less constrained firms (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), but they don't discuss the direct effects of tax deduction on firms' financial constraints. Second, considering China's unique financial environment, we provide detailed and comprehensive aspects to measure financial constraints, including formal and informal financing channels. We propose that tax deduction can release financing difficulties through firm performance improvement, including the growth of commercial credit and the drop of borrowing cost. Third, it is challenging to find a feasible and effective policy to overcome financing difficulties. Our findings in this paper suggest that tax deduction might be a valid policy instrument.

The central parity rate of RMB is announced daily, by PBoC, on 9:15?am upon the opening of foreign exchange market. The market price of RMB cannot deviate from the central parity rate by more than 2% on that trading day. Prior to the ¡°8.11¡± exchange rate reform, the central parity rate of RMB was virtually set by the central bank in a ¡°black-box¡±. As a consequence, there often existed large discrepancies between the spot market rate and the central parity rate, indicating a relatively low degree of market-orientation of the RMB exchange rate as a whole.====According to the ¡°8.11¡± reform, the market makers of RMB foreign exchange market should offer the quotation prices of RMB before the opening of foreign exchange market, based on the changes in a basket of currencies the previous day, and most importantly, on the closing rate on the previous trading day. The PBoC takes a weighted average of those quotes and announces the central parity of RMB. The setup of an explicit ¡°reference system¡± improves the clarity of the foundation of RMB's central parity rate, thus enhancing the transparency of the formation mechanism of the RMB exchange rate and greatly limiting under-table operations by the central bank. Put differently, the PBoC, to some degree, gives up the autonomy of the formation of the central parity and allows the parity to be determined more by the market after the ¡°8.11¡± reform.====Against this backdrop, this paper aims to investigate the price discovery mechanism and interactions between the RMB offshore forward and onshore spot markets, and what role the ¡°8.11¡± exchange rate reform has played, if any. More specifically, we explore whether there exist spillovers of price changes (returns) and price volatility between the onshore and offshore RMB markets; and if so, whether such spillovers are transformed after the ¡°8.11¡± reform. We also intend to identify possible mechanisms for such a transformation.====We follow the literature to use the offshore RMB non-deliverable Forward (NDF) rate to investigate the price discovery mechanism of forward exchange rate markets.====; ====; ====; ====). The second reason pertains to the advantages of financial derivatives. In particular, highly marketized forward markets (e.g., NDF markets) help predict movements in spot prices and can diffuse information, due to the low cost, flexibility, and convenience of financial derivative transactions (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====We find that a remarkable change has occurred in both the return and volatility spillovers. Before the reform, return and volatility spillovers exist from the offshore forward markets to the onshore spot market. After the reform, however, we observe an reverse in the direction and an increase in the strength of the return and volatility spillovers. These findings suggest the existence of cross-market information flows, a change in the direction and a strengthening of the dynamic relationship after the reform. We argue that the ¡°8.11¡± reform is less likely to be a sudden game changer; instead, it is more likely to serves as a milestone reflecting some long-term underlying forces that increase the relative importance of the onshore market.====This investigation may have important policy implications. For policy makers, changes in the directions of inter-market return (price) spillovers reveal information about changes in the relative predictive power of offshore and onshore market rates (====; ====; ====; ====). Specifically, if the predictive power of the onshore spot rate is indeed enhanced after the ¡°8.11¡± reform, the pricing power of domestic RMB exchange rate would be strengthened.====; ====; ====). In particular, investors can legitimately hedge currency exposure or take speculative currency positions based on the knowledge of the dynamic relationship between the onshore and offshore markets. In the meantime, possible inter-market risk spillovers and transmission also bring challenges for market regulators in order to effectively control market risks.====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====In addition to the work on return spillovers between domestic and offshore money markets, another line of research devotes to the influence of exchange rate regime reforms on such return spillovers. ==== and ==== investigate the influence of the 1997 Korean exchange rate regime reform on return spillovers between the Won NDF rate and the spot rate. Both studies document a cointegration relationship between the two markets in the long run. Additionally, the reform in the exchange rate system leads to a remarkable change in the dynamic interactions between the two markets. Specifically, during the pre-reform period, a mean spillover effect exists from the spot to the NDF market; after the reform, however, the relationship is reversed.====Also related is another strand of literature on volatility spillovers and information spillovers between offshore forward and onshore spot exchange rate markets. ==== discover a bidirectional relationship of volatility spillovers between NDF and onshore markets during a period when Indian rupee comes under downward pressure over the period June 2006 to April 2013. ==== study volatility spillovers between the RMB NDF market and seven of its Asia-Pacific counterparts over the period January 1998 to March 2005. They find empirical evidence that the offshore RMB NDF has been driving fluctuations in various Asian currency markets, and that the magnitude of such a volatility transmission is mainly affected by the degree of real and financial integration.====Regarding the impact of exchange rate regime reforms on volatility spillovers between offshore and domestic money markets, existing studies suggest that exchange rate regime reforms exert significant influence on the volatility spillovers across various currency markets. Specifically, focusing on the 1998 Korean exchange rate regime reform, ==== and ==== both find that volatility spillovers between the spot and NDF markets exist in both directions before the reform. After the reform, however, only a one-way volatility spillover effect exists from the NDF to the spot markets.====Our paper is also related to another line of research on the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets. ==== investigate the impacts of fundamentals, global factors, and government policies on the pricing differential between the onshore and offshore RMB exchange rates. ==== also focus on the CNH-CNY pricing differential, but instead explore the role of RMB market reforms in the linkage between the onshore and offshore markets. Additionally, ==== allow for the asymmetric effect of news or surprises in case of an unexpected movement in the CNH-CNY pricing gap.====Our work differs from the above strand of literature because we aim to explore the price discovery and information diffusion mechanisms of offshore forward exchange rate markets. Thus, with respect to the offshore market we focus on the offshore RMB NDF (and DF) market(s), instead of the offshore RMB (CNH) market, as ==== and ==== and ==== employ GARCH-type models to study the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets. One important advantage of MGARCH models is its ability to uncover useful information contained in the interrelation between different markets, taking into account the interplay between conditional variance and covariance.====To the best of our knowledge, no existing study has analyzed the spillovers between onshore spot and offshore forward markets for RMB across the ¡°8.11¡± reform, a crucial step toward a market-oriented exchange rate regime. We fill this void by providing a thorough analysis of the onshore-offshore return and volatility spillovers across the ¡°8.11¡± reform. Our study makes two main contributions to the existing literature. First, we document a remarkable change in the return and volatility spillovers between onshore spot and offshore forward markets for RMB after the ¡°8.11¡± reform. Particularly, prior to the reform, return and volatility spillovers exist from the offshore forward market to the onshore spot market. After the reform, however, we observe an obvious reverse in the direction and an increase in the strength of the return and volatility spillovers. Second, we further identify possible mechanisms for the reversed spillovers. We attribute the reversed spillovers to some long-term underlying forces that raise the relative importance of the onshore spot market. And the ¡°8.11¡± reform simply serves as a milestone reflecting such long-term underlying forces.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical strategy. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and present the empirical results respectively.

A proportion of individuals may be unaware of the high risk associated with a high-return financial product and thus may purchase financial products inconsistent with their risk attitudes. Participating in our education program significantly reduced individuals' tendency to hypothetically invest in high-risk products, especially for those who are risk-averse. Therefore, rather than randomly assigning the education program to investors, we suggest that risk-averse investors be targeted. We find that the responses to standard financial literacy questions are not related to individuals' awareness of the link between high risk and high return, calling for a newly designed question of financial literacy as proposed in our study.",").====One key consideration in policy making is the level of financial literacy or sophistication of the population of general investors. ====The risk-return trade-off is a basic principle that can be applied to almost all financial products.==== However, many investors are unaware of the high risk of high-return financial products. As a result, investors may purchase products that are not consistent with their risk attitudes. For example, in March 2020, the price of crude oil futures dropped to a historically low level, and thousands of Chinese investors were attracted by financial products based on crude oil. They expected high returns from the investment without fully understanding the extremely high risk in this market. On April 22, 2020, for the first time in history, the crude oil price became negative; many investors lost all their investments and even owed money to the bank.====In addition to the usual risk of high-return financial products, financially illiterate investors are also likely to be exploited by man-made ¡°risks¡± in financial frauds. Financial frauds occur when investors are unaware of firms' possible deceptive actions, such as running away with the money.==== For example, in 2015, more than 220 thousand Fanya Metal Exchange investors from 20 provinces in China lost a total CNY 48 billion in investments.==== The misleading product descriptions of Fanya claimed unrealistically high returns without mentioning any risk.====In this context, to what extent can eye-opening education programs increase investors' awareness of the high risk of a high-return financial product? We designed an experiment and survey to investigate the effect of financial education on investment decisions. With the support from the Qianhai Institute of Innovative Research (QIIR),==== we recruited 1216 effective subjects distributed in 30 communities in the city of Shenzhen, China. We experimentally measured subjects' risk preferences using the multiple-price-list method (====), evaluated their financial literacy (====), and recorded their demographic characteristics. We randomly assigned the education treatment that intended to increase investors' awareness of risk.====Based on subjects' hypothetical investment decisions, our simple eye-opening education program significantly reduced an investor's tendency to purchase the high-return financial product. The fact that the education program changed investors' investment decisions suggests that some investors are unaware of the relationship between high return and high risk before education. Otherwise, if investors are fully aware of the risk, we cannot ¡°discourage¡± investors from purchasing the high-return product.====We then explored how the effectiveness of education depends on investors' risk attitudes, financial literacy, and demographic characteristics. In particular, we find that risk-averse investors are the most sensitive to the education program. After receiving the education, 16.88% of risk-averse investors decided not to invest in the high-risk product. In contrast, the education program only led to a 7.73% reduction without controlling for investors' risk attitude. Hence, given limited educational resources, regulators can target risk-averse investors who can be identified by survey questions as well as the link between investors' risk attitudes and their observed characteristics. Our surveys of demographic information suggest that risk-averse preferences are often observed among female and elderly investors. We do not find any strong relationship between financial literacy and risk preferences.====Consistent with reports around the world, we find that Chinese (Shenzhen) investors are subject to the inadequacy of financial knowledge, as are investors in other countries (====). In general, Chinese investors receive similar scores in their responses to the standard questions as investors in the United States, but they exhibit a lower self-confidence about their knowledge of finance. Surprisingly, we find that correctly answering standard questions of financial literacy does not predict investors' tendency to purchase high-return products without being fully aware of the underlying risks. Investors' unawareness of the relationship between returns and risks is an important aspect of financial illiteracy, especially in the context of investor protection. Therefore, we propose to add a new question to the current evaluation scheme of financial literacy.====Our paper is related to the study of how financial education and financial literacy influence people's financial decisions. The literature has mixed results regarding the efficacy of education programs.====Some researchers found that different formats of educations or information nudge can improve investors' financial understanding and financial outcomes. ==== conducted a financial literacy training in Mexico City and found that the training increased both financial knowledge and self-reported saving behaviors. ==== found that attending retirement planning seminars improved people's financial understanding and helps them choose more efficient portfolios. ==== conducted a field experiment in rural China and found a strong relationship between neglecting compound interest and pension contributions. ==== found that financial education corrects people's misunderstanding and increases individuals' investment in pension plans.====On the other side, based on 201 previous studies, ==== summarize that financial literacy and education interventions, in general, play little role in affecting investor behaviors. ==== emphasizes that many financial education programs fail because investors lack the ability to process information provided in the education. ==== found the replacing the statutory prospectus of mutual funds with a simplified summary prospectus could save investors' time spent on investment decision but do not alter their choices. ==== shown that subjects exhibited behavioral biases in understanding mutual fund fees and thus made incorrect decisions. ==== tested three information interventions to mutual fund choices by giving subjects a summary sheet of fees, basic knowledge of mutual funds, and historical returns. They concluded that information nudge had very limited effect, and financial illiteracy was the primary source of mistakes in choosing mutual funds with high fees. ==== found that providing financial incentives for correct answers to a financial knowledge test did not improve real financial outcomes, but nudging subjects by short-term financial goals and personalized financial counseling services significantly improve the outcomes.====We contribute to this literature by experimentally measuring the risk preferences of subjects and demonstrate heterogeneous effects of financial education. We conducted a simple eye-opening education program intended to improve investors' consciousness of self-protection by reminding them of the link between high returns and high risks and the possibility of financial fraud. The education program is a one-page flyer, and subjects typically spent less than 5?min reading it, so it is a typical information nudge (====, ====). We find a positive result that the simple education program improves investors' awareness of the relationship between returns and risks so they can make more informed decisions regarding the investment in high-return products. Similar to ====, we find that the impact of education greatly depends on who receives the education. Specifically, the education program is the most effective for risk-averse investors.",Whom to educate?

However, the long-term effects of exposure to infectious diseases on the elderly have received minimal attention. Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, this study adopts a differences-in-differences strategy to evaluate the long-term effects of epidemic exposure on old-age mortality. We find that intense exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic led to an increase in old-age mortality after the SARS outbreak. We provide some suggestive evidence that exposure to SARS increased psychological stress and limitations in physical activities among old people.","Infectious diseases pose a critical and continuing threat to public health. Over the past 20?years, the world has experienced global epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (H5N1), swine flu (H1N1), meningitis, Ebola, and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As the worldwide population ages, the adverse effects of infectious diseases may increase due to the vulnerability of old people (====).==== Although much has been written on the instantaneous physical and socio-economic effects of disease epidemics, limited attention has been given to their long-term effects on old-age health outcomes (====; ====).====This study investigates whether and to what extent the panic caused by SARS, a lethal infectious disease, affected old-age mortality. The disease broke out in November 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong. It claimed 349 lives with 5327 probable cases reported in mainland China and fostered a sense of panic among the public. The regional and temporal variations in SARS exposure allow us to implement a differences-in-differences (DID) strategy. Our data are mainly from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We quantify SARS exposure as the duration of SARS.====We find that the exposure to SARS led to an increase in the mortality of the elderly after the prevalence of SARS, and its adverse effect became considerably evident over time. A major methodological concern, however, is that SARS exposure may not be orthogonal to unobservable factors that affect health care outcomes. We address this concern in several ways, including parallel trend analysis, a placebo test using pseudo SARS exposure, testing for alternative measures of SARS exposure, and testing for sample selection. These tests lead us to believe in the causal link between SARS exposure and old-age mortality.====We provide an internally consistent explanation of how SARS exposure could increase old-age mortality. We provide some evidence that SARS exposure increased psychological stress and limitations in physical activities among old people. We also show that the adverse effect of SARS exposure was more significant among female and illiterate groups. Moreover, we find the introduction of social ==== programs mitigated the adverse effect. However, the determination of the underlying mechanism is beyond the scope of our study.====Our study contributes to two threads of literature. First, it relates to a large body of empirical literature on the socioeconomic consequences of contagious diseases. In addition to negative instantaneous macroeconomic effects (====; ====; ====), contagious diseases may exert adverse effects on the long-term outcomes of vulnerable individuals (====). ==== used decennial census data from the United States and found that cohorts in utero during the 1918 influenza pandemic had lower educational attainment and higher probabilities of being disabled decades later. ==== reported cohorts born during the 1918 influenza pandemic peaks had excess all-cause mortality. ==== revealed that the 1957 flu epidemic in the United Kingdom had significant negative effects on childhood physical and cognitive development. ==== showed that exposure to a malarial environment in early life substantially increased the likelihood of having various chronic diseases and not working in old age. The adverse psychological impact of infectious disease epidemics might persist among vulnerable groups.====Second, our study contributes to the literature on the impact of psychological stress on health outcomes (====). There is increasing evidence that traumatic experiences are likely to lead to persistently elevated psychological symptomatology that may linger many years after exposure and increase individual morbidity and mortality (====). ==== conducted several laboratory experiments and showed that psychological stress affected immune function and predicted infectious disease susceptibility. ==== showed that stress arising from the Niigata-Chuetsu earthquake significantly increased long-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction in Japan. ==== observed that posttraumatic stress disorder associated with the World Trade Center attacks in New York, on September 11, 2001 significantly increased mortality risk. Our study provides new empirical evidence of the long-term effect of stress derived from infectious diseases on the health outcomes of old adults.====The remainder of the article is structured as follows. ==== provides background information on the SARS outbreak. ==== introduces the data sets and empirical strategies. ==== presents the empirical results.

The outbreak of COVID-19 and the resultant lockdowns took a heavy toll on SMEs. Afflicted by problems of logistics blocks, labor shortages, and drops in demand, 80% of SMEs were temporarily closed at the time of the first wave of interviews in February 2020. After reining in COVID-19, authorities largely eased lockdown restrictions in April. Consequently, most SMEs had reopened by the time of the second round of surveys in May. However, many firms, particularly export firms, were running at partial capacity, primarily due to inadequate demand. Moreover, around 19% of incorporated enterprises and 25% of self-employed businesses had permanently closed between the two waves of surveys.","Business activity in China¡ªthe world's second-largest economy¡ªground to a halt for a few months after the outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020. Tens of millions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were shut down. Given that SMEs generate 80% of employment and that more waves of COVID-19 loom large, it is important to understand the toll that the novel coronavirus is taking on SMEs in order to ensure that policy measures are appropriately designed to meet their needs. However, gauging the impact of COVID-19 on SMEs is particularly challenging because these enterprises are both plentiful in number and small in size.====The spread of the virus has made it impossible to physically survey the SMEs. One way to circumvent this challenge is to conduct online surveys. Right after the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, a few online surveys were conducted (====) to measure the impact of the novel coronavirus on Chinese firms. Online surveys have the advantage of gathering data quickly. However, they are subject to two selection problems (====). The first is that the representativeness of the sample is largely unknown and sometimes skewed. It is common for researchers, for instance, to spread the word about online surveys through their own networks, such as university alumni associations. In this case, the respondents would naturally be more educated than the typical SME owner. The second selection problem with online surveys is that they tend to appeal to certain groups. For instance, entrepreneurs who seriously suffered from the negative shock of COVID-19 were more likely to spend time answering the online survey questionnaires than those who fared better. Therefore, online surveys tend to report more pessimistic views.====To better measure the short-term and mid-term impact of COVID-19 on SMEs, we conducted two rounds of follow-up phone interviews in February and May 2020 with previously sampled SMEs in seven provinces.==== These firms are largely representative at the provincial level and the major industrial level of China as a whole. The phone interviews asked entrepreneurs about the operational status, their major challenges, and their business outlook, as well as their feelings about COVID-19. These rapid telephone interviews, in combination with the baseline survey, provide rich and timely information for studying the impact of COVID-19 on SMEs.====Our phone survey shows that COVID-19 took a heavy toll on SMEs. At the time of the first round of phone interviews in February 2020, although most provincial governments had allowed businesses to reopen (often with stringent conditions), only about 20% of SMEs had resumed production. Fourteen percent of the surveyed firms would have been unable to last beyond a month with their cash flow level at the time, and 50% would not have survived beyond three months. Nearly half of the SMEs did not expect their businesses to reopen within a month or were uncertain about the time of reopening. The findings of our survey suggested that 16% of SMEs would run out of cash before their expected business reopening date.====SMEs were struggling with many challenges, such as disruptions in logistics, restrictions on ====, and declines in market order. The major challenges depended on the industry. For example, export firms suffered more than others, due to a decline in external demand and a lack of key parts that had kept them afloat. SMEs in the residential service sector were hit particularly hard because of shrinking demand. Agricultural enterprises reported more problems with logistical disruptions.====After reining in COVID-19, authorities largely eased lockdown restrictions in April. As a result, most SMEs had reopened by the time of our second round of surveys in May. While the supply-side challenges had faded away, a lack of demand had now emerged as the main challenge. Many SMEs, particularly export firms, ran at partial capacity, primarily due to insufficient demand. Moreover, our ==== analysis based on the survey data and on the universal firm registration data reveals that about 19% of incorporated enterprises and 25% of self-employed businesses closed for good between the two waves of surveys.====By further gathering lockdown policies and government support policies in different places we further examine their impact on firm operational status We found that more inclusive policies, such as social security and ==== deferral, were more effective in helping SMEs than other targeted policies such as credit guarantee.====COVID-19 has unfortunately spread to almost all countries in the world. Many countries have adopted lockdown policies similar to China's, shutting down millions of SMEs. The governments in these countries desperately want to know what impact COVID-19 is having on SMEs as these businesses struggle with reopening. Thus, the study on the impact on SMEs in China may be applicable to other countries as well. The second and third waves of COVID-19 are striking in 2021. Before the population is fully vaccinated, more lockdowns are expected. The evidence generated from this paper offers a useful roadmap for the challenges ahead facing many countries in the course of reopening.====Our study contributes to the emerging body of literature on the effects of COVID-19 on firms (====; ====; ====) and on the Chinese economy (====; ====; ====).

Motivated by this, we evaluate the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on both national and industrial levels by employing quarterly computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Our results reveal that the epidemic may lower China's economic growth in 2020 by 3.5%, versus 4.4% for final consumption (relative to baseline). The service ==== suffers the most from the outbreak, and the Accommodation-Food-Beverage service, Wholesale-Retail Trade, and Transport-Storage-Post are identified as the most vulnerable sectors, with the negative impact on output reaching as high as 14.6%. When moving to 2021, the hit to economy shrinks to 2% (1.2¨C2.7%), with industry estimated to be the most affected sector instead. This study indicates that implementing effective measures for preventing and controlling the epidemic and policies for post-disease economic recovery play critical role in curbing the potential economic damage.","At the present, the risk of viral infection is still high, and the possibility of cases imported from abroad is also increasing in China. Further, the great uncertainties about the transmission mechanism of the virus, reliable treatment scheme as well as the development of vaccines has made it difficult to accurately predict when the outbreak will be over (====). As a result, it is particularly challenging to evaluate the economic risks and impacts of the epidemic (====). However, the post-disaster economic recovery not only has a significant impact on China's sustainable economic development, but also on the global economy (====).====). Given the epidemic has spread from local outbreak to widespread contagion phrase, the economic shock of COVID-19 to China may expand to ?3.6% relative to the no outbreak case; and if the world's situation increasingly worsens, China will keep suffering from the pandemic in 2021, with a negative economic impact up to ?2.7%. Moreover, China's GDP in the first quarter may encounter a???11% cut (relative to the baseline forecast), and it rebounds significantly in the subsequent quarters, despite some delay resulting from the slumping activities in the rest of world (====). Second, we further estimated the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on final demand and output across various sectors, and as far as we know, this should be the first paper to systematically evaluate the economic influence of the outbreak on multi-industrial scale, although there are few works discussed the possible impacts on supply chains and tourism (====; ====).

In particular, ==== report a decrease in shipping times resulting from the BRI and translate these into ad-valorem trade cost reductions. Our focus is on assessing the unexplored impact of the BRI on Chinese and EU welfare.====The BRI is not underpinned by an agreement outlining detailed rules, akin to what we would expect from trade agreements. This is a multi-layered policy whereby the Chinese central government originates the general policy, which is decentralised to ministries and local governments for the detail. The scale of China promotes this multi-layered approach but the negative side effect is that central government has difficulty harvesting the generated information to create a full policy brief. Inside China this method of ==== is well understood, hence the familiarity with slogans (e.g. ¡®China Dream¡¯) rather than detailed policy. However, the BRI pivots China towards the international stage. The countries it is trying to engage in this initiative are more accustomed to detailed policy documents. This is particularly the case for the European Union, which approves of well-established trade arrangements that bring welcome levels of detail and certainty regarding the rules of the game. But while the BRI continues to rapidly evolve, the China-EU Comprehensive Investment Agreement (linked to a China-EU Free Trade Agreement, FTA) has only just been agreed in principle after more than six years of negotiations.====It is also important to understand how the BRI interplays with current China-US trade tensions, since the trade war is an important and topical benchmark against which BRI gains can be measured. The US has been concerned with China's rising economic and political assertiveness for some time. The Obama administration took the tack of pursuing a co-operative international policy, engaging with trading partners through so-called mega-deals ¨C the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The Trump administration, on the other hand, engaged in a policy of confrontation with its trading partners by threatening them with escalating import tariffs. Between Jan 2018 and Jan 2020, the US increased the average tariff on Chinese imports from 3 to 21%, while China increased average tariffs on US products from 8% to 20.9% during the same period (Peterson Institute for International Economics). The recent (phase one) US-China agreement promises very little in terms of reducing these tariffs.====The BRI aims to reduce non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and transportation costs via infrastructure investment along six corridors. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to model changes to trade costs on welfare. Moreover, our framework permits us to model the effect of BRI-related policy decisions on ====Our empirical strategy is based on the general equilibrium structural gravity analysis developed by ====, ====,==== in that we compute the price effects of changes in trade costs and FTA formation associated with different policy scenarios, based on the general equilibrium global trade flows, using 2014 data as a benchmark (for a similar approach see also ====). The relative merits of each scenario are examined from the standpoint of the welfare gains/losses of a representative consumer. We compute welfare gains for the conditional and full general equilibrium (GE). The former calculates welfare changes keeping output and expenditure constant, while the latter also accounts for the changes in output and expenditures due to global price adjustments.====We find that a reduction in transport costs between China and the EU would lead to considerable welfare gains for both parties. For example, a 10% reduction in transport costs would increase the welfare of a representative consumer in China by 1.57% and in the EU by 0.49% for the full GE model. On the other hand, signing a deep FTA between China and the EU would increase welfare by 2.52 and 1.25% respectively. Further, a joint policy of reducing transport costs (via the BRI) and signing the (deep) FTA would increase welfare by 4.26 and 1.79%; this is larger than the sum of the gains from the two separate policies. Therefore, the joint policy is super-additive, magnifying the gains from the separate policies.====The positive effect of the BRI on China from trade cost reductions of 20% is more than compensatory for the potential negative effects of a trade war with the US (assuming 25% tariffs). There is an overall increase in global welfare from the BRI and the welfare gains under the conditional and full GE are positive across the board. The results are robust to different assumptions about the structure of trade cost reductions and accounting for the heterogeneous effects of regional trade agreements. Using the World Bank estimates of trade cost reductions predicts lower welfare gains for China, but higher welfare gains for some low and lower middle-income countries, especially located in Central and South Asia, and Africa. Our analysis of the heterogeneous RTA effects shows that for a China¨CEU FTA to have a strong positive effect, it should go beyond small tariff reductions.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== examines the background to the scenarios used in the model, followed by a discussion of the model in ====.

The success of a science park depends heavily on its supportive environment, suggesting that it is hard to replicate everywhere, while China has established many science parks across regions in the past decade. This study evaluates the degree of misallocation in research and development (R&D) and its determinants across science parks in China. Based on an unbalanced panel data of 145 science parks for the period 2007¨C2014, we find that the overall R&D efficiency has decreased sharply since 2011 when China began to initiate many new science parks. The newly constructed science parks exhibit a lower R&D efficiency than their incumbent parks, suggesting a considerable misallocation in R&D resource caused by expanding science parks everywhere. We further investigate the determinants of R&D misallocation and find that park characteristics and environmental characteristics matter.

Parks with closer R&D collaboration with universities or research institutes, particularly with universities, exhibit a lower R&D misallocation.","), and the government developed most of them.====Extant empirical studies also show mixed findings on innovation performance differentials between in-park firms and external counterparts, e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, and ====. ====Although the evidence of success is not robust, science parks remain a widely-adopted policy tool in emerging economies. From an economic-geographical perspective (where a science park and its surrounding region form an entity), those parks with high-tech firms have an evolving structure of inter-firm linkages and agglomerative effects that help promote R&D productivity and output. Developing technological capability through the cluster of high-tech startups in a superior innovation environment can be an authority's primary policy. Based on this assumption, China has established more than 100 science parks in the past two decades.====If the science park policy is successful, can government transplant this success to other regions? Indeed, China's local governments generally consider science parks as ¡°development catalysts¡± rather than ¡°innovation catalysts.¡± Both employment and income effects brought about by the establishment of science parks are the key goals of local government, as regional economic growth is the primary concern (====). The widespread setups of science parks thus comprise many seemingly science parks, which lower the functions science parks are expected to play in facilitating innovation.==== The concept of science parks has become a popular policy tool that enhances innovation and regional development; evaluating the performance of science parks and identifying their determinants are the essential issues of the science parks policy.====However, R&D resource misallocation, an essential aspect of understanding how well a science park operates, is yet to be investigated in the literature. ==== indicated that the allocation of resources across firms may be a significant factor in affecting a country's total factor productivity (TFP). Resource misallocation thus has been identified as a significant source of variation in productivity in emerging economies (====). In developing countries, R&D is one of the scarce resources for innovation, promoting productivity, and raising the value added of production. Better use of scarce resources can efficiently boost productivity and sustain long-term growth. Directing R&D resource toward government initiated science parks that are located in cities without favorable innovation environments, and well-functioning regional innovation can potentially result in R&D resource misallocation; raising the need for research on the evaluation of different efficiencies in the allocation of resources across science parks. Together, with an understanding of the determinants of R&D misallocation, such research can provide insight into the implications of technology and regional policies.====This study aims to evaluate R&D misallocation and its determinants across science parks in China. It adds three novelties to this line of literature. First, as some countries have established dozens of science parks in the past few decades,==== studies comparing performance across science parks have emerged recently, but have remained limited. For example, ==== and ==== adopt the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to evaluate the efficiency of science parks in China and Iran, respectively. Unlike previous studies focusing on evaluating performance differentials between in-park and off-park firms, this park-level study helps understand the degree and disparity in R&D misallocation across science parks. A counter-factual welfare analysis is also conducted to simulate the loss of R&D outputs due to research input misallocation on the new established parks.====Second, evaluating the performance of science parks is a rather complex undertaking. Instead of using the DEA approach to assess the technical efficiency of science parks in existing studies, this study evaluates the R&D resource misallocations of science parks. Analyzing resource misallocation is an emerging field of literature, while it neglects the misallocation of innovation resource, except for ====. Establishing many science parks in unfavorable innovation environments (regions) might lead to a distortion of the R&D resource usage and an association with a larger R&D misallocation. Building on Hsiech and Klenow's (2009) methodology into misallocation, we calculate the R&D efficiency of science parks. This efficiency measure assumes a larger value if the dispersion of revenue productivity, which is a function of a science park's input and output distortions, is smaller across science parks. This misallocation measure on ¡°revenue productivity¡± is called TFPR in ==== and Hsiech and Klenow's (2009).====Third, on computing the R&D efficiency measure, we have also obtained individual science park's TFPR, which can be viewed as an inverse measure of distortion (misallocation). We further investigate the determinants of misallocation across science parks. As the science park theory is underpinned by the advantage of agglomeration economies and the network externality of the innovation triple helix, existing studies focus on factors, like university proximity, interaction within the triple helix, and others, for example, ====, ====, ====, and ====. Even though science park characteristics are a crucial dimension of the influential factors affecting performance, they are not well examined. ==== indicate that heterogeneity of science parks is relevant to their tenants' performance and affects park performance. However, how science parks' characteristics relate to their performance is less investigated. This study explores how the park's characteristics relate to science parks performance in terms of R&D resource misallocation. Using returns to scale as a conceptual foundation, we also explore whether and how the growth R&D inputs relate to R&D misallocation.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the development and importance of science parks in China. Section 3 presents the methodology and demonstrates the data source. Section 4 presents and discusses the R&D misallocation across science parks in China and conduct a counter-factual welfare analysis to simulate the R&D misallocation if considering non-park regions.

The local fiscal multiplier is estimated in the range of 1.197¨C1.940. We then explore whether the increase in government spending in a city would affect its neighboring cities' GDP growth. Because the neighboring cities would benefit most from the spillover effects, such an exercise sheds light on how an increase in local government expenditure affects other cities.

We propose a microfoundation-based theory that incorporates market friction, market connection and escalation of commitment from the managers. In a dynamic market with frictions, managers with weak market connection need longer time to reach successful transactions, compared to the strongly connected ones. Moreover, escalating behavior could make it harder for the less connected managers to abandon their IP assets even when the embedded value becomes obsolete, which leads to inefficiently longer maintenance and an unforeseen social loss. The model further suggests that removing frictions in the market facilitates transactions and reduces the performance gap between different managers. We provide empirical evidence that is consistent with the theory, using data on ==== from individual innovators with different levels of market connection. The study contributes to the discussion on organizational implications of escalation of commitment, and also shed light on the importance of market connection to value capture of small innovative businesses."," owned by Chinese individual innovators.====; ====). They delay market transactions, which consequently delays the returns and increases the maintenance cost to the managers. The frictions in the technology market indicate that managers may not be able to commercialize their IP in time. By the time that they realize the embedded value in the IP becomes obsolete, they have already put in a good deal of investment in maintaining it. At this point, managers may exhibit costly escalating behavior to continue the investment, i.e., ¡°throwing good money after bad¡± (====). Market connections could serve as moderators to mitigate frictions. They are broadly defined as the network resources and the ability to get close to the market or consumers, which facilitates the transaction of the products or service (====). Different market connections could arise from different levels of ¡°bounded rationality¡± of the managers in processing and utilizing information (====; ====), or from different network positions and interpersonal styles in accessing information (====). Therefore a stronger market connection means more opportunities to trade their assets, which can be translated to higher expected value of the assets to the manager. Combining escalation of commitment at the individual level and market frictions in the business environment, our theory suggests the market connection could work in a costly direction: the less connected managers, who face more frictions in the market thus are less likely to profit from the transaction, end up maintaining their IP assets longer than the more connected owners, ceteris paribus.====We apply our theory to the most prominent type of IP ¡ª patents.

The results show that the ¡°independent¡± innovators are less willing to abandon their patents, even though their patents are not more valuable than those from the ¡°connected¡± innovators. Analysis on patent license/transfer suggests that this is partly because the ¡°independent¡± innovators are less able to achieve timely transactions compared to the ¡°connected¡± innovators. We also provide evidence that clarifying the validity and boundary of the patents facilitates transaction and narrows the differences between the two groups of innovators.====The discussion on the escalation of commitment has featured prominently in the psychological, economic, and managerial literature (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, for a recent review of examples and its determinants, see ====).

This study goes further in order to investigate the impact of child quantity on parents' occupational prestige, a topic less discussed in the field of economics.====Occupational prestige is a reflection of how members of a community evaluate the social status of a job (====); it is commonly used to order occupational hierarchy. Unlike income, a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) in terms of actual resources one possesses (====), occupational prestige is a summary measure of SES that combines skills and income (====). Hence, it measures the privilege and the power embodied in an occupation (====; ====). High-prestige jobs usually imply higher potential earnings and more social resources.==== However, these jobs also require more occupational skills, longer training, and increased responsibility (====; ====). Therefore, child quantity can affect parents' occupational prestige in both directions. On the one hand, parents could attempt to hold high-prestige jobs in order to set a good example for their children, or to obtain more resources for their families. On the other hand, parents could switch to jobs with lower prestige scores in order to have sufficient time and energy to take care of their children. Taken together, how family size affects parents' occupational prestige scores thus remains an empirical question.====In this paper, we compare the relationships between family size and parents' labor market outcomes (i.e., labor supply and occupational prestige score) in Taiwan and Mainland China. Citizens of these two areas share similar social and cultural backgrounds, such as ethnicity,==== the roles of parents, and family organization.==== However, there are three important distinctions between these two areas. First, the average family size is much smaller in Mainland China, due to the strictly enforced One-Child Policy (OCP). Second, Taiwan already had established a complete market economy system by 1990, while in the meantime Mainland China had not yet completed its transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy. In the planned economy, employee-initiated moves were uncommon because of the bureaucratic hurdles (====). In contrast, occupational mobility is high in the steady market economy (====). Third, the female labor force participation rate is extremely high in Mainland China.====Because fertility decisions and career decisions are usually made together, we exploit plausibly exogenous increases in family size caused by twinning to isolate the actual effect of family size on parents' labor market performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize an IV approach to identify the causal effect of family size on parent's occupational prestige scores. Relying on 1990 census microdata for Taiwan and Mainland China, we find that as the number of children increases, the mother's probability of working decreases, while the father's is unchanged in both areas. This is consistent with previous studies (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).

By using a ==== approach, we find that the LEZ policy improves Nanchang's air quality throughout restricted/unrestricted hours and within/outside of the designated LEZ areas. Air quality began to improve during the announcement period and improved further after the policy was enforced. These findings suggest that drivers could adapt to the foreseen LEZ policy by upgrading their vehicles; thus, to achieve policy effectiveness, it is important to make driving regulations compatible with drivers' incentives.","Increased concerns about air quality, traffic congestion and public health have led many cities around the world to implement driving restriction policies. For example, Beijing and Mexico City adopted a license plate number-based driving restriction policy (PDRP) that limits car use based on the last digit of one's license plate (====; ====). Many German cities ban high-polluting vehicles from driving in designated low emission zones (LEZs) (====; ====). However, the effectiveness of these driving restriction policies in reducing air pollution remains inconclusive.====Employing a regression discontinuity (RD) design and station-by-hour air pollution data, we find that the LEZ policy leads to significant reductions in hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) levels and in the concentrations of major air pollutants, including PM==== and PM====. Importantly, based on our preferred model specification, we find no change in the concentration of SO====, which is often considered a primarily industrial source pollutant (====). This finding helps mitigate the concern that our results are driven by non-transportation-related regulatory enforcement or economic activity.====We proceed to explore the variations in air pollution by location and time. We find a universal improvement of air quality inside and outside of the LEZ areas and during restricted and unrestricted hours under the LEZ regime. Again, it is reassuring to observe no systematic change in SO==== after the implementation of the LEZ. As a matter of fact, the reduction in air pollution is more substantial during unrestricted hours compared to the pollution reduction during restricted hours. Because the LEZ is only effective from 7?am to 10?pm, the finding of a significant reduction in pollution during unrestricted hours suggests positive actions undertaken by drivers to upgrade their vehicles in the city. The finding of little intertemporal or spatial substitution with the implementation of the LEZ policy provides suggestive evidence that Nanchang's drivers adapted to the LEZ by adopting cleaner vehicles after the LEZ policy was announced. However, prior empirical evidence on the effects of a PDRP on pollution suggests the contrary (for example, see ====; ====).====We employ the identification strategy described above to study drivers' behavioral responses during the announcement and during the enforcement stages of the LEZ regime. As the LEZ policy was officially implemented nearly two months after its announcement, drivers may have adjusted their behaviors accordingly. Interestingly, we find that the announcement of the policy had a strong effect: the AQI and concentrations of PM==== and PM==== started to decrease after the LEZ policy was announced. This finding further suggests why the LEZ was effective. It is very likely that drivers shifted their purchases in advance to avoid compliance costs under the LEZ regime. More importantly, they had to purchase low-emission vehicles to avoid such costs. The adjustment margin has not been considered in prior studies. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the benefits from improved air quality due to the LEZ policy outweigh the total cost of upgrading the vehicle types.====Our last piece of evidence for the success of the LEZ policy is drawn from Internet search activities in Nanchang. Local Internet search activities are measured by the Baidu Search Index, which is provided by Baidu, the dominant search engine in China. Interestingly, the intensity of the Internet searches that use the term ¡°purchase a used car¡± remained remarkably stable before and after the implementation of the LEZ, but there is a spike in the intensity of the searches that use the same term right after the implementation of the PDRP. The contrasting Internet searching patterns provide suggestive evidence that Nanchang's drivers are likely to buy used (and usually high-emitting) vehicles to sidestep the PDRP, but they do not have such an incentive under the LEZ. Although comparing the efficacy of the two types of driving regulations is beyond the scope of this paper,==== we find that these driving regulations may have induced very different responses among drivers.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, we add to the burgeoning research on the effects of driving restrictions on pollution. ==== studies the effect of LEZs on pollution in Germany. He finds that PM==== falls by 9% within the LEZ areas and finds no evidence that dirty vehicles contribute to higher pollution by increasing the length of driving routes outside of LEZs. Wolff shows that this effectiveness is due to the high compliance behavior of drivers: drivers who live closer to an LEZ substantially increased their adoption of low-emission vehicles. ==== confirm Wolff's finding and argue that the public health benefit that originates from reduced air pollution is substantial. Several studies have analyzed the effects of a PDRP on air quality (====; ====; ====; ====) but have yielded mixed findings. ==== and ==== study the effect on air quality of Mexico City's Hoy No Circula (HNC) policy, which prohibits driving from 5?am to 10?pm one weekday per week based on license plate numbers. They find that HNC fails to improve air quality because it causes an unintended behavioral response: drivers circumvent the restriction by adding old, more polluting second cars. In contrast, ==== find that Beijing's one-day-per-week driving restriction reduces the city's air pollution levels by 21%. Although Beijing and Mexico City share similarities, they differ substantially in their institutions, of motor vehicle types and availability of public transportation (bus, subway or light-rail systems), which may cause the difference in the findings between ==== and ====.====Second, our work adds to the scant evidence on adaptive responses to public policies. For example, ==== find that agents shift vehicle purchases in advance when they expect a new emission standard to take effect. ====Third, this analysis is particularly relevant to China's air pollution and transportation policies. A recent emission inventory indicates that although the contributions of vehicles to air pollution differ by region, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to China's air pollution problem.==== In response, local Chinese governments have implemented driving restriction policies to reduce pollution and traffic congestion. When examining the effects of driving restriction policies, most existing studies have focused on large Chinese cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai (see, for example, ====; ====; ==== Megacities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, differ substantially from medium-sized Chinese cities in population, pollution sources, traffic flows, and government spending on improving air quality. As a growing number of small and medium-sized Chinese cities are considering the adoption of driving restriction policies, reliable estimates of the effects of an LEZ policy on air pollution based on a medium-sized city provide valuable information that can help these cities make informed decisions.====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).

In this article, I argue that ==== is not a good theory of the market. It misleads both economists and government in understanding the economic issues. China is particularly vulnerable to its defects. In contrast, the Austrian School of economics is a better theory of the market since it studies the real market, not an imaginary market. The most important difference between the two economics paradigms is their understandings of the entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is missed in neoclassical economics. In the Austrian School economics and Schumpeterian economics, entrepreneurship is the soul of the market. The paradigm shift of economics is urgently needed but it will be a slow process. Chinese economists should play a role in this transformation.","The reason for this change is both demand-sided and supply-sided. On the demand side, as China has been transitioning from a planned to a market economy, traditional Marxism economics becomes of little use for guiding both reform program design and economic policy analysis. While the Marxist economists provided sound reasons for the necessity of reform with arguments based on the doctrine of ¡°productivity determining production relation¡±, they could hardly tell the authority about how to reform. Also, as the economy went through a monetarization, the Soviet type of the economic balancing didn't work as before. There were strong demands for neoclassical analysis of the market and for Keynesian economics even as early as in the first half of the 1980s.====On the supply side, as China opened its door to the outside, neoclassical ideas and thoughts flooded into China through a variety of channels: Chinese translations of English books, academic conferences and two-direction scholar visiting. In this regard, Gregory Chow, Steve Cheung and Milton Friedman played an important role in the 1980s. The Chinese Economists Society (CES) established in 1984 in the USA played a bridging role. Under the CES umbrella, those young Chinese who went to the American universities to study economics became important forces in changing China's economics research and teaching. They translated and authored books, wrote introductory articles, organized forums, and delivered lectures in Chinese universities. Xiaokai Yang became a star economist in China from the late 1980s on. While CES scholars played their roles through their short-term visiting, the establishment of the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University in 1994 provided an academic home for those Western-trained Chinese economists interested in coming back permanently to China.====There has been no shortage of criticism of neoclassical economics among Chinese economists. The marginalized Marxist economists have been complaining a lot for long time. This criticism can be disregarded for its unimportance in reality.====What cannot be disregarded is the criticism of neoclassical economics by some Western-trained Chinese economists. Justin Y. F. Lin is one of such critics (====I myself now am also a critic of neoclassical economics (==== theory of the market. It is also questionable that Lin attributes to the original locality and development stage the inapplicability of neoclassical theory to China. After all, we cannot say that the Chinese economy of today is less developed than Western economies a hundred year ago when neoclassical economics emerged.====More importantly, while Lin uses his criticism to support a ¡°proactive¡± (interventionist) government, my criticism leads me to endorse a limited government. This reflects that my criticism also fundamentally differs from the prevalent criticism of neoclassical economics in the West. The prevalent criticism is that neoclassical economics embellishes (or idealizes) the market. In my view, this criticism has not grasped the substantial defect of neoclassical theory. To the contrary, neoclassical economics diminishes the market. To prove mathematically efficiency of the market, neoclassical economics makes a series of unrealistic assumptions. This gives opponents of the market a voice, because none of these assumptions can be satisfied in reality, so the market cannot be as efficient as claimed in neoclassical economics.====Why is neoclassical economics well received in China without strong resistance from ruling authority, while Marxism is still the official ideology? One important reason is that neoclassical economics provides a theoretical foundation for government intervention into markets. That is what the authority likes. People who read economics textbooks are not left with a deep impression about how efficient the market is. Instead, their impression is the market fails and government intervention is necessary. In the real world, the effective and efficient operation of the market does not require those neoclassical assumptions, as shown by experimental economists (Vernon ====). The rationale for government intervention in the market derived from these unrealistic assumptions also does not stand! The so-called market failure is nothing but the (neoclassical) market ==== failure.====In the following, I will argue that neoclassical economics is not a good theory of the market. It provides a misunderstanding of the market. In comparison, the Austrian (and Schumpeterian) economics is a better theory of the market. In particular, I argue that the most importance distinction between the two paradigms is the role of entrepreneurship in the market. While entrepreneurship plays no role in neoclassical theory, in contrast, entrepreneurship is essential in the Austrian and Schumpeterian theories of the market.====Theories matter for reality. Much of fundamental disagreements on economic reform and policy debate in China as well as in all other countries can be attributed to that different people hold different theories. For China to avoid regressing to statism and for the whole world not to be trapped into government dominance of economy, it is time for mainstream economics to have a fundamental paradigmatic transformation. Chinese economists should play a role in this transformation even only for China's own sake.",A paradigmatic change is needed for understanding the real market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000201,3-Feb-21,2021,Research Article,299

The proliferation and application of information technology (IT) have triggered profound industrial changes. At present, a new generation of IT reform, with digital technology, industrial robots, and artificial intelligence at its core, is unfolding worldwide and arousing the interest of scholars (====). Governments have responded rapidly in the face of this new technological revolution. As early as 1993, the United States proposed the National Information Infrastructure plan to construct information infrastructure. This plan aimed to maintain the leading global position of the United States in IT development. The launch of the plan aroused the attention of other developed countries, with Germany, France, Britain, Japan and other industrialised countries successively launching their own ¡®Information Highway¡¯ policies (====). However, few existing studies have evaluated the effects of these IT-related techno-industrial policies. This paper investigates the impact of a place-based IT-related policy on innovation in China.====As a ¡®general-purpose technology¡¯, IT plays a vital role in facilitating innovation (====). Conceptually, the innovation process can be divided into two stages: research and development (R&D), which is a series of activities designed to acquire new scientific or technical knowledge; and the development stage, which applies R&D achievements to create new products. IT's application helps to reduce search costs, calculation and storage costs, adjustment costs, and communication and collaboration costs, with significant impacts on the innovation process. In more detail, IT can improve innovation knowledge management, enable innovation production processes (including opportunity identification, concept development, research and design), and facilitate collaborative innovation (====). Most studies based on firm data show that increased IT investment has a positive effect on innovation (====; ====; ====; ====; Santoliri, 2015; ====; ====). However, as firm informatization investment is driven by the innovation demand caused by market competition, these findings suffer from reverse causality problems. To establish a causal relationship between IT investment and innovation, we need to rely on exogenous shocks, such as quasi-natural experiments that promote IT.====In this paper, we evaluate the impact of techno-industrial policy on urban innovation with the pilot zones for integrating informatization and industrialization (PZIIs), a novel placed-based IT-related industrial policy. PZIIs aim to promote applications of IT in industrial development and improve the level of firm informatization. To form reproducible experiences, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China selected two batches of 16 national-level PZIIs from October 2008. The 16 pilot zones involve 30 cities located in 15 provinces. This large-scale pilot policy ensures the representativeness of the sample and lays the foundations for causal identification. Comparing the differences in innovation between pilot cities and non-pilot cities, and differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment, we apply a difference-in-differences (DD) model to identify the causal effects of PZIIs on innovation. The key challenge in identifying causal effects is to select the appropriate control group for the treatment group to eliminate the sample selection bias caused by policy allocation. Following ====Using a novel quality-adjusted measure of innovation output, we find that PZIIs significantly improve urban innovation. Further, we explore the impact of government support in mediating the PZII effects. The results show that the greater financial and economic resources the government where the PZII is located has, the more significant the role of the PZII in promoting innovation. The PZII effect is also more substantial when the effect of the PZII is considered in the performance assessment of officials or when the pilot zone spans multiple prefectural administration units. In addition, as China is a developing country, it is essential that the government promotes market-oriented reforms, which provides indirect support for stimulating policy effects (====). A heterogeneity analysis over the marketized index shows that cities with a higher degree of marketization or a lower degree of factor distortion see a more significant impact of PZIIs on innovation. Finally, we use firm-level data to test whether PZIIs have stimulated firm innovation. The results show that PZIIs effectively guide firms to increase R&D investment. This indicates that the application of IT indeed stimulates the policy effect.====This study contributes to the literature investigating the impact of place-based policy. ==== evaluate the impact of the structural funds program provided by the European Union on the economic growth and employment growth of recipient countries. ==== examine the impact of the empowerment zone program on employment. ==== compare the effects of different types of place-based policies under the theoretical framework of urban externalities and find that firm cluster zoning is more efficient than urban growth boundary policies. ====; ====; ====). The above studies on the effect of place-based policy can be divided into two categories. One is that policies focus on supporting disadvantaged areas, such as the structural funds program (====), federal urban empowerment zone program (====), regional selective assistance (====). The other one is that policies focus on economic agglomeration, such as special economic zones (====; ====; ====). Examining the plant-level data from the valve industry, ==== find that IT investment can effectively reduce the production line's adjustment cost, and provide customized product services, which demonstrates that IT investment can promote process innovation. ==== show that ICT in employee training and service outsourcing can contribute to product innovation and process innovation. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, it is hard for such IVs to satisfy the exclusion restriction. Our identification strategy relies on the quasi-natural experiment of PZIIs, which can identify IT's causal effect on urban innovation.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background and conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and data. Section 4 discusses the empirical results.

The premium given to publication in top journals leads to an emphasis on exhaustive treatment of narrow questions. Detailed, robustly identified studies of novel questions are of undeniable value; however, the opportunity cost of producing such studies is large in terms of research quantity and policy relevance. For economists who aim to achieve what we view as the ultimate goals of academic research (enhancing understanding of the world, solving social problems, and building foundational knowledge to enable future breakthroughs), we offer some insights from publication philosophy in the field of public health. We discuss how public health has developed norms around publishing that are more successful in meeting these ultimate goals. We then offer thoughts on potential lessons for young economists in China and the economics discipline.","In this special issue of ====). Interestingly, in their ==== paper, Heckman and Moktan show that, despite the high credit given to those who publish in the top journals, the literature is clear that, in general, field journals have the most impactful papers. Although there are debates about the extent of this problem in the United States and Europe, in China, the potential problems in this regard are at least as severe as elsewhere in the world.====One of the main problems that arises is the intense competition for publishing in the limited number of journals with the associated issue of the criteria that need to be met before publication is considered. Moreover, due to the excessive influence of these top journals, these criteria for publication have been adopted by most economics journals. Although not exhaustive, these criteria include: (i) the need for the analysis to identify the causality of the factor that is being studied on the outcome of interest, (ii) that the paper's topic and/or methodology are novel, and (iii) the need for the paper to be comprehensive and subject to every conceivable robustness check. Further, although we do not focus on this here, there is another important issue that economists in China face¡ªthe added challenge of the sizeable premium given to research in the United States in Top-5 economics journals (====).====What we would like to argue is that our ultimate objective is not to focus our efforts solely on writing papers that meet the three criteria (identification, novelty, and robustness). Indeed, the real objective of academics should be to try to conduct research that: (i) enhances our understanding of the world; (ii) helps to solve problems of society; and, most importantly, and, as such, the focus of this paper, (iii) contributes to knowledge that builds a foundation for even greater breakthroughs in the future on important issues. In the remainder of the paper, we call this set of three objective the ====. Moreover, we argue that it should be possible to do research and publish papers that: (i) are built around measuring correlations (instead of causation), (ii) are focused on replicating the research of others (e.g., in new samples or sample locations, with new measures of variables), and (iii) report novel data in a transparent, concise form that can lead to real contributions to our understanding of the world, help to solve problems, and contribute to knowledge building, i.e., be used to achieve the ultimate goals of academic research.====To support our arguments, we introduce the philosophy of publishing in another field: public health (although we could have chosen other fields, such as medicine, engineering, or hard sciences). We first show that the field of public health has developed a way of promoting publishing that is more successful in meeting the ultimate goals of academic research. We then describe some of the underlying principles that are accepted (expected, required) when one writes a paper for a public health journal.

We obtain robust evidence that expansionary monetary policy led to the misallocation of bank credit to less productive firms after controlling for confounding factors. However, we find that investment increased more for more productive firms. Additional analyses show that this occurred partly because more productive firms hoarded cash before the crisis, and partly because less productive firms invested more in financial assets.","Expansionary monetary policy was considered by the world's central banks to be one of the most important measures to cope with the 2008 global financial crisis, as monetary expansions increase cash flow and lower ====. However, given the rich heterogeneity across firms, not every firm is equally affected by these changes. Thus, a key question that arises is: what are the heterogeneous effects of expansionary monetary policy on firms' behavior? The existing literature has put forward two different theoretical predictions.====First, the higher a firm's productivity, the greater its investment and external financing needs, and the more likely it is to be affected by financial constraints.====Second, expansionary monetary policy may affect resource allocation. The less productive firms may absorb more credit from the credit market, preventing resources from being allocated to the more productive firms. This channel has been explored by ====, who showed the cross¨Csectoral allocation effect of monetary policy.====It is important to understand which perspective is most applicable in reality because they have different implications for allocative efficiency. One way of testing these two channels is to examine whether the borrowing response of more productive firms is stronger than that of other firms following implementation of an expansionary monetary policy. This issue remains empirically controversial for two main reasons. First, because of the endogenous nature of monetary policy, to clearly analyze its effectiveness, we need to identify an exogenous monetary policy shock that is less correlated with potential confounding factors. Second, the complex debt structure of companies makes it difficult to clearly examine how monetary policy interacts with other factors that affect the borrowing response.==== To overcome these difficulties, we use China's expansionary monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis as a case study. First, as this expansionary monetary policy was designed to deal with the global financial crisis, it enables us to capture the impact of exogenous monetary policies. Second, because bank credit is the main external financing source of Chinese companies,==== the debt structure of Chinese companies is simple, allowing us to identify the effect of monetary policy shocks on bank credit responses more clearly.====In the first part of the paper, we analyze the mechanism by which productivity determines the sensitivity of firms' bank credit and investments to expansionary monetary policy. We develop a model that builds on the idea by ==== and assumes firms with heterogeneous productivity levels. In equilibrium, firms are divided into two groups based on a productivity cutoff. Firms with productivity levels that exceed the cutoff will borrow and invest, whereas less productive firms will not.====When the central bank conducts an expansionary monetary policy, loanable funds are increased and this triggers a decline in interest rates. Reactions to the lower interest rates differ depending on the heterogenous productivity levels of firms. The intensive margin effect stimulates all firms with productivity higher than the cutoff level because of reduced borrowing costs. In addition, declining interest rates lead to a lower cutoff level. Firms with productivity near the cutoff will expand their financing and investment activities. The former effect, an intensive margin effect, influences high-productivity firms, whereas the latter extensive margin effect mainly influences low-productivity firms. In our empirical study, we provide evidence that these different forces are at work.====The second part of the paper details the empirical test of the theoretical prediction and provides a series of robustness tests. We measure the exogenous quantity-based monetary policy shock using the method developed by ====. We connect this information to the firm-level financial data for 2003¨C2013 from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. On regressing total bank loans on the interaction between the monetary policy shocks and the firm-level total factor productivity (TFP), we find that the coefficient of the interaction term is negative and significant. Consistent with our theoretical argument for the extensive margin, we find that expansionary monetary policy was associated with increased borrowing for the firms with lower TFP. The magnitude of this redistributed effect is economically significant. Our estimate implies that a less productive firm with TFP in the 10th percentile experiences a 1.10 times larger marginal effect on bank loans as a result of the monetary policy shock than a productive firm at the 90th percentile.====Estimation of a linear investment equation shows that the coefficient of the interaction between monetary policy shocks and TFP is positive and significant. Our estimate implies that an expansionary policy shock matters for firms' investments when firms are productive. An increase of one ==== in the TFP measure is associated with an increase of 0.6% in investment when there is a 1% increase in monetary policy shocks. This part of our result conflicts with the result regarding bank loans.====A possible explanation for this apparently inconsistent result is that productive firms accumulate internal funds over time and substitute these for external bank credit. In line with this self-financing channel, we focus on productive firms that were cash-rich based on their ==== and find that the effects of productive heterogeneity disappear after controlling for accumulated cash before the stimulus. In addition, we explore the reasons why the less productive companies obtain bank credit but do not expand their investments. We find corroborating evidence that less productive firms are more active in financial asset investments rather than in real investments under an expansionary monetary policy shock.====The main results are robust to a series of robustness checks and we find that they are not driven by firms' state ownership status, size, or leverage. All our main results are robust to controls for introducing the interaction terms of the monetary policy shock and other firm-level covariates (state ownership, size, leverage, and zombie firm).",Expansionary monetary policy and credit allocation: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000134,29-Jan-21,2021,Research Article,302

We show that income is more unequally distributed in old age than in working age. We combine the regression-based inequality decomposition method and the three-step mediating effect test to analyze the transmission of income inequality from initial socioeconomic differences to income inequality in old age. Our study is based on a panel of over 4000 old households from the China Health and Nutrition Survey during 1991¨C2015. We find that the urban-rural gap and educational inequality are the primary causes of old-age income inequality. The effect of the urban-rural gap is partially mediated by educational inequality. Inequality accumulates with age and is reinforced in old age by the fragmented Chinese public pension system.,"). In addition, income inequality has increased in almost all countries in recent decades and particularly rapidly in North America, China, India, and Russia since 1980; between 1980 and 2015, the top 10% income share rose from 35% to 47% in the U.S. and from 26% to 40% in China (====). The countries where most old people live and where population aging occurs rapidly are also those most disadvantaged by inequality (====). Therefore, it is of great importance to study the inequality of the old and the transmission process causing this inequality.====On the one hand, inequalities accrue and become reinforced over an individual's life cycle because advantages and disadvantages associated with one's location, gender, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics accumulate by age (====; ====). On the other hand, social security can pool risks and thus limit the growth of inequality over the life cycle, moderating inequality among the old compared with the young (====). Understanding where the inequality among the old comes from and investigating how inequality changes from young to old is important for the design of public policies aimed at mitigating inequality to improve the quality of life of the old.====This paper studies income inequality in old age and analyzes the factors and the transmission process causing this inequality. We combine the regression-based decomposition approach and the three-step mediation test to analyze how the urban-rural gap contributes to income inequality through education and to identify the transmission process empirically. We also apply the ==== method to analyze how the discrimination of the ==== system contributes to the urban-rural income gap in working age and in old age. Our analysis is based on data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) for the period 1991¨C2015. CHNS is a high-quality dataset covering a long period and has been widely used in development economics studies (e.g., ====; ====).====China provides a persuasive context to analyze the income inequality of the old because it has experienced increasing inequality (====; ====; ====) primarily driven by the public pension inequality (====), and also experienced a rapid population aging in recent decades (====). China also attracts general interest because of the large size of its old population. By the end of 2017, 241 million Chinese were 60 or older, accounting for one quarter of the world's old population (====; ====). Moreover, China faces large urban-rural disparities in development: urban residents receive higher incomes, better social welfare, and better education than rural residents (====). Our results for China are also informative for other developing and transition economies that face large urban-rural gaps, rapidly aging populations, fragmented pension systems, and increasing income inequality.====There is limited research that empirically identifies the transmission process of income inequality. ==== estimates that the urban-rural gap accounts for 40% of inequality using a dataset of 65 countries. ==== documents that the increasing urban-rural gap, especially the rise in the income share of the top 10% of urban households, explains the overall increase in inequality in China. Both studies focus on the direct impact of the urban-rural gap on income inequality. ====; ====; ====).====Our study makes two contributions to the existing literature. First, to our best knowledge, we are the first to empirically identify the transmission process from a cohort's socioeconomic origins to income inequality during working age and to greater income inequality in old age. We empirically confirm this transmission process over the life cycle across the 25-year sample period, and our results are robust across different population cohorts. We show that education is a mediator in the transmission process and provide a ==== foundation to explain the higher levels of inequality among the old than among the young.====Second, we provide new evidence quantifying the level of inequality among the old in China and the drivers of this inequality. Most previous studies on China focus on the inequality of the overall population (including both old and young households) (e.g., ====; ====; ====). ==== analyze the distributional effects of population aging on inequality and conclude that population aging has the overall effect of aggravating inequality. We focus on the inequality among the rapidly growing old population and analyze the transmission process that makes old-age inequality larger than the inequality among the young. Only a few studies have examined the drivers of income inequality among the old in China. These studies have analyzed the impact of specific socioeconomic disparities on inequality among the old, such as gender differences (====), differences in living arrangements (====), and urban-rural disparities (====). We are the first to compare the contributions of different socioeconomic characteristics and to identify the primary contributors to old-age income inequality in China.====We find that the income inequality of old households was higher than that of young households in all survey years during the sample period 1991¨C2015. The urban-rural gap, capturing one's socioeconomic origin, and educational attainment are the primary socioeconomic factors explaining the income inequality among old households. In recent years (2000¨C2015), these two factors explain 11%¨C22% of the overall old-age income inequality. Approximately one-third to half of the contribution of the urban-rural gap to old-age income inequality was mediated by educational inequality between rural and urban areas. The urban-rural gap and educational inequality mainly contribute to old-age income inequality by contributing to pension inequality, which accounts for 45%¨C60% of the old-age income inequality and explains almost all of the inequality increase from 2000 to 2015 for the household cohort that was young in 2000 and became old in 2015.====Our results suggest that reforms of the public resource allocation for social security and education can reduce inequality. Future pension reforms need to balance the trade-off between the adequacy of one pension program and the equality across different pension programs. The current practice to increase pension payments by a fixed percentage for all pensioners (e.g., 5% every year) increases income adequacy but also increases income inequality among the old. Long-term strategies to reduce old-age income inequality in China include improving access to and the quality of education in rural areas, as this would improve the labor market opportunities and wages of rural residents, allowing them to increase their pension savings. These reforms would require a shift in the structure of government spending away from investments for economic growth to income redistribution and improving welfare.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== reviews the literature to develop our hypotheses. ==== describes the empirical methodology to decompose income inequality. ==== introduces the CHNS dataset and our samples. ==== reports the results. ==== summarizes the conclusions and policy implications.",Why is inequality higher among the old?

If so, how do the effects evolve? This paper exploits monthly fluctuations in the number of extremely hot days within a city to identify their effects on firm-level exports in that city. We find robust evidence that hot temperatures have persistent adverse effects on firm-level exports. Specifically, export losses gradually arise following a heat shock, beginning from an undetectable impact and eventually accumulating to a large and significant impact. An additional >30?¡ãC?day in a month could generate cumulative losses up to 0.83% of a firm's annual exports twenty-four months later. The negative effects of extreme heat are mainly through its adverse impacts on the firm's investment, capital, and production output. Capital-intensive sectors and FDI-related enterprises are among the most affected by high temperatures. Our findings support the ¡°no-recovery¡± hypothesis after weather extremes and have implications for future climate change policies.","Living on a warming planet, we have seen a steady increase in extreme weather events (e.g., tropical cyclones, heatwaves, and droughts) over the past few decades. These shocks substantially affect many aspects of human society. Precise estimation of the impacts of weather shocks is critical to the design of climate change policies. In recent years, there have been plenty of empirical studies exploring the links between weather and agricultural outputs (====, ====, ====), health (====, ====, ====, ====), conflicts (====, ====, ====), productivity (====, ====), and economic performance (====, ====, ====, ====). Most of these studies find that weather shocks have significant detrimental effects on various economic outcomes.====). Most previous studies on the relationship between weather extremes and exports use aggregated export data at the country level (====, ====, ====) or the sector/industry level (====, ====, ====) or the port level (====). They cannot investigate the micro-level mechanisms of the weather-exports relationship. Besides, these studies use export data at the annual frequency and cannot explore the dynamics of weather impacts over time.==== Furthermore, these empirical studies have limited statistical power because of the small sample size. Our study contributes to the weather-exports literature in the following ways. We use high-frequency firm-level data to study the cumulative effects of temperature extremes on firms' exports. Besides the new firm-level evidence of the temperature-exports relationship, our paper clearly describes how the impact of temperature extremes on exports evolves. We also unveil the micro-level mechanisms of the effects with detailed firm-level data. In a word, our paper nicely supplements the deficiencies of existing studies on the temperature-exports relationship.====In more detail, we examine whether an extremely hot day (e.g., daily average temperature above 30?¡ãC) has statistically significant cumulative effects on firm-level exports relative to heat-free days.==== We adopt an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to estimate the cumulative effects by exploiting the variations in daily weather data and monthly international trade data. The cumulative effects demonstrate how the impact of extreme heat evolves. We find that following a heat shock (i.e., an additional >30?¡ãC?day), firm-level exports do not show a notable decrease in the beginning three months, then gradually decline and show no sign of recovery within 24?months. Twenty-four months after a heat shock, a representative exporter's cumulative losses could be up to 0.83% of its annual exports. The results are robust to many alternative regression specifications. The persistent negative effects of extreme heat in our paper are also reflected in ====. She finds that the detrimental effects of rising temperature in exporting countries are persistent and accumulate over several years.====Extreme heat may affect a firm's exports by impacting its production process and output. We explore micro-mechanisms behind the cumulative effects with detailed firm-level production and accounting data. In particular, we test whether extreme heat has a significant impact on an exporter's output, labor, investment, capital, and productivity. The empirical results support the following channel: extreme heat significantly hurts an exporter's investment and capital stock; its output and exports are reduced considerably. We do not find that extreme heat has a significant effect on an exporter's labor or productivity. Our study is the first to unveil the channel behind the commonly found negative impact of extreme heat on exports. Related studies confirm some parts of our channel under different scenarios. For example, ==== find that an additional day above 30?¡ãC can lead Chinese manufacturing firms to reduce investment by 0.1%. ==== find that high temperatures could impact machine performance and lower capital productivity in Chinese manufacturing firms. ==== finds that extreme heat reduces a country's gross output.====To find the effects of extreme heat on exports of different industries, we aggregate firm-level exports to 66 two-digit Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) categories and group them into three broad categories: agricultural products (e.g., meat, dairy products, and eggs), light manufacturing products (e.g., beverages, textile, furniture, footwear) and heavy ====We also examine the impact of extreme heat on exporters of different ownership types. The results show that exporters closely related to foreign direct investment (FDI) are the most affected, while domestic private-owned exporters and state-owned exporters are not significantly impacted. FDI-related enterprises in China are generally export-oriented, and they are usually more capital-intensive than domestic firms (====, ====). The significant effects on FDI-related enterprises are in line with the found channel. The domestic private-owned exporters are often labor-intensive. The State-owned exporters are likely to be capital-intensive (====). However, they receive subsidies and implicit protection from the government (====), especially after adverse shocks. These supportive measures are likely to mitigate the damaging effects of heat shocks they receive.====Our paper is closely related to studies on the relationship between temperature and exports. ==== use global trade data to study the relationship between the annual growth rate of a country's exports in a particular product category to the country's average temperature in that year. ==== study the effects of the average temperature on China's international trade at the city-product-level. ==== study the effects of the annual average temperature on international bilateral trade flows for 134 countries during the 1992¨C2014 period. These three studies use annual trade data and focus on the instantaneous effects of high temperatures. They unanimously find that high temperatures have adverse instantaneous effects on trade. Our paper is the first to use monthly firm-level export data and detailed firm information to quantify the cumulative effects of extreme heat on exports and unveil the mechanism behind the effects.====Our paper is also closely related to studies on the long-run effects of weather extremes. According to the demand-driven international trade models, extreme weather events should not have a long-run impact on exports because economies that consume exported goods are unlikely to be affected by the same severe weather events. The empirical study of ==== supports this idea with aggregate data. They find that cyclones have no long-run effect on a country's exports. Our results demonstrate that temperature extremes have a significant and persistent impact on firms' exports over time. Furthermore, we find firm-level exports show a no-recovery pattern after the extreme heat. Our findings support the ¡°no-recovery¡± hypothesis after weather extremes in the literature (====, ====).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we develop a conceptual framework to show how high temperatures could affect a firm's exports. Section III introduces the data and presents summary statistics. In Section IV, we explain our ==== strategy and describe how to calculate the cumulative effects. In Section V, we offer the main results, several robustness checks, channels behind the results, and three extensions.

Based on high-quality administrative data from birth certificates in Shenzhen, China, we first show that a considerable number of births are shifted from one week before the Dragon year to one week after the Dragon year begins, mainly through vaginal and elective C-sections. Then, we estimate the causal health effects of delaying births but do not find any significant results, as measured by birth weight, Apgar scores, and neonatal mortality.","In traditional Chinese culture, each lunar calendar year is assigned a zodiac animal which appears in the cycle once every 12?years.==== Unlike the other 11 animals, the Dragon is worshiped as a mythical creature from heaven and symbolizes auspiciousness, power, and greatness. As a result, China's feudal emperors always claimed themselves to be the true son of Dragons; parents also express hopes that ¡°the child becomes a dragon¡± (==== in Chinese). In general, the Dragon is held in high esteem for its majesty and positive connotations in Chinese society.====, ====; ====), Hong Kong (====; ====), and other Asian countries with a large Chinese population (==== for Singapore and Malaysia). Although Mainland China did not witness such baby booms in the dragon years of 1976 and 1988, a recent study reports that births increased in 2012, the last Dragon year (====).====Although there is rich literature on the dragon year baby boom, it remains unclear whether superstitious beliefs can affect the timing of births via mechanisms, other than consciously timing conception for a dragon year. Intuitively, in a society with such a strong dragon preference, some expectant mothers whose ¡°due dates¡± are close to a Dragon year may strategically alter the date of delivery to ensure that their babies are born in the Dragon year, although no previous studies reported such behaviors. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by exploring high-quality birth registry data for all births in Shenzhen, a ==== in southern China. The data spans the period from 2010 to the most recent dragon year, 2012 (based on the solar calendar), and contains exact dates of birth, which are uniquely suited to this study.====Our results suggest that approximately 210 (or 6.7% of births) births are shifted from one week before the Dragon year to one week after the Dragon year begins relative to the same period in previous years in Shenzhen, where the mean number of daily births is 538. Moreover, this manipulation is mainly attributed to elective cesarean delivery and vaginal delivery, which account for 48% and 40.5% of these shifts respectively. Our results about the extra vaginal births confirm that postponement of child delivery can also be achieved by pregnant women themselves, within a limited time frame, in response to cultural beliefs (====).====We do not find any heterogeneous responses in mothers' characteristics regarding this birth shifting. However, we indeed find that families with high socioeconomic status are more likely to time pregnancy for a dragon year, which provides a caveat note on the literature, assuming that being born in a dragon year is a random event (see ====; ====; ====).====After identifying the impact of the Dragon superstition on the timing of births, we further assess whether postponement of delivery for nonmedical reasons affects neonatal health outcomes. To do so, we compare the health outcomes of those born around the Dragon year (December 2011 and January 2012) to the outcomes of those born in the non-Dragon year in the same period of time, using babies born in other months of the year as controls. The difference-in-difference (DID) method can net out unobserved time trends between the Dragon year and non-Dragon years and eliminate selection biases such that only relatively healthy mothers choose to shift their deliveries into the Dragon year. Our results show an increase in birthweight among the newborns with delayed births, but the increase is not statistically significant. Other health outcomes, such as 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores and neonatal mortality, are also nonsignificant.====Existing studies have evaluated the health effects of timing delivery in response to a variety of economic incentives (====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).==== find that the suddenly announced ¡°Baby Bonus¡± for babies born on or after July 1 of 2004 in Australia led to 1000 births moving from June to July of that year, and that these delayed-delivery babies have higher birth weights compared to their counterparts====. Similarly, ==== and ==== utilize a natural experiment induced by parental leave benefits reform in Germany to study birth timing and neonatal health. Both studies find that the reform led to approximately 1000 births shifting from the last few days of 2006 to the first few days of 2007, but do not find any significant health consequences associated with these delayed births ====. In addition, ==== and ====, ==== find that many women brought deliveries forward in response to tax benefits in the US or to baby bonus cancellation in Spain respectively. They also find that such forward shifted births, even at full term, have negative health consequences in terms of birthweight, Apgar score, and hospitalization rates later in life.====Our paper contributes to this literature in two important ways. First, it provides evidence that some Chinese families strategically alter the timing of births in response to the Dragon superstition, a belief that persists worldwide among Asian populations. Second, most existing studies explore the effects of economic incentives on birth timing and the resulting health consequences. A possible source of bias is that economic incentives, such as the baby bonus for eligible families, may also help increase investment in childcare and consequently improve infant health later in life. Our study, relying on superstition induced birth timing behavior, is less subject to such confounding bias.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides background information on the Chinese zodiac and discusses related studies. ==== describes the data and identification strategy. ==== presents the results on the effect of the Dragon year on birth timing. ==== reports the causal health results, and ==== concludes the paper.","Dragon year superstition, birth timing, and neonatal health outcomes",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000122,13-Jan-21,2021,Research Article,305

In this paper, we develop a model of heterogeneous firms with intermediate trade and two skill inputs, in which we apply the fair wage hypothesis to predict the wage premium changes according to firms' GVCs activities. The model predicts that firms' backward GVC participation, as measured by the share of foreign value-added content in exports (FVAR), has an ambiguous impact on wage inequality of skills, which depends on the relative importance of ¡°FVAR-labor substitution effect¡± and ¡°FVAR-profit effect.¡± However, moving to upstream sectors in GVCs, as measured by the export varieties' upstreamness (or average distance from final use), raises a firm's wage premium. Using detailed Chinese firm-level data from 2000 to 2006, we develop a Mincer-type empirical model to study the wage premium changes associated with FVAR and upstreamness. We find robust empirical evidence that the rise of wage inequality in China mainly arises from moving to more upstream sectors rather than changing GVC participation.","Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the global value chains (GVCs), in which each country specializes in several stages of production and cooperates to produce the final goods. The international fragmentation in GVCs, also known as the second ¡°unbundling¡± of production, allows firms to use imported intermediates for production (====). The vertical specialization and intermediate trade of GVCs have reshaped the labor market of each country. Plenty of studies have studied how globalization affects wage inequality==== (====; ====; ====; ====), but few studies focus on the impact of GVCs on the wage premium, especially at the firm level.====This paper studies the impact of GVC activities on wage inequality in China. An unusual fact of China is that Chinese firms are increasingly substituting domestic materials for imported intermediates, with the average share of foreign value-added content in exports (FVAR) declining from 35% in 2000 to 30% in 2007==== (====). In contrast, most other countries tend to have an upward trend of FVAR by deepening their backward participation in GVCs (====; ====; ====). Participating in GVCs gives access to foreign intermediates, which changes the relative demands for domestic skills and has important implications for the skill wage premium (====). Recent studies investigate the impact of intermediate trade or offshoring on wage inequality (====; ====). However, these studies focus on specific GVC activities, failing to fully picture firms' GVC activities and their linkages with the wage premium.====The purpose of this paper is to provide a unified framework to explain how the changes in GVC participation and position affect the wage inequality of skills within firms. We intend to make the following contributions. First, we incorporate firms' GVC activities into a trade model of heterogeneous firms by decomposing exports into value-added terms and linking value-added trade to different skills. We seek to explain the variations of firms' wage premiums in terms of changes in their GVC activities, which include, in particular, participating in GVCs by using imported intermediates for the production of exports (measured by the share of foreign value-added in exports, FVAR) and moving to more upstream sectors in GVCs (measured by the upstreamness index).====In this model, we follow the setup of ==== and ==== and further apply the fair wage hypothesis to link the wage premium to firms' performance (====). The fair wage hypothesis assumes that workers determine their efforts according to the difference between the real wage and the wage they perceive to be fair for their role (====). In equilibrium, firms with more profits tend to pay higher wages to workers to elicit their efforts==== (====, ====, ====). Following ====, we further assume the skilled workers have bargaining power in their fair wages according to firms' performance, while unskilled workers accept the minimum wage of the relevant industries and provinces.==== Therefore, more profitable firms tend to pay higher skill wage premium (====).====The model proceeds as follows. Firms make decisions on participating in GVCs by importing intermediates for the production of exports. Only profitable firms can overcome the sunk costs of entering foreign markets and participate in the GVCs. Under the fair wage hypothesis, GVC firms tend to be more profitable and pay higher wages to skilled workers than non-GVC firms. We further analyze the static and dynamic associations between GVC activities and wage premiums. We find that increasing foreign value-added in exports (FVAR) does not always generate higher skill premiums. On the one hand, the use of FVAR reduces costs and generates higher profits, which is called the ¡°FVAR-profit effect¡± in this paper.==== Under the fair wage hypothesis, more profitable firms tend to pay higher wages to skilled labor. On the other hand, FVAR has a direct impact on domestic skills. In the model, we assume that unskilled workers barely have bargaining power on wages and accept minimum wages, so the impact of FVAR on wage inequality depends on whether imported intermediates substitute or complement skilled labor. We observe that FVAR substitutes skilled workers in China,==== indicating declining FVAR raises demands for domestic skilled workers, leading to higher wage inequality, termed as the ¡°FVAR-labor substitution effect.¡± The overall impact of FVAR on skill premium depends on the relative importance of the ¡°FVAR-profit effect¡± and ¡°FVAR-labor substitution effect¡± in the model.====Furthermore, we assume that upstream sectors have higher sunk costs than downstream firms, so firms at more upstream sectors tend to be profitable than downstream firms. Therefore, they are associated with higher wage inequality between skilled workers and unskilled workers. Moreover, firms have to pay extra costs to move upstream in GVCs. We assume firms pay the extra costs by improving the productivity shifters between skilled and unskilled workers. Moving more upstream in GVCs raises firms' productivity shifter and profits, further increasing the wage premium of skills.====Second, we construct micro measurements of GVC participation and position for both processing and ordinary firms, which reduces the aggregation biases of using the international input-output tables (IIOTs) to estimate FVAR (====). IIOTs is constructed on the proportionality assumption that all firms within one sector use the same ratio of imported intermediates for production (====). However, firms are heterogeneous in value-added trade. For example, processing exporters tend to use a higher proportion of imported intermediates than ordinary exporters. Thus, in some developing countries where processing trade is dominant (e.g., China, Vietnam, Philippines, etc.), the oversampling of processing firms in the IIOTs leads to aggregation biases in the FVAR estimation==== (====; ====).====Using the Chinese firm-level data combined with transactional-level trade data from 2000 to 2006,==== we can trace value-added trade by embracing firm heterogeneity. The firm-level GVC participation index is measured by the share of foreign value-added content in exports (FVAR), which captures firms' participation in GVCs through backward production linkages (====; ====). We combine the procedures of ==== and ==== to estimate the FVAR of processing firms and ordinary firms. As noted, we find that firms in China show a declining trend in FVAR between 2000 and 2006. The firm-level GVC position is measured by the upstreamness index, representing the ¡°distances¡± of firms' output to the final demand in the international input-output tables (IIOTs). The more stages the output reaches the end-user, the more upstream position it is in the GVCs. Following ==== and ====, we use the export share as the weight to calculate the average upstreamness of export varieties at the firm level. We observe an upward trend of upstreamness, indicating that Chinese manufacturing firms are shifting to more upstream industries in GVCs (====).====Third, this paper investigates the impacts of GVCs on wage inequality within firms, which was rarely discussed in China due to the lack of wage data for skilled workers and unskilled workers.==== Following ====, we develop a Mincer-type econometric framework to estimate the firm-level wage inequality from the average wage and the share of skilled labor.==== We also introduce both firm-level GVC participation and GVC position into the empirical specification as predictors of wage inequality. This approach makes up the limitation of data availability and provides new micro evidence on the impact of GVCs on firm-level wage inequality.====This paper's last contribution is to effectively deal with the possible endogenous nexus between GVC indexes and firms' wage premiums. As we know, the GVC indicators are outcome variables, which depend on the observed and unobserved firm characteristics and incur possible endogenous problems in the estimation. The endogeneity might arise from the self-selection effect of GVC participation (sample selection bias), mismeasurement errors, reverse causality, and the unobserved firm heterogeneity.====To overcome this challenge, we first use the two-step control function approach (CF) to correct the self-selection effect, which allows for heterogeneous treatment effects combined with self-selection into treatment (====). Then, we adopt the lagged 1-period import tariff as an instrument of FVAR. Tariff is an effective instrument as it directly determines FVAR, while as a policy indicator, it is barely affected by wages. Apart from the exogenous instrument, we also adopt ==== method to construct supplement instruments for FVAR and instruments for upstreamness. This technique allows consistent estimation with endogenous variables in the absence of instruments by exploiting heteroskedasticity for identification. It also efficiently deals with endogeneity due to unobservable and mismeasured regressors.====Using detailed firm-level data in China, we find robust empirical evidence of the predictions in the model. Firstly, we find that GVC firms tend to pay higher wages than non-GVC firms. Secondly, we find that firms with more FVAR do not necessarily pay higher wage premiums. The overall impact of declining FVAR on wage inequality is insignificant in China, suggesting the ¡°FVAR-labor substitution effect¡± may offset the ¡°FVAR-profit effect.¡± Moreover, we observe that firms' upstreamness is positively associated with the wage premium. Firms in more upstream sectors tend to pay higher wages to skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. GVC upgrading by moving to more upstream sectors==== enlarges the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. These findings are consistent with the view that firms share the additional surplus generated by GVC activities, mostly with skilled workers rather than unskilled workers. They also indicate that GVC upgrading, rather than changing global value chain participation, has aggravated the wage inequality of skills within Chinese manufacturing firms.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== develops a model of heterogeneous firms to link skill wage premium changes with firms' GVC participation and position. In ====, we describe the data and provide the firm-level measurement of GVC indicators. We also derive the empirical specification from the theoretical model. In ====, we show some empirical results of robustness tests. In ====, we conclude and provide some policy implications.====In this appendix, we analyze firms' wage premium determination in the open economy. Following ====, firm productivity follows a specific distribution with the density function of g(¦Õ). Similar to ====, firms choose to enter the domestic or foreign markets. For potential market entrants, their expected profit from the market is written as ==== where ¦Ä is the exogenous probability of firms' exit (====). Only firms with positive expected profits (v(====)?¡Ý?0) choose to enter the market. The profit of the marginal firm ==== satisfies ¦Ð(====)?=?0 with cut-off productivity ¦Õ?. Inspired by ====, we assume that each firm has to pay the fixed cost ==== to produce the final product ¦Ø. The production follows a random draw ¦Ë==== = (¦Õ, z====, ¦Ó) which depends on productivity, the upstreamness of the variety, and the marginal trade cost of imported intermediates. The joint probability density function of ¦Ë==== is g(¦Ë====), and its marginal probability density function could be written as ====. The probability of firms entering the market successfully becomes:====where G(¦Õ) is the cumulative distribution function of ====(====) and ¦Õ? is the cut-off productivity of the marginal firm that enters the domestic market successfully. For the successful domestic entrants, their average costs are ==== where ==== denotes the wage premium within firms. And the average profit of the domestic market would be ====. The free entry condition ensures the expected value of firms equals to zero where the expected revenue equals to the sunk cost ==== with ¡Òv(====)====(====)====?=?====. The free-entry condition satisfies:====Eq. ==== reveals the relationship between the average market profit and cut-off productivity. Higher cut-off productivity indicates a lower cut-off marginal cost ==== with the smaller possibility for firms to enter the market. In this case, firms would expect to get higher profits to overcome the fixed costs. As a result, the average market profit decreases with the cut-off marginal cost ====.====The marginal firms get zero profits (ZCP) in equilibrium (====), which is written as =====0. ==== represents the cut-off marginal cost. The average market profit conditional on ==== would be:====Eq. ==== indicates that the average profit depends on the cut-off marginal cost ====, which is further determined by cut-off productivity ¦Õ and the wage premium ====. Lower cut-off cost ==== expels out of the market and decreases the average profit of the market due to the tougher competition. The zero-profit condition (ZCP) suggests the positive correlation between the average industrial profit and marginal cost ====.====Given macro variables as exogenous, the marginal cost ==== would be uniquely determined by the free-entry and zero-profit conditions, as shown in Fig. A.1. It should be noticed that only firms with the marginal cost ==== < ==== could enter the domestic market successfully. Moreover, for the marginal firms with cut-off productivity, their profits in the market equal to zero. It means that we can estimate the determinants of the wage premium of marginal firms, which satisfies ==== given ==== as exogenous. Higher cut-off productivity leads to larger wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers in marginal firms. Moreover, given a higher z, the wage premium of firms would be improved by increasing the productivity shifter of skilled labor.====Similar to ====, firms choose to import or export after opening up, which lowers the cut-off marginal cost of domestic firms and forces inefficient firms to exit the market. For example, for importers, the marginal firms of imports have zero profit and marginal cost ====to enter the foreign market. These firms have to bear extra sunk cost of importing (====), and their expected profits is written as ====. Thereby the marginal cost of importing could be written as ====. As we know, ====?>?1 and ====?>?1, the cut-off cost for importing firms (====) is smaller than that of domestic firms (====), which rules the high-cost domestic firms out of importing market.====Moreover, the probability of entering the foreign market is written as ==== where ==== is the cut-off productivity for marginal importing firms. For importing firms, their average cost of importing equals to ====. And their average profit of importing intermediates from one country becomes ====. If firms import from N countries at the same time, the average profits from importing would equal to ====. If firms import from N countries at the same time, the average profits from importing would equal to ====. Moreover, their average profit from domestic market and import markets becomes:====Eq. ==== indicates that the average profit for firms using imported intermediates is higher than that of the closed economy. Firms could lower their average cost and gain extra profits by importing intermediates. According to ====, the same pattern exists for firms of exporting. As shown in Fig. A.1, there is a unique equilibrium with the free-entry and zero-profit conditions in autarky, which determines the cut-off marginal costs of entering the market and the average industrial profit. Trade liberalization moves the zero-profit curve upwards while keeping the free-entry condition unchanged, which lowers the marginal cost of entering the market. The high-cost firms are ruled out of the market, which further improves the average profit of the industry.====For the domestic firms, their profits are reduced by opening up from ====-1] in autarky to ====-1] in the open economy as ====?<?====. The fierce competition after opening up reduces domestic firms' profit from ¦Ð====(====) to ====(====) in ====. According to the fair wage hypothesis, firms with low profits would cut the skilled workers' fair wages to reduce their costs. The change narrows the wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers within the firms. The same trend exists in marginal importers or exports, which enter foreign markets with zero profits. The profits from foreign markets could not make up the loss in the domestic market, and as a result, the marginal importers or exporters would like to reduce their wage premium to maintain the profits in the open economy, as shown in Fig. A.2.====As a result, trade liberalization widens wage inequality of skills with improved profits of existing firms after opening up. Moreover, after opening up, not every firm chooses to participate in GVCs. The GVC firms have to overcome the fixed costs and iceberg costs of importing intermediates and exporting. Compared to the domestic firms in the open economy, the GVC firms have lower cut-off marginal costs, which expel the inefficient and less profitable firms out of the global value chains. Participating in GVCs enables firms to import intermediates with lower costs, which increases firms' profits and enlarges the wage inequality of skills under the fair wage hypothesis. Similarly, upgrading in the GVCs increases firms' relative productivity of skilled labor over unskilled labor, which improves firm profits with wider wage inequality of skills.","Global value chains, firms, and wage inequality: Evidence from China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000031,9-Jan-21,2021,Research Article,306

It is well known that providers of specialized investments may be taken advantage when the contract is incomplete, thus an improvement in legal environments may be able to better protect those specialized asset investors and provide them with stronger incentive for specialized investments hence promote the overall level of specialization of the economy and enhance labor productivity. (1) We use the data set from IEDB(Industrial Enterprises Data Bank) of China to capture this effect. It is found that legal environment improvement does enhance the labor productivity through encouragement of specialization. This effect is robust under different settings in assumptions of endogeneity, heterogeneity and measurements of productivity index. (2) Heterogeneity analysis shows that a bigger market scale does encourage deeper specialization, more specialized investments, and thus improving the labor productivity. (3) The above conclusion holds up not only at the micro (firm) level but also at the macro level of the economy. The labor productivity increase happens with the growth of an ==== along with deeper specialization and better legal environments.","; ====; ====), but the reason for these differences is still subject to debate. In recent years, economists have paid greater attention to the effect of institutions. ==== attribute the economic advances in the West (1500¨C1850) to the benefits of Western institutions. ====, in explaining the ¡°Needham Puzzle¡±====emphasized that the imperial examination system in China cut off creativity among the Chinese literati and created a gap between China and world powers in the late Qing Dynasty (1840¨C1912). Based on economic intuition, a better institutional structure benefits long-term economic development and ultimately affects a country's productivity and economic direction.====Data sources: IEDB 2006 and ==== of Appendix 1) can see that the overall relationship was not affected in that figure.====Data sources: IEDB 2006. The y-axis is provincial level labor productivity measurement, we use per worker sales revenue within the firm to measure labor productivity and then use sales revenue weights to calculate the provincial level labor productivity. The x-axis is a measurement of specialized investments. At firm level it is defined to the logarithm of per capital asset multiplied by contract intensity of the industry. The weighted average across firms weighted by their ratio of sales revenue within a province to get the provincial level measurements. 4 outliers Beijing, Shanghai, Tibet and Hainan were not put in the figure here but included in the appendix (==== of Appendix 2) one can see that the overall relationship was not affected in that figure.====In the paper, first, we establish an ==== that incorporates the consideration of legal environments, specialized investments and incomplete contracts and put forward two important hypotheses. (1) An improvement in legal environments increases the expected return for specialized investments, making investors the residual claimer for surplus returns. Thus, firms will invest more in specialized investments. (2) Better legal environments will encourage firms to invest more in specialized investments, and at the same time, specialized investments can promote the level of specialization of the whole industry and finally lead to a higher overall labor productivity.==== component and reallocation component. We find that legal environment mainly improves the industry growth component of labor productivity.====Two main types of literature related to this study. The first category is incomplete contracts and specialized investments. ==== defines asset specificity as an asset to reflect its value only for a specific purpose, and the value plummets if it is used for another one. Asset specificity can save a lot of transaction costs (information gathering, negotiation, etc.) and thus improve an enterprise's production efficiency. ==== and ==== conducted studies on incomplete contracts under the condition of symmetrical information between the two sides. Some of the quality, behavior, and other conditions are observable by both parties to a contract, but not by third parties. In ex post negotiations, one party in specialized investments creates hold-up problems, resulting in insufficient specialized investments. ==== provides a benchmark our analysis and lays down the foundation of our paper to extend analysis to legal environment and specialized investments. ==== points out the equivalence between contract incompleteness and legal environments and verified this conclusion using cross country comparison. This equivalence makes it hard to explain the difference in labor productivity across regions within the same country. For different regions within the same country, the asymmetry in information, culture and technology characteristics is relatively small, leads to homogeneity of contracts among the regions, thus it is hard to explain the cross-region differential in same country within the framework of ====. According to ====, similar contract structure across different regions should lead to similar labor productivity. However, from ==== we can see the big difference across regions inside China. Their failure to explain regional productivity difference in China lies in their equivalence between contract incompleteness and bad legal environments. Our view is that contract incomplete is mainly determined by the technological characteristics of the industry, the more complex production technology it is harder to foresee all the problems down the road thus higher degree of contract incompleteness. However, for legal environments, especially the implementation of laws varies a good deal across regions indicating the evolution of the legal system are not at the same pace across regions inside China. This legal environment difference plays a role in driving productivity differential across different regions inside China. This effect does not depend on the technology of the industry thus it is different from the contract incompleteness used by ====. We focus on how legal environment might affect firm's investments decisions in specialized assets and further affects labor productivity. Furthermore, our paper differs from ==== in terms of policy implications. Their paper points out the way to rely on market to solve the contract incompleteness problem especially through better bargaining mechanisms while our paper emphasizes how the government can help to provide better legal environment by better implementation of existing laws and by making complete the existing set of laws to reduce firms legal cost in case of contract disputes, protecting returns to investments in specialized assets, stimulating investments in specialized assets.====The second category is about how to solve incomplete contracts. With regard to the hold-up problems brought about by specialized investments, many scholars (====; ====; ====; ====) supporting enterprises to solve the problem through vertical integration. The decentralized economy is more efficient. Greater social welfare will result if hold-up problems can be resolved without vertical integration. Some scholars suggest using legal means to address hold-up problems. The essential problem in hold-up is that third parties to a contract cannot verify specialized investments (incomplete contract), thus the contract cannot be enforced. However, ====, ==== states that if validation costs lead to incomplete contracts, it is preferable for the court to enforce contracts through certain verifiable provisions, rather than relying on default rule. ==== holds that a good institutional environment can reduce moral hazard problems for the team and thus increase team investments in human capital to raise productivity. ==== expressed the degree of perfection in the legal environment as the probability that enterprises are willing to accept complete contracts and studied the problem of enterprise acceptance and rejection of specialized investments under complete contracts.====The research of the literature has brought us many inspiring thoughts. First, legislation has a scale advantage and a large number of prior cases. Second, legislation can change the expectation return of enterprises' specialized investments, which enables enterprises to obtain residual claims, stimulating them to increase specialized investments, helping to increase the labor productivity of enterprises.

We apply this method to China, which has experienced a 10-fold expansion of its higher education sector over the last two decades. We find that about half of online job-seekers in China are two or more years overeducated, resulting in 5.1% pay penalty. However, the effect of overeducation on pay varies significantly by college quality, city type, and the match of college major with ====. Graduates in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) or LEM (Law, Economics and Management) from Key Universities are much less likely to be overeducated in the first place, and actually enjoy a significant pay premium even when they are in the situation.","There has been a large body of literature on the returns to education in the labor market. Recent studies suggest declining return to education (====; ====; ====). On the supply side, there has been a steady increase of labor force with higher education (HE). For example, in China, over the decade from 1999, annual enrollment into HE increased by almost fivefold (====). Although the HE system has played a role in China's remarkable economic growth over the last 4 decades, the continuous supply of new graduates in excess of 7 million each year (====) in the past decade has put growing pressure on the graduate labor market. Indeed, there is abundance of anecdote evidence of growing qualification mismatch in the labor market, with frequent media reports of people with doctorate degrees teaching at primary or secondary schools and many college graduates unable to find jobs that match their majors. However, systematic evidence is still sparse on the matching of the supply with the demand side of the labor market. One way of bringing in the demand side is through the concept of overqualification (====).====Overqualification refers to a state of disequilibrium, whereby workers possess excess educational qualifications relative to those their jobs require. The concept was first proposed by ====, ==== and ====, where the focus was on the difference of average education levels between the supply side and the demand side. Later research extends this concept to the individual level (====; ====; ====; ====). A general consensus is that overeducation leads to lower returns to education and lower job satisfaction, which implies waste in educational investment (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Hitherto, there is hardly any studies of overqualification in China, despite a 10-fold expansion of the HE sector in China since 1999 producing more than one hundred million college graduates.==== Behind the flourishing labor market and its enormous scale, however, it is uncertain whether this supply shock has resulted in mismatch and potential waste of education input.====In this paper, we focus on whether the boost in higher-educated labor supply is fully utilized by the demand side. In other words, the ==== may not have developed or upgraded as fast as the growth of better-educated population, resulting in inefficiency in human capital utilization. As a result, we may see mis-allocation of labors, unemployment, and redundancy in over-pursuit of academic degrees. To better understand status quo and its possible future implication, it is important to study qualification mismatch in the labor market in China.====The lack of labor mismatch research in China is partly due to data availability limitations. We overcome this problem by using data from ====, one of the major online labor recruitment platforms in China. To fully utilize the largely textual data, we resort to functions in Python, such as the dictionary-building implementation, and ====, the best Chinese word segmentation module so-far, to extract key words we need for the research. The main advantages of the data are as below. First, recruitment criteria are clearly listed on online recruitment platforms, therefore we can measure whether and to what extent the demand side and supply side are mismatched, with relative objectiveness. As a comparison, most previous research uses questionnaires and asks the job holders whether they feel they are overqualified or whether they would be offered the job if they applied for the job today, which is either subjective or under a hypothetical scenario, with possible systematic underestimation or overestimation by a certain group (====). Second, data based on online recruitment platforms offers unrivalled timeliness, as it is almost updated on the go, therefore up-to-date and ready to fetch immediately. Third, compared to the survey-based approach, our approach to data collection can offer larger sample sizes and greater area coverage, at very low marginal costs, at least in principle. In fact, our sample data include job seekers from more than 200 cities, making cross-city heterogeneity analysis possible, which could not be done by survey data due to high costs. Fourth, online recruitment platforms are typically more advantageous in the richness of controls. For instance, few surveys would collect information on college major and quality (selectivity), industry, occupation, employment history, and (desired) salaries, all at once.====Therefore, our first contribution is in the development of a novel approach to study overeducation by extracting pre-match information from online recruitment platforms using word segmentation and dictionary building techniques via Python. Using a real example, we demonstrate significant advantages of this new approach over traditional survey-based approaches in objectiveness, timeliness, sample sizes, area coverage and richness of controls. Moreover, this approach is easily adaptable to countries with similar online recruitment platforms.====Our second contribution is to the empirical literature on overeducation, in the context of the China which has experienced a 10-fold expansion of its HE sector over the last two decades. Due to lack to suitable survey data, there has been no study focusing on the wage or earnings effects of overeducation of graduates in China. This was unfortunate, given the importance of China and the totally unprecedented scale of the expansion of its HE sector one could explore. It turns out that online recruitment platforms offer a perfect opportunity to study overeducation of graduates, as people who receive more years of education are more likely to use the online channel for job seeking, and these people are more likely to suffer from overqualification. To this end, our data is more suitable than some other data that mainly focus on rural part of China. Moreover, with the wide area coverage provided by data from online recruitment platforms, we are even able to do heterogeneity analysis across cities, which could provide insights considering the different economic development status in the vast territory of China, but is probably not possible by using survey data due to high costs.==== Industry. On the other hand, having a relevant degree carries a pay premium for IT but not for Finance Industry. Whereas the returns to years of schooling is two percentage points lower in Finance Industry than in IT Industry, being overeducated yields a pay premium in the former but has no effect in the latter industry. The different patterns in the college major-industry mismatch likely reflect the varying mix of industry-specific versus general human capital across college majors on the one hand, and the relative importance of signaling of credentials to employers by industries on the other. Finally, we find strong evidence of heterogeneity in both the incidence of overeducation and the effect of overeducation on pay: graduates in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) or LEM (Law, Economics and Management) from Key Universities are much less likely to be overeducated in the first place, and actually enjoy a significant pay premium even when they are in the situation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== is the review of the relevant literature. ==== presents the data. ==== describes the data matching strategy.

Our empirical results show that the financing cost mechanism cannot explain this increase since the financing costs of green bonds are not lower than those of non-green financial bonds. Furthermore, commercial banks with low asset liquidity engage in regulatory arbitrage to take advantage of the convenience of green bond financing permission to supplement their liquidity. Our results imply that the regulatory arbitrage mechanism is a very important motivation for commercial banks to issue green bonds. To reduce this motivation and ensure the healthy and sustainable development of the green bond market, green ratings of projects should be linked with financing costs as a way to form a positive feedback incentivizing mechanism for green project financers.","Although China's green bond market started late, it has developed rapidly. Since the Chinese government issued the ¡°====¡± at the end of 2015, China's green bond market has entered a stage of rapid development. In 2016, China's issuance of green bonds was the largest in the world, accounting for 39%.==== This phenomenon has been called ¡°From Zero To Hero¡±==== by some international investors. Compared with green bond markets in other countries, green bonds issued by commercial banks are dominant in China, accounting for 77% of all green bonds in 2016, 62% in 2017, and 68% in 2018.==== Why do Chinese commercial banks issue such a large amount of green bonds? An in-depth examination of the motivation of banks can help regulators introduce more effective incentive policies and ensure the healthy and rapid development of China's green bond market.====The existing literature on the motivation of green bond issuance generally posits that issuing green bonds can reduce the issuer's financing costs compared to other types of bonds (hereafter referred to as the ¡°financing cost mechanism¡±). Some studies have found that issuing green bonds can reduce overall environmental governance costs by constructing dynamic theoretical models. It has also been argued that societal welfare would be maximized if companies issue green bonds with a lower rate (====; ====). Other literature empirically studies the motivation of green bond issuance. ==== and ==== empirically show that green bonds are lower in risk premium and higher in liquidity. Furthermore, the trading volume of financial green bonds is larger than non-green financial bonds (====). Thus, it is unclear whether the ¡°financing cost mechanism¡± is the main reason why Chinese commercial banks issue green bonds on a large scale.==== issued a series of strict regulatory policies==== in 2017, which has been called the first year of strong regulation in the Chinese banking industry. The CBRC has strict punishments for various types of regulatory arbitrages and other illegal activities. In 2018, the CBRC officially published ==== provides banks with a new favorable policy that enables them to circumvent the strict regulations of the CBRC. Banks with lower asset liquidity are more likely to issue green bonds to circumvent the regulations and fulfill current assets. We refer to this as the ====.====There appear to be two potential mechanisms that lead banks in China to issue large amounts of green bonds. Given the gaps in the existing literature, this paper carries out detailed empirical research to understand which hypothesis explains the motivation behind this recent green bond trend.====To test the ====, we carefully compared the financing cost of green bond issuance with non-green bond issuance. The financing cost of bond issuance is normally affected by coupon rates, coupon payment frequencies, time to maturity, credit ratings of issuers, and so on. Thus, simply comparing the yield to maturity of the bonds would be insufficient without controlling for other effects. To do this, we first used bootstrapping methods and Nelson-Siegel models to fit the term structures of treasury bonds. We then constructed the risk premium of a green bond and a non-green bond by subtracting the fitted yield of treasury bonds from the calculated yield of the corporate bonds. Finally, we conducted empirical studies on the financing cost of a green bond using the cross-sectional regression method.====The empirical results showed that, among the bonds issued by non-banks, the financing cost of green bonds is significantly lower than that of non-green bonds, in agreement with the findings of the international green bond market (====). However, among the bonds issued by banks, green bonds have no comparative advantage in financing costs compared with non-green bonds. Moreover, when the issuer's credit rating is lower than AA, the financing cost of green bonds is significantly higher than that of non-green bonds. These results are different from those obtained by the international green bond market, which rejects the ====.====To test the ====, we empirically tested whether the asset liquidity ratios of banks induced them to issue green bonds using data on Chinese banks' green bond issuance from 2016 to 2018. The asset liquidity ratios of the banks are proxied by the short-term ratios, deposit rates, and provision coverages from the financial statements of the banks. First, we conducted an empirical analysis of the impact of banks' asset liquidity on the probability of issuing green bonds. Using the BiProbit model to alleviate sample selection bias, the empirical results showed that banks with lower asset liquidity (higher liquidity risk) are more likely to issue green bonds. We then analyzed the effects of commercial bank asset liquidity on the scale of green bond issuance. We adopted the Heckman model to alleviate endogenous problems caused by possible sample selection bias and introduced a threshold model to consider the non-linear relationship between asset liquidity and the dollar amount of issued green bonds. After controlling for the demand for green project investment, the results showed that the lower the liquidity of the commercial bank, the higher the proportion of issued green bonds. Commercial banks with lower asset liquidity (higher liquidity risk) have a strong incentive to issue more green bonds for regulatory arbitrage to supplement their asset liquidity. Thus, the ¡°Regulatory Arbitrage Mechanism¡± is particularly important for explaining the motivation of China's commercial banks to issue a large number of green bonds.====Our results indicate that China's commercial banks issue large scale green bonds not because of favorable financing costs, but rather because of the policy that provides the financing permission convenience, and because some banks with low asset liquidity take advantage to conduct regulatory arbitrage. To ensure the healthy and sustainable development of the green bond market, it is necessary to link financing costs to the rating of the green bond issuers. In other words, a set of positive feedback incentives is needed for green bond issuers to effectively reduce their financing costs. This requires a better green certification mechanism and information disclosure mechanism and more effective incentive mechanisms for ====.====This is the first paper to study the motivation of banks to issue green bonds from the perspective of regulatory arbitrage. Our results can help regulators formulate more reasonable green bond issuance rules and promote the development of a healthy green bond market.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In ====, we summarize the existing literature on the financing costs of green bonds and regulatory arbitrage for commercial banks. In ====, research hypotheses are discussed.

Existing estimations in ==== countries involve establishing the relationship between work and health on a younger cohort, extrapolating the relationship to older individuals, and deriving the excess health capacity as the difference between predicted and actual employment rates. However, benchmarking on the younger cohort is sub-optimal because the observable retirement-health relationship changes with age. The dual nature of the Chinese social security system provides us with a relatively neat benchmark, allowing us to estimate the excess health capacity among urban workers benchmarking on rural residents in the same age range. Using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, this choice, combined with other fine-tuning, yields significantly lower but still substantial excess capacity among older urban workers than benchmarking against younger cohorts. Altogether, among urban Chinese aged 45¨C69, 31.2 million extra workers can potentially be added to the workforce.","One effective way to alleviate the pressure of population aging is to delay retirement. Many countries have already done so, but the process is often contentious (====). One of the most commonly used counter arguments has been that older people are unhealthy and thus incapable of working. Indeed, it is inhumane to force an ailing person to work, no matter how much economic sense it makes. Therefore, to gauge the potential of postponing retirement, it is crucial to examine the work capacity among older persons based on health considerations alone.====A series of highly influential studies organized by the NBER estimated the health capacity to work of older people in ==== countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and several other European countries (papers collected in Wise 2017). Using surveys in the family of HRS (Health and Retirement Study) around the world which contain rich and comparable information on health and employment, sizeable excess capacity is found in every studied country. For example, unutilized work capacity among men aged 65¨C69 is 40% in Japan, 31% in the U.S., 57% in the U.K., and 84% in Germany. For women in the same age group, the additional work capacity is 31% in Japan, 29% in the U.S., 57% in the U.K., and 68% in Germany.====It is worth emphasizing that these studies define the health capacity to work mainly on health status, aside from very limited demographics. Naturally, an individual's decision to retire is also affected by considerations such as social security, private pension, and disability insurance programs, which have contributed to the declining labor force participation of older workers in OECD countries in the 20th century (====, ====). The stabilization or even rising labor force participation of older workers in recent decades is also attributable to policy changes (====). Caring responsibilities (for parents and grandchildren) also affect retirement decisions. By focusing on health, this definition of work capacity deliberately measures physical capacity alone, casting aside individual preferences for leisure or home production, as well as employer considerations under existing institutions. Therefore, it measures the size of the potential workforce that can be tapped into by altering institutions or incentives without appearing to be inhumane.====The procedure of the estimation goes as follows. First, pick a benchmark group whose decision to work is free from institutional distortions and estimate the relationship between employment and health. Secondly, use the estimated model to predict employment among older people who qualify for social security retirement. Finally, compare actual and predicted employment rates to derive the excess health capacity to work. The procedure sounds simple, but the devil lies in how to choose the benchmark group. In the NBER series, the benchmark group is a younger cohort just before they reach the retirement age, so essentially they assume the retirement-health relationship to be the same between younger and older cohorts.====Unfortunately, this assumption may be flawed because the relationship between ==== work and health may change with age. For example, chronic disease at an older age may be more debilitating as it may come with other unobserved functional declines. Thus, using younger cohorts as the benchmark group may overstate the extra capacity to work.====While in OECD countries, finding a suitable benchmark group may be difficult, the dual-retirement system in China offers such an opportunity. In urban areas, workers enjoy generous retirement pensions at relatively young ages, but rural people do not have this privilege and usually work until advanced ages (====). Even though the New Rural Pension Program was introduced in 2009 and has provided universal social pension coverage, the amount of pension benefit is minuscule (====) and insufficient to induce early retirement. Existing studies have found that although urban Chinese residents generally have better health status than rural residents (====; ====), the retirement rate is much higher among urban residents (====). The capability of rural workers to participate in the labor market under worse health conditions suggests that the excess work capacity of urban workers is likely substantial. It is thus our goal to estimate the health capacity to work among older urban workers. In the process, we evaluate the merits of choosing various benchmark groups and estimation methods.====The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the Chinese retirement system in urban and rural areas to illustrate the rationale for using rural residents as the benchmark group. Section 3 discusses the literature, lays out the estimation strategy, and describes our data.

There is no evidence that private firms selling products directly to consumers are more likely to engage in additional CP. Our findings indicate that the main motivation behind Chinese private firms' additional CP under high economic policy uncertainty is seeking more government resources, instead of keeping consumers loyal by maintaining good reputations during hard periods.","Corporate philanthropy (hereafter CP) has been widely regarded as an important business strategy for firms to establish good public reputation (====) or enhance the context of bringing firms' social and economic goals into alignment (==== and ====. From this perspective, one may treat CP as a special type of investment, which helps firms establish competitive advantage over their market competitors. However, philanthropic donation will directly and immediately increase firm's operating cost, while its benefits are intangible and may only be realized after a long period. Therefore, it is interesting to understand the rationale behind firms' CP behaviors, especially during recession or crisis periods, such as when economic policy uncertainty increases.====Theoretically, it has been shown that uncertainty plays an important role when firms make investment decisions (====). However, empirically testing this relationship is not easy as measuring uncertainty is very challenging. The seminar work by ==== first construct economic policy uncertainty (hereafter EPU) index by using a novel news¨Cbased approach, and provide some evidence that firms may cut their investment when facing higher EPU. However, little is known about the impact of economic policy uncertainty on firms' charitable donation decisions.

In literature, firms' CP behaviors could be driven by either altruistic, strategic or political motivations (====; ====Our research contributes to the literature in several ways. We first document a discrepancy in China's corporate philanthropy between private firms and non-private firms in an environment with higher economic policy uncertainty. It is widely acknowledged that China's private firms face an unfavorable economic environment compared with their counterparts (H. ====) and philanthropic donation could be one effective business strategy to improve a firm's competitive advantage (====). Our paper provides empirical evidence to support the altruistic and political motivations, ====, the additional CP of private firms under higher economic policy uncertainty is intended to build better connection with the government and thus obtain more government resources.====Second, we extend the literature about the impact of EPU on Chinese firms' operating behaviors. In recent years, the Chinese economy has been facing both domestic and international challenges. In response, the central government has adjusted its economic policies more frequently, which inevitably induces high economic policy uncertainty. Some researchers have begun to explore firms' responses to the high EPU, including firms' investment (S. ====; ====; ====; Y. ====), capital structure (====; F. ====; ====; Hongjian ====; G. ====), as well as R&D spending (====; ====). Almost all of above studies concluded that firms are more conservative when facing higher economic policy uncertainty.

Our temporal study also shows that considerably more Chinese firms were exposed to exchange rate fluctuations after the major exchange rate reform in 2015. We find a negligible role played by international operations of firms in explaining exposures. The level of exchange rate exposure is primarily explained by variables that are proxies for a firm's hedging costs. Larger firms, or firms with less leverage ratio, tend to have smaller exposures. Exposure is found to increase with a firm's growth opportunity. Last but not least, we find that leverage ratios and growth opportunities impact more significantly on exposures for firms with separation of control and cash flow rights.","; ====; ====; ====). An increasing number of studies aim to explain the so-called ¡°foreign exchange exposure puzzle¡± (====; ====).==== as corporate ownership in China is highly concentrated in a small group; more distinctly, controlling rights of the largest shareholder are greater than the cash flow rights (====; ====; ====). This study contributes to existing literature on exposure by taking the unique structures of Chinese corporate ownership into account.====Using the data from July 21, 2005 to December 31, 2018, we empirically estimate and find statistically significant linear and nonlinear foreign exchange rate exposures of all Chinese public firms. Specifically, 5.6% more Chinese public firms show greater sensitivity to nonlinear exposures compared with linear exposures. In addition, considerably more firms were exposed to exchange rate fluctuations after the August 2015 reform: 26.2% of firms respond to nonlinear risks of the US dollar after the milestone exchange reform in 2015, whereas merely 1.4% respond to those risks before the reform.====We also examine whether a firm's exchange rate exposure is determined by its international operations and hedging needs. We find an insignificant role played by international operations in explaining a firm's exposure, as its proxy, the variable of foreign sale ratio, is marginally correlated with exposures. Firms that have high costs of hedging, however, are found to be more vulnerable facing the volatility of foreign exchange rates. The empirical results show that small firms, or firms with high leverage, or firms with a low book-to-market ratio, are more exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, though these effects are less pronounced prior to the exchange rate reform in 2015.====). Our main results survive those tests.====Finally, we examine whether the separation of control and cash flow rights plays a role in determining foreign exchange rate exposures. One distinct feature of Chinese corporations is that in most firms that have controlling shareholders, the controlling rights of the largest shareholder are much larger than her cash flow rights (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The more that controlling shareholders enjoy the private benefits of control, the less likely they are to pursue the maximization of firm value (====; ====; ====). Because entrenchment effects lower firms' sensitivity to cash flow, we expect that highly entrenched firms would be less likely to take risk management strategies to hedge against exchange-rate volatility. As a result, firms with the separation of control and cash flow rights are more exposed to exchange rate movements when there are greater costs of implementing hedging, i.e. high leverage ratio or low book-to-market ratio. The empirical results strongly support this hypothesis.====Our study contributes to the foreign exchange exposure literature in the following ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic attempt to comprehensively investigate foreign exchange rate exposure in China. Second, our evidence specifically suggests that in emerging market economies, China included, high costs of hedging may prevent firms from effectively managing foreign exchange exposures. Perhaps, a comprehensive reform of financial markets in emerging countries is therefore necessary to cope with growing exchange rate fluctuations. Last but not least, we find that a particular agency cost¡ª entrenchment of controlling shareholders¡ªreduces a firm's incentive to hedge against ====.

According to Transparency International, a Berlin-based nongovernmental organization, China ranked second to last among all participating nations in Bribe Payers Index in 2008 and 2011 (the two most recent data points). Second, bureaucrats' discretion over the allocation of resources is an important antecedent to the incidence of bribery. Tax collection authorities are prone to corporate bribery due to their direct contact with firms and their discretion in affecting firms' economic rents.====; ====). Local governments engage in strong inter-regional competition to attract capital and such inter-regional competition often takes the form of fiscal and tax competition (====). Under this backdrop, LTBs play dual, yet somewhat conflicting, roles in China's tax system (====). As a result, LTBs' discretion and informal nature of tax competition often create strong incentives for firms to bribe. For instance, according to a 2004 report by the China's National Audit Office, local governments engage in unlawful tax practices by granting tax cuts and/or exemptions or implementing tax refund policies (====).====We exploit a unique tax collection reform in China. Starting from 1994, ==== were exclusively assigned to local governments and collected by LTBs. In January 2002, China announced a tax reform to centralize the collection of corporate income tax, shifting it from the LTBs to the STBs, for all firms established after December 31, 2001. This paper uses this policy change to examine how the centralization of the tax collection authority affects firms' bribery activities. In particular, we investigate corporate bribery for a sample of public-listed Chinese firms that were registered between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2003. Because firms that were registered before 2002 were not affected by the reform, the policy shock creates an exogenous variation in the tax collection authority among firms established around 2002. We then use the exact time of registration to identify the impact of tax collection authority on firm bribery.====Following ==== and ====, we use a firm's entertainment and travel costs (ETC) expenditures to measure its bribery activities. In practice, ETC expenditures include expenses for meals, gifts, touring and transportation and the normal travelling expenses required by firms in their normal business operation. Besides legitimate businesses travels and other expenses, ETC is commonly used as an accounting category to reimburse expenditures for bribing government officials. ETC is a standard expense item taken directly from accounting books and therefore it is not subject to the biases from using survey data to measure bribery. These expenditures are measured accurately because each reimbursement item in this category requires a receipt (====).====Our results suggest that firms whose income taxes are collected by LTBs (hereafter, LTB firms) bribe more. On average, the bribery payments of LTB firms are 20% higher than those of firms whose taxes are collected by STBs (hereafter, STB firms). This effect is robust to the inclusion of other firm-level determinants of corporate bribery found in the literature. One may worry that LTB firms bribe more simply because they are slightly older, more mature than STB firms. To alleviate this concern, we then reduce the interval window to include firms that were registered within one month surrounding the cutoff date of December 31, 2001. The results reveal that a firm that was registered in December 2001 (an LTB firm) bribe more, by 0.6% of annual sales, than a firm that was registered in January 2002 (an STB firm). In the test of using tightened window, we can isolate the effects of the tax collection authority on corporate bribery. We also perform several analyses to shed light on the role of the local institutional and legal environment. We find that LTB firms bribe more when they are located in provinces where government intervention is more prevalent and where judicial system is less independent.====We proceed to examine the consequences of corporate bribery activities. We show that, when firms bribe more, firms' tax burdens, measured by the effective tax rate (ETR%), are lowered and they receive more tax-related subsidies at the same time. We conduct a cost and benefit analysis and the results suggest that one extra ==== spent in bribe helps LTB firms reap a benefit of 1.42 ====, of which 1.07 is from lowered taxes and 0.35 is from tax-related subsidies. Such evidence indicates reciprocation: firms bribe the tax authority and receive favors in return, which feed back into their incentives to bribe more. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that corrupt collusion takes place between taxpayers and government authorities.====This paper identifies the effect of tax collection authority on corporate bribery and highlights the complicit role of local government agencies. Unlike the previous studies that focus on the firm-level determinants of corporate bribery (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), our findings contribute to this literature by proposing a new explanation from the perspective of the bribe takers. Specifically, we find that local tax authorities in China facilitate firms to pay bribe and offer favoritism to the bribe payers in return. Our results thus provide an explanation as to why corporate bribery is still on the rise. They also imply that an effective way to combat corporate bribery would be through certain government function centralization.====Why developing countries tax so little has long been a puzzle for many policy makers and researchers (====). To explain this puzzle, a growing literature has started to investigate the role of tax enforcement decentralization (====; ====; ====). Our paper contributes to this literature by providing direct evidence on how the collusion between local tax authorities and firms can compromise governments' efforts to collect tax. As such, it pertains to the debates on how tax enforcement efforts should be organized.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== reviews the relevant literature and introduces the institutional background of tax collection in China. The data and empirical methodology are outlined in ====.

Mechanism exploration suggests that market potential is the main channel that HSR encourages ====, which is realized by accelerated information sharing and face-to-face interactions. And the effect is bigger for high-educated families, wealthy families and in large cities.","Transportation infrastructure reduces, to a large extent, the barriers to connectivity, communication, and exchange of information, each of which is essential to ====. Despite the large body of literature that has focused on the economic outcomes of transportation infrastructure, relatively little research has been conducted on the impact of transportation infrastructure on families or individuals. Moreover, although the research on determinants of entrepreneurship has been increasing, almost no evidence has been presented on how transportation infrastructure affects new-venture establishments, and even less is known of how transportation infrastructure affects entrepreneurial activities. This paper fills the gap between the two strands of literature and examines the impact of one emerging transportation infrastructure ¨C high-speed railway (HSR) on entrepreneurship.====An entrepreneur, defined as ¡°a person who organizes and manages a business undertaking, assuming the risk for the sake of profit¡± (====), plays a critical role in making cities economically dynamic (====; ====; ====). However, the effect may differ by educational level (====); wealth (====).====HSR lines run at an average speed of 200?km/h or more (International Union of Railways, UIC). China's HSR construction started in 2007 and entered its rapid development era after the introduction of Mid-to-Long-Term Railway Development Plan in 2008. The aim of the HSR framework is to first establish connections between metropolitan cities, provincial capitals, and major sub-provincial cities and then expand to other widely spaced, population-dense cities in western China that have diverse natural resources. A goal of the plan was to expand operations to 380,000?km of rail by the end of 2025, and the estimated cost of HSR construction was of the order of RMB 80¨C120 million per kilometer (USD 13¨C20 million), excluding stations. Since the plan's implementation, the HSR network has been extended to 29 of China's 34 provincial-level administrative regions, and by the end of 2018, the total mileage was 29,000?km, more than two-thirds of the world's total HSR mileage.====); cities' external economic linkages (====; ====; ====); trade (====; ====; ====; ====; Volpe ====; ====); housing prices (====); and intercity passenger traffic and employment in industries with a higher reliance on non-routine cognitive skills (====; ====; ====). Transportation infrastructure is crucial toward maintaining business relationships, information exchange, and new business opportunity establishment. Therefore, a study of whether and how HSR affects entrepreneurship would be of great significance.====Based on this information, this study draws attention to the impact of the rapidly expanding HSR construction on entrepreneurial activity at the individual level. We regard HSR construction as a quasi-experiment to estimate the role of HSR on entrepreneurial activities and to study the possible mechanisms at stake. To conduct our analyses, we manually collect detailed information on each HSR line from the ==== from 2007 to 2017, officially published by ====. By collecting detailed HSR line information, we avoid the inconsistency problem from station cancellation that may exist if we only know the opening year of the HSR station in a city. Meanwhile, we are also able to calculate the connection density of each HSR city, which helps us estimate the HSR effect more accurately. To obtain information on entrepreneurship, we use data from the ==== (CFPS) conducted by the Institute of Social Science Survey at Peking University from 2010 to 2018 (5 waves, with the survey conducted every two?years). The dataset provides detailed information on entrepreneurial activities at the individual and family level, as well as individual and family attributes such as family assets, income and demographic attributes of family members.====Using a difference-in-differences (DID) method, we find that the operation of HSR leads to an increase in the rate of entrepreneurship by approximately 3.5 percentage points among residents living in the connected city. Specifically, when the frequency of HSR connection doubles, the entrepreneurship rate increases by about 0.7 percentage points (7.28% of the mean value). And we also detect significant heterogeneous effects across different cities and families. For instance, the high-educated cohort, the high-assets cohort, and residents living in big cities ¨C those who have more entrepreneurial resource in the overall sample ¨C benefit disproportionately more from HSR connection.====Next, we document the possible mechanism through which HSR could affect entrepreneurship. We find that market potential increases after a city is connected to HSR network, and it will facilitate the birth of startups. The reason is that HSR condenses space distance and accelerates the speed of information sharing and face-to-face interactions across cities. One supportive evidence of the increased information sharing is that the entrepreneurship rate in communication-intensive industries experience a larger increase.====This paper offers three main contributions to the literature. First, we are among the first studies to link HSR construction in China to entrepreneurial activities, adding to an insufficiently explored area of research on the relationship between public infrastructure and entrepreneurship. The discussion about whether transportation investment and technology-oriented advancement would affect entrepreneurial choices and human capital helps us understand the economic stimulus effect of transportation infrastructure.

PNTR permanently set U.S. duties on Chinese imports at low Normal Trade Relations (NTR) levels and removed the uncertainty associated with annual renewals of China's NTR status. We find that the PNTR was significantly associated with the rising incidence of child labor in China. A one percentage point reduction in expected export tariffs raises the odds of child labor by a 1.2 percentage point. The effects are greater for girls, older children, rural children, and children with less-educated parents. The effect of trade liberalization on the incidence of child labor, however, tends to weaken in the long run, probably because trade liberalization can induce exporters to upgrade technology and thus have less demand for unskilled workers.","Child labor is a pervasive problem throughout the world, especially in developing countries.==== According to Maplecroft's 2014 Child Labor Index, China was classified as being at ¡°extreme risk¡± of using child labor.==== Approximately 16% of children aged between 7 and 18 are involved in child labor (====). Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated the issue of child labor in China, the largest developing country.====Trade liberalization has yielded prominent economic benefits to developing countries (====; ====), yet its effect on this pervasive child labor remains debated (====). On the one hand, trade liberalization may create employment opportunities for unskilled workers, which may affect child labor directly and indirectly. For example, trade liberalization may directly create employment opportunities for unskilled child labor (====). In addition, trade liberalization may create more external employment opportunities for less-educated parents and make their children more likely to work in agriculture for the household or work in their household business. On the other hand, trade liberalization could raise household income and decrease the incidence of child labor (====; ====). Thus, the relationship between trade liberalization and child labor is empirically inconclusive. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing new evidence from China.====Identifying the causal effect of trade on child labor is the core of related research. ====, ====, ==== and ====, among others, examine whether there is any link between trade and child labor using cross-country comparison where potential endogeneity of trade has posed challenges. For example, omitted labor standards are correlated with both trade flows and the likelihood of child labor (====; ====). ==== and ====.==== A number of studies have examined the causal effect of trade liberalization on child labor based on micro-level data. For example, ==== employ household-level data in Vietnam during its episode of rice market liberalization and find that the liberalization was associated with declines in child labor. ==== and ==== identify the child labor effect of trade through geographic and temporal variation in exposure to tariff reductions. The exogeneity of tariff reductions might be contaminated (====; ====), by, for example, lobbying practice.====This paper seeks to identify the causal effect of trade liberalization on the incidence of child labor with the application of a quasi-natural experiment arising from the change in U.S. trade policy upon China's accession to the WTO in 2001. Although China's exports to the U.S. had been subject to the relatively low normal trade relations (NTR) tariff rates reserved for WTO members since 1980, these low rates required annual renewals that were uncertain and politically contentious. Without renewal, U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods would have jumped to higher non-NTR tariff rates assigned to nonmarket economies, which were originally established under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Thus, the PNTR, which was passed by the U.S. Congress in October 2000 and became effective upon China's accession to the WTO, removed the uncertainty associated with these annual renewals and permanently set the U.S. duties on Chinese imports at NTR levels. The reduction in trade policy uncertainty is associated with increased entry into exporting (====; ====, ====). As the U.S. was China's largest trade partner in 2000, the changes in U.S. trade policy are expected to substantially influence the trade volume of China.==== ==== show that the PNTR is associated with statistically significant increases in the export value of China. Specifically, industries with higher NTR gaps, that is, the difference between the non-NTR and the NTR tariff rates, experience larger trade policy shocks. Moreover, regions with higher employment shares in industries with higher NTR gaps experience a larger boost in export value. Thus, we can identify the impact of trade liberalization on child labor using two sources of sample variation: the variation between regions with high and low NTR gaps and the variation before and after the PNTR. Specifically, we use a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy to identify the causal effect of trade liberalization on child labor. Our generalized DID identification strategy tests whether the difference in the incidence of child labor between regions with high NTR gaps and those with low NTR gaps is greater after the change in policy than the difference in the incidence of child labor between the two types of regions in the pre-PNTR era. This strategy allows for the control of time-invariant differences across regions (for example, unobserved regional institutions such as labor standards related to child labor). Furthermore, the NTR gaps used in our specification had been set long before China's accession to the WTO and are thus likely to be exogenous.====In this paper, we show that a one percentage point permanent decrease in tariff rates is associated with a 1.2 percentage point increase in the incidence of child labor, which implies that child labor meets the rising demand for unskilled workers created by trade liberalization. The effects are greater for girls, older children, rural children, and children with less-educated parents. Trade liberalization in China also creates more employment opportunities for less-educated mothers and makes their children more likely to take over their mothers' housework, which might crowd out children's time for study. Therefore, trade liberalization in China may have enlarged the education gaps between boys and girls, urban and rural children, and between children with more-educated parents and those with less-educated parents. The effect of trade liberalization on the incidence of child labor, however, tends to weaken in the long run, one reason being that trade liberalization has induced exporters to upgrade technology and thus decrease their demand for unskilled workers.====Unlike most studies which find dominating income effects (====; ====, ====; ==== finds that local expansions in less-skilled export-manufacturing industries raise the opportunity cost of schooling and thus school drop-out. ==== find that the expansion in processing export leads to a reduction in schooling of youths in rural China. Despite opposite signs, our estimates have similar magnitudes to some literature revealing negative child labor effects of trade liberalization. For example, ==== find that a percentage point decrease in labor-weighted tariff exposure leads to a 1.5 percentage point decrease in work incidence of children.====This paper is also related to the literature on the effects of trade liberalization on human capital investment. One strand of literature shows that trade liberalization can raise the skill premium (====) and hence encourage skill acquisition even in the context of developing countries (====; ====; ====). In contrast, another strand of literature documents that the effect of trade on human capital investment depends crucially on the skill intensity of exports.==== For example, employing cross-country panel data, ==== show that the expansion of skill-intensive sectors can boost workers' incentives to acquire more training and education, while expanded opportunities in less skill-intensive sectors may exacerbate school attrition and drop-out rates. ==== exploits the variation in regional exposures to high- and low-skill export demand shocks in China and finds that high-skill export shocks raise both high school and college enrollments, while low-skill export shocks depress both. In this paper, we find a negative effect of trade on human capital accumulation in the short term; nevertheless, the negative effect shrinks in the long run probably due to skill upgrading.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses the conceptual framework for our analysis. ==== describes the dataset used in the paper. ==== introduces the measure of China's trade liberalization. ==== presents our empirical specifications and main results. ==== provides explanations of the facts found in ====.

Along with rapid industrialization and urbanization in China, environmental issues emerged and attracted lots of attentions. The issues need to be taken seriously. Otherwise, it will inceasingly threat the sustainability of future economic and social development (====; ====; ====).====It is well-known that China has become the world's largest carbon emitter accounting for 28% of the global total carbon dioxide emissions in 2018. Growth rate of carbon emission increased 2.3% from 2017 to 2018 (====). China also reached per capita emissions in the same range as the European Union (EU) in recent years and grew up to a similar level of Japan in 2018 (====Furthermore, as China's economy has matured, its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has slowed down significantly, from 14.2% in 2007 to nearly 6¨C7% for recent years. China's economic growth has entered a new stage, ¡°new normal¡± which faces both internal and external constraints and challenges (====; ====). From an internal perspective, on the one hand, with diminishing marginal returns on productive factors and investment, China's economy urgently needs to shift from extensive to an intensive model that mainly relies on technological innovation and efficiency enhancement. Economic transformation plays an important role in effective emission reductions, and in developing patterns towards low-carbon transitions (====; ====According to the neoclasscal economic growth theory, the contribution of technical progress determines the pattern of economic development and affects the sustainable development of China's economy (====). Total factor productivity (TFP) growth as a measure of technical progress and technical efficientcy improvement has been traditionally used for investigation and evaluation on the sources of economic growth and quality-related issues of economy (====), while some studies have proposed that energy and environmental factors that are closely linked with sustainable development should also be taken into consideration (====; ====; ====). The reliability of traditional productivity measures should thus be recognized, a closely related concept of ¡°green TFP¡±, that takes environmental factors into account, should be employed. (====; ====; ====). Green TFP is regarded as a better indicator to reflect true economic growth (====; ====Although the traditional method of growth accounting using Solow residuals as the measure of TFP is still rather popular, there has been a growing trend whereby many researchers have been motivated to measure the green TFP with undesirable outputs using the non-parametric approach including DEA-based method (====; ====). Malmquist productivity index, characterized by ==== via Directional Distance Function (DDF) has been used to measure productivity growth and deal with environmental factors in productivity analysis (====). The majority of these studies on China, have been either conducted on specific industry or at the national level. ==== measured the growth rate of TFP in China's service industries from 1990 to 2010 and found that the inter-industry heterogeneity of TFP has decreased, the rate of TFP growth was about 4%. ==== used DEA method and analyzed the green TFP of China's mining and quarrying industry for the period of 1991 to 2014 with regard to technology, scale, and management, the green TFP of China's mining and quarrying industry increased by 71.7%. Even though some recent studies have applied the provincial panel data to account for the provincial green TFP based on DEA method, but not much have been done regarding further empirical analysis on the determinants of productivity growth, not to mention necessary tests of robustness and sensitivity analysis. For instance, in the latest research publications, ==== calculated the green TFP for data on 30 Chinese provinces from 1997 to 2010, and found that environmental growth convergence among regions has mainly relied on the structural effect. ==== estimated the Malmquist Luenberger (ML) productivity index with environmental variables for Chinese provinces from 1998 to 2015, they found that TFP and green TFP showed a general descending trend for most provinces. ==== also applied ML productivity to investigate China's green TFP and its components from 1999 to 2013, their results show that technological progress is the main driving force, and energy conservation and emission reduction are critical drivers of green TFP. As traditional Malmquist approach cannot solve the problem of infeasible solutions under the assumption of variable returns to scale (RTS) (====; ====), modified Malmquist method is necessary to improve the accuracy and robustness of accounting results of green TFP.====As for the choice of inputs and outputs in DEA analysis, it is not surprising that labor and physical capital are necessary inputs, GDP as the desirable output, CO==== as undesirable output (====; ====). In addition to different methodologies and data types, various methods and procedures of provincial capital stock may also lead to variations in reported results of TFP analysis (====). Provincial physical capital stocks as the important input indicator are usually re-constructed by individual researchers based on official statistics. Most studies have applied the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) to estimate capital stocks based on different base years and samples. This involves assumptions about how to estimate the rate of growth and the initial value of physical capital stock, constructing price deflators for different base years and setting depreciation rate of the physical capital stock. And among them, depreciation rate has the highest impact on final calculation results (====), and time heterogeneity of depreciation rate was rarely considered in previous studies. Therefore, in order to further comprehend issues involed in China's economic development, it is necessary to re-estimate the green TFP based on variables that are more accurately constructed. Especially, a better understanding can be expected regarding the issues and patterns in China's regional and provincial economic development.====Distinct from the previous studies, the main potential contributions of this paper are: Firstly, we estimate Chinese provincial physical capital stock and adopt weighted time-varying depreciation rate of physical capital. Secondly, the advanced DDF approach is applied in measuring the TFP and green TFP index of Chinese provinces from 2000 to 2017 based on different kind of RTS. Thirdly, we conduct a series of robustness tests and sensitivity analysis to support our results and empirically examine influencing variables of productivity index. This is of a great significance for the formulation of policies compatible with sustainable economic development.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: ==== introduces the accounting method of TFP, incorporating carbon dioxide emission as an undesirable output into the DDF framework; ==== describes the source and construction of data, introduces estimation methods on Chinese provincial carbon dioxide emissions and physical capital stock from 2000 to 2017, and conducts relevant sensitivity analysis; ==== analyzes the estimation results of Malmquist productivity index and its components from the regional perspective, carries out the empirical analysis on determinants of productivity, and checks robustness of our results; ==== concludes the study and provides policy recommendations.",Accounting and determinants analysis of China's provincial total factor productivity considering carbon emissions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X20301735,2-Dec-20,2020,Research Article,316

Baseline projections until 2040 are generated with the ==== Global Trade Model, a dynamic ====. With the modelled structural changes, the Chinese economy is projected to reorient its focus increasingly onto the domestic economy, raising the share of private household and government consumption in GDP, turning China's trade surplus into a trade deficit, reducing China's share in global exports, raising the share of services in both production and exports, shifting the destination markets of Chinese exports from developed to developing countries, and changing its pattern of comparative advantage away from sectors like light and heavy manufacturing to electronic and machinery equipment. The large bilateral trade surplus vis-a-vis the United States is projected to fall to almost zero.","Some of these features stand to change in the next twenty years. In particular, the following changes are expected to occur. First, the savings rate is foreseen to fall with the demographic changes towards an ageing society and reforms in the public sector towards a more broad-based provision of services in health care, education, pensions and social insurance. Second, the share of services in production is expected to rise as these become more expensive with development and preferences change. Third, a large increase in the number of skilled workers will take place as more people graduate (====). Fourth, the Chinese government has identified selected sectors whose development should be promoted, in particular high-end manufacturing sectors.====), differential productivity growth based on EUKLEMS and OECD-STAN data, and adjusting income elasticities of consumption. To model the falling savings rate and the rising share of skilled workers, we use projections until 2030 from the World Bank report on China (====). The additional productivity growth in the high-end manufacturing sectors is based on Made in China 2025, an industrial policy project of the Chinese State Council announced in 2015.====Other researchers have also examined the impact of structural change and rebalancing of the Chinese economy. Most relevant for our work are the studies on the effect of Chinese rebalancing on other countries. First, ==== have examined as well the impact of a rebalancing of the Chinese economy on the global economy with a CGE-model, concentrating on the impact on the United States. However, they have modelled different policy experiments besides the reduction in the savings rate, in particular a slowdown of economic growth, shifting preferences towards services, and an increase in labour productivity. In our work, the slowdown of economic growth is already part of the baseline scenario and the share of services in GDP is already rising in the baseline because of structural change. Instead, we focused on other trends such as productivity growth targeted to specific sectors aimed at Made in China 2025 and a rising share of skilled workers.====Second, ==== have studied the impact of a slowdown in economic growth in China on other Asian economies employing a dynamic CGE-model, finding that a reduction in economic growth of 1.6 percentage points in China would lead to a reduction in economic growth in developing Asia of 0.26 percentage points, with considerable variation across different regions. The growth reduction is modelled through a reduction in real investment growth by 3 percentage points. The model in ==== features endogenous adjustment in capital and labour utilitization. Their study is different from ours, since we mainly focus on rebalancing and not so much on a slowdown in economic growth.====Third, also using a dynamic CGE-model, ====Fourth, ====Fifth, ==== examine both the likelihood and the potential effects of so-called double rebalancing of the Chinese economy, a reduction of the domestic imbalance (high investment rate) and the external imbalance (even high savings rate implying a trade surplus). They argue that the rate of return on capital have fallen in the years 2010. Together with an increase in the cost of debt funding this can be expected to lead to a fall in investment. Furthermore, domestic rebalancing is expected to slow down the growth rate of the Chinese economy. Finally, they contend that the impact of domestic rebalancing on trading partners depends on the bilateral patterns of trade.

This study tries to investigate this baseline misallocation issue prior to the introduction of the new healthcare reforms in 2009. Building upon established framework, we developed an alternative measure for dispersion of factor price distortions. Using a large national microdata, the results obtained are consistent with previous studies in that for a less developed geographical market, often characterized by poorer factor mobility and weaker market competition, dispersion of the factor price distortions is high, reflecting high degree of misallocation. We also developed a decomposition of revenue dispersion to make inferences about the major channels through which the inverted pyramid arises. The analysis reveals the extent to which, the disproportionately large share of revenues generated by high-tier tertiary hospitals in China, can be attributed to their high productivity and the public trusts in them as providers of quality care.","Optimization of health care resources to get the most out of them is an imperative for countries with rapidly ageing populations (====; ====). This is particularly so for China, where existing healthcare resources are not only scarce but also unevenly distributed across its large geographical area (9.6 million km====), and where the government has set the goal of universal health coverage from prevention to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. To achieve this hugely ambitious goal will require a combination of increasing government spending on public health and deriving more value from these expenditures (====). Rigorous productivity studies, based specifically on rich micro-level data, that provide information on the baseline level of inefficiency are therefore indispensable in shaping the policy landscape in China (====). If indeed there is evidence of large amounts of inefficacies in the health care system, the goal of universal coverage could be met partially through improving efficiencies and therefore the fiscal impact might be less.====The purpose of the present study is to explore the level of resource misallocation in the health system prior to the 2009 healthcare reforms, using detailed information from a large collection of medical care providers in China. This study develops the toolbox that the government could use to track the productivity of the system over time as the reforms play-out.====While it is true that there exists an extensive body of empirical literature measuring the efficiency performance of healthcare delivery (====; ====), the majority of them focuses on a provider's ability to utilize the contemporary production technology (i.e. technical efficiency). Such analyses are popular benchmarking tools, because there is no need for price data, or to impose profit maximizing behavioral objective on public service providers. On the other hand, measuring a provider's ability to respond to prices in developing an optimal production plan (i.e. ====institutional allocative efficiency) are less studied.==== This is unsurprising because more often than not, policy making at the national level prioritizes the effective distribution of resources ==== different providers (i.e. ====), instead of promoting ====.====The literature uses two main approaches when it comes to the investigation of resource misallocation across providers: (1) one measures the variation in allocative efficiency or total factor productivity (====; ====; ====); and (2) another measures the variation in factor price (====, ====).====The challenge of the first approach is to control for quality. For example, efficiency from utilizing highly skilled physicians are likely to be different from low skilled physicians. Without being able to measure quality differences, one cannot tell the extent to which observed difference in efficiency can be attributed to the provider's ability in utilizing input of the same quality. In other words, it doesn't truly reflect the issue of resource misallocation.====The second approach assumes free flow of ==== within the economy; the prices that eventually prevail in the market are determined by the equalized marginal revenues across existing providers. Therefore, the observed differences in factor prices can reflect the degree to which these resources have been misallocated among providers. But differences in factor prices could also be partially attributed to the unobserved differences in qualities. As a result, measuring the variation in distortion, instead of measuring the variation in the level of factor prices, is better for quantifying the misallocation issue in health care where quality of inputs can vary widely.====There are four possible channels through which distortion of factor prices may arise in China: (1) the perverse payment system that distorts a physician's salary (====; ====; ====; ====; ====)====; (2) imperfect markets that hinder free flow of factor inputs; (3) some hospitals pay premiums to retain highly skilled physicians (====); and (4) hospitals may have varying degrees of monopolistic power that can influence the real price (====), such as the authority to promote physicians who are government employees in China.====The present study utilizes observed input cost share to construct a new measure for the variation in factor price distortions, it investigates the degree of misallocation across a large number of medical care providers observed in 2008. The analysis provides empirical evidence for the baseline misallocation experienced by China, prior to the introduction of the new healthcare reforms in 2009. The results obtained are consistent with previous studies in that for a less developed local economy, often characterized by poorer factor mobility and weaker market competition (====), dispersion of the factor price distortions is high, reflecting high degree of misallocation in that region. Additionally, we also construct a decomposition of revenue dispersion and find the degree to which the large income variation across different tiers of hospitals can be attributed to higher productivity and greater demand.====The rest of the paper proceeds according to the following: Section 2 presents our conceptual framework; Section 3 describes the data and analyzes the empirical results; Section 4 concludes and discusses the policy implications.====According to the Lerner equation,====where ==== denotes marginal cost of hospital ====.

Understanding why China's household savings rate is so high is important, as many believe that savings, via their effect on investment, have been the driving force behind China's economic growth. The connection is easy to make. In 2017, investment accounted for 44.41% of China's GDP, compared to a world average of 23% (====). Accordingly, China's high savings rate has been the subject of much recent research (====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====).====Given the concurrence in the timing of the implementation of the OCP and the increase in China's savings rate, it is tempting to assume a causal link. This link has been supported by a number of studies. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; and ==== all conclude that the OCP has been a substantially contributing factor to China's high savings rate. These studies make two crucial assumptions: (i) the observed decrease in the number of children post-OCP is due to the OCP (¡°the endowment effect¡±, and (ii) the relationship between children and saving is unaffected by the OCP (¡°the coefficient effect¡±). As we argue below, both assumptions are debatable at best.====Our study differs from these previous studies in two ways. For our counterfactual, we use saving behavior from other regions without the OCP. Further, we allow the impact of the OCP to affect both the number of children (the ¡°endowment effect¡±), and the relationship between number of children and savings (the ¡°coefficient effect¡±). To disentangle these effects, we employ the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (====; ====).====We are able to do this by merging data from the Gallup World Poll and the Global Findex database. This allows us to compare the saving behavior of people in China to the saving behavior of people in other Asian and developing regions without the OCP. Unlike most of the existing literature, we find little evidence to suggest that the OCP has had a major effect on savings in China.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: ==== discusses previous research and presents are counterfactual strategy. ==== discusses our data. ==== presents our methodology. ==== discusses our empirical results and ==== concludes.",Estimating the effect of the one-child policy on Chinese household savings - Evidence from an Oaxaca decomposition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X2030167X,12-Nov-20,2020,Research Article,319

The U-shaped curve between forest carbon sinks and economic development is the same as the ====. The impact of institutional freedom on forest carbon sinks under different economic development thresholds is analyzed. Institutional freedom harms forest carbon sinks when the country experiences lower economic growth. Further analysis shows that when economic development is high, there are positive effects, and the beneficial effects of institutional freedom on the forest carbon sink gradually enhance as the threshold value increases. The article clarifies the relationship between institutional freedom and forest carbon sinks and also provides implications for making forest management strategies and climate mitigation policies.","The Climate warming problem is the responsibility of every country. Therefore, all the countries must tackle it together. One of the most proposed climate change mitigation strategies is carbon sequestration by vegetation. To meet the Paris climate agreement, forest carbon offsetting strategies had been developed. The forest as a natural carbon sink can be considered as the benefit of sequestrating carbon from the atmosphere.

Recently, some studies have examined certain managerial characteristics' impacts on corporate innovation, including managerial overconfidence (====; ====), managerial social capital (====), CEOs' sensation-seeking behaviors (====), general managerial skills (====), and prior managerial experiences (====; ====).====With increasing market competition and protections of intellectual property, Chinese governments and firms are focusing more on innovation activities (====). Firm management teams' quality has become increasingly important to technological innovation. ==== have discovered that the pay gap between executives and employees significantly increases corporate innovation, supporting the tournament theory and indicating that corporate management's human capital or quality is critical for innovation. A top management team's effective investing and managing of innovative projects may determine the firm's long-term success. However, few studies have systematically examined whether top management quality can promote corporate innovation. This study fills this gap in literature by examining top management quality's impact on corporate innovation in China as an emerging market. Top managers draw on skills gained throughout a career in corporate decision-making. Starting with ====, researchers have explored two types of managerial human capital: general and firm-specific. Although China has experienced rapid economic growth since its 1978 reform and opening-up, it is still lagging when it comes to innovation (====). In China, top management teams face poorer intellectual property protections and weaker legal institutions; consequently, top management teams are more important in decision-making and management activities than their western counterparts. Hence, this study aims to investigate top management quality's effects on corporate innovation.====). At the firm level, this trend may affect firms' top management quality and performance.====Firms with higher-quality top management teams may have more interest in investing in long-term value-creation projects (====), including innovative projects (====). We predict that higher-quality top management teams will invest more in innovative projects, and thus, will gain more extensive innovative output. Such firms can accomplish this by not only having better foresight into innovative investment opportunities' potential value but also in more effectively managing innovative resources. They may provide an environment that fosters a greater tolerance for failure (====). Given this, firms with higher-quality top management teams may attract inventors with greater skills as employees.====This study constructs a comprehensive top management quality indicator based on nine individual proxies using a ====We apply a firm fixed-effects model, ==== approach, and propensity score-matching (PSM) procedure. Our empirical results indicate a robust, positive association. Additionally, this study tests three main influential mechanisms that explain how the top management team's quality spurs and shapes corporate innovation activities, which entail higher tolerance for failure, easing of financial constraints, and hiring more high-quality inventors. Further analyses indicate that the top management quality's positive effects on corporate innovation are more pronounced for high-tech firms, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and growing firms.====This study contributes to existing literature in two ways. First, this study uses a principal component analysis to construct a novel indicator that reflects top management teams' levels of human capital. Whereas existing studies primarily explore managerial characteristics' effects by considering only one dimension. Second, this study enriches the small but growing body of literature on the effects of management teams' human capital. Although management quality is important for corporate management and strategy, little empirical evidence exists regarding the relationship between management quality and corporate policies including innovation.

Essentially, the government uses tax incentives or subsidies to attract firms to gather in a special space. As a result, external economics emerges, and the government can provide more and more employment opportunities and economic output. However, the effectiveness of the SEZ program, which some scholars are skeptical of, is inconsistently established. These scholars argue that some firms and labors locate in the SEZs only because of the benefits of preferential policies; furthermore, these firms and labor do not substantially benefit the development of local areas and even generate crowding-out effects on the productivity and survival time of surrounding firms (====; ====; ====). However, most studies have confirmed the positive effect of SEZs on economic development (====). According to the ¡°==== (2006)¡±, 1568 national-level and province-level SEZs are located in more than 270 cities at prefecture level or above in China; these SEZs contributed approximately 10% of the country's GDP and 1/3 of FDI with only 0.1% of the total land area in 2006 (====). The land-use efficiency of SEZs is much higher than that of Non Special Economic Zones (NSEZs); some empirical studies have shown that the SEZ program promote the improvement of the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms (====; ====; ====); moreover, the productivity advantages of SEZs are caused by agglomeration and selection effects (====¡± and the ¡°==== According to the ¡°==== the number of producer service firms in the SEZs accounts for 66.2% of the total producer service firms in China; the proportion of the revenue and the employees are 67.6% and 22.4%, respectively. Thus, the SEZs are the cluster areas of producer service industries in China. The study on the productivity of producer service industries in SEZs can provide a decision-making reference for promoting the rapid development of China's producer service industries.====). These two types of agglomeration economies generally improve the firm's productivity; thus, the distribution curve of the firm productivity in cluster areas shifts to the right altogether. In empirical research, ====, ====, ====, and others have pointed out that agglomeration economies can generally improve the firm productivity due to Marshall and Jacobs externalities. Different from the productivity advantages brought by firm agglomeration in large market areas, the SEZs are government-formed cluster areas where a series of preferential policies and other policy rents are provided (====). SEZs are not the result of the spontaneous effect of market forces (access to the market or suppliers).====The other mechanism is based on the selection effect of NNEG. By introducing micro-individual heterogeneity into NEG theory, NNEG theory suggests that productivity differences among regions are also due to the spatial location choice of heterogeneous firms. The forms of action vary among different models. ==== proposed that the firms in cluster areas are competitive. Moreover, the market mechanism of survival of the fittest causes inefficient firms to withdraw from the market; only the efficient ones can survive in large market areas (====; ==== argued that the model of ==== proposed the adverse spatial selection effect, and then argued that the agglomeration of efficient firms would lead to serious competition and tend to decentralize, whereas inefficient firms are flexible in location choices. For producer service industries in the SEZs, this study argues that the mechanism of selection effect includes the market competitive effect (withdrawal of inefficient firms under the effect of survival of the fittest) and the location effect of heterogeneous firms (influence of entry threshold on the entry ration of the inefficient firms). On the one hand, the market of producer services expands due to the agglomeration of manufacturing industries in the SEZs. This expansion then aggravates the market competition and causes difficulties for inefficient firms to obtain profits. Thus, the inefficient firms withdraw from the SEZs and promote the overall productivity of producer service industries in the SEZs. On the other hand, the existence of policy rent in the SEZs reduces the entry threshold of producer service industry firms. It increases the entry probability of inefficient firms and inhibits the productivity improvement among producer service industries in the SEZs. Both mechanisms determine the impact of selection effect on the productivity of producer service industries in the SEZs.====In empirical research, ==== first used the method of unconditional distribution characteristic-parameter correspondence to identify the agglomeration and selection effects by measuring the right shift and left tail of the distribution of firm productivity in different regions. Since then, a large number of scholars have examined the existence of various industries in different regions on the basis of this method; however, their conclusions are different (====; ====; ====). Many studies have also discussed the issue on the basis of the data of Chinese firms. From the perspective of research object, most scholars have confirmed the selection effect mechanism of the sources of productivity advantages in big cities (====), cluster counties or cities (====), and large market areas (====). Only ==== discussed the source of the productivity of SEZs; they found that the agglomeration and selection effects can considerably improve the productivity in the SEZs; in their study, the agglomeration effect plays a leading role. From the perspective of research scale, most documents can only reflect the source of productivity advantages of manufacturing firms in cluster areas in China. Furthermore, empirical research on service industries has not been performed. Besides, only a few studies have supported the mechanism of selection effect; some empirical studies have shown that the selection effect does not exist or has a weak effect (====; ====). After considering the policy rent mechanism, ====The present study aims to identify the productivity advantages of producer services in the SEZs. If an advantage exists, then this study will identify whether it derived from the agglomeration effect or the selection effect. This study also further explores the mechanism of agglomeration and selection effects. Compared with the existing literature, this article has a threefold contribution.====Most importantly, this study is the first to explore how agglomeration and selection effects influence the productivity of producer service industries in the SEZs completely. The analysis for identifying agglomeration and selection effects of the current studies are based on the unconditional distribution characteristic-parameter correspondence method. However, this estimation method cannot identify whether the productivity advantages of the producer service industries in the SEZs is brought by the establishment of SEZs or already present prior to their establishment. Therefore, we test the impact of the establishment of SEZs on the productivity of the producer service industry before using this estimation method to identify the productivity advantages and sources of the producer service industry in the SEZs. The endogeneity of location choice of SEZs is overcome well, possibly promoting the accuracy of the estimates.====Furthermore, this study presents an empirical method to identify the agglomeration and selection effects and their mechanisms in SEZs from the perspective of manufacturing industry linkage and location choice of heterogeneous firms. On the one hand, on the basis of the industrial linkage between producer service industries and manufacturing industries, this study identifies the positive correlation between the agglomeration effect of producer service industries and the scale of local manufacturing industries. The agglomeration effect is strong when the producer service industries and the planned leading manufacturing industries in the SEZs have a high correlation. This study also verify the diversified development modes of various producer service industries in the SEZs have a strong agglomeration effect through Jacobs' externalities. On the other hand, from the perspective of the impact of policy rent on the entry ratio of inefficient firms in the SEZs, the mechanism of the selection effect is that preferential policies in the SEZs reduce the entry threshold of firms. Thus, a larger number of inefficient firms locate in the SEZs, thereby inhibiting the productivity improvement of producer service industries.====Finally, this study estimates the productivity advantages of the producer service industries in the SEZs on the basis of the firm data of the producer service industries. This study supplements the research on the producer service industries. At present, most of the discussions on the producer service industries in China have concentrated at the industry level, and discussion at the firm level is lacking. From the spatial perspective, studies at the level of province, metropolis (====), city (====), or district inside a city (====) have not discussed the micro-unit from the firm level. Additionally, unlike manufacturing firms, which often need a large area of land and incur high sunk costs of relocation, producer service firms mostly occupy a small area. Furthermore, for producer service firms, locations are flexible and the pursuit of preferential policies is obvious. Therefore, even if the current study on the agglomeration effect of the manufacturing industries is substantial, the existing conclusions are not necessarily suitable for the producer service industry. Policy misleading occur if industrial heterogeneity is ignored. This paper can provide micro-level evidence for policy making in the producer service industries of SEZs.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the institutional background and develops a theoretical framework. Data, variables and empirical strategy and results are reported in ====. ==== empirically examines the existence and source of the advantages of producer service industries in the SEZs. ==== further identifies the mechanism of agglomeration effect and selection effect on the productivity advantages of producer service firms in the SEZs. ==== concludes.",The impact of special economic zones on producer services productivity: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X20301553,6-Oct-20,2020,Research Article,322

The efficiency principle emphasizes the achievement of emissions reduction targets at the minimum cost (====) and is usually expressed as maximizing economic benefits on the premise of setting emissions reduction targets (====). The equity principle is related to the general concept of distributive justice (====), which includes a variety of criteria such as the sovereignty or grandfather criterion (====; ====), the average criterion based on population distribution (====; ====.====Many studies have examined carbon allocations in China based on efficiency and equity principles, and most of them have employed the indicator method and data envelopment analysis (DEA) technology (====; ====; ====). For example, ==== constructed a carbon emissions abatement capacity index by using per capita carbon emission and per capita GDP to represent the equity principle, and taking carbon intensity and carbon shadow price to represent the efficiency principle. ==== divided China's inland areas into six regions and used DEA technology to estimate the emission reduction costs of 63 carbon allowance allocation scenarios based on regional cooperation. ==== applied a DEA method to construct a carbon performance index representing the efficiency principle, and calculated an integrated indicator combining equity and efficiency principles based on the entropy method.==== pointed out that approximately one-third of the carbon reduction commitments in the United States could be achieved through forest carbon sequestration. ==== conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the variation of soil carbon storage in response to synthetic fertilizer addition. ==== concluded that forest carbon sequestration in Hunan Province, China, increased from 820.2 Tg in 1996 to 1277.8 Tg in 2015. In theory, if a region's carbon emissions can be absorbed by natural ecosystems then they are considered to be within the carrying capacity of carbon sequestration in the region. For example, ==== took the carrying capacity of carbon sequestration as one of multi-criterial indicators for the allocation of carbon emission abatement. Moreover, the development of carbon sequestration capacity is the foundation of developing a carbon sink economy. The eight CET pilot regions in China have established offset mechanisms for no more than 5¨C10% carbon emissions, which encourages other (non-pilot) areas to promote the development of a carbon sink economy based on their own resource endowments. In future studies, it would be beneficial to consider the regional carbon sequestration capacity and the potential income of a carbon sink.====In this study, we estimated regional carbon sequestration capacities and demonstrated regional conditions of carbon overdraft in China during 2005¨C2015 based on regional net primary productivity (NPP) calculated by an improved Carnegie¨CAmes¨CStanford Approach model (====). Moreover, by employing DEA technology, we allocated regional carbon allowances by considering the existing conditions of a regional carbon overdraft and emission reduction goals during the 13th Five-year plan, and analyzed the potential carbon trading under a national CET market and the development of a carbon sink economy provoked by an emission offset mechanism.====Compared with existing literature, the major contributions of this study can be summarized as follows. First, it comprehensively presents regional NPP and carbon overdraft conditions in China during 2005¨C2015, which provides a valuable reference for future research on China's regional carrying capacities of carbon sequestration. Second, regional carbon allowances have been allocated by taking the regional carbon balance into account, while the existing research focuses more on efficiency and equity principles. Moreover, in this study we analyzed the potential carbon sink economy based on regional NPP, which has rarely been seen in other research.====The structure of the remainder of this study is as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this study, Section 3 gives details of the data and empirical research results, and Section 4 presents our conclusions and policy recommendations.",Analysis of regional carbon allocation and carbon trading based on net primary productivity in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301622,26-Dec-19,2019,Research Article,330

We find negative effects of both province-level income inequality and between-group income inequality on SWB, measured by life satisfaction. Our results also show that the effects of income inequality on SWB is stronger for rural ==== residents compared to urban ==== residents. These findings are robust to alternative ways of measuring SWB and income inequality. In addition, we find evidence suggesting that neighbourhood trust is an important channel through which income inequality operates to reduce SWB. We suggest policies that promote trust in communities with high inequality with a view of addressing the negative effects of inequality on SWB.","A widening of the income gap reported across the globe (see, e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====), the consequence of income inequality on subjective welfare or wellbeing has become of general concern and importance (====). However, findings on the relationship between income inequality and wellbeing remain mixed. Some studies suggest a negative association (see, e.g., ====; ====; ====), while others find a positive association (see, e.g., ====; ====) or even ambiguous patterns between inequality and wellbeing (see, e.g., ====; ====).====A recent systematic review on the inequality-wellbeing relationship (====) argues that the inconsistent or inconclusive findings in the literature can be explained by the fact that the strength and direction of the inequality-wellbeing relationship is mediated by several other factors. Thus, ==== emphasise the importance of examining the factors through which inequality influences wellbeing. For instance, social capital and trust is a channel of influence that has received much attention in the literature. Here, it is argued that income inequality works through social dimensions where it is likely to erode social capital (====; ====), which is important for promoting wellbeing (====). Specifically, if individuals perceive inequality as unfair, it is likely to erode trust, reduce generosity and reciprocity, thus undermining SWB (====; ====; ====). Further, the dislike for inequality which erodes trust tends to engender conflicts, high level of violence and crime, which in turn negatively influence wellbeing (====; ====).====Larger income inequalities have therefore been assumed to engender steeper social disparities. However, as noted by ====, existing research has remained speculative on the validity of this assumption, rarely testing the proposed mechanisms with empirical data. To our knowledge, only two studies (====; ====) attempt to examine the validity of this assumption. ==== examine how trust and the perceptions of fairness mediate the relationship between income inequality and SWB in the United States, while ==== examine whether social conflict, anxiety and social trust function as mediators in the inequality-wellbeing relationship in Europe.====We build on the existing literature by focusing on China. A growing body of literature presents empirical evidence on the effects of income inequality on wellbeing in China (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Among other things, these studies are distinguished by the data used with the majority using either cross-section data from a single year (see, e.g., ====; ====; ====) or repeated cross-section data from multiple years (see, e.g., ====).====On the use of cross-section data, ==== use data from the Chinese Household Income Project 2002 (CHIP 2002) to examine differences in SWB between rural and urban households in China. Their results show higher average wellbeing for rural households compared to urban households. The authors argue that wellbeing is sensitive to respondent's perception of their household position in the neighbourhood income distribution, and that for most people in rural areas, their relative position is confined to a narrow reference group of others in the same village. Similarly, ====) and urban residents. Their results show that higher levels of between-group inequality is associated with lower levels of SWB, however, the opposite is observed for the effects of city-level inequality.====Diverging slightly in terms of the choice of survey, ==== use cross-sectional data from the 2006 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to examine the relationship between income inequality and SWB. They find evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between income inequality and SWB such that an increase in income inequality is associated with lower levels of SWB until a threshold beyond which further increases in inequality is associated with an increase in SWB levels. More recently, ==== examine the role of corruption in the inequality-wellbeing relationship, and conclude that corruption is an important channel through which income inequality influences wellbeing. Other studies that have used the CGSS to examine the inequality-wellbeing relationship include ==== and ====, although ==== add on to the literature by providing a perspective that draws on repeated cross-sections from the 2003 to 2010 surveys, rather than inferences from a single year.====Other data sources that have featured in the literature that examines the relationship between income inequality and SWB in China include the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) (====), single wave from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) (====), and other surveys (====). ==== examines the role of distributive justice beliefs in shaping the inequality-wellbeing relationship. Using multi-level modelling, they find that lower inequality is associated with higher SWB. ==== use the 2012 wave of the CFPS but focus on the role of expenditure inequality on SWB. ==== use cross-section data from 31 cities across China. Their study emphasises on the relationship between inequality and SWB in urban China. They report heterogeneous effects of inequality across high and low income individuals.====Our study contributes to this growing but inconclusive literature on the relationship between inequality and wellbeing in China. We use four waves of data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey to examine the relationship between income inequality and SWB, and examine trust and social network as important channels through which income inequality influences wellbeing. Following ====, we take a dual approach to measure income inequality. We use a general measure of income inequality measured by province-level Gini coefficient as well as a between-group measure of income inequality or identity-related inequality defined as the income gap between migrants without urban household registration identity (====) and urban residents. Findings from ====, which suggest that the effects of inequality on wellbeing are influenced by respondent's reference group or perception of their household position in their neighbourhood, lends support to the importance of understanding the role of between-group inequality in promoting or hindering SWB. Thus, similar to ==== we distinguish between general inequality and between-group inequality, and examine the effects of these distinct types of inequalities on SWB. We also examine the role of social network and trust as potential channels through which income inequality influences wellbeing.====Our study differs from the above studies that have focussed on China in several ways. First, unlike these studies, we use panel data which allows us to control for unobservable factors. Unless one includes time-invariant personality traits as regressors, it is difficult to control for unobservable factors using cross-sectional data. Controlling for unobserved factors requires the use of panel data, and this makes it possible to eliminate the influence of unobserved time-invariant individual fixed effects. Further, the tunnel effect hypothesis lends support to the importance of using panel data to examine the effects of income inequality on wellbeing. Using panel data makes it possible to account for the effects of inequality across different time periods and thus more likely to capture the potential positive effects associated with the tunnel effect as well as the potential negative effects which emerge over time after the tunnel effect dies out. Further, the effects of inequality on SWB is determined by two competing effects. When the tunnel effect is stronger, positive effects are observed. However, when inequality persists overtime and the relative deprivation effect becomes stronger, negative effects are observed. This time-varying relationship can only be appropriately studied using panel data.====Second, our study refines earlier work on China by testing if social capital, particularly trust and social networks, are channels through which income inequality influence SWB. As noted earlier, existing research has remained speculative on the validity of the assumption that income inequality tends to engender lower social capital, rarely testing the proposed mechanisms with empirical data (====). We build on the existing literature by examining the validity of this assumption using longitudinal data from China.==== two-stage least square (2SLS) approach, which has been effectively used to address endogeneity in the absence of external instruments (see, e.g., ====; ====).====The remainder of the study is structured as follows.

In a similar study, however, ==== find inelastic effects of income and price on residential electricity demand for Sichuan province based on data over 2007¨C2009. Rather, they show that the control variables such as dwelling size and the holding of home appliances are more important factors. Based on survey data from France, ==== explore the effects of both macro and micro factors on household energy-saving behaviour. Their results indicate that energy price, household income, education level, age of the household head and dwelling energy performance are the five main determinants. ==== study energy demand and basic needs of a sample of households in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. They find that electricity consumption does not respond to income changes until after a certain income threshold for basic needs. Using microdata from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), ==== estimate a complete system of energy demand for urban China with both own-price and cross-price elasticities among different energy types characterized.====In additional to the generic modelling variables as above, another strand of the literature explicitly involves home appliance ownership, its determinants, and its impact on residential energy consumption. In an intriguing paper, ==== find that the ownership of electrical appliances in China does not only depend on the average per capita income but also the shape of the income distribution. Their result indicates that provinces with the same average per capita income but a lower share of poor households (with an annual income per capita below RMB 3000) tend to have a significantly higher rate of appliances ownership. However, due to the lack of microdata in their study, they estimate a reduced-form threshold regression model based on provincial level data from China. Concerning residential electricity demand, ==== analyse the contribution of appliance stocks and their use patterns in the UK. Using survey data from Statistical Norway, ==== develop a conditional demand model (CDM) to estimate the relationship between the total annual electricity consumption and the ownership of different home appliances for a sample of households, including certain control variables. In a recent paper, ==== construct income inequality statistics and examine their effects on household appliance ownership in China. Their result indicates that income inequality has negative influences on the holding of all home appliance types except televisions.====In this paper, we follow the second strand of research to study household appliances ownership and its impact on residential energy consumption. In particular, we develop a stochastic income threshold model on the ownership of household appliances and use the model to analyse the microdata from the annual Chinese Urban Household Surveys (CUHS). To our knowledge, this is the first study of the kind on income threshold for appliance holdings using microdata.====Our contribution is twofold. First, we attempt to extend the ==== study with a fixed income threshold and based on province-level data by accommodating heterogeneous income threshold using disaggregating household data. Our model predicts considerably more appliances in the low to middle income range, which is more consistent with the observed data. The results imply that ignoring the heterogeneity in the income threshold may lead to underestimated appliance holdings for the poor and near-poor households. Next, we contribute to improving the use of repeated cross-sectional data for energy demand in China by creating pseudo-panel data, with cohorts of households as the entities, as pioneered by ====. As discussed by ==== and ====, the constructed panel data may have advantages over simple cross-sectional data as they allow dynamic adjustment modelling, among other things. Also, the constructed panel data may outperform real panel data that usually suffer from sample attrition problems, and allow us to do more detailed analyses.====By applying our stochastic income threshold model to the constructed panel data, we compute the income threshold for the ownership of the different appliances such as air conditioners, personal computers, and refrigerators, and predict the expected number the appliances per household. For air conditioners, for example, we find that the average per capita income threshold for 2002 is about 2896 RMB (in 2000 constant price), and for refrigerators, the corresponding number is about 1804 RMB. At the subgroup levels, we find that a typical household with a higher education (above ====) and living in a southern province, for example, has an average per capita income threshold value of about 1846 RMB for the ownership of air conditioners; This number is somewhat three times lower than the corresponding threshold of 5855 RMB for a household without a higher education and living in a northern province. In addition to the income threshold analysis, we also use the pseudo-panel data to analyse the electricity demand conditional on the appliance stocks and for various household types (cf. ====; ====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops the stochastic income threshold model for appliance ownership and explores the implications of the threshold variations. Section 3 describes the survey data, explains the procedure for our pseudo-panel data creation, and specifies the ==== equations.

The results show that training benefits medical institution performance in some indicators, such as total visits, outpatient visits, non-medical-insurance, and local competitiveness. These effects, however, vary across different types of medical institutions. Grassroot medical institutions in the county area that serve as a health gatekeeper (known as primary health care institution, PHCIs) gain most in hospital visits after training. In addition, training results in a 16.5% increase in the average performance wage for county-PHCIs, and a 52.8% increase in the employees¡¯ performance wage for higher-level general hospitals in cities.

Hence, the accumulation of human capital is an essential topic to study in economic development since it could have impacts on gross production in both direct and indirect ways. Direct effects occur when the accumulation of human capital results in an augmented effect in production function if the production function is non-decreasing with respect to its factors. On the other hand, the accumulation of human capital could indirectly affect the production function as it requires various investments such as education and training, which consume the products including equipment and materials and contribute to stronger economic consequences. Additionally, as noted by ====, ¡°technical change in general can be ascribed to experience¡±, and because ¡°[l]earning is the product of experience¡± (====, pp.155), thus technical progress, in fact, can also be attributed to the accumulation of knowledge, which is another indirect impact of the mass of human capital on the economy.====By decomposing human capital into education and health (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====). However, most of previous discussions focused on schooling and health. The debates of training, another approach in investing human capital through education channel, is insufficient, especially on-the-job training at the firm level (====). ==== have pointed out, for life-cycle capital investment, more than half of the investment occurs in the post-school period, which refers to the training at work. This insight highlights the importance of training when studying human capital investment.====This paper examines the return to training on medical institutions performance. While previous literature mostly focused on the influence of training on workers¡¯ wage or productivity by using firm data (====; ====; (====); ====; ====), this paper aims to evaluate the economic return of training on medical institutions quantitatively.====Since 2015, China has initiated a ¡°Supply Side Reform¡± in order to meet the ¡°Changes of Demand¡±, aiming to restructure the production of the supply side, thus better matching with people¡¯s need. Concurrent with the ¡°Healthy China 2030¡± strategy, the ¡°Supply Side Reform¡± in the health sector is of great importance to Chinese society. In China¡¯s health care provision system, the most debated medical institutions are tertiary hospitals and primary health care institutions (PHCIs). According to ==== 2016, the total number of PHCIs and tertiary hospitals were 926,518 and 2,232, respectively, which means PHCIs and tertiary hospitals represented 94.22% and 0.23% of total medical institutions in 2016, correspondingly. However, when we look at the number of hospital visits, we find that PHCIs visits accounted for 55.05% of total hospital visits, i.e. 4.4 billion hospital visits, and visits to tertiary hospitals reached 20.52% of total hospital visits. Two thousand two hundred thirty-two tertiary hospitals have undertaken more than 20% of medical services, which reveals the necessity of building up the referral system where PHCIs could have played a pivotal role.

Therefore, potential implications from studying training effect on the health care sector would benefit not only health care itself but also social welfare as a whole.

Upward mobility can affect the demand for children in two opposite directions: upward mobility means more resources to spend on childbearing and increases the demand for children; it also lowers the need to rely on children for old-age support and this leads to lower demand for children. In this paper, we use the difference between the subject's self-evaluations of the future and current ",") and economic growth (====).====Thus, understanding fertility decisions has received extensive attention in the literature. Previous studies mainly investigate the effects of socioeconomic characteristics or public policies on fertility decisions such as maternal leave policy (====) and cash transfer programs (====). In this study, we propose a new factor in fertility decisions: upward mobility. Fertility decisions have a substantial implication on ones' time and expenditure allocation over an extended period of time, and intuitively would be constrained by life-cycle budget constraints. Upward mobility implies the changes in the expected future resources and thus may have an important effect on fertility decisions.====The mechanisms of how upward mobility affecting fertility decisions could be demonstrated from two aspects of fertility motives. On the one hand, children have the role of durable consumption goods (====). Upward mobility implies a higher expected resource level and thus would lead to an increase in the demand for children. On the other hand, children often serve as a ¡°safety net¡± in parents' old age, as children have the responsibility to support their parents (====). This convention effectively gives children the role of ¡°investment assets¡± and spending on children would be considered as savings for the future. Upward mobility would thus lower the importance of children as an investment and reduce the demand for children. The combined two motivations for childbearing imply that the effect of upward mobility on fertility decisions remains ambiguous and is thus an empirical question.====This paper attempts to examine how upward mobility affects the demand for children in the context of China. China's demography has been evolving markedly over the last decades, and possibly more radically than any other country in the world. Total fertility shrank sharply from 6.1 in the mid-1960s to just above 1.6 in 2012. To date, the cohort aged 65 and above represents nearly 10% of the total population in China and its share is projected to increase to 18.2% by 2030 (UNDP ====, ====). The rapid changes have caused deep concerns about China's labour force and population aging (====). China is thus a prominent case for studying the underlying mechanisms of ==== motivations for childbearing that would have profound implications for China's population policy. Moreover, the evidence for the investment motivation in childbearing is concentrated in China (====), and thus the interaction between two motives behind the demand for children is potentially stronger and more interesting to study.====In this paper, we use data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) to explore how upward mobility affects the demand for children. We adopt the concept of the Prospect of Upward Mobility (POUM) as the measure of upward mobility. The concept of the POUM is proposed by ==== in a study of the redistribution preference. Following ====).====We use fertility desire instead of the actual number of children to measure the demand for children. One reason is that fertility desire could be closer to the complete fertility for younger cohorts. More importantly, the presence of China's family planning policy may distort the actual number of children away from optimal fertility decisions. Fertility desire questions assume no family planning constraint and could be closer to the optimal numbers of children. We find that upward mobility does encourage the demand for children: POUM has produced significant and positive effects on the number of desired children in all the model specifications with different covariates. This is consistent with a dominating positive income effect of upward mobility on the fertility, in contrast with a common concern that China might have entered the phase where higher income leads to lower fertility in trade for the higher quality of children. Specifically, the impact of upward mobility on fertility desire is concentrated among the groups with higher household income level or urban residence, suggesting that those from more advantaged social-economic backgrounds are more elastic in response to changes in future social status.====Our results have important policy implications for China's demographic policy, as the government is stepping up measures to boost fertility given the high pressure on shrinking labour and social security. Specifically, policies promoting upward mobility through lowering income inequality, promoting better and fairer primary education, improving public services through reducing the private cost of education and childcare, and improving social security and public support for old-age, can be effective in boosting fertility.====This study contributes to the literature at least in three ways. Firstly, we provide some of the first evidence on the relationship between upward mobility and fertility. Given that fertility decisions have substantial implications for the longer-term time and income allocation and possible return in the future, it is important to understand the interaction between upward mobility and childbearing decisions. Our research fills in this knowledge gap and sheds light on the importance of considering life-cycle constraints in analyzing fertility behavior.====Second, our paper has enriched the literature of the POUM, which focuses more on its effect on redistribution preference (====; ====). We have shown that the POUM also affects another important life decision: the fertility decision. This finding extends the application of POUM as a measure for expectations about the future.====The third contribution is that this paper provides evidence on the presence and trade-off between consumption (altruism) motive of childbearing and investment motive behind the demand for children in the context of an emerging economy and an aging society. The patterns for childbearing behaviors have long been a puzzle; even now, China is still suffering from a skewed sex ratio at birth (====; ====The paper is organized as follows.

Specifically, renaming an institution from a ==== to a ==== and incorporating the name of a large regional area lead to a significant improvement in the admission scores; in contrast, choosing a more ¡°fashionable¡± name and eliminating references to historical industrial affiliations have no significant effect, and may even have a negative impact.","Since the middle 1980s, there have been several waves of name changes in Chinese universities. According to research done by ====, in the 16?years between 1999 and 2015, 607 universities changed their names, with some changing names several times, a number which is unique in the history of global education. Traditionally, a name sends an important signal regarding product quality and reputation (====; ====) and information transmission is one of the crucial functions embedded in the name of a university (====). University names incorporate their history, level of social recognition, reputation, characteristics, philosophy, and also provide an important indication regarding the quality of the schools curriculum and operations. When potential students lack detailed knowledge of the university, the name can perform a certain signalling function, and a good memorable name may attract more talented students (====). As competition among Chinese universities intensifies, changing names could be seen as one way to try to gain a competitive advantage.====The influence of the signalling effect brought about by a name change will be reflected in the impact it has on admission scores. However, the effectiveness of the name change is uncertain. While it can indicate an expansion of infrastructure and an upgrade in teaching and academic quality (====; ====), which is beneficial for attracting students with high marks, the existing name usually reflects the history, social influence, and brand value of the university. Therefore, a name change may negate these latter inherent benefits, possibly resulting in an overall decline in scores. Thus, what is the ultimate effect of a name change and will it attract students with higher scores?====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), but other empirical evidence shows no significant impact on firm value (====; ====). In addition, the effect of a personal name change has also been empirically tested (====; ====; ====; ====).====However, the literature related to name change among universities has primarily focused on the motivation of a name change (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Some researchers claim that a name change should have an influence on admission scores (====), however, due to the lack of available data, empirical research based on big data sets to test the effects of such a change is limited.====The wave of name changes in China, which started in the middle 1980s, provides an opportunity to observe and study a quasi-natural experiment. The gradual disclosure of enrollment information has made valuable admission score panel data available for analysis. This research utilizes data for 522 Chinese universities from 2005 to 2015, and within the scope of our knowledge, this is the first study based on a large data sample to examine the impact of a university name change on student enrollment.====After controlling for several kinds of fixed effects, admissions quotas, admissions policies, and the quality of research associated with the university, it is found that: (1) In general, a name change has no significant effect on the admission scores. (2) After subdividing the name change method into four specific categories, it was found that changing ==== to ==== and incorporating the name of a large regional area lead to a significant improvement in the student admission scores, but choosing a more fashionable name and eliminating references to historical industrial affiliations have no significant effect, and may even have a negative impact.

While it is largely unclear the extent to which expropriation can be viewed as an event exogenous to individual and household choices, we deal with the potential selection bias of being expropriated by using the methodology proposed by Oster (2019). Gaining an urban hukou is found to improve the labour market outcomes of expropriated household heads and spouses relative to comparable rural stayers and rural-urban migrants. In particular, hukou-changers gain better access to permanent jobs in the public sector through formal search channels. We also find that expropriated parents invest substantially more in children's human capital as compared to rural parents, suggesting that leveling the hukou status among children can contribute to reducing intergenerational ====.","Although economic reforms post-1978 have enabled rural people throughout China to become more mobile and seek fortune in urban centres, their registration as rural hukou holders has de facto not changed (====). There is considerable evidence on the discrimination imposed by the hukou system on rural-urban migrants and their families (====). Yet, micro-economic evidence on the impact of a change in hukou status on labour market consequences is rather sparse. Thanks to a new database, the Longitudinal Survey on Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC ¨C (====)), we are able to estimate the causal effects of the hukou status on labour market performance by exploiting a unique shock captured by the data: land expropriation accompanied by a change from rural to urban hukou status.====Despite the large literature documenting land reforms since the 1980s and the fast urbanisation of China (====; ====; ====), as well as the mechanics and consequences of land expropriation in China (see e.g. (====; ====)), few studies address the direct economic effects of land expropriation in a household context. Our novel contribution is that we provide the first economic investigation into the labour market impact of hukou status under circumstances where expropriation and hukou change simultaneously occur.====The compensation of agricultural land with a change in legal rights, which allows former rural hukou holders to access public goods and benefits (along with some cash considerations) restricted to urban-hukou holders in the expanding city, is a unique Chinese phenomenon. Therefore, for applied researchers, it offers the possibility of studying how individuals and households respond when subjected to a positive shock in their economic and legal circumstances without adapting their behaviour in anticipation of possible future hukou change ¨C rural and hukou holding was effectively fixed in 1958. After that date individuals appear to have had neither influence nor choice in the hukou they held, though this is based on the historical setting in which rural and urban hukou were determined, and, importantly, the general lack of available documentation on how expropriation was effectively carried out through China. The rigidity of the hukou system post-1958 is conducive to view ¡®expropriation with hukou change¡¯ as a variable exogenous to individual choices. In this case, its effect on outcomes about career or education could be interpreted as causal==== when estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). To verify this conclusion, we apply the approach developed by Oster (====) to formally test whether the results are robust to omitted variable bias, finding overwhelming evidence in the affirmative.====In the empirical analysis we apply the panel random estimator to exploit the longitudinal nature of RUMiC data and use non-migrant rural hukou holders as the main comparison group: these are the people whom the expropriated originally belong to, but we include migrants from the same and other provinces as self-selected groups of rural hukou holders. The results reveal that receiving an urban hukou through expropriation considerably raises the hourly wages of the affected relative to rural stayers and rural-urban migrants. The principal channels through which this effect arises are access to better jobs for tenure (permanent positions), the use of formal job search methods (government arrangements or direct contact with the employer) and types of employer (state-owned companies and government authorities).====We also find that children of the expropriated hukou-changers complete more education than children of urban natives and children of migrants, and almost one year of extra schooling relative to children of rural stayers. This result is novel altogether, and supports the hypothesis that removing barriers to education in urban centres for rural hukou-holding children may be a tool to reduce intergenerational ==== between non-urban and urban-hukou holder groups.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

Three such cities where influential auction formats have been developed for allocating car licenses are the Asian metropolises of Singapore, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with other cities following suit. The current paper examines car auction formats both theoretically and experimentally, with the purpose of maximizing social welfare by improving efficiency and reducing misunderstandings. Reaction time is introduced as an essential non-economic factor of model bidding behaviors in these car license auctions. At the theoretical level, this paper finds that reaction time causes inefficient allocations in the Shanghai auction, but not in the Singapore or Guangzhou auctions. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that late bids prevail in all of these auction formats, but only lead to inefficient allocations in the Shanghai auction. Additionally, the subjects' reaction time in the Shanghai treatment was scored by conducting a number comparison task, finding a positive correlation between the probability of winning and the reaction time score.","Car license auctions have played an important role in recent decades in easing the pressures caused by urbanization. In Asia's large urban centers (e.g., Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and Hangzhou), robust population expansion and growing incomes have fueled the rise in car ownership. In 2016, the number of registered motor vehicles in Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was 0.96, 5.48, 3.22 and 2.30 million, respectively. The surge in the number of cars has engendered numerous problems, including smog, road congestion, and a shortage of parking spaces, to name a few. The limiting and auctioning of car license quotas has been a widely used practice since Singapore pioneered the car license auction in 1990.==== In the early 1990s, Shanghai was the first city in China to assign car licenses using auctions and Guangzhou launched its car-controlling program in 2012. Thousands of car licenses have been sold in such auctions, with a limit of one license per bidder. Purchasing a car license in these auctions allows the bidder to own a car in that particular city. Shanghai, Guangzhou and Singapore each use a different auction format, with other cities following suit with similar versions.==== Hence, the focus of the current paper is on the three influential auction formats, to evaluate their social welfare performance.====The primary concern of conducting an auction car license is to maximize the welfare of limiting car users. Policymakers' interests may also lie in the auction formats which fit their noneconomic policy objectives, such as transparency and fairness, but their policies may cause a massive loss of social welfare. Studies of these auction formats can thus generate ways to design more favorable auction markets for policymakers. Some of the existing literature provides an analysis of the empirical data on car license auctions in Singapore and Shanghai. For example, ==== argue that the Singapore auction should be discriminatory in order to make it more equitable and politically acceptable. Several studies focus on the impact of the change from sealed to open bids in the Singapore auction, which took place in 2001 (====; ====; ====), suggesting that this shift has led to lower volatility in relation to winning prices, and better interactions between the forces of supply and demand. ==== analyzed the impact of historical mechanism changes in the Shanghai auction. Recently, ==== and ==== found that the license auction policy in Shanghai has improved social welfare, while the license lottery policy in Beijing has resulted in a social welfare loss. However, these cities vary in terms of population density, income distribution and traffic conditions, and bidders' willingness to pay cannot directly be observed in the empirical auction data. In order to undertake a direct comparison of these auction formats, a controlled laboratory experiment may be seen as the optimum methodology for testing our theoretical predictions regarding the bidding behaviors and efficiencies in the Shanghai, Guangzhou and Singapore auctions.====The model presented in this paper assumed that there exist two types of auction bidders: incremental or rational. Incremental bidders are those who use a simple strategy of bidding one increment above the current auction price, while rational bidders use a sophisticated best response strategy to prior value distributions and other bids. The model also posited that regardless of the type of bidder, they could not react to other bids instantaneously owing to the presence of reaction time.==== In this paper, the sophisticated best response strategy used by rational bidders was the so-called late-bid strategy.====Behavioral data were collected from our laboratory experiments of real-world car license auction formats, and a theoretical auction format called the Uniform Price Sealed-Bid (UPSB) was applied as the baseline treatment(e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). The experimental results show there to be far more inefficient allocations in the Shanghai auctions than in the other two auction formats.==== In the Shanghai auction, it was found that many high-value bidders were not able to win due to their very low bids, which was not observed in the other auction formats. The lack of success of high-value bidders may have been caused by their slow reactions. For instance, when the price was pushed up by quickly reacting bidders in the last five seconds before a Shanghai auction closed, slow-reaction bidders may have had no time to revise their higher bids before the auction closed. We found further evidence to support this by scoring subjects reaction times after the Shanghai auction. These scores positively affected the probabilities of winning in the latter auction, which is also consistent with the model presented in the current paper. In the real world, Internet agent companies are very common in Shanghai car license auctions, where agents bid for car licenses on behalf of their customers for a fee of 1000 USD to 2200 USD for each successful bid. Typically, these companies have very fast-reaction agents, with extremely fast internet speed and computer terminals.==== In addition, a mass of late bids was observed in the Shanghai, Singapore and Guangzhou auctions, which is consistent with the assumption of late bidding in the present model. By analyzing the convergence of bidding processes with the equilibrium bidding strategy in the UPSB, Guangzhou and Singapore auctions, it was found that learning is much easier in uniform price auctions than in discriminatory price auctions, and also in sealed-bid auctions compared to open auctions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The following section introduces the three auction formats as they are implemented in practice. Section 3 describes the theoretical models of car license auctions. Section 4 presents the experimental design used in the current research. Section 5 summarizes the experimental results. Section 6 discusses the reaction time effects and learning effects found in the experiments. The final section concludes the paper.====Proof for Lemma 1. In the first stage, incremental bidders submit their bids by adding a small amount based on the current price, which increases the current price. Since the presence of the price cap, the current price in the first stage cannot exceed the price cap nor market-clearing prices. In the second stage, the relevant low current price reserves spaces for incremental bidders to revise their bids, which pushes the price up. Meanwhile, best response bidders have no incentive to revise a bid lower than the current price. The one reason is the intensive competition in the second stage, where more than ==== bidders would like to pay higher than the current price. And another reason is the variance among the highest ====?+?1 bids may be very small due to the presence of the warning price and a strict revision rule. Hence, for saving a tiny amount of paying an object, a bidder has to endure a significant decrease in the probability of winning, and therefore revising a bid lower than the current price is not worthwhile for him. To summarize, all bids and revisions would increase the current price.",Evaluating car license auction mechanisms: Theory and experimental evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301488,5-Dec-19,2019,Research Article,337

In this study, we extend the investigation, using a unique panel dataset to thoroughly explore this effect and achieve the following findings. First, the ordinary least squares and fixed-effects estimates, as well as propensity-score matching analyses, suggest that being a leader can enhance academic performance in both the short and long run. Second, student leadership experience in primary school most effectively improves contemporary academic achievement. Third, compared with class commissaries and delegates, the position of class monitor is usually more conducive for promoting academic performance. Fourth, holding a leader position reduces study time but improves learning autonomy; the latter outweighs the former, thereby enhancing academic performance.","As academic performance is linked to the development of human capital in terms of an individual's education and later labor market performance (====; Lindqvist and ====), the factors that determine educational achievement have been widely studied. School resources and family and personal characteristics are the three main categories pointed to as affecting academic outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In addition, some studies reveal that self-efficacy, learning autonomy, and learning self-motivation are also closely related to academic outcomes (====; ====; ====; ====).====Researchers show that leaders have an important impact on group outcomes (====). For example, leaders have a significant impact on the performance of organizations, local communities, and even entire countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Furthermore, many psychology studies argue that holding a leadership position influences personal behaviors such as risk-taking, auto-excitation, and self-regulation (====; ====; ====). Additionally, some empirical studies have shown that becoming a student leader during schooling (e.g., in senior-high school or college) can enhance later labor market outcomes at least in the short term (====; ====).====However, there are limited studies on the effect of student leadership experience on students' academic performance. Among the few, some studies argue that leadership experience may have opposing effects on academic achievement. On the one hand, student leaders work harder than others in their studies and, therefore, achieve higher grades (====). On the other hand, leadership takes time away from study and may distract these individuals from focusing on their work. Therefore, leadership activities may have a negative consequence in terms of academic performance (====).====Using an experimental method, ==== were the first to investigate how student leadership experience affects academic performance. By conducting an experiment in junior high school, authors investigate whether individuals who were randomly selected as student leaders at the beginning of a semester have better academic performance at the end of such semester. They claim that student leadership experience (without considering the difference between different types of leaders) can improve academic outcomes, increase test scores, improve political popularity in class, and make students more autonomous and ambitious. They also argue that while leadership experience may signal pre-existing skills, it may also impact human capital development.====Thus, although many studies have discussed the factors that influence academic performance, many questions remain in terms of how student leadership experience affects academic performance: Does student leadership experience influence academic performance in the short or long run? Is there any difference in the impact on academic achievement of serving as a student leader at different educational stages? Do different types of student leadership experience have different effects on academic performance? Moreover: Through what mechanism does student leadership experience affect academic achievement? Our study attempts to answer these questions in depth.====In this research, we extend the range of the study of student leadership experience in several ways. First, we distinguish the long-run effects of leadership experience on academic performance from the short-run effects by investigating how being a leader influences current and later academic achievement. Second, we explore the differences in the influence of leadership experience in multiple periods, including primary school, junior high school, senior high school, and college. Third, we examine the different effects of various types of leadership positions, such as class monitor, class commissary, class delegate, college-level leader, and school-level leader, on academic outcomes. Fourth, we exhaustively study the underlying mechanism of leadership experience's influence on academic performance by testing how being a leader affects after class study time and his/her learning attitude. Last, by using a unique panel dataset and fixed-effects (FE) estimation, we obtain more precise results.====This study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, our study contributes to the field of research on the formation of human capital. Although there is a substantial body of literature on how family environs influence the development of personal skills (e.g., Cunha and ====), few studies have investigated the association between experience in school and the formation of human capital. Our study addresses this research gap by showing that student leadership experience is a key factor in determining academic performance. Second, our study sheds light on strategies in school management, especially student management. Previous studies have paid more attention to the role of the school principal's characteristics (e.g., gender) and school features (e.g., school size) in the selection of school management strategies (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Our study provides an important supplement by exploring the effects of early leadership experience on later academic performance. Finally, this study enriches the literature on the relationship between student leadership experience and performance from both the subject and research setting perspectives. The student leader structure in some East Asian countries (e.g., China and the Republic of Korea) is quite different from that in developed democracies (e.g., the United States). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the student leader structure in China and simultaneously investigate the effects of different types of student leadership experience on academic performance.====Using survey data of Chinese undergraduate students, we found the following. First, being a leader can enhance academic performance both in the short and long run. Second, student leadership experience during primary school can most effectively improve contemporary academic achievement. Third, compared with class commissary or class delegate, class monitor experience generally more effectively and efficiently promotes academic performance.

Based on three reasonable assumptions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimum size in a particular city, which is affected directly by commuting costs, preference degree for environmental quality, as well as industrial structure. Using China's population census and urban yearbook data in 2000 and 2010, we find that city size imbalances in China are obvious. First-tier cities are oversized, while other cities are undersized, and this imbalance becomes more significant while considering urban environmental quality.","Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand and manage them has remained limited (====; ====). A core issue is whether there exists an optimum level for city size or not, and what factors influence the optimum size if it does indeed exist. In this paper, we extend the model of ==== to a more comprehensive framework, which considers economic productivity, environmental quality, and commuting costs, simultaneously. Empirically, this paper uses rich and updated data to observe city heterogeneity, measures city size with adjusted resident population instead of household registered population (i.e., ==== population), estimates effective labor with a more realistic spatial distribution, and deals with two classical regression problems related to constant returns to scale and technology endogeneity.====We prove that a unique optimum city size exists for each city if the degree of preference for environmental quality is not extreme, and if commuting is not too expensive.==== The optimum size is heterogeneous across cities, increasing with upgrades in industrial structure, and decreasing with high commuting costs and environmental preferences. Using China's population census data, we find that the first-tier cities in China are oversized, but small and medium-sized cities are undersized. This imbalanced urbanization pattern did not change from 2000 to 2010. The small and medium-sized cities in China have the most potential for urban agglomeration, but the reality is that the oversized cities grow even more oversized, while the undersized cities grow smaller and smaller with respect to their optimum sizes.====These findings are important for numerous reasons. They help us understand how urban agglomeration produces externalities, better. ==== predicted that the global urban population will gain an additional 2.5 billion people by 2050. Urbanization has been an inevitable process for most countries (==== One limitation is that ==== used the ==== population only, and did not consider the quality of the local environment. As a result of this limitation the optimum city size in their model may have been overestimated.==== Thus, a re-examination is necessary, especially when urban agglomeration is considered a dynamic process.====Methodologically, we extend the literature in three aspects. First, we develop a model that drives two externalities of urban agglomeration directly, namely, one with respect to commuting costs and the other with respect to environmental quality and economic productivity. By maximizing the net externalities, an optimum city size is determined, which can be represented by a concise and robust equation (as shown in Proposition 1 later). Second, we consider more characteristics that constitute the heterogeneity of the cities, including industrial structure, unit-distance commuting costs, total factor productivity, output elasticity of effective labor, and degree of preference for environmental quality.==== Third, to address constant returns to scale (CRS) and endogeneity issues caused by unobserved productivity, we adopt a new two-step approach.====Empirically, we also extend the literature in three aspects. First, instead of using a uniform spatial distribution to calculate effective labor (====), we employ a negative exponential distribution that is derived from a monocentric model. As argued by ====, major cities in China, such as Beijing, exhibit the monocentric spatial pattern. Between a uniform spatial distribution and a negative exponential distribution, we believe the latter is more adequate, and can better estimate the effective labor, which considers commuting costs. Second, we study all 286 prefecture-level and province-level cities by using their resident population, not just data on their ==== population used in ==== Later in this paper, we find that in 2010, the adjusted resident population was 14.83 million on average for the first-tier cities, while the ==== population was 8.63 million on average. Therefore, ==== population could significantly underestimate the true first-tier city size, and it is more appropriate to examine Chinese city size by using resident population data. Third, we estimate the impact of environment quality on a city's optimal size by comparing our results with the question of whether the environmental quality parameter is included in the empirical models or not. In recent years, urban malaise, such as the worsening environment and traffic, has become the bottleneck restricting further development of Chinese cities. It is important to examine agglomeration economies and diseconomies by considering both, economic growth and environmental quality.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Such a dominant-country position does not exist in Latin America, nor in Emerging Europe, for which the major questions are respectively the position relative to the U.S. and the condition of access to the Eurozone.

For another part of the literature, the RMB may be a leading regional currency that has overtaken the U.S. dollar as the dominant reference currency in Asia.====To shed light on this issue, we implement a dynamic latent factor model to investigate the determinants of 24 emerging countries' exchange rate movements and decompose the evolutions into the contribution of a global factor, a regional factor and a country-specific factor.====First of all, the results indicate that, in the whole period of 2000¨C2015, the common global factor is by far the most important determinant of exchange rate variations for Asian economies (70%) and, albeit to a lesser extent, for Latin America (53%) and all other countries in the sample (49.6%). If we decompose the whole period into sub-periods, the results are quite different. The 2000¨C2005 sub-period shows the predominance of the global common factor as the main explanation of exchange rate movements, especially for Asian countries (73%). However, after 2005, there is a strong increase in the explanatory power of the regional factor in Asia, from 5.6% to 45.1%, indicating that it is becoming the dominant factor in this area. We find evidence, in line with the Chinese dominance hypothesis in the literature, of the increasing influence of the regional factor in the evolution of exchange rates in Asia to the detriment of the common global factor. This is not the case for the other emerging zones. Moreover, when we split the period of 2006¨C2015 into two sub-periods, namely 2006¨C2010 and 2011¨C2015, to take into account the launch of the offshore exchange rate (CNH) in Hong Kong in 2010, the explanatory power of the regional factor in Asia is the highest for the period of 2011¨C2015 (49.7%), with respect to the explanatory power for the period of 2006¨C2010 (47.2%) and for the whole period of 2006¨C2015 (45.1%). We assert that this regional influence could be linked to the internationalization of the RMB and to the more flexible management of the Chinese exchange rate regime since 2005 and after the launch of the offshore rate in 2010.

We also use the zero-inflated Negative Binomial model to examine the likelihood of innovation. We find that the human capital indicators play an important role in influencing patenting, and that some of the human capital variables appear to have a greater impact on patenting in mid-sized cities. Our human capital estimates are obtained after controlling for firms' R&D, size, market share, age, and foreign ownership, as well as fixed effects to control for industry-specific characteristics, and firms' location and geography.","Identifying the underlying factors that make firms more innovative is of considerable importance and has seen substantial research. The literature has identified the roles played by R&D expenditures, firm size, financing constraints, among other characteristics. In part, driven by data availability, much of this literature has focused on firms in the relatively more developed countries.====Our focus in this paper is to examine some of the key determinants of firms' innovation output in a developing and rapidly growing large economy, China. More importantly, our objective is to focus on the contribution of various aspects of firms' human capital ¨C as measured by the firms' managerial and workforce skill-levels ¨C on their innovation output and on their heterogenous effects across different market environments. This is particularly important for a country like China which has made significant investments in R&D related resources to boost its development process, but still lags the developed economies. For example, China was ranked as the second largest R&D spender in the World in 2017.==== However, in the Forbes 2018 list of the World's 100 most innovative companies, there are only 7 Chinese companies, while with 51 are from the U.S.====; ====; ====). At firm level, however, empirical studies on the relationship between firm innovation and human capital are somewhat lacking, especially in the context of a rapidly developing economy like China. Our study contributes to the extant literature by focusing on firm-level innovation in China, and, in particular, by investigating in detail the role played by human capital at various dimensions, including at the managerial level and in the firms' general workforce, as well as by examining how market environments affect the function of human capital. This comprehensive examination of the human factors can shed new light on the drivers of innovation in an important and rapidly developing economy.====The broader literature examining firm's innovation capacity and output has focused on a range of internal and external factors. One strand of literature related to firm level human capital considers highly skilled human capital as a crucial dimension of innovation processes for a firm (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Another strand of literature related to firms' innovation examines the management team (e.g., ====; ====; ====). However, many of the studies have focused either on skilled human capital, or on managerial human capital, and/or ignored external factors such as market structure (e.g., ====; ====).====In our study, we combine both internal and external factors to examine the determinants of a firm's innovation, with particular focus on how various aspects of workforce and managerial human capital contribute to firm innovation, and how the effects might differ across various market environments. Different facets of human capital are distinguished, measured and their roles are investigated, using different datasets and estimation methods.====The data we use are from a World Bank survey of firms in China. The data contain a rich set of variables related to labor force and innovation. Specifically, we study the manufacturing firms in China, because this sector has played a critical role in China's rapid economic growth, and accounts for about 40% of China's GDP. The World Bank survey contains two datasets from two different levels of cities - large metropolitan cities and mid-sized cities, which have very different market environments in China. The market environment can have a profound effect on a country's innovation system (====). This further enables us to examine in detail the factors, especially human capital, affecting firms' innovation in different market environments.====Our estimates show that highly educated human capital plays an important role in both the probability of innovation and the quantity of innovation. However, there is variation on the impacts of the different human capital variables across the samples from the large versus mid-sized cities. The General Manager's (GM, hereafter) and management team's education levels have a positive and significant effect on firms' innovation output in mid-sized cities. The tenure of General Manager plays a positive role in large cities. The average age of a firm's management team appears to have a significant negative effect on innovation in all cities.====The paper is organized as follows.

Along with China¡¯s unprecedented growth, the rapid expansion of its service sector is one of the fastest among emerging countries. However, the literature has yet to offer a clear understanding of such expansion. We show that distribution services first grow with the manufacturing sector, followed by personal services as per capita income rises. Motivated by this growth pattern, this paper provides a theory that describes 1) the complementarity between distribution services and the manufacturing sector, and 2) the substitution between personal services and home production. Empirics show that the personal service sector is the key to account for the early and rapid rise of the service sector in China. Quantitatively, high productivity growth and high capital intensity in the personal service sector, and labor market frictions are the most important channels. By revealing the growth pattern of the service sector in the early stages of development, the paper thereby contributes to the growing literature on the rising importance of the service economy.","Cross-country evidence shows that the service sector gradually becomes the largest sector in terms of output and employment in the developed world. Historical data shows that when an economy grows, resources flow from the agricultural sector to the manufacturing sector, eventually shifting to the service sector. Such Transition calls for a natural question: why do some countries experience earlier and faster growth in the service sector?====Over the past three decades China has grown rapidly into the second largest economy in the world. Along with such unprecedented growth, it also experienced a fast expansion of its service sector, with an expansion rate that is among the top of emerging markets. Understanding the sources of such expansion is important, since it can help elucidate the growth potential of other developing countries.====We first show that China has distinguished itself from other emerging economies with a higher growth of value added share or employment share in the service sector at the early development stages. However this feature is difficult to explain at the aggregate level because 1) evidence suggests that personal services, a sub-division of the service sector, are the key to explain its early rise; 2) traditional theories of structural change cannot explain the dynamic pattern of the service sector quantitatively when applied at the aggregate level. Motivated by these facts, this paper departs from the existing literature by disaggregating services into distribution services and personal services, which enables a deeper examination of the different growth patterns of the two service components.====Disaggregation in this way reveals the heterogeneity in the service sector: different services have different growth patterns, and they require separate explanations. Distribution services accompany the manufacturing sector as its complements. They rise with industrialization and are commonly unaffected by per capita income changes. Personal services, on the other hand, are demanded by the households as substitutes for home production. As income increases, people who have comparative advantage with their work prefer to purchase personal services from the market rather than producing at home. As a consequence, the personal services expand, but at a later time than distribution services.====This paper provides a theory that highlights 1) the complementarity between distribution services and the manufacturing sector, and 2) the substitution between personal services and home production. In order to fully study the structural change, the model incorporates both non-homothetic preferences and uneven sectoral productivity growth. It also incorporates physical capital and moving cost across sectors, which enables the study of the capital deepening effect and the role of labor market frictions.====The model establishes a link between labor productivity and the sectoral composition. We calibrate the model to fit the Chinese data. Given exogenous sectoral TFP trends, the model endogenously generates dynamic patterns of the sectoral labor allocation, that are consistent with the data. We then use this quantitative model to conduct counterfactual analyses to determine the relative importance of different channels of the structural change. There are several important channels which can affect labor reallocation across sectors, but only a few of them can account for the early and rapid rise of personal service sector. Our counterfactual results show that the most important channels are the high productivity growth and high capital intensity in personal services, and the labor market frictions.====This paper contributes to the literature in two aspects: Firstly, most research on the rise of the service economy, focuses on the growth of the service sector at a later stage following a high level of per capita income. This paper, on the other hand, looks at the growth of services at an earlier stage when per capita income is low. It is particularly meaningful to look at this early stage, because it is what many emerging economies are currently experiencing, so the study of China¡¯s case offers a useful and important lesson. Secondly, this paper departs from most literature by studying the service sector at the disaggregate level, instead of the aggregate level. Such disaggregation is necessary, because different service components show very different trends in their growth. This is why traditional structural change theories based on aggregate service data often fail: anyone is bound to get a poor fit if two distinctive series are mingled together. This paper shows that to study China¡¯s service sector we have to look at the disaggregate level.====This paper is related to a large existing literature on structural change, rise of service, home production and development of China. Traditional theories of structural change (for instance, see ====; ====; ====), cannot provide a good quantitative match with the rise of the service sector.==== This paper fills the gap by providing a candidate with disaggregated services and home production. It is also the first to document the growth of the service sector in China at a disaggregate level, as well as different growth patterns between distribution services and personal services at the early stages of development. For alternative treatment, see ====, ==== which features hierarchic type preferences. This paper also relates to a growing literature on the role of market versus home production. Similar to ====; ====; ====, we introduce a home production sector, which can explain a large and late income effect towards services. In our work we focus on the substitution between personal services and home production. Existing literature on China¡¯s economic growth and transformation mainly focus on the decline of the agricultural sector (====; ====) or the rise of the non-state sector (====; ====; ====). Comparing to the latter literature, this paper provides an alternative perspective to decompose the non-agricultural sector in China.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides the background and motivation for the service disaggregation. ==== formally states the model. ==== delivers the calibration and counterfactual results. ==== discusses the robustness of the model. ==== summarizes and concludes.",The rise of the service sector in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301464,26-Nov-19,2019,Research Article,342

This may, however, lead to an overestimation of effective labour supply when considerable people are overeducated. By incorporating a concept of ¡°market recognition,¡± which proxies the gap between the capabilities reflected through the education level and the capabilities required by employers, we establish a ==== model to quantify this gap in China during 1999¨C2011. Our calibration results show that overeducation had deteriorated as market recognition continued to decline. We give an interpretation from the perspective of effective labour supply.","Overeducation is the incongruence between a person¡¯s level of education and the level of education required for his/her job. Such incongruence reflects a disequilibrium or inefficiency in the labour market: some workers cannot find jobs that make full use of their abilities and are, therefore, ¡°underutilized¡± (====). The prefix ¡°over¡± implies a reduced return to a person¡¯s surplus educational attainments. The rate of return to years of required education is 7¨C10% in US and UK, while that of overeducation is 1/2¨C2/3 of it (====; ====; ====).====Most of overeducated workers are young and receive limited on-the-job training (====) or lack non-academic skills (====). As a result, they suffer a large wage penalty (====; ====). With lower job satisfiction, heavier psychological stress, and lower reported level of productivity (====; ====; ====), overeducated workers are more likely to change their occupations (====).====Overeducation problem first hit US college graduates in 1970s. Due to changes in the industrial structure and an unprecedented growth in the educated labour supply, American workers found that their acquired years of schooling significantly exceeded the levels at which their counterparts were once employed (====; ====). Overeducation then spread to other developed countries. ==== and ====The recent growing concern about overeducation arose in developing countries, such as China. In the last decades, China has been characterized by a rapid economic growth and a shortage of highly-educated workers. To address this issue, the government expanded the scale of higher education since 1999, which significantly increased the supply of college graduates. The consequences came to be complex. It partly solved the skilled worker shortage, however, considerable college graduates failed to find matched jobs.====). The overeducated people are, therefore, not necessary to be associated with an inefficient use of human resources because they are reported unqualified in the job (====). In this case, the possible solution is to improve human capital by educating or training so that overeducated people can be qualified in skilled works. However, another view argues the opposite. In the case of wage rigidity with a shortage of job vacancies, which is caused by market frictions (====; ====; ====) or institutional barriers (====; ====), to pick up a small number of employees among considerable applicants, the employer tends to raise the requirement to an unnecessary level. Since the education level is considered as a signal of innate abilities (==== suggested removing the regional mobile barrier to lower the unemployment rate and increase matching quality in China.====The overeducation in China is probably a composite effect relying on both mechanisms mentioned above. Our study emphasizes on the former. We investigate the characteristics of China¡¯s phenomenon and find that fresh college graduates probably have less human capital than that they are expected to have. This decline of human capital can be attributed to three reasons: the decline of average quality among enrolled students, the decline of education quality in unqualified institutes, and lack of sufficient training during education process. To validate this, we introduce a concept of ¡°market recognition,¡± which helps to rectify the bias of using the number of highly educated people as an estimate of human capital. Market recognition proxies human capital by measuring the relative chance of obtaining a skilled job, not by investigating earnings from the job.====Empirically, we establish a computable ==== (CGE) model to calibrate the process of how overeducation emerged and deteriorated as the market recognition of college graduates declined during the college expansion period 1999¨C2011 in China. The endogenized value of market recognition presented a sharp decline from 1.0 in 1999 to 0.3 in 2011. It means that the chance of obtaining a skilled job for a fresh college graduate has largely declined if compared to other fully recognized job-seekers in this period, and implies an increasing gap on human capital between them.====In addition, we explain the excess labour supply in overeducation scenario from the ¡°effective labour supply¡± perspective without wage rigidity prerequisite. The effective labour supply is determined by the nominal supply of labour categories and their market recognition. Wages can only adjust to clear the effective labour market, in which a part of job-applicants who have required skills (determined by the market recognition) are regarded as the effective labour supply to skilled jobs, while the rest ¡°ineffective¡± applicants have to do unskilled jobs.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== details the recent overeducation problem in China. In ====, we introduce the variable of ¡°market recognition¡± into a job-vacancy-chain model to explain how overeducation of college graduates emerged. In ====, we quantify the changes in the market recognition of college graduates during 1999¨C2011 through calibrating a general equilibrium model. In ====, we discuss the effective labour supply concept based on the market recognition and simulate how a drop in market recognition would affect the economy. ==== concludes the paper.====Here are three Eqs. ====, ====, ==== and they are the variant of Eqs. ====, ====, ==== in ====. The value of market recognition of each category of labour is initially set to be one. If we introduce the exogenous variables which are in bold in (A1-A3), the rest variables can be calculated.====For variable ====(¡ä97), we use 1997 employment data from ====. For variable ====(¡ä97), (====?¡Ê?====), we use 1996 employment data ====(¡ä96) minus a constant leaving proportion, which is 2%. For parameter ====, (====?¡Ê?====), we assume the natural sacking rate is around 1.6% for each category of labour. For variable ====(¡ä97), the assumption is listed below:====The top equation indicates how employed persons offer to other occupations. First, we assume on average 7% of employed persons in each occupation are willing to change occupations. Then the distribution of supply from each occupation to other occupations is determined by their initial employment pattern. For instance, if 5 college-educated persons work as managers, 10 work as technicians, 5 work as clerks, 5 work as salesmen and 5 work as production workers at the beginning, then the proportion of supply from clerk occupation to technician occupation will be 10/(5+10+5+5+5)?=?1/3. The median equation indicates how many persons remain in the initial occupation. The bottom equation describes how unemployed persons and new graduates choose their occupations, and the mechanism is the same as the first equation.==== displays the initial labour transition matrix ====(¡ä97). The main feature of the labour transition is that most people will hold their current occupations, and this matches a survey result¡ªon average it was only 1.84 times for a Chinese worker to change his job during his whole life before 2000 (====).====Some flaws in ==== however are obvious: (a) the number of new college graduates who become managers is too large; (b) unemployed persons get so many opportunities to be technicians, nearly 50%; (c) the re-unemployment rate is too small¡ªonly 23%, but the published data suggest a higher rate, 50% according to China Statistical Yearbook 1998; (d) the unemployment rate of new college graduates seems too high in 1997. Similar flaws also exist in the labour transition matrix in the high-school level and the primary education level. To fix these, we adjust values of market recognition until ==== is obtained.==== is more reliable than ====. First, the sum of the transition rates of college graduates to technicians (====) and to administrative positions (====) is 63%. It is consistent with ====¡¯s survey in Shanghai, which reports that more than 60% of college graduates who remained in Shanghai found technician or administrative jobs in government or public institutions. Second, the setting of unemployment rate of college graduates is reasonable. ==== also reported that 7% of 4-year-term graduates and 10% of 3-year-term graduates could not find jobs when they left school in 1997. At last, the unemployment rates of each education level can match the data from ==== (see ====). We think it reasonable to keep most values of market recognition to be one unless we can find new data resources to support the settings of transition rates from labour categories to occupations.","Overeducation, market recognition, and effective labour supply",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301452,21-Nov-19,2019,Research Article,343

The most direct impact is reflected in trust and trustworthiness between the local household registered population and the nonlocal household registered population. In this paper, using the framed field experiment method with local and nonlocal hukou pupils as subjects, hukou identity is exogenously introduced into the trust game through information disclosure and ¡°priming¡± technology to investigate whether hukou identity affects trust between the two hukou identities. The experimental results show that the concept of hukou identity and its characterized cognition of different treatments have been implanted in people since childhood, thereby affecting their trust and trustworthiness in the process of social integration. Subjects will show more trust (more investment) towards local hukou pupils compared to nonlocal hukou pupils, and subjects will show higher trustworthiness (more return amount) towards partners who share hukou identity than those with a different hukou identity.","The hukou system is the mandatory household registration system in China. This system assigns individuals a hukou type shortly after their birth, which entitles them to certain social benefits. In that sense, the hukou identity is similar to the social security number in the United States or the national insurance number in the United Kingdom since they are all institutionally imposed. The hukou system, however, is very different from the other two systems because an individual's hukou type is not randomly assigned. Furthermore, this system favors individuals with urban hukou and discriminates against those with rural hukou in a variety of ways, making it difficult for them to obtain education, employment, housing, health care, and other social benefits (====, ====). Hence, the hukou identity is an institutionally imposed social identity assigned to Chinese at birth with a social rank.====; ====). In particular, generalized trust in other people with whom the individual has never met or may never meet again, is an important prerequisite for a society featured by general cooperation and social interaction (====; ====). A large number of empirical studies also show that trust can boost economic prosperity (====), increase economic growth (====; ====), improve the legal system and government regulation (====; ====), enhance education quality (====), and promote social welfare (====). Without a doubt, trust plays an important role in the process of social and economic development.====Accordingly, research on the trust level of residents for strangers in China is also quite influential (====; ====; ====). ==== studied social integration in urban China and analyzed the relationship between hukou identities and trust towards local and central government. ==== concerned religion and trust in strangers among China's rural-urban migrants. In particular, study began to explore the trust between local household registered population and nonlocal household registered population (====). These empirical studies mostly proceed from the macro perspective and judge people's trust level via questionnaires. Nevertheless, using a questionnaire about personal subjective feelings as a scientific basis to examine people's behavioral preferences is always questioned in terms of data validity (====).====As ==== applied the experiment method of trust game, the experimental economists provided a more effective way for measuring individual's trust level. ==== held that in the controllable experimental environment with incentive mechanisms, social interaction between the game players is eliminated due to the two-party anonymous one-time trust game; thus, the derived data reflects a pure level of trust. At the same time, the trust game experiment conducted with Chinese samples as subjects has also gradually emerged (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====In this context, this paper attempts to examine the trust and trustworthiness between the local household registered population and the nonlocal household registered population from individual micro level using the standard trust game method. The local household registered population and nonlocal household registered population represent two different social identities. Will being treated differently daily based on one's hukou identity change people's trust and trustworthiness in interaction, resulting in possible opposition and exclusion between different hukou identity groups as between different status, castes, and races, or make people show different level of trust for population with different hukou identities? Finding an answer to this question requires further empirical evidence to clarify whether the hukou system has introduced people's awareness towards different hukou identities, and whether such awareness will change people's trust and trustworthiness.====) is adopted in this study to exogenously prime hukou identity to game experiments, and directly investigate the effect of hukou identity on trust.====)==== was adopted to introduce pupils' awareness of hukou identity and feelings towards different treatment for different hukou identities in daily life in an effort to examine whether such a cognitive experience will determine their choice in game decisions and change people's trust and trustworthiness.====The experimental results show that pupils have clear awareness of hukou identity and tend to regard local hukou pupils as superior to nonlocal ones. This perception being primed has directly led to different decision-making choices in the face of game players with different hukou identities in the trust game. Although the disclosure of hukou identity information will not induce the difference of subjects' trust and trustworthiness when they face game players with different hukou identities, after priming of the awareness towards hukou identity, participants will show more trust to local hukou pupils as compared to nonlocal hukou pupils, and participants will show higher trustworthiness (more return amount) to partners of same hukou identity than of different hukou identity.====The reminder of the paper is organized as follows: The second section contains the literature review, with a focus on reviewing the trust game, trust and social identity in the experiments, and hukou identity experiments.

The tide of ","Urbanization has been a major issue worldwide for centuries. Over half of the population lives in towns and cities, and the figure is expected to increase to 68% by 2050 (====); a large portion of this population resides in Asia. Among those comprising the urban population, about 90% of people live in India, China, and other countries due to the large number of rural-to-urban migrants therein. Future increases in the size of the world's urban population are estimated to be concentrated in a few countries. Among these countries, it is estimated that China will account for 255 million individuals (====). In the developing world, which has the highest urban population growth worldwide, China's urbanization remains the fastest, and the number of migrants expected to become urban dwellers therein is estimated to increase from 11.3% in 2018 to 20.2% by 2050 (====). Migration is a significant contributor to urbanization because when many migrants from the agricultural population move into the cities, the urbanization process is accelerated (====). Industrialization drives migration and increases both the urban population and the number of individuals seeking social and economic opportunities in cities, who constitute the bulk of the labor force in China.====The emergence of automation in the new economy and technological era, accompanied by a decrease in technology cost, is expected to exert global effects. The impact of robotics prompts both hope and fear in people (====, ====). On the one hand, automation has considerably reduced the working time per unit of output (====; ====). On the other hand, the replacement of labor forces in the 21st century has triggered the concern that technology may lead to large-scale unemployment in the future. According to the McKinsey Global Institute's research report, by 2030, 400 to 800 million jobs worldwide will be replaced by automation (====). Two-thirds of jobs in developing countries may disappear due to automation (====; ====). In the future, automation will replace low- to middle-skilled workers and gradually leave many migrants unemployed (====). Automation will also create new jobs, such as robot repair technicians.====Urbanization is largely driven by forces comprising a rural push or an urban pull, and rural-to-urban migration is expected to create an urban¨Crural utility gap (====; ====). Cities are extending their boundaries to accommodate the increase in population and the growth in land use. For example, China's urbanization was largely driven by surplus migrant labor and rural land and is internationally defined as a ¡°rural push and an urban pull force.¡± Various studies have adopted the forces comprising a rural push and an urban pull as factors that drive urbanization (====; ====). The penetration of automation in manufacturing has changed the dynamics of urbanization and the social spatial structure of cities (====; ====). Automation not only serves as the fundamental force driving upgrading in the manufacturing industry, but also affects the urban social and spatial structure and migrants' employment in the urbanization context (====). Thus, understanding the dynamics, processes, and influences of automation may provide support for addressing the question regarding how technology advancements affect migrant workers and drive urbanization.====Automation exerts global impacts at different speeds and in various ways, shapes, and forms (====). Automation in China is proceeding rapidly due to the country's unprecedented urbanization, and China has been reported as the fastest expanding market of robotics in the world (====). Since the 1980s, China's urbanization has exhibited the highest speed and the largest scale in human history. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which is dominated by labor-intensive manufacturing, is known as the ¡°world's factory.¡± It was the first to open itself to the world as part of ====, and it has created a complex industrial network of textiles, clothing, shoes, electronic information manufacturing, home appliance manufacturing, and other industries. Migrants have become the driving force of urbanization (====, ====) and have promoted urban labor-intensive manufacturing development. The ¡°migrant labor tide¡± gradually emerged in the late 1980s, and many surplus rural laborers flooded into cities. The PRD region has been deeply embedded in the global production network and has become an indispensable part of the global manufacturing network (====).====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The second section reviews relevant literature on the development of automation in manufacturing enterprises and the influences of migrants on urbanization. Related studies conducted worldwide are summarized and compared. The third section lays out the current study's analysis framework and analyzes the automation driving force, its process, and its impact on manufacturing enterprises.

Our research complies with most of the previous studies that show that the benefit from innovativeness outweighs the cost and we solidify our conclusions by considering a few distinctive features existing in China's economy.","Firm dynamics have long concerned economists. Whether in developed or developing countries, the exit and entry of firms to the market are an essential part of industrial development(====). Recent years have seen a burgeoning increase in the number of start-ups in China, leading to one of the world's largest pools of unlisted companies. These fledgeling companies, however, have fairly high rates of exit from the market. This brings to the following question: What are the factors that assist new businesses or lead to their exit from the market? There are numerous studies about how innovation influences the dynamics of companies, but few have discussed this topic in regard to start-ups. Innovativeness, on one side, is one of the most important factors to measure a start-up's potentiality. However, contrary to the assumption of the neoclassical model that states that firms exist and make decisions to maximize profits, start-ups bear more associated risks in engaging in research and development due to the limited resources compared with large companies. Hence, in this paper, we delve into whether deciding to innovate have impacts on the survival of start-ups and, if they do, are the impacts positive or negative.==== applications, which reflects the efforts of firms to innovate. In addition, we employ another indicator standing for firms' strategies on innovation, measured by the proportion of sales of new products to total sales. When combining these two variables, we can explore to which extent innovativeness, assessed either by input or output of innovation activities, influences the risk of exit. The survey dataset provides uninterrupted descriptions of each firm as long as they operate at the science park. This feature helps us to control the possible heterogeneity problems.====Following previous studies on corporate survival, we adopt the complementary log-log model, put forward by ====This paper complements existing studies in four aspects. The cornerstone of our paper is that it is the first one to use a specific Chinese start-up survey dataset to discuss firm dynamics. This naturally irons out one aspect of the concern on endogeneity since unlike large firms, start-ups have to make a trade-off between investing in production and innovation given the limited assets available. The comprehensive dataset also covers more characteristics of companies compared to other large scaled corporate surveys. Second, we employ an efficient hazard survival model favoring right censoring, and solve potential heterogeneity problems thanks to a broad selection of variables provided by the survey dataset. Furthermore, the source of a patent and the destination of its application are investigated, helping us to dig into the distinctiveness of a patent, further exploring the quality of the innovativeness and its impact.

Understanding the structure of energy use is necessary to address these environmental effects. We investigate how urbanization affects residential energy use, using data from the Chinese Residential Energy Consumption Survey 2012 (CRECS 2012). By comparing the energy consumption of urban and rural households and identifying the factors influencing the differences, we find that dwelling characteristics (e.g., building infrastructure, residential area), household characteristics (e.g., household size, income), and unobservable factors (e.g., the surrounding environment, living habits) all play roles in shaping residential energy consumption. Urbanization directly decreases energy consumption through differences in the environment outside the household (markets, infrastructure, etc.), while it indirectly increases consumption through the presence of central heating, decreased household size, and increased household income. We find a positive total effect: urbanization increases residential energy consumption in total. We also find that urbanization shifts energy consumption away from coal and toward electricity and gas. In addition, we distinguish between onsite urbanization (formation of towns based on rural markets) and offsite urbanization (movement to large cities). Compared to onsite urbanization, offsite urbanization shifts energy consumption toward electricity and gas by a larger magnitude. Finally, we project residential energy use in 2020.","Per capita energy consumption in China has been increasing alongside the increase in urban population. The structure of energy consumption has shifted toward electricity and away from coal,==== as shown in ====, Panel B. Even with this shift, energy use results in environmental problems such as emission of local pollutants and greenhouse gases. Therefore, the Chinese government has carried out a series of policies to reduce energy consumption (e.g. ====; ====), and put forward an ¡°intensive, intelligent, green, low-carbon¡± plan for urbanization.==== To achieve this goal, it is critical to understand the mechanism through which urbanization affects energy use. Therefore, this paper investigates the factors that influence the differences in energy consumption between urban and rural households, and looks into the direct and indirect effects of urbanization on energy consumption.====This paper is rooted in two series of studies. One series of studies takes the angle of ¡°top down¡±. These papers start from the characteristics of urbanization, systematically state the impacts of urbanization on energy and environment, and investigate the mechanism of the impacts. The analytical tools include the theories of ecological modernization (e.g., ====; ====; ====), urban environmental evolution (e.g., ====; ====; ====), and compact cities (e.g., ====; ====). Regarding whether urbanization increases energy consumption, empirical studies have mixed findings. Some studies find that urbanization leads to an increase in urban energy demand through changing related production, transportation, infrastructure, and other aspects of the living environment (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In contrast, some other studies find that urbanization does not necessarily increase energy consumption due to the economies of scale and improvement of energy efficiency resulting from the transition to modern energy (e.g., ====; ====; ====).====The other strand of literature takes the angle of ¡°bottom up¡±. These studies start from micro-level decision makers ¨C households or individuals ¨C and analyze the mechanism through which urbanization affects households' energy use behavior. Depending on the mechanism, this series of literature can be divided into three categories. One category focuses on household characteristics. Researchers find that urbanization increases household income through providing more job opportunities and better public services such as education. They also find that households in cities tend to have younger household heads, smaller household sizes, and a smaller residential area. All these differences in the characteristics of the household affect their living habits and energy consumption behavior (====; ====; ====). The second category focuses on the difference in the external environment in which individuals make decisions, such as markets, infrastructure, policies, etc. Urbanization provides better roads, communication and financial infrastructure, which lead to better access to markets and information. All of these changes in the environment affect residents' energy consumption behavior as well (====; ====; ====). The last category focuses on the direct impact of urbanization. Urbanization changes related infrastructural facilities and equipment, such as dwelling characteristics, energy-using appliances, etc. For instance, urbanization changes residents' energy choice set and increases the heat retention of homes, which directly changes residents' energy consumption (====; ====).====This paper fits into the second series of the literature. Taking a ¡°bottom-up¡± angle requires household or individual level data. Due to the lack of comprehensive data at the fine level, previous studies in China mainly focus on regional difference in energy use or are limited to one type of energy or one category of factors that influence energy consumption (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Utilizing data from the Chinese Residential Energy Consumption Survey 2012, this paper investigates energy consumption differences between urban and rural households nationwide, including not only the difference in quantity, but also the difference in structure of energy consumption. Findings based on nationwide surveys could be more generalizable compared to regional studies. This paper also identifies the factors that influence the energy consumption of households, including the characteristics of households and dwellings, as well as the unobservable difference between urban and rural areas, such as the external environment. Including these observed and unobserved factors could alleviate the omitted variable problem and increase the predictive power of the model. Finally, this paper simulates spatial residential energy consumption trends under urbanization scenarios, which could provide reference for policy makers.====Moreover, the paper contributes to the literature by distinguishing among different types of urbanization. Urbanization in China includes both offsite and onsite urbanization (====). Offsite urbanization refers to rural residents' migration to large cities. Onsite urbanization, which is unique to China, refers to the formation of small towns based on rural markets and driven by the industrialization of rural areas (====).==== In China, offsite urbanization usually dominates in less developed rural areas, while onsite urbanization dominates in more developed rural areas (====). Both offsite and onsite urbanization are expected to increase energy consumption in urban areas and decrease energy consumption in rural areas, due to the population change in these areas. However, the nationwide total effect is ambiguous, because urbanization could increase energy demand through increasing income and better access to energy, while it could also decrease energy demand through economies of scale or better energy efficiency. This paper distinguishes between onsite and offsite urbanization, because the two forms of urbanization could have different effects on energy consumption, due to the differences between cities (offsite urbanization) and towns (onsite urbanization).====Based on the regression results, we find that household income, household size, education, and unobservable factors (e.g., market environment) all have significant influences on residential energy consumption. We quantify their respective contributions to energy consumption change and find that urbanization increases per capita energy consumption by 118?kg coal equivalent (kgce), increases electricity and gas by 21 kgce and 85 kgce, and decreases coal by 58 kgce. Interestingly, we find that offsite urbanization increases energy consumption by 167 kgce while onsite urbanization decreases energy usage by 15 kgce. Furthermore, we explore the possible reasons behind the findings.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the survey data and compares energy consumption between urban and rural households. ==== describes the empirical estimation strategy and presents the regression results. ==== simulates residential energy consumption change under urbanization scenarios. ==== repeats the empirical analysis with offsite and onsite urbanization distinguished. ==== concludes.",Does urbanization increase residential energy use?

Using a manual dataset of economic growth targets in 230 Chinese cities during 2003¨C2016, we find that economic growth targets of governments curb public service expenditure on education, science and technology and this distortion results in the stagnation of human capital and technological progress, constraining long-term economic growth. When the growth target size of cities exceeds that of higher-level governments or if governments overfulfill their growth target tasks, then public service expenditure will decrease. We interpret the empirical findings as evidence that promotion evaluation based on economic performance distorts the composition of public expenditure, hinders sustainable economic development, and even accelerates the start of an economic downturn. Our study adds significant evidence to the theoretical literature emphasizing that the official evaluation system and public service could affect business cycle.","More often than not, governments at all levels in China set economic growth targets at the beginning of each year and are likely to focus on achieving this growth target throughout the year. The local officials refer to the targets of high-level governments when they set economic growth targets. And the official of cities cannot learn the provincial target in advance of the public announcement in provincial official government documents. We thoroughly interpret the economic growth target from four aspects: the size of the target, the overweight of the target relative to the targets of higher-level governments, the strength of constraints to achieving the target, and the actual completion of the target. ==== shows the trend of the economic growth targets of the governments of cities, provinces (====), and the center (====) and changes in the gap between cities and provinces or the center over the period 2002¨C2016. We observe that cities have the highest economic targets, followed by provincial targets, while the center has the smallest.====The probability of promotion of local officials increases with local economic growth (====). Furthermore, local officials can intervene in the Chinese economy (====; ====). In addition, fiscal decentralization aggravates the distortion of public expenditure by triggering government regulation of the economy (====). After the tax-sharing reform in 1994, fiscal decentralization increases local governments' expenditure responsibilities and decreases their revenue capacities (====; ====). Infrastructure construction is conducive to increasing local fiscal revenue as well as achieving high and rapid economic growth. The preference by local officials for infrastructure-type projects rather than public service projects further distorts the composition of public expenditure.==== provide reasonable evidence for the existence of promotion competition mainly for cities within the same province, which means that a city's growth target overweight is largely constrained by the overweight of other cities within the same province, and the overweight variable might be endogenous. By employing instrumental variable (IV) regression, we obtain more accurate results.====One contribution of our study is that we manually collect policy information from official government documents and websites of 230 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2016 to generate a panel dataset with other characteristic economic indicators. For economic growth targets, we comprehensively extract the characteristic data, including the size of the target set by cities, provinces, and the center, the ratio of hard constraints to achieve the target, and the actual value of economic growth. A hard constraint means that government documents use vocabulary of ¡°above¡±, ¡°ensure¡± and ¡°strive¡± that conveys the government's strong desire to fulfill its target, such as ¡°above the growth target¡±, ¡°ensure the growth target¡± and ¡°strive for the growth target¡± in official government documents. On the other hand, existing empirical research on the composition of public expenditure is mainly based on cross-country or regional-level data (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). By contrast, our data are more microscopic and can more precisely reflect the impact of growth target on public expenditure. In addition, we control ten factors that might affect public expenditure other than growth target. These data of factors can help avoid unobservable variable bias and more accurately examine the impact of growth target on public service expenditure.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== sums up the institutional background and features of economic growth targets. ==== describes the data and variables. ==== examines the relationship between the size, overweight, and completion of economic growth targets and public service expenditure of education, science and technology, and analyzes the decision-making process for the target and the influence path of target decision-making. ==== further studies the role of the transition of the Chinese economy.

In particular, we examine whether children are enrolled in school on a timely basis according to their age when their parents are away. We found both theoretical and empirical evidence to support that parental migration generates a strong positive impact on timely enrollment if a child is from a less wealthy background. However, the effect decreases with family ====, and reverses after reaching a threshold; we find this point using family house size as our proxy and the turning point occurs at a moderate size of approximately 148 square meters. In addition, we find a compensating effect that migrants tend to spend more on a child's education investment to offset for the loss of parental time care. Lastly, we found the overall impact of parental migration is negative on the timely enrollment of child. Thus, with the important heterogeneities attributed to wealth, our results suggest that the left behind children of more affluent parents may be pushed into worse human capital outcomes; given the rapid development of China, it may be the case that the current cohort of left behind children is less likely to be enrolled in school than earlier cohorts.","Human capital gaps originating at a young age can widen and contribute to a lifetime of income inequality (====; ====; ====; ====). Though both investments in time and funding for human capital development are crucial, recent studies have shown that active parental time inputs are of first-order importance for children at early ages, relative to resource investments (====; ====; ====). Nevertheless, studies of parental time with children often focus on the intensive margin and do not allow for differential impacts by resource endowments.====Such results are often difficult to extend to a developing economy with a large migrating population and considerable disparities in wealth. In these contexts, parents often have to migrate to gain resources, which leads to the need to study the extensive margin adjustment. Furthermore, some are migrating from dire ==== conditions while others are coming from more comfortable means.====This study estimates the impact of parental migration, an extensive margin loss of parental time, on China's rural left behind children's school enrollment. We focus on the crucial question as to how sensitive the impact is based on the family's wealth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the impact of family wealth on children's human capital outcomes in a parental migration context. Our results reconcile the growing yet inconclusive arguments on the overall (net) impact of China's rural-urban migration on children in recent years by showing that sample selection with small differences in wealth can produce large difference in estimated outcomes.====In the theoretical section, we construct a model that identifies two channels through which parental migration affects human capital outcomes. The first is the compensating channel. Human capital production of a child requires both financial resources and time investments. A migrating parent will compensate for the inevitable lump-sum loss of parental time care by spending extra resource investments on children. Second, there is a heterogeneous wealth effect which derives from the diminishing marginal product of resource investments. The intuition is as follows: as less wealthy families are not able to spend large amounts of resources on their child's development, additional funding they can garner through migration for work can provide large marginal returns. Meanwhile, families with higher wealth status find that additional resource investment coming from migrating parents provides lower marginal returns which makes it harder to cover the impact from loss of time care. In other words, optimization and diminishing marginal products of both inputs predict that the additional funding of wealthier immigrants will not be able to offset the time lost to their children.====We find strong empirical evidence of both the compensating channel and heterogeneous wealth effect using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1997 to 2015. In terms of descriptive evidence in our sample, migrant families tend to be wealthier, measured by house size, and there is considerable heterogeneity; thus, the overall impact of migration on education is an empirical question. Using house size of 148 square meters as a cutoff, we found that migrants from below the cutoff line have children who are more likely to be enrolled in school on a timely basis than their non-migrant counterparts. However, the impact decreases as the family gets wealthier. We see this when the effect reverses for wealthier families who are above the cutoff. When we introduce a set of individual and community level observables, migration, and its interaction with house size, the impact of migration is persistently significant. In addition, we see some of the heterogeneous wealth effect operating through other variables which provide, on net, evidence of the wealth effect turning to a negative effect.====To test for the compensating effect, we use whether the child takes a bus to school as an approximation of resource investments showing that parents are sending students to schools farther away and paying for their transportation. This empirical evidence suggests that children with migrating parents from lower wealth households are 32% more likely to take bus to school, supporting the theory's prediction.====Lastly, to put our empirical work in the context of the current research on the net effects of migration, we estimate the overall impact of migration. Our results suggest that migration impact human capital of children, on net, in a negative manner. However, once controlling for other observables, the effect drops out. This shows the sensitivity of estimations of migration. It also provides robustness support that despite such sensitivity, our main heterogeneous wealth effect remains.====We are able to suggest that policymakers should support the left behind children at the lower end of the wealth distribution as they are more likely to be in school, but to remain aware that higher wealth migrants may not be helping their children. For these families, policies that allow children to move with their parents and relaxing the constraints of the ==== system may be a way to boost parental time inputs.====To address selection issues and inherent ",Does wealth matter?

We exploit government-induced variations in aggregate enrollment rates as our ====. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we find a substantial positive effect of military service on off-farm wage employment and earnings for men of rural origin, which is comparable in magnitude to the estimated returns to a college education in China. We also provide evidence that the earnings premium is likely to be explained by improved access to urban formal employment, political and human capital accumulation. However, in spite of the off-farm employment gain for all cohorts, we find that the positive earnings premium of military service is mainly concentrated among the pre-1970 cohort.","Military service has been seen as a pervasive and influential experience in men's lives and may affect a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes (====; ====In China, the large urban-rural divide is the main structural determinant of income inequality (====). Rural individuals, who have been denied access to quality education and urban employment due to the ==== system, in general have worse labor market prospects than urban individuals (====). Serving in the military can provide an important economic opportunity for rural youths for several reasons. First, veterans are given priority hiring status and are sometimes assigned urban jobs directly in the public sector when their military service has been completed; in this way, rural veterans can also convert from rural to urban ==== status (====). Second, military experience has been widely regarded as a quasi-political credential in China, which may be turned into economic benefits in the off-farm labor market. Third, the formal and informal learning opportunities offered in the military may improve the human capital stock of rural youth and enhance their subsequent labor market outcomes. Fourth, veteran status can be viewed as a screening or certification device; thus, military-related networks and signaling can also translate into a wage premium for rural people who generally have lower education.====However, in recent years public interest in military service seems to have decreased in rural China, most likely due to increased access to and increasing returns to education and greater rural-urban ====. Thus, from a policy perspective, it is essential to understand the role of military service in determining the rural-urban transition for rural people and track changes in the returns across cohorts in rural China. This analysis may have important implications for policies on the military recruitment and the welfare of military veterans in China.====There is no consensus about the labor market consequences of military service in the literature on developed countries.==== Many studies find varying degrees of negative earnings effect of military service, primarily due to the lower value of military experience than working experience in the civilian labor market. ==== shows that white Vietnam-era veterans had lower earnings than non-veterans, while ==== find that the veteran earnings penalty diminished to zero by the early 1990s, as they had more labor-market experience. Similarly, ==== find that World War II veterans earned no more than, and sometimes even less than, non-veterans. ==== also find a negative effect of peacetime compulsory military service on earnings in the Netherlands. In contrast, two recent studies by ==== and ==== find no impact of peacetime compulsory military service on earnings for British and German conscripts.====Several studies show some evidence that military service can lead to positive earnings outcomes for disadvantaged youth in developed countries (====; ====; ====; ====). ==== find that voluntary military service in the early 1980s led to higher employment rates and a modest increase in earnings for nonwhite veterans after service in the United States. ==== estimate a positive earnings premium of 5% for African-American veterans. ==== also find that peacetime conscription increased wages by 5% for men with only a primary school education, but had zero effect for men with higher education in Portugal. However, none of the above studies speak directly to the mechanisms underlying the veteran premium.====In this paper, we study the impact of military service on off-farm wage employment, earnings, and other labor market outcomes for men of rural origin, based on a nationally representative sample from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2010¨C2016. Identifying the causal effect of military service is made difficult by the selective nature of military service. One selection effect is that recruits are positively selected among registered conscripts according to physical and political criteria and other military requirements, which may lead to an overestimation of the returns to military service. Another selection effect is the self-selection of veterans. Poor rural youth may choose to enlist because they have lower expectations for educational attainment, future earnings, and job prospects, which can induce a negative bias in estimating the returns to military service.====Following the literature, we exploit variations in the aggregate enrollment rates induced by government decisions concerning the number of recruits needed in different years as the ====. In the 1970s¨C2000s, there were two main sources of demand-side variation in the aggregate rate of military enrollment. First, in order to focus on economic development and improve the quality of the military forces in an era of peace, the government reduced the size of the military by one million in 1980, one million in 1982, one million in 1985¨C1987, half a million in 1997, and 0.2 million in 2003. Second, during this period, China was also involved in several small-scale wars and battles. These events could have led to variation in demand for military recruits over time, but were uncorrelated with individuals' unobserved characteristics that might affect labor market outcomes.====This paper has several interesting findings and contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, to our knowledge, this paper is among the first to examine the role of military service in the labor transition from the farm sector to the off-farm sector in developing countries. We find a substantial positive effect of military service on off-farm wage employment and earnings for men of rural origin, which is comparable in magnitude to the estimated returns to a college education in China.====To shed some light on the declining interest in joining the military in China, we also investigate the cohort differences in the returns to military service. The results show that military service leads to higher off-farm employment rates for rural veterans from all cohorts; most of the earnings premium associated with military service appears to be concentrated among the pre-1970 cohorts. For the post-1970 cohorts, despite no observed earnings premium, military service still has a positive return in the off-farm labor market when fringe and non-pecuniary benefits are taken into account.====Second, the mechanisms through which military service has a wage premium for disadvantaged youths are not well understood in the literature. The rich information in the data allows us to thoroughly explore how military service affects off-farm wage earnings through a variety of possible channels. We provide evidence that the returns to military service in off-farm wage employment for rural veterans is likely to be explained by improved access to urban formal employment, political and human capital accumulation.====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== shows that education has played a significant role in increasing urban formal employment for rural people in the late 1970s and early 1980 when rural people were prohibited from moving to urban areas. With the gradual relaxation of administrative restrictions on labor mobility, ==== find that rural individuals with more education had increasing access to off-farm jobs and higher wages. ==== estimated an average return to education of 6.4% in off-farm wage employment in rural China. In this paper, we provide evidence that military service is another important mechanism through which rural youth obtain more opportunities off the farm and improve their socioeconomic status.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the institutional background of military service in China. Section 3 outlines the potential theoretical implications of military service on off-farm job access and earnings for rural people. Section 4 explains our ==== and estimation strategy. Section 5 describes the data and variables used in the analysis. Section 6 presents the main results and discusses potential mechanisms and cohort trend.

Using data from the Hong Kong Population Censuses, we find that both Mandarin and English language skills are linked to improved labor market performance, and the premiums for English are much larger than those for Mandarin. We further show that the sovereignty transfer of Hong Kong from the UK to China in 1997 has strengthened the positive role of Mandarin and English language skills in finding a job in Hong Kong. The political change has also increased the earnings of people with the ability to speak Mandarin. As a comparison, the earnings premium for speaking English has declined in magnitude after the sovereignty transfer. Investigating into the mechanisms, we show that the rising premiums for Mandarin language skills are operated through choices of occupations and ==== sectors. Our findings suggest that important political changes can affect the economic returns to language skills in the labor market.","Language skills, as an important form of human capital, may have a positive influence on labor market outcomes. The beneficial impact can be direct in the form of more efficient job research or higher productivity on the job, and it can also operate through indirect channels such as reduced employer discrimination (====). Previous studies have shown that English language skills, widely used in international communication, can generate premiums in the labor market in non-English speaking countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Other studies have found positive economic returns to speaking the host language among immigrants for whom the host language is not their native language (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In the Chinese context, previous studies have investigated the economic returns to speaking Mandarin (====; ====), English proficiency (====; ====; ====; ====) and speaking local dialects (====; ====).====Although the importance of language skills in labor market competition has been increasingly realized and studied, the existing studies have not considered the potential impact of the changes in language structure. In the presence of globalization, the spread of languages is common with increased international business activities. Such language spread is related to business opportunities, productivity and then income and employment. The home language of a region is generally stable, but the introduction of second languages into a region may possibly reflect the social changes and generate structural variations in language-skill premiums in labor market. Based on this consideration, this paper studies the effects of language skills on labor market outcomes with a particular interest in the economic premiums for languages associated with important political influence.====; ====; ====; ====), this issue of second-language skills is important in policy implications because an adoption of external languages can be a result of the balancing between cultural identity and economic interests.====In this paper, we use data from the Hong Kong Population Censuses 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 for our analysis. As the overwhelming major of residents in Hong Kong speak Cantonese as their native language, we focus on this group of people to obtain a relatively homogenous sample. As the sovereignty transfer can result in important demographic changes such the inflows of immigrant from the mainland of China, we restrict our attention to long-term residents in Hong Kong. Specifically, in our estimation sample we only include those who resided in Hong Kong before the handover and have continued to be a resident in Hong Kong after the sovereignty transfer. This practice helps alleviate the bias from the endogenous population movements induced by the major political change. After imposing these sample restrictions, we identify how their second language skills (Mandarin and English) affect their labor market performance in Hong Kong.====Our empirical analysis show that overall both Mandarin and English language skills are linked to improved labor market outcomes in Hong Kong, and the premiums for English are much larger than those for Mandarin. There is evidence that the sovereignty transfer has strengthened the positive effects of Mandarin and English language skills in finding a job in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the political change in 1997 has improved monthly earnings associated with the ability to speak Mandarin. In contrast, while those who can speak English as a second language can still enjoy an earnings premium for this language skill after the handover, the premium has declined in magnitude when compared with that before the sovereignty transfer. Furthermore, we find evidence of heterogeneity in the premiums to language skills by age groups and gender. Investigating into the mechanism for the increased post-handover premium for Mandarin language skills, we show that, after the handover, ==== sectors and occupations that have a comparatively higher demand of employees with Mandarin language skills pay higher wages to workers with Mandarin-speaking abilities.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

How market power is exercised depends on the curvature of the abatement cost function. If the marginal abatement cost function of buyers (sellers) is less steep than that of sellers (buyers), the price of permits is lower (higher) than that under perfect competition. This is because the market power of buyers (sellers) exceeds that of sellers (buyers). The price of permits is close to the perfect competitive price when all traders have the sameslope of the marginal abatement cost function.","Market power in emissions trading has been extensively investigated because emerging markets for tradable emissions permits, such as the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), can be dominated by relatively few large sellers or buyers. ====; ====). Based on this background, reducing market power in permit trading is an important policy issue.====Using a laboratory experiment, our objective in this paper is to test the performance of an emissions trading market utilizing a double auction in a bilateral oligopoly. The issue we address is the robustness of how a double auction mitigates market power in emissions trading. Until now, many researchers have empirically analyzed market power in a double auction market (====; ====), and the adverse impact of market power has been an important issue for theoretical analyses of permit trading (====).====Prior to emissions trading, the administrator is required to determine the initial endowment of permits, which may exacerbate the adverse impact of market power on efficiency. However, the literature on laboratory experiments of double auctions indicates that a double auction could achieve an efficient outcome even if dominant traders exert market power. If that is the case, the administrator should apply a double auction to emissions trading. To investigate how a double auction affects market power in emissions trading, ====compared the market outcome between a double auction and a revenue neutral auction in a laboratory experiment of emissions trading. They revealed that a double auction could reduce market power more than a revenue neutral auction. Furthermore, ====Although the literature on laboratory experiments of emissions trading reveals the effectiveness of double auctions, it focuses on traditional models of imperfect competition, which assume market power either on the sellers' side or on the buyers' side. In fact, some studies have noted that a double auction may not achieve an efficient outcome if the market in question cannot be well described by a traditional model of imperfect competition (====; ====). Thus, the important research question is whether a double auction curbs market power in emissions trading where both sellers and buyers can exert market power.====In contrast to the experimental literature on market power, the benchmark for the experiment in our study is derived from theoretical bilateral oligopoly models for emissions trading, including a share auction (SA) model, a noncompetitive equilibrium (NCE) model, and a supply function equilibrium (SFE) model. The SA model was developed by ====, Section 6, who applied the uniform price auction for multiple units in ==== to emissions trading. The NCE model was developed by ====, who applied the slope-taking equilibrium of ==== to emissions trading. The SFE model was developed by ====, who applied the supply function equilibrium models of ==== and of ==== to emissions trading. These models have the potential to better describe the real behavior of emissions trading because previous studies of laboratory experiments that analyzed the imperfect competitive situation of emissions trading have already shown that the traditional model cannot explain market outcomes well. Almost all laboratory experiments of tradable permits consist of a limited number of sellers and buyers. Therefore, the model of bilateral oligopoly is more suitable for the analysis of market power in the laboratory experiment of tradable permits.====Although theoretical models that focus on bilateral oligopoly have already been developed in the literature, there is little empirical analysis of the extent to which these models can predict actual trading in the permit market. ==== investigated whether a SFE model can predict permit trading in a laboratory experiment. They focused only on the SFE model in their analysis of bilateral oligopoly and did not employ a double auction. In contrast, this study treats alternative models of bilateral oligopoly in emissions trading markets, such as SFE, SA and NCE models, and applies a double auction to emissions trading. The model of bilateral oligopoly can also apply to understand the energy related market. Therefore, it is the crucial researcher that we test the model how much well describe actual trading behavior.==== presents theoretical bilateral oligopoly models in an emissions trading market, and it summarizes the research questions addressed in the laboratory experiment. ==== describes the experimental design and theoretical predictions of alternative bilateral oligopoly models. ==== presents the results of the experiment, and ==== concludes the analysis.

Within these cities, the housing affordability problem leads to longer commuting time due to the separation of home and workplace, and lower housing space consumption for the residents.","In addition to cross-city comparison on housing affordability, it is equally important to understand the spatial distribution of housing affordability ==== a city. Given that workspaces are more spatially agglomerated than homes, housing unaffordability near workspaces may discourage home purchase near workspaces, thus creating social problems such as congestion and long commuting time. However, no existing literature has documented within-city distribution of housing affordability possibly due to data inaccessibility.====It is also important to examine affordability for renters because the conditions may substantially differ for renters and homeowners. For example, ==== found little evidence of increasing housing unaffordability for owner-occupied housing in the U.S., but pronounced increases in the rent burdens for poor households. Even though the homeownership rate at the national level exceeded 78.95% in urban China according to the 2010 population census, the share of renters is still high in first- and second-tier cities.==== However, little literature studies the renters' housing affordability in China so far.====In this study, we fill the literature gap by providing a new and comprehensive overview of housing affordability in urban China. Specifically, we use the ¡°housing expenditure to income ratio¡± to measure housing affordability, which is defined as the ratio of repayment to income for homeowners, and the ratio of rent to income for renters. Based on several unique datasets, we not only extend the scope of the analysis to all Chinese cities at the macro level, but also provide micro-level analysis within a major city. In addition, we investigate the potential consequences of the affordability problem. The key findings are in three folds, as follows.====First, we provide the first affordability measurement covering almost all cities at prefecture level or above in mainland China. The results suggest that the overall level of housing affordability in Chinese cities remained relatively stable or even improved during the sample period between 2014 and 2018. For about 90% of cities, covering about 75% of the urban population in China, the overall housing affordability condition was acceptable during the whole sample period, for both homeowners and renters. We also point out that the previous literature might overestimate the affordability problem owing to sample selection bias.====Second, however, we highlight a serious affordability problem associated with a few superstar cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Xiamen. In 2018, the ratio between expenditures on housing and household income for homeowners in these superstar cities reached a historical peak of 1.29. Furthermore, the micro-level analysis, based on an anonymous superstar city in the sample, suggests that the actual affordability conditions are even worse than that revealed by the city-level data, especially when the spatial mismatch between job and residential locations is considered. Our further analysis points out that such a serious affordability problem results from both a shortage of supply in the space market and a potential mispricing in the asset market. We also provide evidence that this affordability problem has spread to surrounding cities, especially after these superstar cities started to curb home purchases from 2010.====Third, based on the micro-level analysis, we shed light on two of the most direct economic consequences of low housing affordability in the superstar cities. The housing affordability problem leads to longer commuting time within these superstar cities due to the separation between home and workplace. Meanwhile, urban households in working places with worse housing affordability have to choose smaller dwelling units to control their housing expenditure.====This study contributes to the growing body of literature on Chinese housing problems. Most existing housing affordability analyses in China have focused on a number of major cities (====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====; ====). However, we believe that a comprehensive understanding of housing affordability status, including both the overall conditions of all cities and the unique features of superstar cities, is of paramount policy importance in the further development of Chinese housing markets. The study also makes a methodological contribution to the housing affordability literature. In particular, this study is among one of the first housing affordability measures and analyses based on micro-level data.==== Finally, we contribute to the emerging field of economic and social consequences associated with deteriorating housing affordability (====; ====; ====; ====) by providing new empirical evidence in the context of a developing economy.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The following Section 2 provides institutional background on China's urban housing sector. The data and housing affordability indicator adopted in the analysis are described in Section 3. Section 4 presents and discusses the results on city-level affordability measures for all cities, and Section 5 highlights the affordability problems, as well as the potential consequences, in one of the superstar cities based on the micro-level analysis. Section 6 concludes the paper.====In order to investigate the potential effect of the gap between listing prices and transaction prices on our results, we collect micro-level housing resale transaction data from a leading brokerage company in China. This dataset covers all resale units sold by this brokerage company between 2014 and 2018 in 21 major cities, namely, Beijing, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Dongguan, Foshan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Hefei, Jinan, Langfang, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Yantai. For each transaction, we calculate the ratio between the transaction price and the listing price. For all the 763,049 observations, the average ratio is 0.97; that is, on average the transaction price is 3% lower than the listing price. It is more important to note that, as shown in ====, the variation in the average ratio between these city-years is actually small. Therefore, using listing price, instead of transaction price, might slightly affect the level of affordability indicator calculated, but it would not affect the analysis on the temporal pattern or the city variations.",Recent housing affordability in urban China: A comprehensive overview,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301233,31-Oct-19,2019,Research Article,354

The key prediction of the model, borne out by data from Chinese provinces spanning 2004¨C2013, is that an increase in the local corporate income tax-sharing ratio, which proxies fiscal incentives offered to local governments, motivates local governments to compete for capital investment through increased public expenditure.

Local officials were therefore motivated by incentive contracts to promote local business development, which eventually increased their residual ¡°fiscal profits¡± (====). After over a decade of the ¡°fiscal contracting system,¡± in 1994 the central government launched a new round of fiscal reforms featuring a tax-sharing scheme between the central and local governments that is still in effect today. These reforms largely recentralized revenue assignments, while keeping the assignment of expenditure responsibilities virtually unchanged. As a consequence, local officials experienced mounting fiscal pressures regarding financing their expenditure needs. This added to the increase of local incentives to support business development to increase local and shared revenues.====This paper aims to explore this latter (fiscal) mechanism, that is, the strong fiscal incentives implied by the tax-sharing system (TSS) for local governments to promote investment in their jurisdictions.====The paper contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, we provide evidence that fiscal incentives offered to local governments significantly shape their policy choices, which has been the central argument of the ¡°second generation fiscal federalism¡± literature (see ==== for a review). China provides a unique institutional setting to study this issue. This is because provincial governments in China have been granted substantial discretion in determining their own tax-sharing rules within their borders, which has given rise to a high level of variation in sub-provincial treatments. This variation is so substantial that it creates wide-ranging incentive effort for local governments to attract investment. In this regard, we also contribute to the literature by proposing a more accurate measure to capture fiscal incentives offered to local governments ¡ª the actual tax-sharing ratio at the ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, the role of fiscal decentralization in providing incentives for local officials to compete for capital investment has not been directly tested. In this respect, our paper is among the first to explicitly establish the relationship between provincial tax-sharing rules and investment rates in the provinces.

To deal with the endogeneity of parental education, we exploit Taiwan's educational reform in 1968 making education compulsory up to the ninth grade. Based on a uniquely large and detailed administrative data set from Taiwan, our results show that the average education level of mothers is positively related to the male ratio at birth, both in the case of high-parity births and when mothers are at least 30?years old.","The International Center for Research on Women reports that the link between female education and gender bias is far from clear (====). On the one hand, researchers find that the acquisition of low levels of education, as opposed to no education, may give women the means to more efficiently put into practice deep-rooted gender preferences (====; ====; ====). Therefore, in areas with low levels of education, we may observe that female disadvantage in natality is more pronounced among educated mothers as opposed to uneducated mothers. On the other hand, once a higher-level education threshold (e.g., tertiary education) is achieved, higher demand for male children will be appeased (====). Coalescing these two ideas, ==== suggest that the relationship between female disadvantage in natality and parental education can be non-monotonic. In particular, they hypothesize that the sex ratio at birth (male births per female births) is increasing at a decreasing rate until a threshold level of education is reached, at which point this relationship reverses: that is, the sex ratio imbalance declines with more education.====However, it is not easy to identify the causal effect of parental education on gender bias, because the direct measures of parental education are endogenous. To illustrate, consider a woman who decides to acquire more education to improve her socioeconomic status. The returns to this decision ultimately would depend on both the level of education attained and her unobserved innate qualities (e.g., ability, charisma, and beauty). Hence, the returns to education will be biased upward by these unobserved factors. A similar relationship may be found between education and preference for sons. While it may appear that education causes mothers to break away from more traditional roles (====), it is possible that educated women have pre-existing traits that cause them to acquire more education and to have a more equal-gender-role stance. Thus, while it may look as if education decreases the probability of having a male child, this relationship is likely to be spurious.====It is also possible that omitted variable bias would attenuate the effect of parental education on the probability of having a male child. For instance, one of the most cherished virtues in Confucianism, a tradition deeply rooted in many of the Asian countries with a high male ratio, is the concept of filial piety (or filial obedience). According to Mencius (a Chinese philosopher and ardent interpreter of Confucianism), the greatest unfilial behavior is to provide no male heirs. Confucianism also prescribes that the three most important human relationships are rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives. This suggests an inherent ranking that subordinates individuals to their rulers, sons to fathers, and women to men (====). Under this patrilineal kinship system, family lineage and property are passed from fathers to sons, and the desire for male heirs is likely to materialize in the form of female disadvantage in natality. ==== dissects the impacts of Confucianism on Chinese reproductive behavior, pointing out that in pre-modern China it was in fact the more educated people who received more education about Confucianism. Hence, the relationship between education and the demand for male children may be affected by the interaction between traditional roles and education. That is, if education and tradition are passed from one generation to another, then we may find that education is positively correlated with the demand for male children. But, once again, this relationship may not necessarily be causal.====In this paper, we attempt to identify the causal effect of parental education on the male ratio at birth, which is defined as the ratio of male births divided by total live births. We first outline a simple model of the demand for children.==== Then, we use Birth Certificate Records from Taiwan to test the main predictions of this model. We rely on the exogenous increase in parental education resulting from Taiwan's educational reform of 1968 making education compulsory up to the ninth grade. The parental birth date determines exposure to that reform; both the parental birth date and differential rates of school openings by county of residence provide sources of variation to aid our identification.====Our empirical results show that a mother's education has no effect on the male ratio of her children when she gives a birth before the age of 30, but has a significant positive effect on this outcome when she is at least 30?years old. Second, a mother's education has no effect on the male ratio of her first or second children, but has a significant positive effect on the male ratio at the third birth parity====Consider the unitary model of the family proposed by ====. Let ==== represent the utility function of parents. ==== is a function of the expected return from children, ====, and abortion usage, ====.==== Hence, parental utility can be represented by the following utility function:====, ====, and ==== are given exogenously. In particular, ==== is parental schooling, ==== is parents' optimal number of children and is assumed to be a deterministic function of time ==== such that ====/====?<?0. While the optimal number of children is also likely to be a function of parental characteristics, for simplicity we assume that the optimal number of children is agreed upon before the formation of the family. Finally, ==== is the availability of technology that permits the effective practice of gender driven abortion (i.e., the availability of technology that helps to determine the gender of the fetus and legal pregnancy termination). We assume that parents derive utility from the returns from children (====/====?>?0) and disutility from abortion usage (====/====?<?0).==== Furthermore, we assume that the utility derived from the returns from children is independent of the level of abortion usage (====/====?=?0).====The expected return from children is defined as:====where ====?>?0 is the return from the male child; ====?=?==== ¨C ==== is the return from the female child, and ==== is the differential cost of having a female child; ====?=?====(====) is the number of boys; ====?=?====(1¨C====(====)) is the number of girls; and ====(====) is the proportion of males born to the couple, a linearly increasing function of abortion usage (====/====?>?0 and ====/====?=?0). Clearly, ====?=?====?+?====, and ====?=?¡Æ==== (====). Without loss of generality, we can assume that the return from having a girl is different from the return from having a boy, or ====?¡Ù?0. In particular, we hypothesize that ==== captures the extra cost or benefit associated with having a female child and is a function of both parental education and the proportion of boys, or ====(====,====(====)) and ====/====, ====/====?<?0. If ====?>?0, the extra cost of having a female child, ====, for example, may reflect the fact that when parents expect to follow patriarchal and/or virilocal rules, their private return to investments in their daughters' health or education is expected to be lower than their private return to investments in their sons (====).====We begin by assuming that parental education is fixed at ====. For example, in the case of Taiwan, primary education was compulsory before the education reform of 1968, hence it is reasonable to claim that baseline individuals had at least a primary education. Then, ==== is a low level of education, but it is higher than no education at all.====Given the concavity of ====, the optimal level of abortion usage is the solution to the following first order condition (====):====At the optimum, parents choose their level of abortion usage up to the point where the aggregate net disutility from abortion usage just equals the net utility from the extra return from having another boy.====Assuming that the natural probability of having a boy is equal to that of having a girl, if the abortion technology required to practice gender selection does not exist, then the expected return from having children is simply equal to 1/2?====[====?+?====]. That is, the more and the less educated parents on average should have equal chances of having a male child when they are unable to influence the gender of their children. Moreover, regardless of their level of education, parents should have a 50% chance of having a male child and a 50% chance of having a female child. Nevertheless, under this scenario, the preference for sons is likely to manifest itself through higher probabilities of survival for boys relative to girls (see ====; ====).====When there is an exogenous increase in education, say from ==== to ====, and the technology to select an infant's sex is available, the effective or perceived return from having girls is closer to the return from having boys only if education is negatively related to male gender bias. In other words, the extra cost or loss from having a girl decreases with higher education (==== < 0). From the optimality condition and the concavity of ==== it is clear that, relative to the baseline case, parents now would choose to have fewer gender related abortions; hence, they are more likely to have fewer boys. More educated parents will abort less, but they may continue to abort as long as the difference between the return from a male child is sufficiently higher than the return from a female child, such that the aggregate net disutility from abortion usage equals the net utility from the extra return to having another boy. The opposite will be true if education is positively related to son preference (==== > 0).====Now, let's assume that, ceteris paribus, ==== increases. Since ====/====?<?0, this implies that ==== decreases. By the implicit function theorem, we have====It follows that, when ====?¡Ù?0, as the number of optimal children falls, ceteris paribus, the number of gender related abortions increases. Under this scenario and the assumption of preference for sons (====?>?0), ceteris paribus, mothers who have delayed parenting are more likely to abort female fetuses than mothers who have not. This can be expressed as (==== > 0).====Now, let's assume that there exists an optimal level of education ==== such that ====(====)?=?0. Under this scenario, parents will have no incentive to choose ====?¡Ù?0; hence ====?=?0 whenever ====. Similarly, ==== implies that whenever ====(====)?=?0 we also have ====?=??==== ====?=?0. That is, regardless of what their optimal number of children is, optimizing parents will not resort to abortion for the purpose of selecting the gender of their children.",The quantity of education and preference for sons: Evidence from Taiwan's compulsory education reform,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301300,30-Oct-19,2019,Research Article,357

The identification uses the energy regulation of the 11th Five-Year Plan implemented in 2006. We show that tighter energy regulation leads to a significant energy intensity decrease and that firms switch their energy structure from using dirty fossil energy to a cleaner one. We also examine the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and find that the rising R&D inputs and increasing energy consumption ratio of high energy efficient firms are the mainly two reasons.","Through a forecasting framework ====, find that environmental governance constraints can transform China's energy structure and thus CO==== emissions and coal demand can be reduced. ==== assess the Two Control Zones policy which restrict the SO==== emissions in the target region. They find that the policy is inefficient for more polluting firms closing in targeted regions and opening in non-targeted regions. ==== study whether the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) was effective for controlling water pollutants. They find pollution-intensive activity decreases in areas with more stringent regulation and increases in lower regulated areas. ====Several researchers assess the effect of Top-1000 energy-consuming enterprises program. ==== evaluate the performance of iron and steel sector from 2006 to 2010 and find that the closing outdated facilities and more advanced technology are the main two reasons leading to energy saving. ==== find that energy intensity decreases significantly during the 11th FYP period. ==== find that Top-1000 program works well and besides energy saving, it can also reduce CO==== emissions by 450 Mt. However, due to data limitation, literature above only makes a descriptive analysis at the aggregate level. ==== analyze whether Top-1000 program has influence on firms' export performance and find that the program facilitates the export activities and increase firms' international competitiveness. But due to the lack of energy consumption data, they haven't analyzed whether the program is effective with respect to firms' energy intensity.====Another strand of literature focuses on the determinants of energy intensity. Higher energy price may motivate companies to reduce energy intensity (====; ====; ====; ====). By contrast, low energy price controlled by Chinese government is one of the main obstacles for energy intensity reduction (====). Urbanization and industrialization also play significant roles in affecting energy intensity (====). Meanwhile, Chinese past energy intensity reduction was mainly attributed to higher energy efficiency (====) and China still has much potencial to reduce energy intensity by transforming its energy structure (====). Moreover, different sectors and regions exhibit heterogeneity in productivity improvement and environmental performance. ==== find that industrial wastewater emissions reduction in coastal areas, and economic performance improvement in the central and west regions are the main contributing factors of Chinese increasing productivity. Meanwhile, Technological innovation mainly takes place in the coastal provinces, and economic performance and environmental performance are negatively correlated in the west areas. Using a micro-level data, ==== further find the firm-level heterogeneity in corporate financial and environmental performance. A large number of technical innovators are found in the textile, paper, steel, and computer industries.====Although some literature above has studied the effect of government regulation or the factors influencing energy intensity, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature quantitatively analyzing the effect of government regulation on energy intensity. Besides, mechanisms of how regulation influence firms' behavior are rarely analyzed in existing literature. This paper differs from previous literature in several dimensions.====First, we empirically exam the effect of government regulation on energy intensity and structure. The 11th (2006¨C2010) Five-Year Plan (FYP), as the first binding target for Chinese energy intensity, offers a compelling setting to exam the efficacy of Chinese energy regulations on energy intensity. In China, binding targets refer to the criteria through which central government assess the provincial governments' performance, just like KPI (Key Performance Indicator). The ==== of local officials is directly linked with whether they complete the binding targets. Although before 2006, there were several energy saving regulations, they were all not binding. Therefore before 2006, local officials actually had no incentive to fulfill those targets, which made it hard to assess regulation's efficacy. Besides, in the 11th FYP there was a national target of 20% energy intensity reduction, and central government decomposed it into the province-level targets. Generally, provinces with higher energy intensity were subject to higher reduction target. Local officers' promotion was also related to their compliance with these targets, which facilitate local governments to make efforts to meet these targets. In addition, the Chinese FYPs are one of the most important development guidelines. Several subprojects, such as the Top-1000 Program, were also implemented to help achieving this plan. All the programs and plans indicate China's resolute determination in energy saving and energy transformation. Besides the 11th FYP, we also construct the environmental-related word ratio of government work reports as the proxy of energy regulation to do a robustness test.====Second, this paper pays much attention to the mechanisms of how energy regulation influences energy intensity. Energy intensity is directly correlated with firms' productivity. And according to ==== and ====, change in aggregate productivity can be decomposed into within-firm effect and between-firm effect. The former effect emphasizes the technological improvement of the enterprise itself. The latter effect comes from two mainly sources: market share reallocation among surviving firms, and the entry of new producers and the exit of old ones. Following this way, we decompose the reduction of firm's energy intensity into three components: technological improvement of firms themselves, selection dynamics and energy share reallocation. With respect to the technological improvement channel, energy regulation will encourage firms to develop green and more efficient technology and thus decrease their energy intensity. The selection dynamics channel indicates that energy regulation may encourage the entry of new producers which have lower energy intensity and the exit of old ones which have higher energy intensity. Energy share reallocation may also contribute to the aggregate reduction of energy intensity if those high energy efficient firms consume more energy relative to the low ones. Therefore, we test whether the energy regulation influence firms' energy intensity through the three channels above.====Third, this paper presents a systematic evaluation of China's energy regulations with a new firm-level panel dataset for the years 2003¨C2009. We collect the direct data of firm-level energy consumption, including the consumption of coal, oil and natural gas, and investigate how firms react to the stricter energy regulations. To the best of our knowledge we are unaware of a comparable dataset in existing literature.====This paper, using a difference-in-differences method, investigates the impact of the 11th FYP's binding target on energy intensity reduction and fills the gap in previous literature. Significant evidence shows that more stringent regulation leads to lower energy intensity and less coal consumption. We also analyze the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. For the within-firm effect, we find that the 11th FYP significantly encourages firms' investment in R&D and thus promote firm's productivity and reduce energy intensity. As for the between-firm effect, the mechanism of market share reallocation is proved by the estimated results while the mechanism of selection dynamics is not at work. ==== suggests that state-owned firms face softer budget constraints. In this paper, we also find the similar pattern that non-state-owned firms outperform state-owned firms under energy regulations and that firms with high energy consumption reduce their energy intensity more than firms with low energy consumption.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: ==== describes the background information about Chinese energy regulation; ==== introduces the data and the econometric methodology; ==== presents the regression results; ==== discusses the potential mechanisms; ==== conducts heterogeneity analysis; ==== do some robustness checks and ==== concludes.",The impact of energy regulation on energy intensity and energy structure: Firm-level evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301129,25-Oct-19,2019,Research Article,358

Given that the Big Five account for about 40% of Chinese banking system assets, their low efficiency potentially threatens the country's financial development and financial stability. Specific policy measures that might help raise efficiency include reducing the market share of the Big Five banks and making significant changes in governance practices.====However, the literature falls short of identifying the factors that explain this low efficiency. This gap is essentially due to a methodological limitation. Former studies are only considering the overall efficiency of Chinese banks and do not decompose it into persistent and transient component (long-term and short-term inefficiency). This distinction seems to be instrumental for understanding the Chinese banking sector. Persistent inefficiency accounts for the presence of structural problems in the bank, which include poor organization, weak management or political incentives preventing ====. Transient inefficiency is related to time-varying issues such as the adaptation to changes in the economic environment.====This distinction does reflect a common hypothesis concerning the explanation of the low efficiency of China's Big Five banks compared to other types of banks, such as foreign banks and joint-stock banks. Big Five banks would be ==== inefficient compared to other types of banks. Such an assumption entails critical policy measures, such as reducing state ownership, shrinking banks' size, reorganizing their structure, and creating profit-oriented incentives for management. If low Big Five banks' efficiency does ==== stem from structural reasons, different policy measures would be required to ensure that these banks are efficient in the short-run. Short-term adjustments such as changes in the inputs prices or temporary policy support would then be more adequate than structural transformations.====Identifying the sources of Big Five banks' inefficiency is vital for selecting the appropriate policy measures. Recent progress in efficiency methodology allows identifying the relative proportion of long-term and short-term inefficiency within the overall efficiency of banks. The objective of this study is to draw upon this novel technique to provide a new perspective on explaining the different level of efficiencies among Chinese banks. We test the hypothesis of different long-term and short-term efficiency of Chinese banks by providing a decomposition of their efficiency into its transient and persistent components. Making this distinction is instrumental for understanding the Chinese banking sector and designing appropriate policy measures.====We measure the persistent inefficiency and transient inefficiency of Chinese banks by applying the model of ==== and thus contribute to the burgeoning literature accounting for this distinction. Their approach takes advantage of the nature of panel data to decompose overall efficiency into persistent and transient components. It relies on a three-step procedure that estimates a cost function with panel data and applies the stochastic frontier approach to isolate persistent and transient inefficiency components. The model provides a major improvement to traditional stochastic frontier models in the literature on bank efficiency. Former models based on the stochastic frontier approach view inefficiency either as time-invariant (====; ====), time-invariant mixed with firm variables (====, ====) or transient only (====). The model of ==== allows us to estimate and disentangle persistent efficiency and transient efficiency.==== find that this approach provides new and more precise estimates. The persistent efficiency estimate provides a new measure of efficiency which is not related to the estimate provided by the approach of ====. The estimate of the transient inefficiency, while more closely related to the one obtained using the approach of ====, provides useful additional information on short-term inefficiency.====We consider a large and unique dataset of 166 banks for the period 2008¨C2015, including the Big Five banks, joint-stock commercial banks, city commercial banks, rural banks and foreign banks.

The accuracy of official agricultural statistics has long been questioned in China. This paper studies the linkage between agricultural production data manipulation and the Granary County Subsidy Program (GCSP). Since 2005, Chinese government gave subsidies to those counties with five-year average grain production between 1998 and 2002 more than 200 thousand tons to encourage these local governments to give priority to grain production. The prospective counties with grain production slightly below the threshold may have incentives to over-report their grain production. Based on the ===='s density test, this paper provides suggestive evidence of over-reporting grain production caused by the GCSP in 2005, 2006 and 2008, though the over-reporting rates are only 3%, 2%, and 1.7% respectively. The policy implication would be that fiscal distribution rules of a central government should avoid data manipulation incentives in local governments, particularly should cut the linkage to the data which are self-reported by the local governments.","Ensuring grain self-sufficiency has always been a priority of Chinese agricultural policies. Chinese grain production experienced decreasing trend since 1998 and the production in 2003 returned to the level in 1990. Therefore, China has taken a series of policy measures since the early 2000s in response to the rising concerns on food security. Most of measures, such as the abolition of agricultural tax, direct grain subsidy program and price intervention program, are directly targeting at farmers based on their contracted land area (====). The Granary County Subsidy Program (GCSP) was announced in April 2005 to reward the contributions of local governments to national food security. This subsidy mainly relies on whether the counties' 5-year arithmetic average grain production is >200 thousand tons on average==== between 1998 and 2002, and the commodity grain==== is >5 thousand tons. The key statistics for the policy is 200 thousand tons of grain output, as 5 thousand tons of commodity grains could be easily reached when the total production is over 200 thousand tons.====To get more fiscal distributions from the central government, it is rational for local governments to over-report their statistical data to fawn the central government's distributional rules because the grain production data is from the self-reported county level statistical yearbook. China reformed its fiscal system, and carried out the so-called revenue-sharing system in 1994, in which the central government controlled most of the revenues (====; ====; ====). The granary counties have high incentive to ¡°effortlessly¡± get the fiscal coffer even by manipulating grain data. However, exaggerating grain production may threaten food security with over-estimating grain self-sufficiency rate, and distort China's agricultural policy. Data manipulation may also undermine the government's credibility (====). This paper aims at investigating whether the Granary County Subsidy Program (GCSP) implemented in 2005 causes a dubious grain production data around the cut-off (200 thousand tons). This paper will also shed some lights on the proportion of manipulation and the characteristics of which the county is likely to manipulate data.====The accuracy of China's major statistics data generally has long been questioned. Some literature finds that (1) China's GDP is often over-reported, though the evidence is not solid (====). Recently, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia admitted that their GDP figures could have been inflated by up to 40% and such fake data mask economic rebound====; (2) China's CPI is often slightly under-reported (====; ====); (3) Food production is often over-reported, but the consumption under-reported (====; ====, ====); (4) Environmental pollution data are often under-reported (====; ====). Manipulation of food production data has led to catastrophic social and economic consequences. It is known that the big famine at the beginning of 1960s in China which caused >30 million unusual deaths was linked to manipulation of food production data in the period of the Great Leap Forward (====; ====). Due to the exaggeration of grain output, state grain procurements experienced a devastating increase and grain sown areas were also cut (====). These led to the decline in food availability and furtherly results in the big famine.====). It is comprehensible that the GCSP may lead to data manipulation. The GCSP contains three important regulations:====The subsidy did increase the fiscal coffer of the granary counties. In 2005, 958 counties shared a total amount of RMB5.5 billion subsidies from central government. The subsidy amount is capped at RMB20 million with an average of RMB 5.7 million, accounting for about 2.6% of their fiscal revenues and about 13% (a few counties are 55%) of their total subsidy increment.==== The amount of subsidy from central government increased to RMB39.3 billion in 2016, with an annual growth rate of 20%.====The central government changed the subsidy rules in 2008, perhaps realizing that the subsidy rules in 2005 might have incentivized local governments to over-reporting their grain production. In 2008, the central government declared that the subsidizing counties, in principle, remained the same as those in 2007,==== viz. the eligible counties in 2008 are the same as that in 2005¨C2007. The increased subsidies mainly went to the top 100 super granary counties, which are based on the five-year average production between 2002 and 2006. As mentioned before, three years later, the grain production data in 2005 and 2006 is actually used to distribute subsidies. Manipulating grain production data would be paid off if subsidy rules were not changed. As the list of granary counties which would receive subsidies were fixed since then, the incentives of data manipulation may disappear.====The GCSP offers us a good choice to conduct a study to see if local counties (particularly those are slightly below the threshold of 200 thousand tons) cooked their grain production data in reaction to the GCSP between 2005 and 2007. Furthermore, we can use the data after 2008 as a robust check because the subsidy rules changed.====This paper has three contributions. First, although ¡°forensic economics¡± has been applied to many fields, this paper firstly applies the detection techniques on Chinese grain production data to investigate whether the GCSP results in data manipulation. Given the central role of food security in Chinese agricultural policy, this paper will provide valuable implications for policymakers. Second, the discontinuity at cut-off can attribute to data manipulation as well as many other factors. Besides ===='s density test, we furtherly use the regression discontinuity model based on the grain harvest areas collected from third-party to provide suggestive evidence of data manipulation. Third, we also adopt the censored MLE strategy developed by ==== to quantify the proportion of manipulation.==== describes the data. ==== presents the density test developed by ====.

The result shows that better memory capacity can lead to a higher probability of overweight due to the higher discount rate and more food consumption when this person is not obese; while it helps the overweight individuals to lose weight due to memory disutility from obesity. The different effects of memory result from the tradeoff between memory utility from food consumption and memory disutility from obesity.","The prevalence of overweight and obesity is a rapidly growing threat to human health worldwide. According to the data from World Health Organization, the rate of overweight for adults above age 18 was 39% worldwide, and the obesity rate was 13% in 2016, which was almost tripled from 1975. Overweight and obesity have not only become a public health threat but also caused a substantial economic burden and welfare loss (====; ====; ====; ====To analyze the cause of overweight and obesity epidemic, the economics literature has paid ample attention to socio-economic factors, such as rising income, lower food price, the popularity of fast food, etc. (====; ====; ====). Recently, more researchers attempt to understand obesity from the perspective of behavioral economics, for human behavior may be more fully described by including the insight of behavioral economics that assumes people depart from rationality in systematic ways (====; ====). For example, ==== have a comprehensive review on the behavioral economics literature related obesity and highlight several behavioral phenomena, such as present-biased preferences, visceral factors, and status quo bias. However, we argue that memory, which is largely neglected in the economics literature, may also play an important role in explaining body fatness. Memory could influence individual behavior via various channels. Previous studies have already confirmed the existence of memory utility, which posits that current utility depends not only on current consumption, but also on memory utility deriving from past consumption (====; ====; ====). According to the results of these literature, memory capacity is positively correlated with discount rates, thus better memory capacity implies larger consumption amount in the early stage of life (====). Therefore, ignoring the heterogeneity in memory capacity could lead to substantial bias in understanding intertemporal consuming behavior, such as food consumption, which is largely considered the main determinant for body fatness.====Food consumption does not only provide the necessary energy for human body, but is also an important source of pleasure or satisfaction (====; ====; ====). With the development of food industry and the improvement of living standards, people enjoy a much wider variety of food consumption nowadays. Biological, psychological and sociological studies have already confirmed the existence of eating-related pleasures. For example, abundant biological literature has demonstrated hedonic feelings of palatable food consumption are triggered by the stimulation of the brain opioid system (====; ====), while sociological literature has shed light on food-induced positive effective reaction amplified by social interactions (====). Therefore, memory utility is triggered not only based upon taste from the sense, but also from related events and experience around food consumption (====), and pleasure of palatable food enjoyed today then generate long-lasting positive memory utility for the future, which is then added to the future utility. Therefore, an individual who maximizes his total utility during the lifetime will naturally consume more food at present when income is not a constraint for food consumption for most people nowadays (====; ====). Better memory capacity should be associated with a higher degree of memory utility and hence larger premium for consuming food today (====). Consequently, better memory capacity may be associated with larger weight gain in the current period due to more food consumption.====However, over-consumption of food may potentially contribute to body fatness (====; ====; ====; ====), which can generate negative memory utility (memory disutility) as well. Excess energy intake in early life will increase the number and size of a person's fat cells. Even if this person reduces his energy intake in a later stage, the size of fat cells could shrink, but not their number. People with extra fat cells tend to regain lost weight rapidly (====, pp.272). Obese people could encounter utility and well-being loss, which we can learn from the perspective of cause and consequence of obesity (====; ====). For one thing, it is widely acknowledged obesity is not the result of rational decision-making by individuals who compare risk and benefits of eating, since people may be myopic in decision making (====) and have self-control problems (====) to carry out optimal long-term eating plans when exposed to the immediate gratification from food (====; ====; ====). That is, consumers often overeat because the enjoyment of a meal is immediate, while the consequent weight gain is delayed, and unable to control their short-term desires for their own long-term wellbeing (====; ====). Hence, being obese leads to lower utility due to inconsistent long-term preference. For another, being obese leads to increased risk for health problems like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Type II diabetes, etc. (====; ====). Also, Individuals' self-perceptions and well-being are influenced by how they believe they are perceived and evaluated by others (====), while prejudice, bias, and discrimination are often experienced by obese individuals through social interaction nowadays when Obesity is widely stigmatized (====; ====; ====; ====). Therefore, the weight effect of food consumption enjoyed today can also generate negative memory utility (memory disutility). Memory here serves as utility lose for consuming more food at present, and better memory capacity implies larger utility loss. Consequently, considering the disutility of being overweight or obese, a consumer with higher memory capacity is more likely to reduce food consumption once they are overweight. That is, better memory capacity could help to lose weight for overweight and obese individuals if this person is already overweight or obese. In summary, with the involvement of memory utility from food consumption and memory disutility from obesity, memory capacity may have two different impacts on weight gain depending on the stages of being overweight and obese.====Although the medical literature has found higher memory capacity is associated with reduced food intake and increased weight loss for overweight individuals (====; ====), the economics literature has explored the effect of memory capacity on overweight and obesity in a limited way. Actually, heterogeneous memory capacity of individuals is largely neglected in the economic analysis. Therefore, the first contribution of this paper is to establish a theoretical model for analyzing the roles of memory in weight gain, and then test the effect of memory capacity on overweight and obesity by applying the double-hurdle model to Chinese data. Our findings confirm that memory capacity is indeed correlated with weight gain, which depends on the balance of memory utility from food consumption and memory disutility from obesity.====Our paper is also related to behavioral economic studies on overweight and obesity. There has been consensus among economists that the economic analysis of obesity is complicated, and it is better to assess it by combining the traditional economic models with insights from psychology and behavioral economics (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== find that higher risk tolerance is associated with a larger probability of obesity among low-income African Americans. A recent study by ==== shows that college students eat less healthily in the exam period due to depletion of self-control because of the heavy workload for exam preparation. ==== have a comprehensive review on the behavioral economics literature related to obesity and their implications for effective policy making. The key difference between this paper and the current literature is that we focus on memory utility, a behavioral factor that has not been studied in the previous literature. Recently, there are also more studies that examine the people's perception on their memory capacity (====) and the effect of memory on individual decisions like procrastination (====). But those studies are not directly related to memory utility.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== presents the theoretical framework; ==== introduces the data and the empirical model specification; ==== shows the empirical results.

However, empirical evidence of how and to what extent cooperatives facilitate the technology adoption extensity, defined as the number of technologies adopted by a farmer from a wide range of agricultural technologies, remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on the technology adoption extensity using cross-sectional data collected from 413 farm households in Sichuan province of China. We use ","Remarkable technological progress in the agricultural sectors has contributed to a substantial increase in food production, particularly since the start of the Green Revolution in the early 1950s (====; ====; ====).====One primary reason for the low rate of technology adoption in smallholder agricultural systems is the high transaction costs involved in accessing new technologies (====; ====; ====; ====). Transaction costs are the observable and unobservable costs associated with exchange of goods and services (====; ====; ====; ====). Prior evidence has shown that farm cooperatives can collectively purchase production inputs for their members and provide technical assistance to their members, contributing to a reduction in transaction costs (====; ====; ====; ====).====This evidence is apparently in line with a number of new institutional economics arguments explaining the existence of cooperatives in terms of their ability ¡°to economize on transaction costs and to develop ¡®countervailing power¡¯¡± (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Farmer cooperatives also frequently serve as intermediaries and platforms for promoting technology adoption by facilitating information exchanges between smallholder farmers and technology suppliers (e.g., universities, research institutes, agricultural extension agents, and technology companies). In all these cases, it seems more plausible to locate the rationale for cooperative activities in helping farmers to enhance value creation and to capture greater profit margins along the supply chain than in preventing opportunism on the part of farmers' contractual partners.====If the new institutional economics explanations of cooperatives were couched exclusively in terms of the opportunism prevention problem, they would be of little help in making sense of the above mentioned types of cooperative activities. Fortunately, this is not the case. A strand of the new institutional economics literature known as ¡°the theory of the firm¡± includes two major varieties of approaches, contract-based and competence-based. Whereas the contract-based approaches explain the nature of the firm through its ability to align incentives in such a way as to curb opportunistic behavior (====), the competence-based approaches see the firm as ¡°a repository of productive knowledge¡± (====; ====; ====; ====). In their latter quality, the firm is distinguished by its ¡°ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments¡± (====; ====). According to ==== argues that ¡°cooperatives may ¡­ be more propitiously situated than conventional firms to achieve the cooperation involved in the development and application of productive knowledge¡±.====Transferring the competence-based approaches to the cooperative context does, however, raises the question about differentiating between the contexts of cooperatives and investor-owned firms. This question can be straightforwardly addressed by drawing on ==== synthesis of the contract-based new institutional economics explanations of farmer cooperatives. ==== traced these explanations back to the relatively small size of family farms as the sector-specific characteristic of agriculture throughout most of the world. In his words, ¡°the role of agricultural cooperatives lies in enabling the realization of advantages of hierarchical organization in agriculture while avoiding the need to incur its transaction costs, which are prohibitively high in this sector¡± (====). It is clear, however, that the ¡°advantages of hierarchical organization¡± may likewise pertain to its competence-based attributes, such as its being the repository of productive technological knowledge (====). In other words, in view of the size limitations of family farms prominently theorized by ====Interestingly, several studies have shown that cooperatives are actually doing so (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In a study on Ethiopia, ==== showed that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on fertilizer adoption. ==== found that participation in a cooperative has a positive impact on farmers' adoption of specialty-coffee varieties in Costa Rica. ==== revealed that cooperative membership increases the probability of adopting improved cassava varieties in Nigeria. In a study on China, ==== showed that cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of adopting organic soil amendments including organic fertilizer and farmyard manure. Another study on China by ==== revealed that compared the non-members, cooperative members are more likely to adopt integrated pest management technology.====Despite the rich literature on the relationship between cooperative membership and farmers' technology adoption, what has been less clear so far in empirical terms, is how farmer cooperative membership affects the adoption extensity, here defined as the number of technologies adopted by a farmer from a wide range of multiple technologies. The competence-based approaches emphasize the importance of the complementarities of skills, routines, and capabilities in shaping the firms' unique specialization and diversification portfolio. Accordingly, famers may have interests in utilizing cooperative services for a set of technologies that complement each other or that match their farms' specialization, particularly in diversified smallholder farming systems such as in much of China (====; ====). To the best of our knowledge, no empirical studies have systematically investigated the effect of cooperative membership on farmers' adoption of an array of agricultural technologies, especially technologies at all stages, from the production stage, to processing, and finally to the sale of agricultural products.====An implication of the competence-based approach is that different technologies pose distinctly different challenges for the organization of collective learning and competence-building processes. Accordingly we hypothesize that the effects of cooperative membership on technology adoption will vary for different types of technologies. The extant empirical literature likewise confirms the existence of this variation. For example, ==== found that membership in an agricultural association has little effect on the adoption of conservation tillage and improved seeds, whereas a number of other studies report positive effects of cooperative membership on the adoption of improved seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides (====; ====; ====The primary objective of this study is to explore the relationship between farmer cooperative membership and the extensity of technology adoption of a farmer. Specifically, we want to answer three research questions: Does cooperative membership have a positive effect on the number of technologies adopted by smallholder farmers? How does cooperative membership affect adoption of production and post-harvest technologies (similarly or differently)? And, finally, what are other factors besides cooperative membership that affect farmers' technology adoption extensity? These three question are anchored with three key hypotheses accordingly: (1) cooperative membership has a positive impact on the technology adoption extensity; (2) cooperative membership has different impacts on the adoption extensity of production and post-harvest technologies; and (3) In addition to cooperative membership, farmers' technology adoption extensity is also affected by other socioeconomic and demographic factors.====This study uses household survey data collected from 413 farmers from Sichuan province of China and count data models to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on technology adoption extensity. The sample includes 212 cooperative members and 201 non-members. Because the cooperative members and non-members may differ in terms of socioeconomic characteristics and smallholder farmers decide themselves whether or not to participate in a farmer cooperative - not randomly assigned to be members or non-members, selection bias occurs (====; ====; ====; ====The following section presents the background and data. ==== introduces empirical models, followed by a presentation of results and discussions in ====.

Using the first-hand ,"After China opened itself up to economic reform and embarked upon market reforms in the late 1970s, it seized the window of opportunity by attracting light manufacturing firms from the East Asian tigers, especially Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Labor-intensive light manufacturing sectors were well in line with the latent comparative advantage of mainland China, which helped to tap into abundant and cheap Chinese labor forces. This reform has enabled China to achieve remarkable economic growth over the past four decades. Such a process of economic structural transformation has been coined as a ¡®flying geese¡¯ model in which a more advanced country (the ¡®lead goose¡¯) transfers capital, technology and management skills to a less developed country (a ¡®follower goose¡¯) (====). From the perspective of New Structural Economics (====),==== two key success factors behind China's economic growth miracle are that the production structure has been well aligned with the factor endowment structure since the late 1970s, and that the government has played a facilitating role in turning the latent comparative advantage into a competitive advantage in the global market (====).====).====Researchers have tried to examine the extent to which Chinese manufacturing firms have responded to the cost pressure by relocating their manufacturing capacity to low-wage areas. ====, ==== matched the Chinese Ministry of Commerce's register of Overseas Direct Investments with China's Industrial Enterprises Survey data from 2011 to 2013 and annual average wage data for prefecture-level cities, and found that labor-intensive light manufacturing sectors related to the textiles, clothing and leather industries are focused on the low-income countries which is consistent with the ¡®flying goose¡¯ effect.====Yet, relocating to low-wage areas is merely one possible coping strategy in response to rising labor costs. Another strategy is to replace labor with capital by upgrading production technologies and enhancing labor productivities. Recent studies have focused on the impact automation on productivity and employment (e.g. ====; ====; ==== and ====).====Few researches, however, have empirically incorporated relocation and technology upgrading, two major competing solutions, into an integrated framework in response to rising labor costs. Our paper primarily aims to make an empirical contribution to the existing literature by conducting the rigorous firm-level survey of about 640 Chinese light manufacturing firms to explain why firms within the light manufacturing sector may make heterogeneous coping strategies ¨C relocation within China or abroad, and technology upgrading ¨C in response to rising labor costs.==== In other words, this paper tries to answer why some firms select relocation while others choose technology upgrading in coping with rising labor costs.====New Structural Economics has predicted that as wages are rising in China, labor-intensive light manufacturing firms will relocate their production capacity to low-wage developing countries (====). Yet the existing discussion has primarily focused on the response of the light manufacturing sector in response to rising labor costs, and few has been done to explore whether there is variation in the response of firms among light manufacturing subsectors. From the perspective of New Structural Economics, we may expect that more labor-intensive light manufacturing subsectors may have greater incentive to move abroad given other things being equal as they can save more production costs. But so far little empirical research has been done at the subsector level. Our paper aims to fill the gap by relying on firsthand collected firm-level survey data to test the above hypothesis. By delving deeper into the subsector level, our paper may help to advise decision-makers on how to formulate heterogeneous policies for various types of firms in order to assist them in coping with the challenge of rising labor costs.====This paper proceeds as follows: it first introduces the ",To upgrade or to relocate?

In this study, we examine the impact of tenure security perceptions and trust on household decisions to rent in land in a region where tenure security is high and in a region where households face much lower ==== security. Our regression results suggest that when land tenure is less secure, household perceptions of tenure security positively affect decisions to rent in additional land and the size of the rented land, whereas trust is important for the choice between oral and written contracts. When land tenure is relatively secure, household tenure security perceptions are less relevant, and trust becomes more important for land rental decisions. However, tenure security perceptions do seem to play a role in the choice between oral and written contracts in such high tenure security environments.","In the process of rural structural transformation that China and many other developing countries experience, many laborers leave the agricultural sector and become engaged in off-farm employment. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Chinese rural workforce involved in off-farm employment has increased from 252.78 million people at the end of 2011 to 281.71 million people at the end of 2016; this means that 47.77% of the rural population was engaged in off-farm employment at the end of 2016 (====; ====). Well-functioning rural land rental markets can play an important role in this process, as they can enhance productivity as well as equity by allowing households with higher agricultural ability to gain access to additional land and permitting participation in the nonfarm economy by those households with lower agricultural ability (====; ====, ====; ====; ====).====The number of rural land rental transactions has increased considerably in China since the 1990s. However, important regional differences can be observed in the degree of land rental market development, while existing markets often tend to be highly segmented with (usually informal) rental transactions restricted to a close circle of relatives outnumbering formal transactions (====; ====; ====). The limited development of the land rental market in some regions and its segmented nature strongly reduce its potential to enhance productivity and equity; moreover, productivity-enhancing land investments may not be undertaken when land rentals are based on informal contracts (====, ====).====What factors can explain the incomplete development of the land rental market in China? The existing international literature stresses the role of transaction costs in causing low levels of land rental market participation and contributing to land market segmentation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and a lack of trust among partners (====).====Since 1998, the Chinese government has implemented a number of land tenure reforms that are meant to improve tenure security and stimulate the transferability of rural land. Relevant laws include the Land Administration Law of 1998, the Rural Land Contract Law of 2002, the Property Law of 2007, and the Mediation and Arbitration of Rural Land Contract Disputes Law of 2009. Although these reforms have contributed to improved legal, or ====, tenure security, the extent to which they contribute to land rental market development is not clear. What matters for land renting decisions is perceived tenure security, not just legal tenure security (====; ====; ====). Perceived tenure security refers to household perceptions of tenure security and generally takes the form of household probability estimates of the chance of eviction from the land (====). Perceived tenure security depends on the way in which land laws and land titling programs are being implemented (====., actual tenure security),==== how information about these laws is being distributed among stakeholders, and on other factors, such as customary land tenure systems and other social norms and traditions (====).====The importance of tenure (in)security perceptions for decision making by tenants is increasingly recognized. Available studies focus in particular on the role of tenure security perceptions in housing improvement in South America (====; ====; ====; ====). Other studies have examined the impact of tenure security perceptions on land investments and input use in Ethiopia (====) and China (====). The role played by tenure security perceptions in rural land renting decisions, however, has been neglected so far in the available literature.====Regarding the role of trust in land rental transactions, it may be assumed that a high level of kinship trust reduces transaction costs of land rentals that occur among kinship members. High levels of kinship trust relative to non-kinship trust may be an important explanatory factor in land rental market segmentation. In such situations, landlords tend to worry less about losing land when they rent their land to their relatives. ==== found that access to land by tenants in Northern Ethiopia was less constrained in communities having a high share of kinship contracts in all rental contracts and hypothesize that lower transaction costs due to higher trust among kin are the underlying reason. We are not aware, however, of any empirical studies examining the roles played by different types of trust (====., trust toward kin, trust toward known people and trust toward strangers) in land renting decisions.====The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact of tenure security perceptions and trust, as two major factors affecting transaction costs, on farm household decisions to rent in land in China. We focus our analysis on the demand side of the land rental market. The supply side is usually underenumerated in rural household surveys, including the survey that we used for this study, because households who are not found at home at the survey time are not interviewed. As a result, households that migrated elsewhere and rented out their land to other households¡ªa common phenomenon in rural China¡ªare excluded from the sample.

On the other hand, the quality of such a decomposition also affects the subsequent empirical evaluations of all Dynamic-Stochastic-General-Equilibrium (DSGE) models which typically focus on the business cycle analysis and as a result whose estimation requires separating the trend and cycle in its first step. Since the work by ==== and ==== the Unobserved Components (UC) model has emerged and become a popular statistical framework to decompose the output into its permanent and transitory components. The UC model is appealing for a number of reasons. Firstly, the UC model typically specifies that the observed output is a sum of the (unobserved) nonstationary trend component and the (unobserved) stationary cyclical component with both components following certain time series dynamics. As such, the UC models yield structural and intuitive interpretations. Secondly, although various frequency-based filtering approaches such as Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (====) and Baxter-King (BK) filter (====, ====, ====, and ====). However, the UC model has been shown to nest the typical filtering framework (see e.g., ==== for the result of the HP filter and ==== for a general discussion), and unlike the filtering approaches, the UC approach does not pre-specify the key parameter values and rather lets data speak for itself by estimating those parameters using data before using these parameter estimates to compute the trend and cyclical components. Thirdly, the UC model is intrinsically connected with the Beveridge-Nelson (BN) decomposition (====), another important forecast-based trend-cycle decomposition methodology relying on the reduced-form models that can also avoid issues with the filtering approaches as mentioned above. Lastly, it is relatively more straightforward to extend the UC model to a multivariate framework and at the same time to preserve its intuitive and structural interpretations. One recent important development in the literature of the UC models is the extension of the univariate UC model to the multivariate UC framework in order to use more information to obtain a more accurate estimate of the output decomposition. ==== proposes and estimates a bivariate UC model with a cointegration restriction of the output and consumption to study the slow response of the consumption to permanent income. ==== works on a bivariate UC model of the output and unemployment to investigate the relationship between the two, also known as Okun's Law. Following ====, ==== propose and estimate a multivariate UC model of output, consumption and investment with common trends and common cycles. Finally, ====, ====, and ==== take advantage of abundant U.S. data to build and estimate a medium-to-large scale of multivariate UC models for the purpose of estimating the long-run trends and short-run cycles of many economic series.====In this paper we aim to provide a careful and comprehensive study of growth cycles and business cycles of the Chinese economy using both the univariate and the bivariate UC models. There are a number of reasons why we focus on the Chinese economy in this paper. Firstly, our paper is the first one that takes full advantage of the most recent development in the literature of UC models to study the Chinese economy and can potentially contribute to the general development of the UC models using the unique feature of the Chinese economy. Most applications of the UC model following the classical papers by ==== and ==== cyclical assume orthogonal permanent and transitory shocks. However, ==== point out in their influential paper that the orthogonality assumption restricts certain UC models. Specifically, in a UC model where the trend is a random walk with a constant drift (constant long-run growth rate) and the cycle follows a stationary AR(2) process, they find that the relaxation of this orthogonality assumption in the UC model when applied to the US data results in a strongly negative correlation between the two shocks and yields a substantially different trend-cycle decomposition. As they explain in the paper, the negative correlation between the trend shock and the cycle shock is consistent with ==== who point out the important role of shifting the long-run path of output following productivity shocks and the resulting short-term fluctuations adjusting toward the shifting trend. This interpretation, however, also indicates potential model mis-specifications of the random walk with a constant drift. ==== explore this implication in a multivariate UC model and find that introducing additional dynamics into the permanent component helps to account for this negative correlation, which is consistent with the interpretation in ====. One limitation with the work by ==== is that they study a UC model that restricts the long-run growth rate to be constant. When ==== use U.S. data to investigate the role of correlations in the more general double-drift UC model as in ==== and ==== that features a time-varying long-run growth rate (drift), the drift shock is typically estimated at or close to zero and insignificant. Although this estimation often needs to account for the ¡°pile-up¡± issue as pointed out by ====, the emergence of this issue implies that the size of the variation of the long-run growth rates must be small when applied to the U.S. data. This is probably not surprising given the advanced nature of U.S. economy and thus its long-run growth dynamics would not be as volatile as that of an emerging economy such as China whose economy has experienced frequent structural transformations. As such, this distinct feature of the Chinese economy provides an excellent case for us to better identify the variations of the long-run growth rates (or the growth cycles) in the UC models, that have been poorly identified using U.S. data in the past literature. In this paper, we use the Chinese data to estimate the most general UC models with time-varying long-run growth rates and correlated shocks. To improve the reliability of our estimates of the growth cycles as well as the business cycles, we also extend the univariate UC model to a multivariate UC framework by exploring the Phillips Curve type of relationship between the output gap and the inflation. A better identification of the time-varying long-run growth rates in the UC models, in both the univariate and bivariate models, helps to study its interactions with and its impacts on the other components in the model, in particular the potential correlations among shocks. The more general UC model with a better identified growth cycles intuitively should lead to a more robust model specification and thus a more reliable trend-cycle decomposition. In this regard, our work contributes to the general development of the UC models. Secondly, our other purpose is to employ the powerful UC models to identify and estimate growth cycles and business cycles of the Chinese economy in order to provide guidance to policy makers. Given various structural transformations and reforms that the Chinese economy has experienced in the past several decades, the estimated differentials of the long-run growth performance over different time periods can potentially shed light on the driving forces of the long-run economic growth and provide insights for future economic reforms. In particular, the recent slowdown of the Chinese GDP growth rates has led to intensive discussions of the so-called ¡°New Normal¡± of the Chinese economy and requests for ¡°Supply-Side¡± reforms. The underlying assumption of this policy proposal, however, is that the decline of the observed output is primarily due to a decline of the long-run growth rate. Our framework can provide a direct empirical evidence in support of or against such an assumption and the resulting policy prescriptions. Moreover, our trend-cycle decomposition exercises can also quantitatively document the extent to which the output decline is attributable to the cyclical component as well as the trend component, which provides a necessary empirical ground for proposing appropriate policies. Finally, lately there have been numerous estimates and debates of the long-run growth potential of the Chinese economy, in wake of the recent slowdown. Our UC models can provide an up-to-date estimate of such long-run growth rate, contributing to this important debate.====To our knowledge, our paper is the first one that employs the double-drift UC model with both orthogonal and correlated shocks in both the univariate and bivariate UC models to study the growth cycles and business cycles of the Chinese economy. Firstly, we find that the business cycle extracted from the univariate UC models is positively correlated with the inflation rate, suggesting a Phillips Curve type of relationship for the Chinese economy. Secondly, in the bivariate UC model augmented with the Phillips Curve, we provide a reliable trend-cycle decomposition and document a substantial amount of variations of the long-run growth rates of the Chinese economy. One of our most important findings is that the long-run (potential) growth rate of the Chinese economy started to decline since as early as the mid-90s, which corroborates ==== who argues that the policy focus shifted round early 90s from the small private businesses in rural areas to large state-owned enterprises in urban areas and this led to efficiency losses. Thirdly, we find that the Chinese economy started to enter the economic recession at the business cycle frequency since about 2014. This recession has since then continued to deepen and the actual output level has fallen below its potential level by about 5.30% in 2017. Although the UC model and other filtering or decomposition methods have been applied to study the Chinese economy in previous literature, our work is distinct from these past works and makes a number of new and important contributions. ==== follows closely the univariate UC model in ==== and ==== that includes trend, cyclical, and seasonal components in order to conduct a trend-cycle decomposition using Chinese quarterly GDP data from 1987Q1 to 2013Q1. Compared to our study, their study is limited to a univariate UC model, and does not include models that permit correlations among shocks as in ====, uses the trigonometric functions instead of the more widely used autoregressive process to model the cyclical component, and studies a much shorter time span not including the time period from the late 70s to the late 80s that turns out to be instrumental in order to discover one of our most important findings. ==== apply the frequency-based filtering approaches to decompose Chinese output fluctuations and find that much of the Chinese output volatility is attributable to the growth cycles rather than the business cycles. However, their study is subject to the serious critiques of the frequency-based filtering approaches as summarized above. As explained in ====, the UC model instead offers a more robust and powerful test and a comparison of trend and cyclical components of the output. ====, ==== are two studies that are very closely related to our bivariate UC model in which we bring in the additional information about the inflation and augment the univariate UC model with a Phillips Curve type of relationship between the output gap and the inflation to improve the reliability of the trend-cycle decomposition, following ==== They rely on an estimate of the output gap through the multivariate BN decomposition to study the empirical Phillips Curve of the Chinese economy. Our bivariate UC model also produces a Phillips Curve for the Chinese economy, which seems broadly in line with their results. Several other studies investigate the importance of nonlinearity and asymmetry of the Chinese business cycles, which we do not explore here. For example, ==== estimate the type of Friedman's Plucking UC model of ==== using Chinese output data. In their UC model, the long-run growth rate is restricted to be constant with a focus on the asymmetric nature of the business cycle in a univariate framework. Finally, ==== employ the Threshold-AR model and ==== estimate a Markov regime-switching AR model using the Chinese output data to study the nonlinearity and asymmetry of the Chinese business cycles.====This paper is organized in the following way: ==== presents the univariate double-drift UC models and the bivariate double-drift UC models together with their state-space representation and the estimation methodology.==== ==== reports the estimation results of various models and provides detailed discussions of these results. ==== concludes.==== show that the unconstrained UC model with correlated shocks can yield the same trend-cycle decomposition as the Beveridge-Nelson (BN) decomposition. ==== extends this result to the double-drift model that we study in this paper. The BN decomposition is an important statistical framework that can decompose any series into its trend and cycle components. The BN trend is defined as the long-run forecast of the output. As such, this decomposition method relies on only the reduced-form model and thus avoids more structural assumptions. In this Appendix, we extract the trend, trend growth rate, and cycle from the UC models by following closely the approach in ====, in order to compare the UC decomposition with the BN decomposition.

We identify a significant positive impact of ==== (top provincial-level government officials with prior working experience in other province) has no effects on regional output synchronization.,"Extensive research have been done on the relationship between political factors and economic performance (====; ====; ====; ====) as well as on business cycle synchronization (====; ====; ====; ==== and ====). In particular, voters typically welcome economic policies that can boost economic growth and employment while maintaining low inflation rate; accordingly, incumbent officials devise and implement economic policies to please voters for higher chances of being re-elected. (====). In actuality, politicians and officials are often associated with a certain faction or party; thus, their choices of economic policy are inevitably influenced by party interests and political ideologies.====Nonetheless, an important and yet insufficiently studied issue - political influence on the synchronization of economic activity, remains unresolved. Among many obstacles blocking the investigation of political impacts on business cycle synchronization, the fact that political systems differ substantively across countries and identifying variations in political institutions across countries is an arduous task, may be the main one. Hence, regional studies under similar political and legal systems that can yield accurate estimations are desirable (====; ====; ====). In this study, we fill in the gap by exploring the channels through which bureaucratic system affects output synchronization using cross-regional data of China.====China is an ideal setting for studying the political impacts on regional output synchronization for two reasons. First, China has a largely regionalized economy.==== Thanking to as many as 34 segments of the domestic market, cross-regional trade and capital flow are varied enough to reveal the association between political factors and output synchronization. Second, the Chinese economy is characterized with massive intervention from the central government. China's political system has played a pivotal role on its rapid economic growth during the past four decades. All local government officials are evaluated both formally and informally by central governments based on local GDP growth rate and loyalty to the central government.==== Consequently, regional economic growths are likely to be synchronized between the provinces that share similar central-local relation. (====; ====)====To test the association between regional output synchronization and state-province relation, we collected pairwise provincial-level panel data from 1993 to 2014. In specific, we tested the effect of the career path of top provincial leaders, including party secretaries and provincial governors, on regional output synchronization. We define the two types of career path as follows. First, ==== is when top provincial leaders of any pair of provinces have served in the central government; second, ==== is when top provincial leaders of any pair of provinces have worked in the other province of the same pair but never in the central government. The empirical results confirm that ==== has a significant positive impact on regional output synchronization, whereas ==== has no effects. The main policy implication of this study is that bureaucratic system influences the synchronization of regional economic activity in China, but exclusively through ==== and not ====.==== on synchronization remain essentially unchanged throughout.====While this study confirms the main finding in ==== that patron-client relation positively affects economic development in China, three critical distinctions, however, between ==== and ours merit mentioning: 1. our findings do not solely rely on patron-client relation even though it is incorporated into the channel through which ==== affects growth; 2. our dependent variable is output synchronization instead of the GDP growth of a single province/city; 3. we explore central-local relation in contrast to ====¡¯s province-city one.

The potential for increased female labour force participation and higher income in urban regions can change household gender relations through improved female bargaining power (====) and autonomy (====). Evidence spanning 20 countries has shown that with national level increases in female employment, the time men devote to unpaid housework increases (====; ====). Simultaneously, retreat from state support for children and elder care and dismantling of the ==== that previously reduced women's unpaid work burden, has led to a pronounced shift of caregiving responsibility to the family (====; ====; ====). Women's engagement in paid work in China is relatively higher than elsewhere in the world, yet women bear a disproportionate share of unpaid work (====; ====). Especially in urban China, there has been a worsening of household gender inequality with intensified pressure for women to play dual roles as market income earners and caregivers (====). Demonstrating China as a particularly valuable setting for examining household gender asymmetries, a small, albeit growing number of Chinese studies, underscore women's second shift (e.g., ====; ====), and have studied aspects of the gendered division of domestic work (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This paper enriches this literature, employing in-depth time-use analysis to cast new light on the nexus between urbanization and household gender inequalities.====Time-use is a valuable test of gender equality and a useful indicator of social change and attitudes to gender roles (====; ====; ====). Increasingly time-use analyses are used to research family welfare (====; ====). Recent Chinese studies too, utilize time-use patterns to examine important wellbeing issues (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For instance, ==== indicate time spent on unpaid work at the expense of sleep and leisure can have detrimental female mental health outcomes. ==== explore time allocation patterns between married couples in urban China, showing how relative income impacts on their time spent on unpaid work. They urge additional scrutiny of the forces that catalyse long-term change and continuity of traditional gender norms. Taking up this call, the overall purpose of this paper is to analyze whether and to what extent urbanization narrows the household gender inequality gap with males doing more housework yet widens it with females experiencing a second shift of unpaid work.====Before proceeding further, we point out that we use the term urbanization in a general sense to refer to residence in urban regions. With the unprecedented rural-to-urban migration of recent decades, migrant households are an important group of China's urban residents. Although recent research on China, emphasises a broad divide in family and gender values among urban and rural populations (====; ====; ====; ====). Their time-use patterns could be quite distinct from other urban residents. Therefore, for fine-grained scrutiny of the time allocation patterns of urban residents in contrast to their rural counterparts, we separate out the migrant group. Thus we supplement the literature by gauging the implications of urbanization on household gender time allocation, through a widened group analysis of urban households that examines urban and migrant households, relative to their rural peers.====We examine full 24-hour time allocation configurations of paid and unpaid work, leisure and self-care of matched couples in these three different household groups, to provide better understanding of the gender-differentiated impact of urbanization. Since the presence of young children has a significant impact on the gendered division of labour in households (====), we explicitly acknowledge the time costs of children. Applying and adapting the classic ==== approach to the Chinese context, we investigate time impacts of children on parental activities relative to childless couples. As such, our study builds on extant Chinese time-use literature with in-depth investigation of parental time allocation, especially for parents of younger children across three groups.====Education plays a role in changing gender role attitudes (====). Similarly, total household income, comprising income from paid work and non-labour income, can play an important role in narrowing the gender inequality gap in China, for example by enhancing female bargaining power (====; ====; ====). Household income also impacts on time use patterns via its positive association with access to paid childcare and preschool education (====). We supplement this literature with close examination of the implications of education and household income on time allocation across the three population groups we study.====Our analysis also lends itself to providing analysis of within gender differences. Most recently ==== examine the impact of urbanization on housework time across different groups of women, emphasizing the importance of same sex comparison across households in different groupings. We extend their analysis beyond housework by including other broad time-use categories. Finally, we also add to the literature on intergenerational co-residence in households (====; ====; ====; ====This paper contributes to building the cumulative body of literature on household gender inequality in the Chinese context from several standpoints. A major contribution is our fresh insights on the extent of the burden of a second shift of unpaid work, that especially supplement recent studies that mainly focus on household gender differentials in categories of unpaid work and urbanization (e.g. ====; ====). Our analysis of time distribution across all broad activities in three-group households, with a methodology that enables a focus on parental time costs with reference to childless couples is another useful complement to extant Chinese time-use studies. Other contributions include our examination of the intersections of gender and educational attainment and income of couples, to expose if urbanization contributes a powerful push in improving household gender equality.====Our study reveals that although urbanization improves household gender equality with males engaging in more unpaid work, it may also go hand in hand with the added burden of an unpaid second shift for females. Hence it endorses the importance of examining the total work burden of females and males in the couple unit of analysis, namely consideration of both their paid and unpaid work time allocations, when evaluating gender asymmetries in the household division of labour. Overall, while the embedded cultural context and patriarchal social norms exert a powerful influence on the gendered time allocation in households, urbanization tends to erode such traditional gendered patterns. Thus, for instance we find urban males take on a greater share of unpaid work than their counterparts in other groups, but this effect is more pronounced for better educated males. Ultimately, we confirm that the urbanization-education-income link is key to improving household gender equality.==== results and interpretation.

We use quantile regression methods on a data set of 135 Chinese banks during 2004¨C2017. Our results suggest that bank capital buffer has a robust U-shaped association with bank risk-taking. This effect is more significant for banks that at the upper tail of risk-taking distribution. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the turning point of capital buffer decreases throughout the risk-taking distribution. These findings offer important policy implications that continuously increasing bank capital requirement does not continuously lead to lower risk-taking, instead, requiring banks to build up too much capital buffer is more likely to result in greater risk-taking for high-risk banks.","Recent decades have witnessed major reforms regarding capital adequacy regulation, corporate governance, and risk management in China's banking industry (====). In particular, the 2004 capital adequacy regulation implemented by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) represents a fundamental change in the Chinese banking system. Consequently, the Chinese banking industry changed from one in which less than 10% of the banks met the requirements to one in which almost all of banks reached or exceeded the regulatory standard from 2004 to 2009 (====). The drastic changes of capital buffer and risk management in China's banking sector makes verifying the link between bank capital and risk-taking an important topic.====Despite the voluminous banking literature, the relationship between capital buffer and risk-taking is still ambiguous (====). Bank capital buffer refers to the level of capital above the required minimum held by banks at a given time (====). On the one hand, traditional moral hazard models predict that banks have an incentive to decrease capital buffer and to increase asset risk-taking. In other words, undercapitalized banks tend to take on excessive risk to exploit the deposit insurance schemes. Moreover, enough capital buffer acts as a cushion to absorb adverse financial shocks and to limit ex-ante moral hazard behavior (====; ====). Undercapitalized banks may face the danger of losing market confidence and reputation, as well as triggering the severe regulation problem, therefore have a strong incentive to accumulate capital promptly. One way to acquire this goal is to switch from a safer portfolio to a riskier portfolio to chase possible higher expected returns. Recent empirical studies, such as ==== and ==== find that the capital buffer is negatively related to bank risk-taking.====On the other hand, ==== argue that capital buffer has a positive impact on bank risk-taking. Since greater capital buffer equips banks with stronger ability to deal with potential temporary losses, gives more flexibility in choosing investment projects, and induces banks to take excessive risk-taking simply because they have enough insurance even if unexpected shocks occur. Meanwhile, banks with the lower capital buffer can be super cautious in picking investment assets, because they are so approaching to the minimum regulatory requirement that falling a little bit of capital level may lead to costly adjustment of bank portfolios or even bankruptcy. Empirically, ==== find a significant positive relationship between bank capital buffer and risk-taking, while ==== claim a positive two-way relation between the capital buffer and risk-taking on the short-run.====The discussion above indicates that the link between the capital buffer and risk-taking is still an empirical question. Our paper extends the earlier study by exploring the nonlinearity and heterogeneity effects of bank capital buffer on risk-taking. We employ quantile regression approach on a panel data of 135 banks over the period 2004¨C2017 in China. We find that bank risk-taking as measured by the ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans (NPL) and the inverse of ====-score (Z) has a U-shaped relationship with bank capital buffer. Further, the turning point of capital buffer decrease across conditional quantiles of bank risk-taking distribution. The effect of capital buffer on bank risk-taking is more significant in high-risk banks than low-risk banks. These findings have several important policy implications. For instance, continuously increasing required bank capital buffer does not persistently reduce bank risk-taking, instead, requiring the bank to build up too much capital buffer is more likely to result in increasing risk-taking for high-risk banks.====Our paper contributes to the existing literature in three aspects. First, we investigate the relationship between capital buffer and risk-taking using quantile regression approach. Studies mentioned above all share a common assumption that the marginal impact of capital buffer on bank risk-taking is identical, regardless of risk-taking distribution. However, our work is methodologically different from prior studies by using quantile regression methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to show that the nonlinearity effect of bank capital buffer on risk-taking is heterogeneous across the risk-taking conditional distribution. ==== suggest that neglecting the heterogeneity in outcome variable might lead to inconsistent estimation results. Moreover, while comparing to the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach, quantile regression can describe the entire conditional distribution of risk-taking and enable us to assess how policy variables affect banks at each quantile of risk-taking's conditional distribution, with a focus on the highest and the lowest risk-taking banks. It is often the case that the characteristics of the banks that take risks below or above the conditional mean are intrinsically different. For regulators and policymakers, it is important to understand what happens at both extremes of the risk-taking distribution given a certain level of the capital buffer.====Second, this study explicitly explores the nonlinearity between the capital buffer and risk-taking adopting quadratic estimation. Although the empirical specification of ==== also embeds quadratic term of capital ratio, they mainly focused on the role of rational governance upon bank risk-taking in the Asian region. Given that the banking system is heavily regulated, banks manage their capital buffers in line with the regulatory capital requirements. Banks usually have two goals. One is to sustains a capital level greater than required minimum, and the other one is to earn as high as possible returns. When the capital buffer is enough to secure a bank against the danger of falling close to or under the regulatory requirement line, the desire of higher returns dominates. In this case, the greater buffer will induce a relative higher bank risk-taking. Otherwise when the capital buffer falls below a certain threshold, the moral hazard effect that induces banks to take on more risk dominates. The long-run linkage between the capital buffer and risk-taking is therefore nonlinear and dependent on the size of the capital buffer (====).====Third, we use a comprehensive dataset of 135 Chinese banks over a relatively long period (2004¨C2017) to study the Chinese banking system, while the existing literature focuses primarily on the United States. Nevertheless, it is particularly interesting to investigate how an evolving banking system reacts to capital buffer and risk-taking under a new regime of the prudential capital regulation framework. The China case provides a unique opportunity to directly analyze the effect of bank capital buffer on bank risk behavior, due to the remarkable transformation since 2004 (====).====This paper is closely related to the recent literature on the capital buffer and bank risk-taking. For example, ==== examines the relationship between bank capital buffer and portfolio risk and macroeconomic developments. ==== focus on the short-term capital buffer and portfolio risk adjustments. ==== investigate the unique risk exposure of Islamic banks' capital buffers. ==== study the relation among banks' capital buffer, risk-taking, and performance in Canadian banking system. However, unlike our paper, these studies share a common assumption that the link between the capital buffer and risk-taking is linear and underline the influence of business cycle. While we focus on the interaction of capital buffer and bank risk-taking, other studies link bank capital buffer to credit growth, charter value and macroeconomic fluctuations. ==== explore the determinants of bank capital buffers employing a dataset of 1337 banks in 70 countries. ==== empirically investigate the relationships between capital buffers and credit growth for French banks. ==== analyzes the nonlinearity between the capital buffer and charter value.====Our paper is also related to the recent banking literature that focused on the impact of some covariates on different quantiles of response variable's distribution other than the conditional mean. ====, for example, use quantile regression analysis to the Merton structural credit model to measure how capital adequacy and default probabilities fluctuate over a 10-year period for Japanese banks. ==== study the effect of bank regulation and supervision on risk-taking using quantile regressions, showing that bank regulation and oversight has an impact on the dangers of high-risk banks but not for the low-risk banks. ==== use this approach to investigate the effect of the Basel III on the efficiency of Islamic and conventional banks. These studies show the importance of considering the heterogeneity across the conditional distribution of the outcome variable.====At present, only a few of papers associate with this issue on Chinese banking sectors. For example, ==== investigate bank risk-taking, efficiency and law enforcement utilizing data from 133 Chinese city commercial banks for the 1999¨C2008 period. ==== use 45 Chinese commercial banks during 2000¨C2010 to examine the cyclical behavior of bank capital buffer under macroeconomic fluctuations. ==== take advantage of the exogenous regulatory changes in capital ratio just like us, but they emphasize the relationship between capital ratio and cost efficiency for 100 Chinese banks over the period 2004¨C2009. ==== focus on the impacts of risk and competition on profitability using 41 Chinese commercial banks over the period 2003¨C2011.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the quantile regression framework and outlines our empirical model.

Under this province-specific quota system, students from different provinces do not compete with each other and are not differentiated after admission. As opposed to the pooling quota system, where each college has a quota for multiple provinces, the province-specific quota system may introduce unfairness and inefficiency. In this paper, I thus develop a model to empirically compare the two systems in Guangxi, Hebei, and Sichuan in 2006 and 2007. I find that pooling quotas improve students' welfare and so does combining quotas for more provinces. However, students from some provinces have lower utilities after pooling quotas. Since students are treated equally after pooling, the results indicate the unfairness of the province-specific quota system. All results indicate the government should abandon the province-specific quota system.","The annual college entrance examination is considered the most important exam in China. After this exam, students are assigned to colleges based on their scores and preferences. Currently, every college in China has a quota for each province; in other words, students from different provinces do not compete with each other. For example, although the population of Sichuan is four times larger than that of Beijing,==== in 2016, Peking University planned to admit 31 science major students from Sichuan and 111 from Beijing.==== Obviously, it is more likely that Peking University will admit a student from Beijing than one from Sichuan. Additionally, the colleges do not differentiate between students after enrollment. This system of province-specific quotas is largely criticized for its unfairness, as some provinces (e.g., Beijing) have higher quotas than others (e.g., Sichuan).==== Moreover, its effectiveness is debatable.====Intuitively, if colleges pool quotas instead of maintaining a province-specific quota system, students will benefit from more choices (higher quotas from colleges) but will face fiercer competition (more students competing for each slot). For example, suppose there are two colleges and two students. College ==== (====, respectively) and student ==== (====) are in province ? (====). Both students prefer college ====. In the specific-quota system, each college assigns one place for students in their own province and zero for students from the other province. Student ==== (====) will be admitted by college ==== (====). After market aggregation, in the pooling quota system, each college plans to admit one student from either province. Assuming that the two students have the same quality and randomly assigning ranks to them, if student ==== ranks higher than student ====, student ==== (====) will be assigned to college ==== (====). In this case, student ==== has more choices (i.e., {====,?====} vs. {====}) whereas student ==== faces fiercer competition (i.e., student ==== also competes for college ====). In addition, if student ==== slightly prefers ====, social welfare decreases, while if student ==== strongly prefers ====, social welfare increases.====This study compares social welfare under the province-specific and pooling quota systems. To the best of my knowledge, no studies have hitherto analyzed the province-specific and pooling quota systems. Furthermore, the study quantifies the unfairness faced by students depending on their province of origin and suggests that ignoring this issue raises effectiveness and fairness concerns.====In the empirical analysis, I counterfactually pool college quotas for any two or all three of the regions of Guangxi, Hebei, and Sichuan. For example, Sichuan University admits 173 students from Guangxi and 216 from Hebei. If I pool the quotas for Guangxi and Hebei, Sichuan University admits 389 students from Guangxi and Hebei combined. The results suggest that social welfare increases after pooling the quotas under both the deferred acceptance (DA) and Boston mechanisms (BM).==== Additionally, pooling quotas for more provinces always yields higher social welfare. In most cases, the performances of BM and DA systems become more similar and the advantage of BM reduces after pooling. This suggests we can implement DA after pooling quotas because this mechanism is Pareto efficient, justified-envy free, and strategy-proof, and we do not need to significantly sacrifice welfare.====However, not all students benefit from pooling quotas. For instance, science majors from Hebei will lose 19.094% of their utility after pooling the quotas of the three provinces in 2007, while the utility of those from Sichuan increases by 15.162%. The results suggest unfairness before pooling the quotas, as students are treated equally after pooling.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: I review the relevant literature in ====, present the model in ====, describe the data in ====, and conduct the empirical analysis in ====.

Results show that the grain subsidy has a significant and positive effect on both leasing out and leasing in farmland in rural China. Rural households with an increased share of full-time off-farm workers are more likely to lease out farmland and less likely to lease it in. Older operators and households with less educational attainment are less likely to lease in farmland. Large farms are likely to both lease out and lease in farmland. Finally, the Land Shareholding Cooperative System (LSCS) plays an important role in China's farmland leasing market.",")and free redundant rural workers to take off-farm jobs (====), but it also provides rental income to old farmers. Two important factors affecting China's emerging farmland lease market are the nation's policy of paying a direct grain subsidy to farmers and the nation's supply of off-farm labor in rural areas. Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided agricultural subsidies to farmers to increase grain production. The subsidy policies include a high-quality seed subsidy, a direct grain subsidy, a farm machinery subsidy, and a comprehensive subsidy (====). Agricultural subsidies have contributed significantly to grain self-sufficiency in China (====). Of these policies, the direct grain subsidy (DGS) is important for improving grain producers' income because it is paid directly to the farmers (contracted land operators) who are growing grain crops such as rice, wheat, and corn. In a recent article, ==== concluded that the grain subsidy program significantly increased the acreage allocated to grains.====Since the late 1980s, with technological advances in agriculture and the rapid urbanization, labor has been migrating from rural to urban areas of China (==== The growth of rural workers migrating to urban areas has coincided with increased agricultural productivity, modernization of agriculture, and farmland leasing activities. However, in China, rural migrant workers usually leave behind family members (the elderly, females, and children) and return to their families during periods of unemployment (====). The increasing migration of rural workers has led to an inadequate supply of labor and a lower quality of labor for farm work. The movement of labor to urban areas has seriously accelerated farmland loss, an increase in left idle, and an increase in the size of farmland operation (====). Rather than fully engaging in rural-urban migration, rural Chinese households have engaged significantly in off-farm employment. As a result, this off-farm income has had a significant impact on the total income of rural Chinese households (====). Several studies (====; ====; ====; ====) highlight the significances of farmland leasing market and focus on the factors affecting farmers' decisions to participate in this market.====Although the issues of the grain subsidy, off-farm employment, and land leases have received attention in previous studies, none has simultaneously addressed the issue of the grain subsidy and the off-farm labor supply as they relate to the farmland leasing market. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the grain subsidy and the off-farm labor supply of rural households on the farmland leasing market in China. Finally, we test the robustness of our results by using different sample sizes and estimation technique. Using choice modeling approach (multinomial logit technique) and 2015 farm household-level data collected from nine provinces from China the study finds that grain subsidies received by the contracted farm operator households have a positive and significant impact on farmland leasing out and leasing in decisions. On the other hand, the study finds that the share of full-time off-farm work in the farm family has a positive and negative impact on farmland leasing out and leasing in decisions. The study also finds that age and education attainment are negatively associated with farmland leasing in decisions. Further, the result from this study shows that farmers in villages with Land Shareholding Cooperative System (LSCS) are more likely to lease in farmland. Finally, using different sample sizes, endogeneity, and estimation techniques, reveals that our findings are robust.====The contribution of this study to the literature is three-fold. First, it highlights the effects of agricultural policies on the farmland leasing market, which is especially important considering the rapid urbanization and agricultural transformation in China. Second, it emphasizes the grain subsidy's role in the farmland leasing market, providing a new perspective in explaining the farmland leasing behavior.

To conduct the survey, we first used the 2012 China Statistical Yearbook to extract information on provinces (regions) for total population, per capita GDP, the total area of arable land, the proportion of arable land (cultivated land area to total land area), agricultural population accounted for the proportion of the total population and the proportion of agricultural output accounted for the proportion of GDP in the provinces and autonomous regions, and combined with seven major geographical divisions in mainland China. The final selected sample areas were Guangdong, Guizhou, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Ningxia, Shanxi and Sichuan Provinces. See table below for the distribution of farms surveyed. Using the above six indicators, the task groups further clustered the counties in each province and select 6 counties in each province. Finally, 54 counties were selected. In each town we chose an administrative village, and each administrative village chose two natural villages and randomly choose five farmers in each natural village, so the ideal sample size in each province is 240. In order to further strengthen the interregional comparison, we selected 600 samples in the Guangdong and Jiangxi Provinces. However, only 547 and 587 samples were returned from these two provinces. In the remaining provinces (regions) the sample size was about 201¨C239. Although the sample size in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces is high, the overall sample size is large and there is no statistical significant bias in the overall analysis or sub-provincial analysis.

We find that, on average, migrants increase the wages of urban workers, with the effect being magnified for more skilled urban workers. This suggests that migrants with skills similar to those of urban workers may complement them. We explore the possible channels of these effects. From the supply perspective, we find that migration inflows accelerate the occupational upgrading of urban workers, especially for low- and medium-skilled workers. From a demand perspective, as the share of migrants in the urban labor force increases, the number and output of industrial firms also increase, and firms become more reliant on low-skilled workers. The more migrants in a city, the greater the available employees for industrial firms, particularly for low-skilled employees. However, the effects on high-skilled firms are much smaller or insignificant. In addition, we find that migrants have little impact on firms' capital-labor and capital-output ratios.

This approach generated larger immigration effects than area studies. More recently, studies of natural experiments analyzed migrations induced by political factors in the sending country (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These studies generally did not find a significant immigration effect on native outcomes.====Because immigrants are not commonly found in developing countries, most current research focuses on developed countries. Recently, though, deep structural transformations in developing countries have made rural-urban migration comparable to that of developed countries. For example, China saw 270 million rural-urban migrants in 2014.==== Policymakers in developing countries face similar problems as developed countries. In other words, how does rural-urban migration affect the labor market outcomes for ¡°urban natives¡±?====Using data from China, the world's largest developing country, this paper provides new evidence about immigration's impact on the host country's labor market. When studying immigration's impact on a receiving labor market, China is a particularly interesting case. First, as mentioned above, the number of rural-urban migrants in China is huge, accounting for about one-third of the urban labor force. Second, China is unique in its household registration system, which restricts not only labor moving from rural to urban areas but also labor moving between cities.==== Therefore, the number of ¡°urban natives¡± relocating in response to the influx of migrants is very small.==== For this reason, area studies might be more feasible for China.====, we construct a supply-push instrument based on past migrations, which is not correlated with current unobserved labor demand shocks. We also use heteroskedasticity-based instruments generated by ==== as a validation test.==== Without using valid external instruments, this technique identifies structural parameters in models with endogenous regressors. Identification is achieved because the regressors are uncorrelated with the product of heteroskedastic errors.====We find that rural-urban migrants have a positive effect on the wages of ¡°urban natives,¡± with the effect being larger for more skilled urban workers. Our IV estimations indicate that a ten-percentage point increase in the share of migrants in an urban labor force causes the wages of urban workers to rise an average of 6%. The wage rise for low-skilled urban workers is 4.5%, 5.3% for middle-skilled urban workers, and 7.6% for high-skilled urban workers. While ==== IV estimations are similar, the magnitudes are smaller: 3.4%, 3.6%, and 5.8%, respectively.====We then explore the possible effect of migrants on the wages of ¡°urban natives¡± from the aspect of labor supply and demand. First, from a supply perspective, we find that migration inflows lead to occupational upgrades for urban residents. For urban workers with low and medium skills, this upgrade is important. The share of occupational employment for high-skilled urban workers, though, declined slightly, without a concomitant upgrade. Because urban residents may become unemployed as a result of migration inflows,==== we use data that includes the urban unemployed. Consistent with earlier findings (====; ====), the results show slight evidence that the probability of unemployment decreases with the influx of migrants. From a demand perspective, we find that the greater the share of migrants in the urban labor force, the greater the number of manufacturing firms, especially low-skilled firms, and the higher the value added by skilled workers. Employment has a similar pattern. The higher the share of migrants in an urban labor force, the more employment in manufacturing firms, especially for low-skilled manufacturers. At the same time, migration has little impact on capital-labor and capital-output ratios. By establishing new firms or expanding production, capital can quickly adapt to the influx of low-skilled migrants. Since manufacturing firms can quickly absorb migrants, the negative impact on urban workers' wages is small.====This paper contributes to a large body of literature about the impact of immigration on the labor market (====), especially from the perspective of internal migration. Several related papers deal with China. ==== estimated the causal effects of migration inflows on urban firms.==== They found that migration inflows reduced labor costs and increased employment at destinations.

Burning high-fluoride-content coal indoors is the primary source of fluoride pollution in Guizhou Province of China. Exploiting longitudinal data from China Health and Nutrition Survey, we applied individual fixed effect models and triple difference models to examine the effects of whether households use coal as domestic fuel. The results showed that fluoride pollution from coal burning significantly increases the diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels of adults. And the pollution also leads to higher likelihood of underweight. Our further analysis indicated that fluoride pollution from coal burning during the infant period greatly reduces the height and weight of children in their childhood and adolescence periods. We also explore the mechanism by investigating the influence of fluoride pollution exposure on birthweight and find evidence that fluoride pollution had a negative impact on prenatal development.","Air pollution is a severe problem in China. In recent decades, this problem has attracted a lot of attention from both the public and the academic circles (====; ====). Air pollutants that are significant in outdoor air are often found in indoor air as well. As standards become stricter for these pollutants, problems on indoor pollution gains more attention. A World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2007 estimated the number of premature deaths due to indoor air pollution at 420, 000 annually, which was even higher than due to outdoor air pollution, estimated at around 300,000 deaths annually (====). Indoor air pollution comes from solid fuels (coal and biomass) for cooking and/or heating in households. Some coals have undergone mineralization, causing their enrichment in potentially toxic trace elements such as arsenic, fluorine, mercury, antimony, and thallium. In this paper, we focus on one aspect of indoor air quality: fluoride pollution from household coal-burning. Although an appropriate intake of fluoride is beneficial to the prevention of dental caries, excessive fluoride causes conditions such as dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and cardiovascular dysfunction, in addition to having adverse effects on infant and child development (====; ====; ====).====Currently, the health problems caused by fluoride are most severe in developing countries, particularly China and India. Drinking-water contamination and the burning of fuel that contains high levels of fluoride cause a substantial number of people worldwide to have excessive intake of fluoride. According to UNESCO statistics, over 200 million people worldwide consume drinking water with fluoride content that exceeds the standard of 1.5?mg/L recommended by the WHO (====; ====). In China, 87.28 million people are at risk of consuming high-fluoride drinking water.==== In India, the number is 66 million (====). In addition, 35.82 million people in China face the threat of indoor fluoride pollution from coal burning.====Although a large population of people are exposed to the threat of fluoride, few systematic empirical studies on the influence of fluoride on human health have been conducted beyond the domain of medical research. This is partly because fluorosis is endemic mainly in underdeveloped regions of the world, and its prevention is less urgent than that of infectious diseases. Thus, both governments and researchers have not paid sufficient attention to its potential threat to health and economic growth. Because programs for the prevention of fluorosis are only undertaken in limited areas within endemic regions,==== it is technically challenging to develop appropriate natural experiments to empirically study the effects of fluorosis on health.====To systematically identify the hazards of fluorosis to health, we developed empirical strategies based on the changes in domestic fuels in Guizhou Province, China. Because burning high-fluoride-content coal indoors is the major cause of fluorosis in Guizhou Province, whether households use coal as domestic fuel directly determines the severity of fluoride pollution in indoor spaces. Due to the closure and annexation of small private mines by the government, the coal supply for households has decreased markedly, and substantial numbers of families have changed their domestic fuels since 1997. Based on this likely exogenous change in fluoride pollution and by applying microdata from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study identified the effect of fluorosis on health in China. The results indicated that fluoride pollution from coal burning significantly increases the diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels of adults. And the pollution also leads to higher likelihood of underweight. In addition, by comparing the health of different children within the same family, we found that fluoride pollution from coal burning during the infant period greatly reduces the height and weight of children in their childhood and adolescence periods. To further verify that fluoride pollution is the major means through which fuel change affects health, we estimated a triple difference model by using the sample from two contiguous provinces, Hunan and Guangxi, as the control group. The results were still very robust. Therefore, fluoride pollution produced by coal burning causes very serious damage to the health of people in Guizhou.====This paper provides the following contributions to its field. First, significant adverse effects of fluorosis on health were identified systematically, providing a useful reference for the prevention and control of fluorine pollution in developing countries. Second, the study enriches the literature (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) on diseases, health, and economic development. Due to the negative health impact of fluorosis, economic development could be substantially hampered in the endemic regions. Thus, governments and related organizations should focus more on the prevention and control of fluorosis. Finally, this study revealed the long-term influence of exposure to fluoride pollution during infancy, indicating that fluorosis should be treated with comparable seriousness to malaria and iodine deficiency in pregnant women and infants (====; ====; ====).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: ==== presents a brief introduction to the hazards of fluorosis and the prevalence of fluorosis in Guizhou Province. ==== describes the empirical strategies and data sources of the study. ==== reports the empirical results of the influence of fluorosis on health. ==== provides a summary of the study.",Indoor air quality and health: Empirical evidence from fluoride pollution in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300276,7-Mar-19,2019,Research Article,373

We then use the difference-in-difference estimation strategy to investigate two-dimensional variations in periods (i.e., before and after 2015) and asset reversibility (i.e., high- and low-reversibility industries). The empirical results show that economic policy uncertainty significantly impedes real investment and reduces net debt issuance for private firms, whereas no such effects exist in state-owned firms. Interestingly, however, economic policy uncertainty has no significant impact on firms' cash-holding decisions.","The nexus between uncertainty and firms' financial decisions is an important issue in the literature, but different conclusions seem to emerge under different assumptions. One branch of studies finds a negative relationship between uncertainty and firms' investment in the case of risk aversion and incomplete markets (====; ====). Another branch of research, however, finds that uncertainty promotes investment under the assumption of perfect competition and constant returns to scale (====, ====; ====, ====). Still other studies emphasize that the investment¨Cuncertainty relationship is ambiguous (====).====In addition, ==== assert that firms make investment decisions by comparing the value of investing in the current period with the present value of investing at all possible times in the future. ====, ====).====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Furthermore, economic policy uncertainty increases financial market frictions (====; ====), especially the costs of external financing, including the risk of default (====; ====), the cost of debt (====) and the equity risk premium (====; ====). Therefore, it seems reasonable to conjecture that economic policy uncertainty can reduce firms' investment and net debt issuance while increasing their cash holdings.====To test these hypotheses, the supply-side structural reform in China at the end of 2015 provides a quasi-natural experiment to identify the causal relationships. China entered the ¡°new normal¡± stage in 2012, and the central government proposed the supply-side structural reform in 2015, which brought about more frequent and ambiguous policy adjustments than before, leading to greater policy uncertainty. More importantly, we employ industry-level asset reversibility as the treatment variable. The reason is that most investments entail sunk costs caused by asset irreversibility, which cannot be retrieved in the future, and the value of the waiting option is related to irreversibility (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). That is, a higher degree of irreversibility leads to higher sunk costs, so firms have more incentives to delay investment if the assets are more costly to trade in the secondary markets. Therefore, asset reversibility should determine the responses of firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions to economic policy uncertainty.====; ====; ====), the sensitivities of firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions to economic policy uncertainty are likely to be heterogeneous. In particular, the effects of economic policy uncertainty appear to be stronger in financially constrained firms (with higher costs of external financing) than in those with low financial constraints. Since state-owned firms in China are exposed to soft-budget constraints (====), we use firms' ownership to capture their financial constraints and then investigate whether heterogeneous effects exist in the underlying firms.====Our empirical analysis employs quarterly data for Chinese nonfinancial firms listed in the A-share stock market over the period from 2013 to 2017, during which the growth rate nearly remains stable. The baseline estimation results find that economic policy uncertainty impedes corporate investment and reduces net debt issuance for private firms but plays insignificant roles in state-owned firms. However, there are no significant relationships between firms' cash holdings and economic policy uncertainty. In detail, a 1-standard-deviation decrease in asset reversibility leads to a 0.141 (0.386) percentage-point decrease in the investment (net debt issuance) rate for private firms. Specifically, the negative effect of economic policy uncertainty on firms' net debt issuance is embodied in short-term debt rather than long-term debt. In addition, we conduct the difference-in-difference regressions using alternative econometric specifications and measures of asset reversibility, eliminating the possible effects of the stock market crash in 2015, randomly assigning asset reversibility across countries and so on. Our findings are robust to these checks.====One challenge in our identification is to find an appropriate measure of asset reversibility. According to ====, ==== and ====, among many others, asset reversibility refers to the sunk costs caused by investment irreversibility. ==== propose three measures of asset reversibility, including the ratio of investment over total assets, the comprehensive index of rent expenses, depreciation expenses and sale of property, plant and equipment and a 0¨C1 dummy variable for durables and nondurables. However, these proxies neglect the usability of assets both within and across industries. To compensate for this problem, ==== develop a framework to measure asset reversibility using the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) capital flow table.==== In this paper, we use the Kim¨CKung method to estimate the asset reversibility across industries in China based on China's national input¨Coutput (NIO) flow table.====The value addition of this paper to the literature is reflected in several aspects. First, this paper contributes to the empirical literature on how uncertainty affects firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions. Most previous studies explore the effects of political uncertainty/risk (e.g., ====; ====; ====), while some recent works investigate the impacts of economic policy uncertainty in the developed countries (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Differing from these studies, our paper examines the relationships between economic policy uncertainty and firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions in China, an emerging and developing country that is heavily dependent on government regulations. In particular, the supply-side structural reform for China in late 2015 led to greater policy uncertainty than before, which is used as a quasi-natural experiment in the identification scheme.====Second, this paper is relevant to the empirical literature on how financial constraints affect firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions. A plethora of works explore the measurement of firms' financial constraints (e.g., ====; ====; ====), while many other studies focus on examining the heterogeneous sensitivities of firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions for firms facing different financial constraints (e.g., ====; ====; ====). Nevertheless, little attention is paid to whether financial constraints play a significant role in the nexus of economic policy uncertainty and firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions. This paper measures firms' financial constraints using their ownership and shows that economic policy uncertainty has a stronger impact on investment¨Cfinancing decisions in firms with stronger financial constraints, indicating an asymmetric effect.====; ====; ====) and those of the ¡°four trillion¡± stimulus package (e.g., ====; ====), but scant research examines the impacts of the supply-side structural reform on firms' investment¨Cfinancing decisions.====It may be noted that ==== examines the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and firms' investment in China. They show that when the degree of economic policy uncertainty is higher, firms stand to lower their investment and vice versa. Albeit the topic in ==== is similar to the current paper, there are four main differences between our work and ====. ====, our paper highlights the importance of asset reversibility embedded in the real option theory in explaining the empirical findings. ====, the DID framework is utilized to mitigate endogeneity in our paper, which is also more effective in identifying causality. ====, we focus on whether firm's financial constraint matters for the nexus between economic policy uncertainty and their investment-financing decisions, which is not entirely covered by ====. ====, in addition to corporate investment in the cited study, our work also accounts for firms' financing (i.e., net debt issuance and cash holding) decisions. More importantly, we utilize the supply-side structural reform for China in late 2015 as external shock, contributing to the empirical literature on the influences of major events occurred in China. In addition, our paper applies the framework of ==== to China and then obtains the measure of asset reversibility across industries, which can be used to other related researches in the future.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background of the supply-side structural reform in China and discusses the logic behind its use as an exogenous shock to economic policy uncertainty.

Moreover, the correction of distortions in production factor costs (capital and labor) is necessary during certain reforms applied in the model; that is, on the one hand, higher credit costs for firms that face soft budget constraints (via financial transactions taxes) and, on the other hand, a catch-up of foreign firms' wages by domestic firms (via social security contributions).====These tax reforms bring welfare benefits to households and stabilize the welfare reaction to productivity shocks.

Developing and transition countries have witnessed tremendous increase in economic inequality (====; ====; ====).====The dramatic surge of inequality has raised concern by the government in many countries, as high inequality is considered to be associated with adverse consequences. A major concern of rising economic inequality is that inequality is harmful to economic development, as numerous researches have recorded this negative correlation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Such effect is found to be mediated via education (====), incentive of innovation (====), marked accessibility (====), trade (====), as well as preferential policies (====).====Scholars are seeking the causes of this phenomenon. ====; ====), whereas these policies per se may be the result of government ideology (====; ====; ====).====Among all these factors, the role of institution has been of particular interest by scholars. ==== linked electoral institutions and the scale of redistribution in mature democracies. Under proportional representation systems, center-left governments dominate, whereas under majoritarian systems, center-right governments dominate. It is by this reason that countries with proportional representation system redistribute more than those with majoritarian system. Situations vary in new democracies. ==== compared the effect of electoral competition on redistributive efforts in Korea and Taiwan, and find that there is almost no effect in Korea while in Taiwan electoral margin is negatively correlated with redistributive effort. In China, the only popular election happens in rural villages, which was introduced gradually since the late 1980s. ====Compared to the rich knowledge for democracies, less is known for the relations between institution and economic inequality when the political system is non-democratic. Among the limited attentions, ==== found a sharp contrast between democracies and non-democracies in the effect of trade expansion on income inequality that in democracies trade expansion is associated with a significant increase in income equality, whereas non-democracies saw exactly the opposite side because the two types of countries are usually endowed with different industrial structure, therefore it is not political institutions per se that lead to the results.====In this paper, we utilize a unique political arrangement in China which symbolizes non-democratic institutions to analyze the effect of political institution on economic inequality. Compared to many countries where politicians who run for the top positions in subnational or local government usually have deep root in the region, China seems to be an exception. There has been a tradition of inter-regional cadre exchange since the ancient empire. Nowadays, many provincial and city leaders today are non-native people, neither have they lived in the city or province long before they take the office. Instead, they are exchanged from other localities and appointed as provincial or city leader forthwith.====We record the political career of city office-holders¡ªthe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secretaries and the mayors, and classify them by their local residence prior to holding the office. We then analyze the welfare consequence for having a city leader with or without local residence in terms of economic inequality by utilizing a household survey dataset. We find that expenditure inequality is significantly lower in cities with long locally resided leaders (henceforth, ¡°locals¡±) compared to those with leaders transferred from other cities (henceforth, ¡°outsiders¡±). Measured by the Gini coefficient, the average gap between the two types of cities is approximately 0.025, which accounts for almost 6% of the average Gini coefficient. We find that smaller inequality is generated by more generous delivery of targeted transfers directly to low-income households when the city leader is local.====This paper also contributes to the governance of politicians in China and its consequences. In the absence of popular election of the government, economic performance-based yardstick competition is believed to be widespread in China's government system and treated as a significant incentive for local leaders (====; ====; ====) and to have contributed at a great extent to the rapid growth of the China's economy during the 1980s to 2000s. A unique characteristic of China's cadre governance that has been overlooked by economists is that cadres are often switched between localities of the same administrative level (====), which implies that most of the leading local officials are not local. In a recent research, ==== find empirical evidence from the switches of provincial leaders: party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern spend a higher share of budgetary resources on education and health care and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces. They then consider outsiders as career maximizers, whereas locals may either be partly driven by other considerations, or may be constrained in implementing the career-maximizing policy mix. Our research extends ====) and enhance the selection of cadres (====), implying that such institutions should be scrutinized more cautiously by taking into consideration the loss of welfare of local residents.====; ====). Depending on the specific program, the age, employment status, and income, among other personal characteristics, of the median voter are pivotal to policy makers (====). Moreover, special interest groups can lobby policy makers at a cost for the policy they prefer. For example, low-income seniors are more dependent on the program and are more active in political participation with regard to social security (====; ====, ====). In recent studies, evidence shows that the birthplaces of the political elites are favored in the allocation of the government transfers, even for the electoral system (====; ====). Our findings show that in the absence of a popular election, the ¡°ideology¡±¡ªthe characteristics and preference of local leaders¡ªalso affect social security spending, and the gap in such spending may affect social inequality.====Lastly, this paper relates to the literature on the equalizing effect of social security programs. Most of the studies focus on the impacts of social security programs on income inequality rather than expenditure inequality but have not reached consistent conclusions. ==== finds that a high replacement rate of unemployment compensation has entailed strong adverse incentives in the USA, as most of the unemployment benefits go to middle- and upper-income families, which results in a higher level of inequality. Many later studies also support this idea that some government transfer programs might cause greater inequality because a disproportionately large percentage of these benefits are received by middle- or high-income families (====; ====). However, there are also many papers on the opposite side showing that social security programs can help reduce inequality (====; ====; ====). ====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a brief introduction on China's facts of inequality, the cadre governance, and the social security system to serve as background information which facilitates our research.

Today, China not only accounts for the world's largest share in world GDP (18.26% versus 15.29% for the United States (US) in 2017; see World Economic Outlook, WEO, 10-2017) but is also the world's leading exporter (having surpassed the US in 2007 and Germany in 2009) and the world's second largest importer (====).====However, in 2011, China's growth rate started to decline and amounted to ¡°only¡± 6.9% in 2017 according to official figures; many observers have assessed growth in China as being even lower (although still quite high compared to other emerging market economies (EMEs) at the same development stage). There is a considerable body of literature has emerged dealing with the concerns that the China's growth strategy is unsustainable, arguing that the Chinese economy needs rebalancing==== (meaning, among other things, a shift from an investment- and export-led to a more consumption- and inward-driven growth path). Hence, China could soon be confronted with a further severe growth slowdown or could even enter a middle-income trap (MIT).==== The latter term has already emerged in the political debate in China. For example, in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos 2015, the Chinese premier Li Keqiang mentioned the various reforms China has to undertake in order to ¡°successfully overcome the ¡®middle-income trap¡¯.¡±====Our paper deals with the question of whether China is in the MIT or will enter the MIT in the future. We discuss the relevant (basic and applied) MIT literature and (i) apply various empirical MIT definitions to China and (ii) analyze the development of various MIT triggering factors for the Chinese economy to discuss the answers to this question.====The previous literature on the MIT and China can be divided into two branches. There is ==== (i.e., cross-country studies==== and case studies==== that try to construct MIT definitions and/or find MIT triggering factors in general), often applying its results to China. Furthermore, there are ==== particularly exploring the development indices (and ¡°MIT triggering factors¡±) in China and attempting to derive policy implications to avoid the MIT.==== While the papers of ==== discuss their implications for China rather informally and parenthetically, we focus our attention on China and apply, among others, the consensus results of branch (A) for predicting whether China is in the MIT or whether it will fall into the MIT.==== has not achieved consensus regarding the answers to the questions of whether China is in the MIT and/or whether it will get caught in an MIT. In contrast to branch (B), we do not base our discussion only on triggering factors, but also consider the MIT definition approaches, to analyze whether China is or will fall into the MIT. In this way, we add further arguments to the discussion in the literature on branch (B). Furthermore, we have a different focus regarding the choice of the main triggering factors in comparison to the branch (B) consensus, since we base our analysis more strongly on the MIT basic research results (branch (A)).====Despite the increasing number of articles dealing with the MIT, there is still no clear and generally accepted definition, and some researchers are rather skeptical about whether the MIT exists in the sense that middle-income countries more frequently experience a growth slowdown than countries in other income ranges. Obviously, this question is important, since we do not need to worry about China entering an MIT if the MIT does not exist. Therefore, in ====, we first take a closer look at the discussion in the literature regarding the existence of an MIT, before we further analyze whether China is or will be confronted with it in ====, ====. In ====, we first analyze the definitions according to which China is or will be in the MIT (or not). In ====, we then focus on the MIT triggering factors. There we provide an overview of the triggering factors identified in the literature and study the empirical evidence on the development of the most important triggering factors in China for assessing whether China will enter the MIT. Finally, ==== briefly summarizes our main findings and derives some policy implications.",China in the middle-income trap?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300033,14-Jan-19,2019,Research Article,378

Over the 2000¨C2014 period, China allocated 971, 218 and 138 ODA projects to African countries in the social infrastructure and services sector, the economic infrastructure and services sector and the production sector respectively. Between 2000 and 2014, the economic infrastructure and services sector was the first sector in terms of ODA amount with a total of US$18.9 billion ahead from the social infrastructure and services sector with US$7 billion or the production sector with US$3.1 billion. Results of our analysis suggest that the motivations of Chinese aid allocation to African countries differ by sector. Chinese ODA in the social infrastructure and services sector appears more responsive to the economic needs of recipient countries but is also more driven by foreign policy considerations. Chinese economic interest, in particular for natural resources acquisition, is associated with China's ODA allocation in the economic infrastructure and services sector. Finally, while governance quality in recipient countries is not related to Chinese ODA in the social infrastructure and services sector, we find that China allocates more ODA in the economic infrastructure and services sector and the production sector to African countries with weaker institutions. One of the strong conclusions of this study is to show that considering only China's overall aid to Africa can be misleading as to its underlying determinants, and therefore to point out the need to disaggregate the analysis by ODA sectors.","The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was created in 2000 in Beijing in order to strengthen Sino-African economic cooperation and diplomatic relationships. Since 2000, the volume of Sino-African trade has increased tremendously from US$9.7 billion in 2000 to a peak of US$215.9 billion in 2014 (United Nations Comtrade Database). Over the last 20?years, Chinese Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in Africa have also risen drastically. The global Chinese FDI stock in Africa increased from US$0.5 billion in 2003 to US$21.7 billion in 2012 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Bilateral FDI Statistics). This stock reached US$34.7 billion in 2015 (2015 Statistical Bulletin of China's Outward Foreign Direct Investment).====Since the creation of the FOCAC in 2000, Chinese official development assistance (ODA) to Africa has also largely increased. Between 2000 and 2014, African countries have received as much as 1592 Chinese ODA projects for a total amount of 34.8 billion of 2014US$. In the political science literature, China is often accused of allocating its ODA in its own interests. China would allocate ODA to African countries mainly to guarantee its access to the natural resources of these countries and to secure export markets for its products. Moreover, Chinese ODA to Africa would also be used to extend China's international support (====; ====). China refutes these accusations and states to allocate its ODA in response to the needs expressed by the recipient countries, following an equality and mutual benefit principle and according to a non-interference principle (Declaration of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, 2006/11/05; ====; ====).====In addition to the literature on the determinants and impacts of Chinese FDI (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), a recent literature on the determinants of Chinese ODA to African and non-African countries has emerged. As in the broader aid allocation literature focusing on traditional donors, this recent literature has investigated the role of three types of variables that might influence Chinese aid allocation decisions: the needs and merits of recipient countries and the economic and political interests of China. ==== study the determinants of Chinese aid allocation to all recipient countries over the 1956¨C2006 period. The authors use several data sources and focus on total Chinese aid as well as food aid and the number of Chinese medical teams sent to recipient countries. Their results point to the lack of influence of recipient countries' oil production for the receipt of total ODA projects and food aid but not for the receipt of Chinese medical teams. On the contrary, they show that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voting alignment of recipient countries with China is positively correlated with all types of Chinese aid received except food aid. Results of ==== also underline the prominence of political considerations in Chinese aid allocation. ==== finds that authoritarian countries do not systematically receive more Chinese official finance. In a very recent study, ==== focus on total amounts of Chinese ODA and OOF to African countries over the 2000¨C2013 period. Their results confirm those of ====. Indeed, they find that foreign policy considerations, as measured by Taiwan recognition, UNGA voting alignment or temporary membership of African countries on the United Nations Security Council, are significantly correlated with Chinese ODA amount and Chinese grants. On the contrary, they find that Chinese economic interests, as measured by recipient countries' trade with China or oil production, do not impact ODA allocation but only the allocation of less concessional flows (OOF). ==== study the factors associated with Chinese health ODA projects and amounts to African countries between 2006 and 2013. They find that Chinese health aid is responsive to the economic needs (as measured by the Gross Domestic Product - GDP - per capita) of recipient countries while it is unrelated to various measures of health needs or governance quality in African countries. They also find no strong evidence that Chinese health aid allocation decisions favour natural resource-rich countries or countries with important commercial ties with China. As highlighted by ==== and ==== for Chinese ODA in all sectors, results of ==== confirm the idea that China uses its health aid as part of its foreign policy since non-adherence to the One-China policy makes the receipt of Chinese health aid very unlikely.====Existing literature on the determinants of Chinese aid allocation mainly focused on total aid flows or on specific types of aid such as food aid, health aid or the sending of medical teams. However, Chinese motivations for aid allocation might differ depending on the ODA sector considered. Three main types of aid sectors are defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD): the social infrastructure and services sector (thereafter referred to as the social sector), the economic infrastructure and services sector (thereafter referred to as the economic sector) and the production sector. Given the explicit economic interests of China in specific areas of African economies, such as the energy or the transportation sectors, one might hypothesize that economic motivations are more important in driving Chinese aid allocation in the economic and production sectors compared to the social sector. On the other hand, motivations behind aid allocation to the social sector might be more related to the needs of African countries given the lack of direct economic interests of China in this sector. Besides pure ====, aid allocation in the social sector might also be used by China as a soft power to extend its international support and visibility.====Our objective is to study the factors associated with Chinese aid allocation to African countries over the 2000¨C2014 period. In particular, we aim to test whether variables related to the needs and merits of African countries and to the political and economic interests of China differently impact the volume of Chinese aid to African countries depending on the sector considered. Compared to the existing literature, this will refine our understanding of the factors influencing the allocation of Chinese aid to Africa. Given the lack of Chinese official ODA data, we measure Chinese aid allocation to Africa using the last version of AidData's Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset (Version?1.0), 2000¨C2014 (====). We focus on the number of Chinese ODA projects and on ODA amount. For ODA amount, the analysis is restricted to the economic broad sector given the very high shares of social and production projects that lack financial valorisation, 60.7% and 54.3% respectively.====Between 2000 and 2014, China allocated 971 ODA projects to African countries in the social sector. Over the same period, China financed 218 projects in the economic sector, amounting for a total of US$18.9 billion, and 138 projects in the production sector. Our results suggest that factors associated with Chinese aid allocation depend on the sector considered. ODA in the social sector appears more responsive to the needs of African countries while it is also further linked to foreign policy considerations. Natural resources acquisition is associated with total Chinese ODA allocation and more specifically to ODA allocation in the economic and social sectors. Finally, in line with results found by the literature on the determinants of Chinese FDI, China tends to allocate more economic and production sector ODA to African countries with weaker political governance.",What can we learn on Chinese aid allocation motivations from available data?

This problem has been recently admitted as arising from research attention biased towards household saving, yet savings by the corporate and public sectors (termed the non-household sector) may be more important in China. We find strong evidence that the biased distribution of national income towards the non-household sector is a key determinant of high aggregate saving in China, with this situation reinforced by its huge surplus labor. Such a sectoral perspective, albeit useful for elucidating Chinese savings, was previously used in descriptive discussions. This perspective is formally taken into account in our empirical study generating significant findings. We also show that high Chinese savings have more or less to do with other economic, demographic, and institutional factors as identified in the literature.","A trade war has been recently launched by the U.S. against China as its largest source of trade deficits (====). However, Trump tariffs will not have much impact on this problem because it is the savings-investment gap that drives the trade balance, not the other way around (====). Trade deficits of the U.S. are caused by its falling and low savings relative to its level of investment, and its recent deficit-financed tax cuts and spending hikes are likely to worsen its current account (====). The U.S. deficits with China have become more serious even during the trade war, and this situation is due to the savings-investment gap that has long existed in China as well as in the U.S. It is thus worthwhile to address why the U.S. has saved so less and why China has saved so much (e.g., 52.5% of GDP in 2008) (====). This study will focus only on the Chinese saving issue.====Yet this is a difficult issue called the ¡°Chinese saving puzzle¡± (====), which was hotly debated not long ago but has not been resolved yet in the literature. China was blamed on its ¡°savings glut¡± for trade frictions, economic imbalances, and even global financial crises (====; ====). Various studies have emerged to explain this glut, but there exist certain flaws in those explanations as reviewed in the next section. The issue still remains open to debate as revisited in our paper. A serious flaw in the past studies was the biased attention paid only to household saving. Such saving is most important to aggregate (or national) saving in other economies but may not be so crucial in China, especially for the recent period (after 2000).====While progress has been made in understanding China's household saving behavior, the literature is void of research on savings by its corporate and public sectors (referred to as the non-household or state sector) (====).==== China's household saving fluctuated around 20% of GDP in 2002 but has since increased only slightly; in contrast, its non-household saving has grown steeply, rising above 32% in 2008 (====). Thus focusing on household saving portrays an incomplete picture of aggregate saving (====; ====). To obtain a full picture, enough attention should be paid to the non-household as well as household savings. This paper attaches more importance to the corporate and public savings.====One reason for imprecise estimation of China's national saving is that the empirical work is based on flawed consumption theories which involve no income distribution. China's high rate of aggregate saving is attributable to the unequal distribution of income, through which the corporate, public, and household sectors are interrelated to each other. As more of national income is distributed to the investing non-household sector and as disposable income increases faster in this sector than in the consuming household sector, a natural outcome must be a rising and high rate of aggregate saving. It is therefore necessary to examine, as done in this paper, the effects of income distribution on the saving of each sector. Although the implication of those effects for aggregate saving was discussed in various op-eds and descriptive reports (====; ====), no formal empirical study for this implication has been conducted yet in the literature. Our paper will fill such a gap.====The paper establishes empirical evidence for the sectoral income distribution as a key determinant of China's national saving. This distribution is a common factor for all sectors as more of the given income distributed to one sector implies less of it left to another. These sectors are interrelated via this factor that, however, may have differing impacts on aggregate saving. Following previous studies our regression includes other economic, demographic, and institutional factors as control variables specific to sectors. Each of these covariates plays a special role for sectoral and national savings. A distinction between saving rates and propensities is made to elucidate the different effects on saving behavior of the common factor and specific factors. A two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is used to deal with endogenous variables in regressions for propensities and rates of sectoral savings. A ====The paper proceeds as follows.

In China, 169 million rural residents have been migrating and an additional 292 million are expected to become urbanized in the next two to three decades.==== Undoubtedly, their migration and settlement patterns will directly shape the form of urbanization and influence the extent to which China can reap benefits via the process of urbanization to sustain its economic growth and development.====Existing studies have focused on the temporary migration of Chinese rural residents, and several common patterns have been identified in recent years (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). First, migrants have been increasingly reluctant to leave their home origins to work in other provinces (====). Second, migrants desire large cities as migration destinations (====). ==== specifically point out the sudden drop in inter-provincial migration since the late 2000s and the continuously declining proportion of migrants flowing to the eastern regions. From the perspective of temporary migration, recent studies suggest the rising importance of within-province migration in shaping China's urbanization process. Compared to the temporary migration activities, permanent migration can be more relevant to understanding the form of urbanization that is taking place in China. However, little is known about rural migrants' permanent migration patterns and intentions.====This paper complements the existing literature by offering new evidence on permanent migration of Chinese rural residents. Permanent migration in this study is defined as rural residents permanently settling down in urban areas, which refers to not only the change of hukou status to a location different from the original rural location but also the permanence of settlement in the new location. Specifically, this study documents the actual permanent migration choices and analyzes the permanent migration intentions of Chinese rural residents under different urbanization policy scenarios.====The data used in this paper comes from self-collected rural household surveys conducted over 2006¨C2015, interviewing and following 1200 rural households in Zhijiang city, Hubei province in China. The longitudinal nature of the data collected in migrants' source community makes it possible to trace actual permanent migration over a relatively long period of time and study the magnitude and pattern of permanent migration without the common problem of attrition, this feature is generally absent from most of the rural household surveys or migrant surveys done in the destination communities. In addition to the actual permanent migration activities, the surveys contain questions that solicit permanent migration intentions in hypothetical policy scenarios, which allows for examining how the relaxation of China's traditional urbanization policy instruments, namely urban hukou restrictions and the rural ==== institution, could affect the pattern of permanent migration intentions. In particular, as China is increasingly removing hukou restrictions and guaranteeing rural residents' land rights to stimulate the process of urbanization, this study embeds choice experiments in the survey questions in order to measure the intended permanent migration responsiveness of rural residents to changes in the rural land rights institution if hukou restrictions are eliminated in all Chinese cities.====The main findings are the following. First, despite the rapid rise in the urbanization rate in China between 2006¨C2015, the actual permanent migration out of Zhijiang is scanty. At the same time, the actual permanent migration pattern shows a home province dominance. Interest in large cities among permanent migrants is limited to large cities nearby and within the home province. In terms of permanent migration intentions, responses from the hypothetical policy scenario that eliminates hukou restrictions in all Chinese cities reveal that the rural residents in Zhijiang are reluctant to engage in inter-provincial migration. Over time, the proportion of people who intended to leave the home province in the policy context of fully removing hukou restrictions in all Chinese cities even falls. The survey-based choice experiment reveals that China's recent rural land rights policy change, which removes the condition of rural land rights on rural hukou status, is effective to induce Zhijiang's rural residents to permanently leave their home villages, moderately effective in stimulating them to migrate out of their home city, but is not impactful at all in engendering permanent, inter-provincial migration. Furthermore, in the hypothetical policy context of the government fully levels the playing field of hukou entry for all ==== and guarantees rural land rights unconditionally, at low values of years of schooling, an additional year has a negative effect on the intention to engage in permanent inter-provincial migration. An important limitation of the findings is that they are based on the local field survey data instead of a nationally representative dataset. The drawback lies in the limited scope of a local case study to identify the potential impact of national poliy. The benefit is that it is specifically desgined to study permanent migration and contains featues generally unavailable in nationally representative dataset. The trade-off notwithstanding, local case studies can be valuable to shed light on the urbanization proces in China. The results drawn from local surveys should be intrepreted with caustion and corroborated with general findings in the literature and with patterns at the national level.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes China's urbanization policy, the background of which is key to understanding the hypothetical policy questions conducted in the local surveys that focus on the two traditional policy instruments, namely urban hukou restrictions and the rural land rights institution. Section 3 introduces the dataset used. Section 4 documents the pattern of actual permanent migration. Section 5 analyses the intentions of permanent migration. Section 6 discusses a reversal of the migration pattern that contributes to the observed within-province dominance of permanent migration intentions. The final section offers concluding remarks.","Permanent migration desire of Chinese rural residents: Evidence from field surveys, 2006¨C2015",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1930001X,4-Jan-19,2019,Research Article,381

However, the US defaulted the payment for their staff dispatched to and stationed in China which forced China to make huge sums of advance payment. The total costs of American military presence in China, including China's Reverse Lend-Lease contribution as a return to US military aid, amounted 15% to 22% of China's total fiscal expenditures. Since the beginning of 1937, the price indices increased only 200% by 1941 but rocketed to 1600 times by 1945. We develop a dynamic Fiscal Theory of ==== (FTPL) to capture the relationship between fiscal shocks and price level. Our ==== levels using provincial panel data 1937¨C1945.

In January 1944, General Joseph Stilwell requested Ho, Ying-chin, (the Commander in chief of the Chinese army in China theater), to provide fresh beef from Yunnan and ship to India. But there were no cattle in Yunnan available any more. Because of U.S. military presence in Yunnan since 1941, even work cattle were expropriated and slaughtered for meat consumption by the U.S. troops stationed in China and Burma. By early 1944, Yunnan had already relied on cattle in neighboring provinces for the consumption of U.S. troops.====Needless to say, the shortage of beef was just a tip of the iceberg. The outbreak of the Pacific War marks the beginning of the formal U.S. military and economic aids to China, under the ¡°Lend-Lease Act¡±====These military aids, although strengthened China's air supremacy against Japanese and helped to establish air force in southwest China, and provided the only life line from allied nations, mainly Burma, they nevertheless had significant negative impacts on the Chinese economy. This is because a significant share of the cost of U.S. military presence and operations was disbursed by China.====As pointed out by existing studies (e.g., ====). The hyperinflation continued into the civil war during 1946¨C49 and the revenue seeking (from seigniorage) nature of the government was confirmed and even quantified in existing studies such as ====.====The notorious hyperinflation since 1940 resulted many criticisms and dissatisfaction on the financial and monetary management of the Nationalist government (e.g. ====, ====; ====; ====). The existent studies believe that the cost for China to finance the U.S. military aid was huge if not catastrophic. For instance, ==== estimates that the cost of U.S. military aid in China which was paid for by the Nationalist government, was over 50 billion. The monthly disbursement was almost C$ 4 billion per month before Feb. 1944 (====).==== China's inflation was moderate before the outbreak of the Pacific War and significantly heightened afterward.====The CPI increased fleetingly after 1942. Compared to the price in 1937, the price in 1938 rose 39%, and the price in 1944 increased 191% from 1943. In 1945 it was the 1500 times of 1937 level. The direct reason of this hyperinflation is the currency devaluation through over-issuance. The Minister of Finance at the time, O.K. Yui, reported that the government issued a total of ==== (Chinese National Currency) C$100,319 billion during the wartime, or over 7300 times than in pre-war (1933¨C1937) level (====). The issuance of ==== in 1938 was 40.6% more compared to 1937 level, and 87.2% more in 1939 compared to previous year, in 1942, the annual increase was 132.5%. The issuance of ==== in the first eight months of 1945 was 556.9 billion, which was 390 times of pre-war level (====).====Although the finance of American presence in China and disbursement have been studied from an accounting perspective, there is no existing research, however, to the best of our knowledge, has quantified the impacts of reverse Lend-lease on China's wartime finance and inflation. Through archival investigations, we find that the total spending on disbursements for U.S. military aid in China of the period 1942¨C1945, was C$ 246 billion==== from the Treasury of the Nationalist government, which was roughly 7% of total military expenditures of China.====The conventional understanding of U.S. aid to China was based on political considerations, i.e., a strategy or propaganda to ensure post-bellum U.S. interest in Asia-Pacific (====; ====). These commentators tend to exaggerate the positive effect of the aid and some completely neglects the cost of the aid to China (====; ====). By contrast, most studies by Chinese authors observe the negative consequences of the aid (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== notices the monetary impact of the Reverse Lend-Lease, but does not offer a quantitative analysis and attributes the hyperinflation to the mismanagement of Nationalist government. The current paper is first one to investigate the causal relationship between the Reverse Lend-Lease and China's wartime inflation.==== asserted that ¡°inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon¡± and the fiscal policy is often thought to be unimportant for inflation determination. Over the last 25?years, this view of price determination has been challenged, suggesting that fiscal policy might even play the dominant role in certain circumstances. For example, ====, ==== and ====; Cochrance, 2005; etc.) became known as the ==== (FTPL).====Our structural model based on FTPL framework characterizes the dynamics of nominal and real money supply, as well as price levels, upon impacts from current period government consumptions. Using parameter values from other historical studies, our simulation results confirm the predictions of the FTPL model. From the Euler equation governing intertemporal real money balance and consumptions, we derive an empirically testable hypothesis and our empirical results based on provincial panel data support the relationship between fiscal expenditures and price levels derived from theory model.",Where is the beef?

On the other hand, ==== and ====In this paper, we attempt to transcend the problem of understanding which of these assumptions are right by using a variable that can act as an ¡°impartial referee¡± for the macroeconomic proxies. ==== and ====, ====, ==== and ====). We believe that this is a reasonable assumption because errors in nighttime lights come from variation in weather patterns as well as from variation in satellite quality over time. On the other hand, errors in GDP and other official series come from misreporting by individuals, firms and other institutions, as well as from methodological choices of statistical offices. Therefore, there is little reason to believe that these errors have anything to do with each other.====Under our crucial assumption and using data across Chinese provinces and over time for the period 2004¨C2013, a regression of log nighttime lights on the macro proxies as well as on province and year fixed effects yields coefficients on the proxies that are proportional to the proxies' optimal weights (see the mathematical framework in Section 2.1). We find that the Li Keqiang variables are significant predictors of nighttime lights growth, but that their optimal weights differ substantively from a simple average. In particular, bank loans receive considerably more than one-half of the total weight, while railroad freight receives much less than one-third. Electricity production also typically receives a large and statistically significant coefficient, but it may be biased upward if our core identification assumption fails. Formally testing that the coefficients on the three Li Keqiang variables are equal rejects this null hypothesis in most specifications, and the failures to reject are driven by large standard errors rather than similar coefficients. Since the growth rate of loans is larger and more stable over time than the growth rates of electricity and (especially) freight, this finding is important for predicting true unobserved Chinese GDP growth. Moreover, we find that adding log GDP to the separate components of the Li Keqiang index does not materially change the coefficients on the Li Keqiang variables, and the coefficient on log GDP is only marginally significant. We also find that conservative adjustments for the potential correlation between the measurement error in nighttime lights and the measurement error in electricity do not change our conclusions concerning the importance of loans in explaining nighttime lights. We perform similar regressions including other variables besides the Li Keqiang components that have been used by analysts to predict Chinese growth (e.g. retail sales, passenger traffic, and floor space under construction, among others) and find that bank loans continue to be important in explaining nighttime lights, and therefore, in predicting Chinese economic growth.====For each regression that we run, we construct forecasts for the path of Chinese growth in a two-step process. First, we calculate indices of the growth rates of the macroeconomic proxies using the optimal weights implied by the regression coefficients from the provincial-level regressions mentioned above. A remaining problem is that the regression coefficients are proportional, but not identical, to the variables' optimal weights, and any intercept is unidentified. Hence, in the second step, we normalize the resulting growth paths by regressing the official GDP growth path on these indices for the 2004¨C2012 period. We use the predicted values of this second regression (in and out of sample) as our predicted GDP growth series. We obtain standard errors for the predicted paths of Chinese GDP growth by parametric bootstrapping from the asymptotic distribution of the estimated coefficients from the provincial-level regression. We find that GDP growth in 2015 Q4, a time when the financial press was awash with stories about a hard landing of the Chinese economy, is somewhat higher, but quite close to the officially reported rate, with a 95% confidence interval that precludes growth rates below the officially reported level at that time, though our findings are consistent with growth rates having declined by more ¨C from a higher level immediately after the crisis ¨C than was reported. We also obtain this finding in our most comprehensive specifications that include different sets of macro proxies corresponding to the various indices used by market participants to predict the Chinese economy. Our finding is intuitive because the nighttime lights suggest a particularly large weight for bank loans in the best unbiased linear predictor of Chinese economic growth, and, unlike freight and electricity growth, which fell during 2015, bank loan growth remained high over the course of that time.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the mathematical framework for using nighttime lights to construct optimal indices of predictor variables. Section 3 presents a description of the data. Section 4 describes our methodology for converting the index values into forecasts. Section 5 presents the baseline results. Section 6 presents results with covariates from other indices of the Chinese economy. Section 7 concludes.====The raw data for this analysis was collected from the CEIC China Premium database, with all series, calculations, and adjustments (as relevant) described below (CEIC series codes are available on request). The main regressions using provincial and nighttime light data were conducted with annual series. National level GDP forecasts utilized quarterly series. All growth rates were calculated as year-over-year log differences.====Log GDP: Log nominal or real GDP (depending on context).====Log Primary, Log Secondary, Log Tertiary: Log nominal or real GDP (depending on context) by sector.====Log LS GDP: Log real ¡°Pseudo Lombard St. GDP¡±. LS GDP is calculated from official nominal GDP growth and a deflator comprised of the weighted average of the CPI, fixed asset price index, and export and import unit value indexes, using 2010 GDP weights of consumption, investment, exports, and imports. The resulting series has a correlation of 0.97 with the actual Lombard Street Research proprietary real GDP index, which was kindly provided to the authors.====Log Electricity: Log electricity production, kWh bn, at national and provincial level. Due to missing data in 1/2016 and 2/2016, data for Q1 2016 is filled-in by linear interpolation.====Log Rail Freight: Railway freight traffic, million tons.====Log Loans: Log bank loans in local currency. Provincial annual data is the annual average of monthly data. In order to help control for certain bad loan write-offs and series breaks, national level monthly data is computed from the stock of RMB loans at end 2001 and the cumulative ¡°new increased loans in local currency¡± from the official aggregate financing (¡°total social financing¡±) data. The national level quarterly data is computed as the three month average of this monthly data.====Log Total Freight: Log total freight traffic, million tons, by air, inland water, rail, and road.====Log Retail Sales: Log retail sales of consumer goods, RMB billions, at provincial level. To mitigate problems caused by missing data in January and February, substantial discrepancies between officially published year-to-date and monthly data in levels, and substantial discrepancies between officially published levels and percent changes, the following methodology is used to construct the national quarterly series: A nominal index in levels is constructed from the officially published seasonally adjusted monthly change from 1/2011 to the present, and backwards from 12/2010 to 1/2004 using the officially published percent year-over-year change series, which is regarded as being adjusted to make data comparable to earlier readings. Note that the methodology underlying the officially published percent change is non-transparent, appears to have undergone numerous series breaks since the mid-1990s, and in years prior to 2011 at least may have included some adjustments for price increases. In practice, during the period 2005 to 2010 the officially published year-over-year percent change is always nearly identical to the percent change computed from officially published levels except for 2005 and 2010, when the officially published percent change is substantially lower and smoother. The quarterly index is computed as the three-month average of this monthly index.====Log VAI: Log real value added of industry. For provincial annual data indexes in levels are computed from official real percent growth data. To minimize missing data, for national level data an index is levels is computed from official monthly seasonally adjusted changes from 1/2011 to the present, and backwards from 12/2010 to 1/2004 from the officially published real percent year-over-year changes. The quarterly index is computed as the three-month average of the monthly data. Due to missing data in January, the first quarters of 2004 to 2011 includes only February and March.====Log FAI: Log of nominal fixed asset investment, RMB millions. Quarterly national level series is computed from the officially reported year-to-date data.====Log Exports: Log exports, by location of exporter, USD millions, at national and provincial level. Converted to RMB at the average annual or quarterly exchange rate, as relevant.====Log Imports: Log imports, by location of importer, USD millions, at national and provincial level. Converted to RMB at the average annual or quarterly exchange rate, as relevant.====Log Steel Production: Log industrial production of steel products, thousand tons, at provincial level from China Iron and Steel Association, and at national level from National Bureau of Statistics. The quarterly national level series is computed from the officially reported year-to-date data.====Log Floor Space: Log of floor space under construction, commodity building residential and non-residential, square meters, at national and provincial level. Annual data is floor space under construction as of December. Quarterly is floor space under construction as of the end of each quarter.====Log Floor Start: Log of floor space started, commodity building residential and non-residential, square meters. Annual series is cumulative starts through December of each year. Quarterly series is floor space started in each quarter computed from officially published year-to-date monthly data.====Log Passengers: Log of transport passenger traffic by air, road, water, and rail, millions of persons.====Log RE Investment: Log of real estate investment, RMB millions. Quarterly series is computed from officially published year-to-date data.====Log Air Thrput: Log of airport passenger traffic. Provincial data is ¡°airport passenger throughput¡± in thousands of persons and national data is ¡°air passenger traffic¡± in millions of persons.====Log Deflator: Implicit overall GDP deflators computed from nominal and real GDP series for both annual provincial GDP and quarterly national GDP.====Log FAI Price Index: Log of the fixed asset price index at the national level.====Log Retail Price Index: Log of the retail price index at the national level.====Urban Population: Total population residing in cities and towns for each province or region, including military personnel of the People's Liberation Army.",China's GDP growth may be understated,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301470,11-Dec-18,2018,Research Article,383

The purpose of this paper is to provide an evidence on the impacts of climate change on China's agriculture, with particular attention to the market and trade responses. Using projected crop yield changes for China and its' main trading partners under changing climate, we employ an agricultural partial equilibrium model (CAPSiM) and a linked national and global equilibrium model (CAPSiM-GTAP) to assess the impacts on food production, price, trade and self-sufficiency of China. Our results show that climate change will have significant effects on crop production though with large differences among crops. Under the worst climate change scenario RCP 8.5, wheat yield in China is projected to decline by 9.4% by 2050, which is the biggest yield reduction among the crops. However, the market can also respond to the climate change, as farmers can change inputs in response to reduced yields and rising prices. As a result, production losses for most crops are dampened. For example, wheat production loss under RCP8.5 reduces to only 4.3% due to market response. The adverse impacts on crop production will be further reduced after accounting for the trade response as farmers adjust production to much higher prices in the more severely affected countries. The paper concludes that we need to learn more from farmers who optimize their production decisions in response to the market and trade signals during climate change. A major policy implication is that policymakers need to mainstream the market and trade responses into national plans for climate adaptation.","China's agriculture is expected to face challenges in the future mainly due to rising food demand and constraints of land and water resources. Although China has largely ensured its food security in the past 40?years, it has increasingly relied on international markets to ensure its food supply since 2004 (====; ====). With increasing population, higher income and constraints of resources, the pressure on China's food security is going to increase in the future. ==== predicted that China's overall food self-sufficiency is likely to fall from 94.5% in 2015 to around 91% by 2025.====Climate change will likely aggravate the challenges China faces on its food security in the future. China's annual average temperature has been rising significantly over the past six decades and the warming trend will continue under the future projections (====; ====; ====; ====). It is generally accepted that the mechanism of climate change affecting China's agriculture is mainly through rising temperature and increasing fluctuation in precipitation (====; ====).====The impacts of climate change on China's agriculture have been widely studied in the literature through biophysical models (e. g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== found that the negative impacts of climate change on wheat yield in China could reach up to 5.6¨C18.5% under A2 scenario==== by 2020s. Similarly, ==== suggested that if the temperature increases by 1?¡ãC, rice yield would decline by 6.1¨C18.6% even after considering the adaptation measures. ==== predicted a moderate decrease in rice yield in the range of 4.9¨C8.6% in 2050s. Meanwhile, some other studies also provide the evidence on positive impacts of climate change on some of the crops. ====, for example, concluded that irrigated maize yield would increase slightly by 2020 under B2 scenario====.====A major limitation of the biophysical models for assessing climate change impact is that they tend to overestimate adverse impacts of climate change on agriculture, as they fail to account for the underlying buffering capability of economic system, which the later attains through adjustments in production inputs and structure. For example, ==== also found that climate change would cause China's total crop production to decrease only slightly (0.2¨C0.5%) in 2080. Some global studies on climate change do explicitly cover China while accounting for endogenous response of markets (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Nevertheless, these studies either lack empirically based data on yield shocks for main crops in China or do not apply the detailed national economic model for China that can reflect China's agriculture market accurately.====). There are several important global studies on the role of international trade in climate change on agriculture. For example, ==== made the first attempt to discuss the role of international trade in assessing climate change impacts. Later, ==== explored the potential for a more freely functioning global trading system to maintain improved food security in the long run (i.e. by 2050). More recently, ==== suggested that global trade would continue to play a central role in assuring that global food system adapts to a changing climate in that it is likely to facilitate the movement of food from areas of surplus to areas of deficit. However, there is no China-focused study that assesses climate change impacts on China's agriculture while accounting for the role of international trade.====The overall purpose of this paper is to provide an updated and more reliable evidence on the impacts of climate change on China's production, prices, trade and self-sufficiency of major crops, with particular focus on the market and trade responses. Our study aims to give some perspective to the studies that (i) focus only on the impacts of climate change on national food markets (ii) use single region model and (iii) fail to consider the price transmission from the rest of world. Our study examines the climate change impacts on major crops towards 2050 under the worst climate change scenario (measured with representative concentration pathway, i.e., RCP 8.5) and the best climate change scenario RCP2.6.==== To achieve this purpose, we use the econometrically estimated projected changes in the yields of major crops in China, while we derive the projected crop yield changes for China's main trading partners from a process-based biophysical method. Next, we employ a widely-used agricultural partial equilibrium model (China Agriculture Policy Simulation Model, CAPSiM) of China to assess the climate change impacts on agriculture, thus considering the domestic market responses. Then we use the linked national and global equilibrium model (CAPSiM-GTAP) to assess the climate change impacts on agriculture, wherein we consider both the market and trade responses. The linked model approach effectively transmits the effects of foreign countries' climate shocks on agriculture to China via trade, while allowing us to use a more precise and detailed national economic model.====Our results show that the effects of climate change on crop production are significant but have large variations among crops. Under the worst climate change scenario i.e., RCP 8.5, among all crops in China, wheat yield is projected to experience the largest decrease of 9.4% by 2050. After taking into account the market response, production losses for most crop are dampened (e.g. wheat production loss reduces to only 4.3%) because of the growers' response to changes in agricultural prices under climate change. Moreover, if we consider the impacts of climate change from the rest of the world, which affect China's trade and therefore domestic production, the severity of climate change impacts on China's agricultural production will be further reduced, e.g. to around 4% for wheat. The study concludes that we need to learn more from farmers who respond to changing climate according to the market and trade signals, and further mainstream these lessons into national adaptation development plan.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces data sources for yield changes under different climate change scenarios for China and its main trade partners. Section 3 describes the simulation methodology, baseline scenario and climate change scenarios.

While the rise in yield is obviously owed to the adoption of modern varieties and the rising use of inputs, little research has examined the yield gains as a result of the improvement of germplasms through international exchanges in the domestic breeding program. This study aims to understand the uses of exotic germplasms in wheat varieties adopted by farmers and their contributions to wheat yield and production in China. Based on unique data on major wheat varieties adopted by farmers and their pedigree in 17 major wheat production provinces in the period between 1982 and 2014, descriptive analyses show that the varieties with germplasms from CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) and other countries (or Others) accounted for 19% and 81%, respectively, in the major varieties adopted by farmers. While the direct adoption of exotic varieties in production has been falling, the use of exotic germplasms in wheat breeding has increased over time. Moreover, the varieties with both, Chinese and exotic germplasms, normally had higher average yields than the varieties with Chinese germplasms alone in most periods studied. The ==== further shows that when compared with the varieties with pure Chinese germplasms, those with exotic germplasms contributed higher yields. Without the germplasms from CIMMYT and Others, the average annual yield would be lowered by 63?kg/ha and 323?kg/ha, respectively, during 1982¨C2014. The estimated increase in wheat production as a result of using exotic germplasms reached 10.4 million tons annually and has increased over time in the past three decades. The paper concludes with several policy implications for China's plant breeding strategy and for international donors funding the germplasm program.","Producing over 120 million tons of wheat per year, China is the world's largest wheat producer. Wheat is also the second largest food crop after rice, and the third largest crop overall, after maize and rice, in China (====). Despite the wheat area decreasing by 17% during the period from 1978 to 2015, production more than doubled over the same period, transforming China from a major wheat importer (average annual imports of 11.5 million tons¡ªabout 13% of domestic consumption in the 1980s) to near-self-sufficiency since the early 2000s (====).====The significant rise in wheat yields in China is a successful story of modern technologies at work. While increase in modern inputs such as fertilizers contributed to yield growth in all major crops, ==== showed that the primary source of wheat yield growth was from the rise of total factor productivity (TFP), which had increased at about 4% annually, during the period between 1979 and 1995. Their study further showed that in addition to overall change in technology, the genetic materials (or germplasms) from the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) also contributed to the growth in the TFP of China's wheat prior to the mid-1990s. ==== extended the early study to 2011 and found that CIMMYT==== germplasms had contributed to a total increase in the TFP of wheat in China by a range of 5% to 14% during the period from 1982 to 2011. These results are consistent with the literature reported by many natural scientists who have argued the critical importance of incorporating foreign (or exotic) germplasms in wheat breeding in China (====; ====).====Despite the importance of exotic wheat germplasms in wheat breeding and wheat yield improvement in China, little research has documented the roles of different exotic germplasms by source, and examined their impacts on wheat yields and production. To our knowledge, only three studies had partially analyzed the impacts of germplasms on wheat productivity in China. ==== examined the impact of CGIAR's germplasms on TFP through its impact on varietal turnover==== during the period between 1982 and 1995, but they did not explicitly examine its impact on the TFP of wheat and yield. ==== estimated the contribution of CIMMYT's germplasms to yield gains based on experimental yield data of adopted wheat varieties in China. ==== analyzed the direct impact of CIMMYT's germplasms on wheat TFP in China during the period between 1982 and 2011. However, all these studies compared CGIAR's germplasms with the aggregate germplasms that combined those from both, China and other countries. However, past literature shows that China's wheat breeding program has also intensively used germplasms from Italy, the USA, and the former Soviet Union (====; ====).====Understanding the roles of breeding programs by incorporating germplasms from different sources is important not only for breeders in their breeding design, but also for policymakers in setting their funding priorities. This study aims to understand the sources of germplasms embodied in wheat varieties as adopted by farmers and their contributions to wheat yields and production in China. To achieve these goals, we examine the following two sets of questions: 1) What roles have exotic germplasms from CIMMYT and other countries played in the wheat breeding program in China in the past three decades? How have they changed over time? 2) What are the impacts of incorporating exotic germplasms in wheat varieties on wheat yield performance in China?

Although humans have used rangelands for consumptive and non-consumptive purposes for centuries, it was only in the early 1900s that researchers first began to study problems associated with sustainable management of rangelands. In this context, sustainable management of rangeland refers to ¡°the manipulation of rangeland components to obtain the optimum combination of goods and services for society on a sustained basis¡± (====).====). In economic terms, they are rival and non-excludable goods. While full privatisation is one way of eliminating open access (====), it is often not feasible, and particularly not in the case of the Mongolian rangeland where mobility of animals both within and across years is required (====). Livestock grazing on rangeland in Mongolia can be considered a typical case of ¡°resources that are highly mobile over large expanses of territory, or of those, such as irrigation water, which require a collective infrastructure to be exploited. In these peculiar circumstances, collective regulation under the common property regime is the only way to avoid the inefficient management and/or the degradation of the resource under conditions of open access¡± (====: p.138).====Sustainable rangeland management has received considerable attention among common pool resource scientists and scholars during the last two decades (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== reviewed governance and development issues of pastoralism in different countries including Maasai pastoralists in East Africa, and pastoralists in India, Mongolia and China, and argued that the future of pastoralist populations is far from certain. Pastoral practices, including the tendency of individual herders to maximise their herds, coupled with increasing number of herders, are viewed as major factors promoting desertification. In Western China, rising livestock prices have contributed to a rapid increase in the number of livestock and a sharp decline in the available rangeland area per livestock unit, while in Northern China, rangeland degradation is caused by changing livestock demography, mushrooming permanent grazing encampments, year-round grazing, and an almost entirely new disaster preparation and response method (====).====Mongolia is a country where almost 80% of territory consists of rangeland; it ranks first in the world in terms of its share of rangelands. Rangeland is the basic natural resource of the Mongolian agricultural sector, which accounts for 18.8% of the GDP of the country (====). The rapid rise of livestock numbers during the last two decades is favourable for the herding population and also benefits other sectors that use livestock as an input. However, the number of livestock has risen beyond a critical level in terms of the ecological potential of the rangeland in Mongolia (Erdenetuya, 2006). The open access system combined with rapidly rising livestock numbers has resulted in significant deterioration of rangeland; the institutions governing the herding system are therefore no longer considered as being suitable (====). Novel natural resource management institutions have been introduced in Mongolia since 1999. Thus, Mongolia has become a de facto testing ground for community-based rangeland management, with the establishment of herders' self-help groups facilitated by different donor- and NGO-sponsored programs (====). Donor agencies have been using two main approaches to the introduction of community-based rangeland management in Mongolia (====). These are: i) a territorial approach to rangeland management, where all traditional users of a certain territory are organised in Pasture User Groups (PUGs), ii) the formation of voluntary herder groups, which are organised primarily on the basis of a combination of kinships, shared use of key resources and common interest for joint activities. Little is known, however, about the impact of these community-based management institutions on the quality of rangeland.====The objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of community-based rangeland management institutions in Mongolia by analysing the specific characteristics of pasture user groups that affect rangeland quality. The primary interest of voluntary herders groups is the joint selling of animal-based products and small-scale seasonal products over relatively short periods of time.

This provides a rare opportunity to examine how airlines practice price discrimination across different ticket distribution channels. Using a unique dataset collected from this market, we find that price discrimination across different ticket distribution channels is not influenced by market competition but increases with demand.","Price discrimination is a practice firms often use to extract ====. Airline pricing is a prominent example of this practice. It is a well-known fact that two passengers on the same flight with similar seat positions may have paid very different prices. Airlines segment consumers into different groups through various ticket restrictions to practice price discrimination. The restrictions used include whether the flight is direct or not, time-of-day, day-of-week, refundability, advance purchase requirement, cabin and booking class, Saturday-night stayover requirement, etc.====One of the main issues in this literature is the relationship between market structure and the ability or incentives of firms to price discriminate. The conventional wisdom is that a competitive firm cannot price discriminate because it is a price taker and a firm with market power can price discriminate as long as it is capable of segmenting the market. Hence, the prediction is that as the market becomes more competitive, firms price discriminate less. However, both theoretical studies by ====, ==== and ==== and empirical studies by ==== and ==== show that price discrimination can exist in quite competitive markets. And more recently, theoretical studies of both second-degree and third-degree price discrimination show that the effect of competition on price discrimination can be ambiguous or even positive under certain circumstances.==== As theoretical studies do not produce a clear prediction, the relationship between market structure and price discrimination is fundamentally an empirical question.====Our paper offers new evidence on this important relationship using a new identification strategy and data from a new market. Unlike studies in the literature that focus on how airlines use ticket restrictions to price discriminate in the more mature US and European markets, we focus on how airlines price discriminate across different ticket distribution channels in the emerging US-China flight market. In the US-China flight market, airlines sell tickets mainly through two channels. In one channel, airlines contract with consolidators (wholesale travel agents) to sell a large number of tickets for them. In return for their services, they offer consolidators a large discount on ticket price. Consolidators then work with retail travel agents to market tickets to travelers and the discount offered by the airlines is usually shared among all three parties. In the other channel, airlines sell tickets through their own websites and call centers. As a result, consumers are segmented into two groups based on where they purchase their tickets. Airlines take advantage of the fact that some consumers are not aware of the existence of one channel and price discriminate across different ticket distribution channels.====Empirically measuring price discrimination is a challenging task. Price difference for the same ticket is the sum of price discrimination and difference in marginal cost. While we observe price difference, difference in marginal cost is usually unobserved. As for air tickets, an important component of the marginal cost is the shadow cost of capacity, or the opportunity cost of each remaining seat on the flight, and this cost varies over time as more seats are sold (====). In addition, tickets from different distribution channels, even for exactly the same ticket, may be classified into different fare classes. Tickets in different fare classes impose different penalties when the ticket needs to be changed or canceled and also may differ in the number of miles frequent flyers can earn. As a result, the marginal costs for tickets in different fare classes are different even though the flight experience is identical. Therefore, we approximate price discrimination using the price difference between two non-refundable economy class tickets, one from each distribution channel, for exactly the same ticket sold at almost the same time, where the difference in marginal cost is likely to be small.====Using a unique dataset collected from the US-China flight market, we first quantify the magnitude of the price difference between the two ticket distribution channels. We find that for the same ticket, the difference between the agent price and the price from the airline's official website is about 49% of the agent price on average. We then further examine the relationship between price discrimination and market competition as well as other market conditions using ====. Under mild identification assumptions, we find evidence that price discrimination across different ticket distribution channels is not influenced by market competition but increases with demand.====Theoretical studies of segmenting the market through different distribution channels can be dated back to ====, who shows that a monopolist can open multiple sales outlets and offer different prices at each in order to price discriminate against consumers with high search costs. Though third-degree price discrimination models by ==== and ==== are related, ==== points out that competitive analogs of Salop's monopoly model, where consumers' search costs play an explicit role, have not been well explored.====Several studies have examined how airlines use ticket restrictions to price discriminate and the results are mixed. ==== and ==== study the price discrimination with respect to the advance purchase requirement and the Saturday-night stayover restriction and find the relationship to be positive. ==== group tickets into five quality categories according to their cabin and booking class, refundability and specific travel and/or stay restrictions. They find that price discrimination decreases with actual and potential competition from Southwest but the same result cannot be generalized to other airlines. ==== study price discrimination through refundable contracts and find price discrimination declines when demand uncertainty is resolved. More recently, ==== studies the welfare effects of dynamic airline pricing taking into account the interaction between intertemporal price discrimination and stochastic demand. Another strand of the literature examines the relationship between market structure and overall price dispersion, rather than price discrimination, with the assumption that price discrimination is the main driver of price dispersion.==== The results are mixed as well. ==== find that more competition leads to more dispersion, while ==== and ==== find the relationship to be negative and nonlinear, respectively.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses the unique aspects of the international flight market between the US and China. ==== introduces the data.

Our study results reveal a clear pattern of counter-cyclical credit expansion by Chinese banks in response to the outbreak of global financial crisis.

We find that the correlation in cross-region economic growth performance increased during the recent global recession and declined post-recession, albeit still at a higher level than before 2008. While the large degree of synchronization of regional growth dynamics permits the central government or central bank to implement a uniform fiscal or ====, this concurrently reduces China's ability to stymie the propagation of external shocks and instead increases systemic risks across regions.","Given the increased role that China is expected to play on the global landscape, it is understandable why much attention has been focused on the sustainability of China's growth rate. Discussions along this line have centered on the sources of China's growth and the growth difference with other countries. We add to this debate by assessing the synchronicity of inter-regional growths within China, acknowledging that this bears important implications for the nation's growth potential and the persistence of its global presence. Such an examination also leads to useful discussions of appropriate fiscal and ==== that may prove crucial to the sustainability of the nation's long-term economic growth and development.====Intuitively, the more divergent or heterogeneous the growth dynamics are across different regions, the better diversified the overall economy. This will translate into an economy that is better able to absorb the outside shocks. This also generates a conundrum, a more divergent growth performance across regions also poses a more serious challenge for formulating a common national fiscal or monetary policy. For example, when one region is experiencing economic boom while another is in a recession, it is harder for the policy-makers in the central government or the central bank to determine the appropriate national policy which will not conflict the interests of both regions. On the other hand, when regional growth becomes increasingly more synchronized, it would be more straightforward for the policy-makers to decide upon appropriate national fiscal and/or monetary policies. China has historically experienced a tremendous amount of regional growth disparities, especially given its frequent but unevenly distributed economic reforms.====Given the paucity of literature focusing on provincial growth differentials in China, this paper seeks to fill the void. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to document the synchronization and divergence of the regional growth in China.====Using a dynamic factor model with time-varying loading parameters and stochastic volatility, we find that the economic growth across provinces does not appear to co-move strongly prior to the global recession during the period of 2008¨C2010. To the contrary, the global recession seems to have contributed to the increasing synchronization of the regional growth in China. The correlations of economic growth among regions not only peaked around 2010 but have since stayed at a level higher than the pre-recession period.

In China, local governors are appointed by higher-level governments. Since the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) has been the dominant objective of the Chinese central government for the past several decades, the yardstick competition based on GDP growth has existed among local governments (====). This paper tries to investigate the effect of interjurisdiction political competition on economic performance.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Therefore, local governments have more incentives to favor growth than before under this institution. In addition, local government competition may also help to reduce excessive government intervention, improving firms' efficiency (====).====On the other hand, several studies argue that negative effects of local political competition on sustainable economic growth should not be ignored, especially when there is excessive competition among local governments. According to ==== (2006), a term of office for governors and secretaries should not be greater than five years. The norm, consequently, has become a powerful tool to impel local officials to focus on the short-run effect on economic growth and ignore the necessary elements of sustainable economic growth (====). For example, local governments in China prefer infrastructure investment to investment in science, education, health, or public services, resulting in insufficient human capital accumulation (====; ====). Due to excessive competition, there is local protectionism, excessive investment, overlapping construction, and other distortions (====; ====; ====).====Although previous studies have provided a broad and diverse theoretical foundation and empirical findings on local government competition, there are several limitations. The most important one is that the effects of political competition on sustainable economic growth and environmental pollution have often been investigated separately in previous studies. Ignoring either of them, however, leads to biases, because there is a close relationship between them. On the one hand, it is well known that, during the production process, desirable outputs are frequently associated with undesirable outputs, such as wastewater or air pollution. When researchers measure sustainable economic growth as traditional total factor productivity (TFP), ignoring the undesirable outputs may lead to a biased evaluation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). On the other hand, environmental pollution will hinder sustainable economic growth by impairing public health and worsening social inequality (====; ====; ====). Due to China's serious environmental pollution (====), it is particularly necessary to incorporate pollution into the sustainable growth accounting framework.====To combine environmental pollution and a sustainable growth accounting framework, a notion of green total factor productivity (GTFP) was proposed by the Asian Productivity Organization in 1992 (====). The literature on measuring GTFP focuses on model choice. By far the most popular approach to measurement of GTFP is nonparametric models (====; ====), in which directional distance function (DDF) in a data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework is gradually replaced by the non-radial, non-angle slacks-based measure (SBM) approach (====; ====; ====). Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), a parametric approach to the measurement of GTFP, is also used in a few studies. For example, ==== measure GTFP growth for 29 provinces in China during the 1995¨C2010 period via hyperbolic distance functions in an SFA framework. Using various samples and models, researchers find that China's productivity appears to differ under two approaches, whether undesirable outputs are taken into consideration or not, and that TFP in China is overestimated if undesirable outputs are ignored (====; ====; ====).====The second limitation is that the aggregate effect of local government competition on TFP is overlooked. Previous studies have usually focused on the effects of local government competition on a specific factor, such as either fiscal expenditure structure, market segmentation, or enterprise tax burden. Even if the effect of local government competition on sustainable economic growth is taken into consideration, researchers are often interested in the effect of a particular government policy, such as environmental regulation or tax administration.====Finally, the intensity of local government competition is often measured as enterprise tax rates or per capita foreign direct investment (FDI) in previous studies. It can neither exactly measure the degree of political competition primarily driven by fiscal decentralization and political centralization nor address the endogeneity of local government competition.====To fill the gap, we calculate GTFP based on a stochastic frontier model including pollution emissions as inputs. This paper, then, identifies the causal relationship between county-level political competition and prefectural GTFP, using the number of county-level jurisdictions within a prefecture as a proxy for the intensity of political competition and constructing ==== via the density of small rivers. We find strong evidence for an inverse U-shaped relationship between county-level government competition and prefectural GTFP, in that marginal effect of political competition diminishes and eventually becomes negative.====This paper contributes to the literature in three dimensions. First, this paper provides novel empirical evidence in China at the county-level in the literature on the relationship between interjurisdiction political competition and GTFP. Theoretically, China's economic growth is driven by county-level political competition, an important institutional force (====). But no empirical evidence at the county-level has existed in the literature apart from ==== field interviews. The evidence of the inverse U-shaped relationship in this paper indicates that ==== argument holds only if no excessive competition exists. Next, an unusual measure of interjurisdiction political competition, the number of county-level regions within a prefecture, is employed to identify the causal relationship between local government competition and economic performance. It helps address the endogeneity, as it is, to a great extent, the legacy of administrative districting in history. Compared to policy-specific measures in the literature, the number of county-level regions captures the overall intensity of interjurisdiction political competition and, hence, is not sensitive to a specific government policy. Finally, we jointly investigate TFP and environmental pollution by means of a more reliable index to evaluate environmental economic development, distinguished from existing papers focusing on either traditional TFP or environmental pollution.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the empirical methodology. ==== describes the basic data. ==== measures GTFP. ==== presents the main results and discussions. ==== concludes.",Interjurisdiction political competition and green total factor productivity in China: An inverted-U relationship,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301287,12-Sep-18,2018,Research Article,392

By using cross-country panel data, ==== present evidence that if land markets are imperfect, new institutional mechanisms, for example machine service evolve to mitigate the efficiency cost attributed to the land market rigidities.====As real wages and thus the opportunity cost of farm labor rapidly increased, China that largely supports the proposition that wage growth in recent years led to an introduction of labor saving practices. Chinese farmers started relying on mechanical operations using machine services provided by the Specialized Custom Plowers, Planters and Harvesters (SCPPH) teams.====Consistent with the Hicks-Hayami-Ruttan-Binswanger hypothesis, the substitution of labor by mechanical operations appeared in all major crops as the relative price of labor to machine services dramatically decreased in the past decade (====). Earlier studies seemed to reach a conclusion that the availability of machine services is largely driven by supply side (====; ====). That is, prospective farmers tend to acquire more land by renting in land given the constraint of land sale market and also rely on machine services, rather than purchasing machines when real wages increase (====). In this sense, larger farmers are in a better position to expand the operational size, but the extent to which lands are fragmented potentially and significantly block mechanization. To overcome such a bottleneck, one of the most important rights in today's China is the rights to rent land (====).==== In almost all villages, households also have the rights to transfer land to another household or firm (====). The existing literature have reached a concensus that one of the major functions of land rental markets is to reduce the extent to which lands are fragmented, i.e., renting in land from neighboring plots (====; ====; ====).====In China, an effort has also been made to consolidate lands as evidenced by the emergence of more medium-sized farms who operate on a few hectares and large-sized farms who operate on tens and hundreds of hectares (====). Cultivated land transfers have been accelerated since the late 2000s (====; ====). By the end of 2013, nearly 53 million (or 23% of) rural households rented out their cultivated lands, which accounted for 26% of total cultivated lands under the household responsibility system (MOA, 2014).==== Distinct from early common practices of transferring land among relatives and friends in village with nearly equal numbers of land rent-in and rent-out households (====), land transfers moved to new operators in recent years. For example, in 2013, about 20% of rented-out land was transferred to farmers' professional cooperatives, more than 9% to companies, and the rest to individual households including newly-named ¡°Family Farms¡± (====).====Fragmented farm structures are costly in production and land consolidations have positive impacts on agricultural yield (Deininger et al., 2016). A number of studies focused on the impact of land fragmentation on agricultural production. ==== showed that land consolidation from 4 plots to 1 plot increased productivity (marginal product of labor) by 8%. ==== also showed that an increase of Simpson index by 0.01 has increased labor cost by 0.42% and decreased oxen and tractor cost by 0.33% in rice production. In ====, an increase in the number of plots reduces agricultural output but only through the channel of labor productivity. Land consolidation does release rural labor. Other empirical works based on the analysis of household data also provide indirect and mixed evidence on the linkages between land fragmentation and labor supply in rural China. ====. Benefits accruable from land consolidations are not just static but dynamic, e.g., through accelerated mechanization. However, the effect of fragmented lands on mechanization has not been directly evidenced.====This paper analyzes the roles of farm size and fragmentations in the introduction of mechanical operations using farm panel data collected in 6 provinces in China. Our hypothesis is rising real wages create an incentive for relatively large holders to increase its scale of operations to mechanize and save labor costs (substitute for labor), but fragmented lands may increase transaction costs to use machines as plots are separately located. In this setting, the decisions to increase farm/plot size and introduce mechanical operations (through machine services) are interdependent especially when real wages rise rapidly. This is exactly the situation in which fragmented lands matter in the substitution between labor and machines.====Rising real wages create an incentive for relatively large holders to increase its scale of operations to mechanize and save labor costs. In this sense, the decisions to increase farm size and introduce mechanical operations (through machine services) are interdependent. However, such mutually dependent decisions become important only when real wages are rapidly rising. Consistent with this conjecture, the empirical analysis shows that when agricultural wages rapidly increase, farm size becomes a critical factor to determine mechanization. Thus when real wage rapidly increases and labor shortage becomes serious in rural areas, large farms tend to gain its advantage to mechanize. However, the above scale merit is significantly penalized by land fragmentations captured by the number of plots. More consolidated lands seem to show advantage to introduce mechanization. In the literature it has been shown that in some economies when labor becomes more scarce and hired labor does not completely substitute the family labor, the households/individuals that remain in farming begin to specialize in order to more efficiently use their labor, farm more area and produce higher incomes (====; ====). ====The analysis is complemented by the contingent valuation method applied to land rental transactions. The data on willingness to pay (WTP) to rent in land are used to disentangle farmers' willingness and actual decisions on land rental arrangements. The preliminary analysis shows that changes in the willingness to pay to rent and actual rental arrangements (decisions) are consistent. Interestingly, we observe that on average, farmers became more willing to pay to rent in land if real off-farm wages rapidly increased. This tendency is clear among those who operated relatively large land in the initial period. Interestingly, the relationship is negative among those who operated relatively small land. That is, large (small) farmers became more (less) willing to rent in when real wages increased fast, which is consistent with our conjecture on divergence among farmers.====The paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the data used in the analysis: household survey and experimental design on WTP. Empirical strategies are also described in ====. ==== presents empirical results. First, changes in the willingness to pay to rent in land is systematically related to real off-farm wage growth and the way they are related depends on the initial farm size consistently with our theoretical conjecture. Second, mechanization to substitute for labor became active in the areas where real wage growth was high but this was significantly constrained by the per-plot land size (and the number of plots). The above relationship is also clear among those who became more willing to rent in land.====Source: Authors¡¯ own data.",What constrains mechanization in Chinese agriculture?

For instance, scholars have noted that shifting the rural-urban construction land market from a dual system to an integrated one could gradually ameliorate efficiency and the social welfare (====).

By contrast, scholars also worried that rural construction land marketization would result in land oversupply, negatively affect the urban primary land market and ultimately hinder local governments' land financing abilities. In such a case, local governments would not be able to afford urban infrastructure construction and would even be unable to promote rural-urban integration (====; ====).====What exactly are the allocation and distribution effects induced by China's ongoing rural construction land marketization and its aim to foster an integrated rural-urban land market? To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of literature that quantitatively investigates this issue because the data on rural construction land marketization in China were insufficient prior to the central government-initiated rural land institution reform that began in 2015. However, the goals of the new round of land marketization in contemporary China, such as optimizing the land allocation, protecting rural households' interests, and narrowing the income gap between rural and urban areas (====) as well as the practices of national pilot areas allow us to investigate the efficiency and distribution of rural construction land marketization in depth. We therefore provide a more explicit theoretical analysis than ==== and more convincing empirical evidence given the unique dataset collected in this study.====In summary, this paper intends to address the following issues: 1) to better understand rural construction land marketization in China and, more specifically, 2) to identify the allocation and distribution effects of rural construction land marketization. To that end, taking the perspective of the interplay between efficiency and distribution, we attempt to develop a theoretical model for rural construction land marketization to provide new insights into rural land institution reform in China. Additionally, we intend to conduct an empirical analysis of the allocation and distribution effects of rural construction land marketization based on the evidence from a pilot area.====The paper is organized as follows. The second section briefly introduces the ongoing rural construction land marketization in China. The third section discusses the effects of China's rural construction land marketization in theory, develops a partial equilibrium model, and then proposes the research hypotheses. The fourth section takes the trial in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, as an example to estimate the allocation and distribution effects of rural land construction marketization and to test the theoretical hypotheses.

This special issue on ¡°Energy Demand in Emerging and Developing Economies: Measurement, Policy Interventions and Evaluation¡± improves international understanding of the patterns of energy demand in China by presenting recent experimental and empirical research following the Beijing Energy Conference in 2018. The main purpose of this introductory article is to present recent research advances by summarizing new findings and insights from this special issue, combined with recent literature. It shows that China's rising energy demand and energy transition practices have led to numerous policy interventions, which provides rich observational data on behavioral change and offers an ¡°experimental window¡± with large opportunities for scholars. Beyond the traditional topics of residential and industrial energy demand and its drivers, an increasing number of studies focuses on energy policy evaluation or quantify the environmental and climate consequences of energy consumption. This new line of research, supported by policy-oriented model-based quantitative analyses, experimental approaches and econometric analyses using multi-source disaggregated data, offers new insights into various aspects of China's energy demand.","Global energy demand is rapidly accelerating. Global energy consumption reached a record high of 13.9 Gigatons of oil equivalent (Gtoe) in 2018, with the fastest growth rate (2.9%) on record since 2010 (====). The consequent increase in energy-related carbon emissions leads to widespread public concerns about the irreversible consequences of climate change (====). China accounts for 25% of global energy demand (almost half of global energy demand along with the United States and India) and faces high expectations to take responsibility in the mitigation of global warming resulting from energy consumption. The United States announced its withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement in 2017 (====), leaving room for other actors and creating expectations, especially for China, India and other developing economies to lead the global energy transition. These countries, however, face serious energy issues in their own economic transitions, including energy access and energy supply shortages, carbon emissions and adverse health effects associated with fossil fuel use. In China, energy efficiency and energy demand responses in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors play a crucial role in these developments and require the attention of both academics and policy makers.====Despite substantial efforts made in the analysis of energy demand patterns in developing countries, the identification of determinants and the evaluation of intervention policies has received little academic attention due to both a shortage of local scholars and disaggregated source data. To bridge this gap, the Renmin University of China, University of M¨¹nster, Germany and Kyushu University, Japan, together with the China Economic Review journal, hosted the Beijing Energy Conference in September 2018.

Using data spanning a long time period for rural ","). With rapid economic development, China faces increasing environmental pressures especially in reducing CO==== emissions. At the same time, its roundwood imports have multiplied in recent years, accounting for more than half of the world's total in 2014 (====). Moreover, 56% of its population, especially the rural poor, lives in mountainous areas (====). In an effort to stimulate domestic timber supply and promote rural development through forest production, China piloted and gradually advanced a new round of forest tenure reforms (CFTR) for its collective forestland in 2003.====In China, collective forestland refers to land owned by rural communities as a whole, which accounts for 170 million ha, or 60% of the nation's total forestland. Local actors (i.e., village leaders) were the direct managers in charge of collective forestland before implementation of the CFTR. During this period, forest stock was low due to unclearly defined property rights to forestland within the rural communities. The CFTR devolves use rights to forestland, without leasing fees, from rural communities to households by contract, individually or as a group. Contract holders have the right to profit from sale of products grown on the land or to lease out the land. In general, the reform grants households free ==== of 70?years with clearly delineated land boundaries in government issued certificates.====). Given the rotation length of tree growth, a long and legally defined land tenure is a prerequisite for successful participation and investment in tree plantation (====; ====). However, compared to community-level devolution, the CFTR is more comprehensive in devolving land use rights directly to rural households (====; ====). The fragmented and small-scale forestland held by each household (2.9?ha per household after the reform according to our survey) may impair their ability to actively manage the land.====Moreover, farmers rarely participate in forest investment when they have no rights to standing timber (====; ====). Since 1987, China adopted a logging quota system on planted forests (====). Households are required to apply for a harvest permit from the local government to harvest and sell the timber, which could dampen contractors' enthusiasm in land management and hinder further reforestation and afforestation. ==== estimated that logging restrictions have significant effects on China's wood products imports and exports. As a supporting policy for the CFTR, Chinese government has promised to gradually relax harvest restrictions after it finishes issuing land tenure certificates. However, it remains unclear to what extent secure land tenure and logging rights will facilitate tree planting of smallholders in rural China. The aim of this paper is to estimate the effects of land tenure security and logging rights on investments in tree planting, which can contribute to the choice of policy instruments in rural China. If logging rights are found leading tree planting investments, then policies aimed at transparentizing and simplifying the permit application process will facilitate government's aims to stimulate timber supply and reduce rural poverty.====Recent studies have investigated the effect of the CFTR on investment in forest management (e.g., ====; ==== and ====). The estimated results remain inconclusive in terms of sign and magnitude. ==== verified a positive effect of forest certificates on forest investment. Using post-reform survey data, ==== demonstrated higher annual investment in forest management when households show positive attitudes toward the reforms and are more confident to get a harvest permit. ==== found that the CFTR increased the degree of forestland fragmentation, which in turn had a negative effect on forest investment. Using management investment irrespective of tree species (e.g., for timber use or for fruit farming) and growth stage may have contributed to the inconclusive results. Another problem rests in the difficulty to control for biases resulting from selection into tenure reform and logging rights, complicating a robust evaluation whether smallholders with the CFTR issued certificates and logging rights would have been able to achieve higher investment than their counterfactuals.====Our study adds to the literature in several ways. First, to our knowledge, there are no studies that specifically look at the effectiveness of recent policy reforms in promoting afforestation and/or reforestation in China ¨C a gap this study intends to fill. Tree planting activities of smallholders could have long-term impacts on forest coverage and environmental conservation in China. The question of interest here is whether secure land tenure and logging rights have causal impacts on investments in tree planting or whether smallholders are systematically different in the first place (e.g., poorer social and economic background) in a way that affects their tree planting investment outcomes after the CFTR. Second, we develop a robust approach to control predetermined characteristics. Studies have used current household characteristics in a year as covariates in studying the effect of tenure reform on forest management investment. A major limitation of using current characteristics is that it is problematic to correct for the selection bias into treatment especially in the absence of potential ==== for the treatment. One of the advantages of our long time field survey is that data is available before the assignment to the treatments, i.e., before land tenure certificates were issued and logging restrictions were relaxed. We compare differences in tree planting investments between treated and untreated smallholders and address the potential endogeneity of land tenure security and logging rights using matching methods and selection models.====The section that follows explains the institutional background of forestland tenure and logging quota in China. ==== presents the methods and models. ==== describes the survey and data used in the analysis.

Total annual meat consumption grew from about 6 million tons in 2000 to 8.6 million tons in 2015, with an annual growth rate of 2.8% (====). Pork consumption grew especially fast, from a per capita consumption of 10.5?kg/year (rural) and 18.9?kg/year (urban) in 1990, to 14.4?kg/year and 21?kg/year, respectively in 2012 (====). To meet the increased demand for pork meat, the production of domestic pork production expanded considerably, from 40 million tons of pig meat in 2000 to 55 million tons in 2015 (====).====).====However, the quick transformation and intensification of the livestock sector comes with serious environmental externalities. In the case of hog farming, poor manure management causes considerable emissions of pollutants. Most farms are characterized by a high manure-land ratio, which leaves them with limited capacities to recycle manure back to cropland. Meanwhile, many enterprises neglected the development of manure management techniques during their quick expansion. In effect, manure management in China is underdeveloped, also in international comparison: only 1/3 of total manure nitrogen was utilized in China, while about 3/4 was utilized in the United States and 80% in the European Union (====).====The low level of manure management threatens air, water and land resources. For instance, animal manure has found to be an important source of heavy metal leakage in Northeast China (====). A study from Jiangsu Province in China shows that the concentration of copper and zinc in pig manure has been increasing by 770% and 410% from 1990 to 2008. Both heavy metals are used as food additive in industrial hog farming due to their antimicrobial and growth-stimulating effects (====).====In acknowledgment of the seriousness of agricultural non-point source pollution, the Chinese government has already taken action to regulate intensive livestock operations. The No.1 Central Document in 2014 (====) explicitly proposed encouraging large-scale farms to efficiently utilize livestock waste. Researchers and policy makers also suggested several specific measures, such as better monitoring of existing regulations, economic instruments like a cut of subsidies on chemical fertilizer, educational measures and technical improvements (====) or productivity increase through management and technological measures (====). Generally, large-scale farms face stricter regulations than small enterprises, as for instance stipulated by Animal Law, Animal Epidemic Law, Livestock and Poultry Scale Pollution, Prevention, and Control regulations (====).====Taking into account both the structural and the policy background of the hog sector transformation and the repeated claims of the severe environmental burden of industrial hog farming, several important questions need to be answered in order to efficiently target specific policy measures. How does waste management from commercial farms differ from backyard hog farms? How does farm size affect both production and waste management? Can commercial hog enterprises meet the increasing demand without inducing negative environmental externalities? Are the existing policy measures efficient in reducing the emission of pollutants? This paper is the first contribution estimating both environmental and technical efficiencies of hog farms and analyzing the effects of farm types and ==== on these efficiencies.====Both parametric and non-parametric methods have been used in the literature to measure environmental and technical efficiencies. A stochastic frontier translog production is commonly used in the parametric domain. ==== applied stochastic frontier production function to show that the environmental efficiency and technical efficiency of Chinese hog production at province level are highly correlated. However, several limitations of the stochastic method have been discussed in the literature. One is the requirement that the production technology is to be specified a priori (====).====Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely applied to estimate environmental efficiency, since it features less restrictive assumptions. Among others, ==== applied DEA to derive the measures of environmental performance of Danish hog farms. This paper employs a slack-based DEA model (SBM) to estimate both technical and environmental efficiencies using farm level data. The SBM was proposed by ==== and extended to account for undesirable outputs (====; ====). The SBM is appealing in that it allows for a non-radial non-oriented movement towards the efficiency frontier, i.e. the input and output mixes can be altered without arbitrary choice of the direction of optimization. A SBM extended to accommodate the weak disposability approach has been applied by ==== and ====, ====By measuring both the technical and environmental efficiency of the hog sector, this study aspires to close an existing research gap. Previous studies separately tackled the topics of manure management in the Chinese hog sector (e.g. ====; ====), its environmental consequences (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====) and mitigation strategies (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Few studies however have measured the environmental efficiency of the Chinese farming sector via DEA models, among them one study on Chinese fish cultures (====) and one work on land use efficiency for crop-farming (====). There are only three studies on the environmental efficiency of the Chinese hog sector, however none of them using farm-level data but only aggregated province-level data (====; ====; ====).====The paper is structured as follows: ==== describes the data, and ==== introduces the SBM model.

Specifically, an additional year of education decreases the probability of smoking and binge drinking by 4.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Although the health effect of drinking is ambiguous, we also find that the likelihood of drinking decreases by 1.6% with one additional schooling year. Interestingly, an additional year of education could counteract intergenerational persistence of smoking and binge drinking from the father, but it has no impact on intergenerational persistence from the mother. Our results suggest that education might be an efficient way to control unhealthy consumption behaviors in China, but it might not be an efficient way to prevent intergenerational persistence of unhealthy consumption behavior from the mother.","Cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking are two crucial behaviors that negatively affect health and longevity (====; ====; ====; ====). The Chinese government is increasingly concerned about the public health expenditures caused by cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking. National legislators start to actively consider national bans on smoking in public and work places as well as on cigarette advertising. Nevertheless, tobacco control in China has remained particularly cumbersome due to the influence of the tobacco industry. There are over 300 million cigarette smokers in China consuming roughly one-third of the world's cigarettes with substantial higher prevalence of smoking men (52.9%) than women (2.4%) compared with global smoking rates for men (36.9%) and women (7.3%) (====). Almost 1.4 million people in China die annually from smoking-related diseases, and this number is expected to rise to over 3 million by 2050 if current smoking rates continue (====).====Alcohol drinking is another health-related behavior. It is increasing faster in China than elsewhere and shows a steady rise (====; ====). The 2007 national survey of alcohol consumption has revealed that in China, 55.6% of men and 15.0% of women are frequent alcohol consumers (====).==== Alcohol use disorders (AUDs)==== are common problems linked to disturbances in mental and physical health (====). Precisely, the AUD rates in China are 9.3% and 0.2% among men and women, respectively; these rates are comparatively larger than the AUD rates in other countries (====).====To control and better understand the determinants of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, a large number of studies have been conducted. These studies extensively focus on the impact of socio-demographic variables, such as income and price, on the occurrences of cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. The impact of price on individuals' alcohol and cigarette consumption has been extensively studied (====; ====; ====). For instance, ==== find that price elasticity for cigarettes is approximately ?0.5; however, income is less likely to affect cigarette smoking as the income elasticity is extremely low, ranging between 0.003 and 0.038. ==== find that neither price nor income has statistically significant impacts on cigarette smoking. Regarding alcohol consumption in China, ==== conclude that price has no significant impact since the price elasticity is virtually zero for beer and only ?0.12 for liquor. ==== also find that income does not affect alcohol consumption for men, while socio-demographic factors such as education, employment, and marital status play a significant role.====Moreover, many studies suggest that parental consumption behavior may also influence filial consumption behavior (====; ====; ====; ====). However, regarding cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, the empirical results are mixed. Some studies find a positive correlation between parental and filial alcohol consumption (====; ====), while others indicate no significant correlation (====). Alternatively, filial consumption behavior might depend either on maternal or paternal consumption behavior. ==== find that a young adult who lives with an unmarried mother has a higher smoking propensity. ==== finds that alcohol consumption is higher among children whose mothers typically have approximately three or more drinks daily or who drink on a weekly basis, while fathers' alcohol consumption only positively influences sons' drinking behavior. The studies suggest that parental consumption behavior influences filial health outcomes; nevertheless, it has largely been ignored in the literature on China.====; ====; ====; ====), suggesting that more educated people are likely to have better health status and are less likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, while other studies cannot provide strong evidence that education leads to healthier behavior (====; ====; ====). Given the existing literature, however, the mechanism underlying the connection between education and unhealthy consumption behaviors is still not fully understood. To the best of our knowledge, only one study by ====; ====). While the mechanisms of future opportunity costs consider that education raises a person's future utility that can be influenced by current unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and binge drinking, desire for a higher future utility can impel the higher educated to escape unhealthy consumption behaviors. According to the explanation from the mechanisms of unobserved heterogeneity, education and health behavior are correlated only because education is a proxy variable for unobserved variables, such as time preference or ability. Thus, it is particularly important to control for unobserved heterogeneity that is correlated with education and health or health behaviors (====; ====; ====); however, it is difficult to disentangle whether education impact is evidence of an efficiency mechanism or evidence of future opportunity costs or both of them.====While the same issue exists in our study even through controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, our hypothesis is that education may discourage offspring from maintaining parents' unhealthy habits, such as smoking and binge drinking, since more highly educated people might be more aware and knowledgeable of the harmful consequences of unhealthy consumption or are more likely to control their health-related behaviors. Nevertheless, focusing on investigating the causal relation between education and health render the precise mechanism irrelevant in our study. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, there is limited research on measuring the impact of education on ==== of unhealthy consumption behaviors, let alone on considering the unobserved heterogeneity of education in intergenerational persistence of these behaviors.==== argue that a feedback relationship between education and health exists. Positive health behavior could also positively affect the demand for education and school performance. For example, ==== also show that alcohol consumption negatively influences students' academic performance. These findings suggest that there seems to be a strong reversed causal relationship between unhealthy consumption behaviors and education. Neglecting the endogeneity of education in estimating the impact of education on cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption may lead to biased results. To obtain unbiased estimates requires carefully addressing the endogeneity of education.====Changes in government regulations concerning education can serve as natural experiments to control for the endogeneity of education. For instance, law changes in education or schooling related aspects could affect individuals' years of obtained education but are less likely to directly influence their health. These laws and regulations, therefore, generate exogenous variation in years of schooling both across regions and over time, such as changes in compulsory schooling laws (====; ====; ====), and the abolition of secondary school fees (====). Other schooling related aspects include, for example, college attendance during war time (====) and the number of academic track schools in a state (====). ==== investigate the causal effect of education on health using the Compulsory Schooling Law and the Provisions on the Prohibition of Using Child Labor as instruments for education; they cannot obtain conclusive results for smoking due to a violation of the exogeneity of their instruments. One possible reason might be lack of controlling for cohort trends in their estimation, since two institutional changes operate based on the year of birth, failure to adequately control for cohort trends is likely to invalidate the instrument (====).====Although many studies have estimated the causal link between health and education, studies have seldom investigated how education impacts intergenerational persistence of unhealthy consumption behaviors considering the endogeneity of education. In this paper, we address the question whether education has an impact on unhealthy consumption behaviors as well as on their intergenerational persistence. Our study contributes to the literature by (1) identifying the correlation of unhealthy consumption behaviors between offspring and parents, by (2) examining how education affects filial unhealthy consumption behaviors through two institutional changes used as instrumental variables for education, and by (3) investigating the impact of education on intergenerational persistence of unhealthy consumption behaviors.====The paper is organized as follows.

However, it is unclear which type of FS, namely a market-based or a bank-based financial system, has a positive impact on economic growth. If the market-based financial system is suitable for economic growth, then increasing the relative importance of financial markets will be preferred, and vice versa. Another important question is whether the marginal effect of FS on the real economy changes in the process of economic development. This is especially critical when an economy experiences structural changes during its development. As global countries are at different stages of economic development, it is unwise to assume that the impact of FS in all countries is either similar or homogeneous.====However, the existing literature has not been fully successful in examining the evolutionary effect of FS during the process of economic development. For example, the studies treating the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United State (U.S.) as market-based systems versus Japan and Germany as bank-based systems show that FS matters for economic growth in developed economies (e.g., ====; ====).

By comparing the coefficients of FS in different regions of China and the evolving coefficients at each percentile of real GDP per capita, we can observe the evolving effect of FS on unbalanced regional development as an economy develops.====One potential contribution of this paper is the construction of a theoretical framework to investigate the relationship between FS and economic growth. The existing studies have primarily focused on analyzing the role of bank-based or market-based systems in economic activities from the perspective of the financial sector alone but have neglected the demand of the real economy for ====. An empirical contribution of this paper is the use of panel quantile estimation to quantify the evolving role of FS in the real economy. The panel quantile estimation provides information on the underlying nexus at each percentile of the distribution of economic development. By doing so, we also explore the evolving effect of FS on the real economy at different stages of economic development.====Our paper provides several interesting findings. First, there is an optimal FS, which is not constant but evolves over time to meet different demands of the real economy at different stages of economic development. Second, increasing the relative importance of financial markets has a significant and positive effect on economic growth in China (at both national and regional levels), suggesting that a market-based financial system is more helpful than a bank-based system in the development of the Chinese economy. Third, the years 2002 and 2008 are the two structural change points for the marginal effect of FS on economic growth. Furthermore, the distribution quantile positions 42 and 74 of per capita GDP are key boundaries, indicating that the marginal effects of FS at different stages manifest different patterns. Fourth, a specific FS increases unbalanced regional development within highly developed regions, whereas it decreases unbalanced regional development between low and highly developed regions. Consequently, the impact of FS on economic growth shows an inverse U-shape as the economy develops, which is consistent with the Greenwood¨CJovanovic hypothesis (1990).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: ==== provides the literature review; ==== describes the theoretical framework in relation to the formation of an optimal FS and its dynamic evolution; ==== presents empirical results and their implications; and ==== concludes the paper.",Does financial structure matter for economic growth in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18300828,4-Jul-18,2018,Research Article,401

We address the endogeneity of market size by an IV strategy, based on a measure of potential market size, which is driven only by changes in the Chinese income distribution. This measure is exogenous to changes in prices and qualities of durable goods and is a valid instrument for expected future market size. Our results indicate that an increase in market size by one percent leads to an increase in firm-specific total factor productivity by 0.46% and an increase in labor productivity by 0.50%. These findings are robust to controlling for export behavior of firms and supply side drivers of R&D.","The economic growth of China is characterized by a formidable increase of productivity in the industrial sector. Fast productivity growth has multiple sources. On the one hand, it proceeds from the reallocation through the selection of more productive firms (====; ====, ====). On the other hand, it results from active investments in technology adoption and adaptation (====, ====). ==== argues that a shift from capital accumulation to innovation is a necessary condition for Chinese growth to continue on its fast-converging trajectory.====If investments aimed to improve productivity are becoming more and more important over time, what is their driver? According to the theory of directed technical change (e.g., ====, ====, henceforth DTC) market size is an important determinant of such investments. While the theory DTC focuses on the introduction of new frontier technologies, ==== show that market size is also crucial for what they call ¡°directed technology adoption.¡± Their argument echoes the pioneer study of ==== documenting that the introduction of a superior technology, hybrid corn, was faster in US states with a larger domestic market size.====? This paper asks whether ¨C and to which extent ¨C the expansion of the local market for consumer durables stimulates productivity-enhancing investments by Chinese firms, thereby contributing to the surge of technical progress in Chinese manufacturing.====Our empirical investigation is motivated by recent theories that combine DTC with non-homothetic preferences (NHP), including ====, ====To establish an empirical link between expected market size and technical progress, we combine data from two different sources: the Chinese Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) which provides information on consumption behavior of households; and the Annual Survey of Industrial Production (ASIP) from which firm-specific productivity measures (and their changes over time) can be calculated. We concentrate on 16 industries covering a substantial share of expenditures for consumer durables: cellphones, cars, computers, telephones, refrigerators, home video appliances, washing machines, air conditioning, cameras, satellite dishes, motorcycles, kitchen appliances, radios, sewing machines, electric fans and bicycles.====A potential problem with our empirical analysis is the endogeneity of market size. Technical progress can be the trigger rather than the effect of the expansion in the domestic market of a specific product, e.g., by causing a fall in its sale price. To tackle the ==== we exploit the enormous variation in the distribution of household incomes associated with Chinese economic growth during the last two decades.====In 1990, less than 17% of Chinese households fell into the category of high-middle income and high-income households. By the year 2011, the share of households in these income categories has increased to 74% (20% high-middle and 54% high-income). During the same period, the share of low-middle income households decreased from 37 to 12%, while the share of low-income households fell from 46% to 14%. ==== These changes lead to predictable, differential changes in demand across various consumer goods industries. For instance, to return to the previous example, the market for motorcycles booms earlier than the market for cars. However, at some point, the former becomes saturated, and the potential for future market expansion dies off. At that point, it is the car industry that starts attracting investments and innovative activities. It is this source of variation that forms the basis of our strategy to identify the impact of expected demand on technical change in Chinese manufacturing industries.====More precisely, we construct product-specific Engel-curves for the 16 consumer durables, and estimate changes in expected market size for each durable good. We first fix income-group specific ownership rates of a particular durable good to a particular base-year and then use the changing population shares across income classes to calculate a measure of potential ownership and potential market size in other years. This yields an industry-specific markets size measure, whose evolution over time is entirely driven by changes in the income distribution. Changes in ownership patterns of a given income group, which might be induced by changes in prices or the quality of goods, do not affect this potential market size measure. To the extent that these differential changes in expected markets size are uncorrelated with unobserved factors that drive innovation incentives, our market size measure identifies the impact of expected demand on technical change in Chinese manufacturing.====We find quantitatively important demand effects on technical change: a one percent increase in expected market size increases firm-specific TFP by 0.46% and firm-specific labor productivity by 0.50%. Hence our findings suggest that firms in industries with a large expected local market have increased their productivity more strongly, and show also higher levels of other measures of innovative activity.====The estimated effect of expected market size is robust to a number of checks. First, we include a rich set of firm-level determinants of R&D and market concentrations, in particular foreign and government ownership, as some scholars pointed out that this may affect productivity to a considerable degree (====). Second, we show that our results are robust to supply-side drivers of R&D affecting innovation opportunities of Chinese firms by including different measures of worldwide technology potential reported by firms in the US and Switzerland operating in the same durable good industries. Third, our findings are robust when we control for a firms' export status. This is particularly important in the context of China, as the Chinese economy is strongly export-driven, so demand conditions on export markets may be more relevant for productivity and technical progress than domestic demand. We test for the robustness of our results controlling for firms' export behavior. Interestingly, in our dataset there is a stark dichotomy between exporting and non-exporting firms. About 54% of the firms in our sample do not export at all, whereas for 21% of them exports account for more than 75% of their total sales.==== It turns out that the domestic market size effect is insignificant for exporting firms. Instead, our results are entirely driven by non-exporting firms serving exclusively the Chinese market. This is coherent with our hypothesis that innovative activity is driven by the expectations of future market size. What matters for exporting firms is the global market. For these firms, the expansion of the domestic market size is less important. For non-exporters, however, technology adoption behavior strongly hinges upon expectations of the domestic market size. For instance, a car producer serving the local market will react to the expansion of the Chinese middle class. In contrast, the investment behavior of an assembling firm producing cameras that are exported globally will not be affected by local market size expectations.==== document a causal link between market size and innovation building on differential patterns of drug use between young and old individuals. Exploiting the demographic changes in the U.S. population as exogenous source of variation in market size, they find a positive effect of expected demand on innovation across different drug categories. Their findings are quantitatively important and very robust. A 1% increase in potential market size leads to approximately a 4% increase in the entry of new non-generic drugs. ==== demonstrates that health policies designed to increase utilization of vaccines created strong incentives to develop new vaccines. According to her estimates, a 1 dollar increase in expected annual revenue for vaccines generates additional 6 cents of investment in that vaccine. Moreover, these policies were associated with a 2.5-fold increase in clinical trials for new vaccines. Contrasting evidence comes from ==== who investigate the effect of Medicare on the development of new pharmaceuticals for the elderly. They find no evidence that the introduction of Medicare is associated with an increase in drug consumption among the elderly. Consistent with this, they also find no evidence of an increase in the approval of new drugs more likely to treat diseases that affect the elderly, after Medicare's introduction. ==== consider the market size increase for prescription drugs through Medicare Part D which increased pharmaceutical firms' expected sales. They find a significant increase in pharmaceutical R&D for therapeutic classes with a higher Medicare market share. ==== use detailed data on spending patterns of patients (and their insurers) to show that expected market size has a highly significant and quantitatively important effect on innovations (as measured by the number of new chemical entities of the market of a particular disease class.)====The above findings all indicate a large impact of expected market size on innovative activities but they are specific to the pharmaceutical industry. It is not clear whether empirical evidence from the pharmaceutical industry applies to other industries as well. ==== focus on demand effects on R&D in the whole U.S. industry. Using the input-output structure of different industries as an instrument for actual market size, it turns out that a sector's market share has a significant positive effect on sector-specific R&D investments.====). While an increase in R&D intensity is a common pattern over the development process, this has started when China has still a very large technology gap from the frontier. Taiwan, for comparison, reached the same R&D-to-GDP ratio in 1995 as did China in 2009, when its GDP per capita was twice as large as China in 2009. Some recent studies argue that this exceptional pattern is partly due to the opportunities provided by the presence of a large domestic market. ==== argue that large and fast growing consumer markets create a premium for research-intensive industries to establish production centers in close proximity to burgeoning-consumer markets. ==== go further and suggest that an important driving force could be the changing composition of domestic consumption shifting away from products with low-technology content (such as bicycles) to goods and services that are more technology intensive (such as automobiles).

In recent years, different types of ","China's land market is characterized by a dual-track system based on a division into urban and rural sectors. Under this system, rural land cannot be transferred to urban users directly by rural households (the land users) or by village committees (the formal land owners). The land must first be transferred to the government, i.e., rural collective-owned land must first become state-owned land (====; ====), which means that the government actually controls rural-urban land transfers. This dual-track land market, with prices paid to rural collectives kept artificially low, prevents rural households (and the rural sector) from benefitting from the incremental revenue resulting from rural-urban land conversion and thus contributes to the large income gap between China's rural and urban sectors (====; ====).====The 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (18th CCCPC) announced in 2013 that China is aiming to establish unified land markets with respect to the rural and urban sectors. In particular, rural households and/or village committees will be allowed to directly supply rural construction land (i.e. rural land that is not classified as agricultural land or unused land) to the urban sector (====). This decision by the 18th CCCPC is a strong signal that the Chinese government intends to liberalize rural-urban land transfers. The 19th CPCC held in October 2017 announced that land market reforms would be further deepened.====Liberalizing rural-urban land transfers intends to improve land allocation efficiency (====; ====). It is also expected to contribute to narrowing the rural-urban income gap, as rural households will earn a larger share of the incremental revenue resulting from land transfers (====; ====). But government land revenue will be negatively affected, which may cause reduced investments in infrastructure in rural and urban areas (====). And it is likely to contribute to larger income inequality within rural areas, as households living in urban fringes will benefit more than other rural households (====).====The available literature on land markets stresses the positive effects of liberalization on land productivity and allocation efficiency. Well-functioning land markets can contribute to economic development by transferring land from less productive to more productive users and by stimulating investment incentives, because the asset specificity of land decreases as a result of its transferability (====). There exists a substantial body of literature on the liberalization of land markets in either rural or urban sectors (====; ====; ====; ====). However, the available international literature on the liberalization of rural-urban land markets is very limited (====; ====). A possible explanation is that, although (local) governments in many countries intervene in rural-urban land transfers, they usually do not completely control rural-urban land transfers as the Chinese government does (====). The Chinese government decides not only the level of compensation paid to farmers and the price charged to urban users, but also the quantities of land acquired and supplied (====).====For over ten years, China has implemented ==== projects that experiment with rural-urban land market liberalization. These include pilots with short-term leases by rural households to urban users, long-term transfers (rentals or sales) to urban users, and with land use quotas traded by local governments with urban users. However, the question remains to be answered is: what¡¯s the impact of these three different types of land market liberalization rules on the distribution of incomes between rural and urban areas and the income distribution within rural areas? This study aims to gain more insights into these distributional effects by making a comparative analysis of three pilot projects carried out under each of these land market liberalization rules.====Statistics about rural-urban land transfers are considered as very sensitive by local officials. It is therefore impossible to collect detailed data about rural-urban land transfers. For that reason, we adopted a case study approach. The data collected through these three case studies cannot be used for rigorous statistical testing. Instead, we formulate two testable hypotheses from an analytical framework derived from existing theory, and examine the extent to which the data collected from the three case studies are consistent with those hypotheses. This approach allows us to obtain deeper insights into the distributional effects of rural-urban land transfers which cannot be obtained from available official statistics.====The paper is organized as follows.

Different values for income elasticities could be a major reason. This study projects meat and cereals demand for China based on a meta-analysis of the income elasticity estimates using a collection of 143 and 240 income elasticity estimates for cereals and meat products, respectively, from 36 primary studies. We find that income elasticities for most cereals (general cereals, rice, and coarse grains) and all meat products (general meat, pork, poultry, beef & mutton) tend to decline as per capita income increases, except for wheat, which increases. Taking this into account, differences between consumption projections based on time-varying income elasticities and values based on constant elasticities are substantial in quantities and increase over time.","In conjunction with rapid economic growth for more than three decades, China is experiencing significant structural changes in food consumption (====, ====). Understanding these changes and what they portend for future food consumption has important implications for food policy, particularly for a country with the sheer population size and GDP of China. And as an emerging economy, China's structural changes in food consumption may also carry policy lessons for other developing countries.====China has been the subject of extensive empirical studies on food demand during the past two decades using a wide range of models and data sources (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). However, the estimated demand elasticities in the literature are quite varied, and some even controversial (====). For instance, the income elasticity for wheat reaches as high as 1.1 in a study by ====, much greater than the ??0.37 estimated by ====.====The elasticities obtained from the empirical demand analyses are often used for projection of food demand, which could help make better food policies. Though there are many projections for China's food demand, and the projection results often differ significantly from each other. ==== and ====This paper conducts a meta-analysis of income elasticity estimates for meat and cereal products in China, which systematically studies the heterogeneities in the elasticities. A meta-analysis is a quantitative analysis of a body of similarly related primary studies to summarize the results or evaluate the reliability of the findings (====). We use a meta-regression approach in which study results are regressed on key characteristics of each study (====), alcohol (====), meat (====), calories (====) and Chinese total factor productivity (TFP) (====), we use the estimated income elasticities from the primary studies as the dependent variable in the meta regressions.====Many types of food products are analyzed in the food demand literature for China. We focus in this paper on two groups of products, cereals and meat. These are the two most important groups of food products in Chinese diets, as they are the main calorie sources (====, ====). In particular, meat consumption is linked to sustainable development (====), because the continuously increasing meat consumption in China may stress the environment and international food security, and hence has drawn a lot of attention both in the policy and the academic arenas. Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) in the ==== indicate that the shares of cereals and meat in total food expenditure were 8% and 20%, respectively, for urban China in 2011 and 14% and 21%, respectively, for rural China in 2011. Cereals and meat are also the two groups of food products in China for which there are the largest number of estimates of income elasticities.====As part of the meta-analysis we examine two questions pertinent to future food consumption in a country such as China that is growing economically and becoming more urbanized. First, is there a relationship between income elasticities and per capita income levels, and if there is, how do elasticities change as income grows? Engel's law indicates that the share of food expenditure in total household consumption will decline in company with income growth, and it implies that the income elasticity will become less sensitive (====). However, most of the current projections have not taken into this factor, and often use constant elasticities. The projections will cause substantial bias, mainly bias up particularly in the long run. Second, after controlling for per capita income, is there a systematic difference in income elasticities between rural and urban households? One can expect that the income elasticities in rural areas will be higher than in urban areas as the income in rural areas is lower, and the dietary is more dominated by tradition fiber food. The projection for food demand in China should separately shed light on rural and urban areas. The two questions are empirically supported by our meta-analysis. Accordingly, we project the demand for rural and urban separately as well.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: ==== introduces the data on income elasticities for cereals and meat demand in China; ==== describes the meta-regression models estimated in this paper; ==== outlines the variables hypothesized to explain heterogeneities in income elasticity estimates; ==== presents the meta-regression results; ==== derives projections of income elasticities based on the meta-regression results and what these projections mean for future Chinese food demand; and ==== contains conclusions and policy implications.",Projecting meat and cereals demand for China based on a meta-analysis of income elasticities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X17301888,5-Dec-17,2017,Research Article,406

In this paper, we study the impact of the reform on rural energy consumption. Devolving forest tenure improves farmers' access to forest products on their newly acquired forestland, and is therefore expected to increase farmers' fuelwood consumption. The reform also allows farmers to adopt some revenue-enhancing forest technologies which may lead to energy switching in farmer households. Our empirical study finds that the devolution significantly increases household fuelwood consumption for both lower and higher income households; the ==== benefit more. This is welfare-improving in places where alternative fuels are still too costly. We find limited evidence that higher income households in Yunnan begin to substitute alternative commercial fuels for fuelwood when those are available. Our findings suggest further devolution of forest rights, especially in the poor, forest-rich regions.","In most developing countries, traditional biomass (e.g., wood, straw, crop residues, manure, etc.) is the main energy source for rural households. Biomass-based energy such as fuelwood is still the largest source of renewable energy, accounting for roughly 10% of world total primary energy supply (====). In China's less developed rural areas, where some remote households lack access to electricity and other forms of marketed fuel, biomass is the largest source of fuel for domestic heating and cooking purposes (====). Nearly 60% of rural households use fuelwood as a main energy source for cooking as of 2010 (====). High reliance on biomass has implications for sustainable forest management (====, ====, ====, ====) and public health due to indoor air pollution (====).====The extensive literature has mainly investigated the determinants of fuelwood demand and its substitution by other energy types in developing countries, for example, ====, ==== and ==== in Nepal; ==== and ==== in rural India; ==== in Malawi; ==== in Uganda; ==== in Indonesia; ====, ====, ==== and ==== in rural China. However, to the authors' knowledge, no previous studies have investigated how forestry policies or reforms affect household fuelwood use. In China, the new round of Collective Forest Tenure Reform started in 2003, focusing in particular on forest rights devolution, i.e., increasing the proportion of forestland managed by individual households and strengthening tenure security. This larger proportion implies a greater extent of devolution (through transfer from village collectives to household responsibility).====The main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of forest rights devolution on the consumption of a forest product ¨C fuelwood ¨C in a relatively poor province in southwestern China. A secondary objective is to evaluate the substitution effects between alternate sources of energy. Our inquiry extends the prior household energy literature by adding the important policy dimension of tenure, and the geographic experience beyond South Asia and East Africa. In the literature evaluating Collective Forest Tenure Reform, little is known about the impact of forest rights devolution on rural household (biomass) energy demand. We evaluate the effect of greater and lesser devolution on fuelwood consumption by comparing villages in the same province that have different levels of devolution.====Forest tenure reform ensures that the households possess the rights to their forests and the future returns to their effort in terms of labor and capital. Well-defined and secure tenure in the Chinese reform establishes an incentive for improved forest management (====, ====, ====). One would also expect that, subsequently, forest production increases, in terms of the yields of timber, bamboo, fruit, fuelwood, and other non-timber forest products. The production, collection and self-consumption of the increase in any of these products adds to the welfare of the self-consuming households. The sales of the market products contribute to household cash income and enable them to make additional purchases of all varieties of consumer goods, including fuelwood and preferred substitutes such as charcoal, coal, LPG, and electricity where available.====Using household survey data collected in 30 villages in Yunnan province, we find that household fuelwood consumption does increase with the extent of forest rights devolution. The impact on fuelwood consumption is significant and positive for both lower and higher income households, and the ==== benefit more. We find limited evidence that higher income households in Yunnan begin to substitute alternative commercial fuels for fuelwood when those are available. In places where easy substitutes are unavailable, any tenure-induced increase in fuelwood contributes importantly to household welfare.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The results show that the implementation of the land tenure reform slowed down the increase in livestock production, although it did not completely stop this increase. It therefore appears that land reform is in itself unable to offset the impact of other factors that accelerate the increase in livestock production. Moreover, the constraining effect of the land tenure reform on the increase in livestock production decreases over time, and ultimately disappears.

According to the current Law of the People's Republic of China on the Contracting of Rural Land, use rights of grassland are contracted to individual households for a duration of 30¨C50?years. At the end of the 1970s, land tenure reform was first implemented through the Household Production Responsibility System in the crop farming areas of China and was completed rapidly and successfully. Research showed that the assignment of individual cropland use rights gave farmer the incentive of improved agricultural production and spurred the marketing of agricultural goods (see e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====). Based on this outcome, the central government of China continued land tenure reform in pastoral areas in the early 1980s and assigned grassland use rights as well as livestock property rights that had been owned by the communes to individual households. However, the assignment of grassland use rights has not been completed as successfully as that of cropland in China (====). For instance, compared with the cropland in China, where household-based use rights were assigned overnight, the assignment of grassland use rights is still incomplete despite efforts for 30?years. By 2014, around 84% of grasslands had been allocated to individual households in China, and the central government continues to emphasise the need for clarifying grassland use rights for individual households (====). In practice, in some areas of Inner Mongolia, only the grasslands for mowing forages have been allocated to individual households while the grazing grasslands are still owned and used by all of the local households (====). Scholars (e.g. ====, ====, ====) have identified a number of possible barriers to the completion of the land tenure reform in the pastoral areas of China. This paper will explore possible reasons by focussing on the aspect of pastoral livestock production.====, ====). The privatisation of grassland property rights or use rights has been regarded as a panacea to avoid overgrazing and protect the grassland ecosystem, in order to avoid the situation termed ¡®the tragedy of the commons¡¯ (====, ====, ====). ==== theorem stipulated that a clear assignment of property rights is a precondition for economically efficient resource allocation. The followers of the ¡®tragedy of the commons¡¯ and property rights theories advocate that the grassland resource should be either privatised or maintained as common land while clearly assigning rights of entry and use to promote the sustainable use of grassland through exclusiveness. Following this conventional wisdom, most governments in the world have assigned grassland property rights or use rights in an attempt to ensure the sustainable development of grasslands (====, ====). In line with observations about the effects of privatisation of cropland, the central government of China believes that the assignment of private grassland use rights provides land users with incentives to graze animals within the carrying capacity of the land, as well as to increase land investment in order to conserve their own grasslands (====).====However, the findings on the effects of privatizing grassland resources are complex (e.g. see ====, ====). During recent years, some scholars have expressed concern about the replacement of the traditional common-use system and nomadism by private use and settlement due to grassland privatisation (====, ====). This transformation of traditional pastoralism has impeded mobility and flexible grazing (====, ====) and limited herders' access to emergency pastures and other key productive resources (====, ====). This, in turn, has increased feeding costs and reduced herders' ability to withstand natural risks (e.g. ====). In addition, research has shown that the carrying capacity of grassland is reduced due to decreased access to heterogeneous landscapes (====, ====, ====). As such, the total population of livestock that could be supported by a grassland ecosystem is predicted to decline as a result of the spatial and social boundaries stemming from privatisation.====In fact, much of the growth in animal supply has been coming from rapidly expanding intensive breeding systems rather than through traditional grazing systems in pastoral areas (====). Similarly, the main production areas for livestock products in China have experienced a geographic shift from pastoral areas to crop farming areas (====). The market share of livestock products from grazing systems is decreasing compared to that of crop-livestock mixed or industrialised systems (====, ====). This trend is suggested to be attributed to the reduction in grass yields due to grassland degradation, and raises environmental concern about the ecosystem of permanent grassland (====, ====, ====). Besides these possible factors, we wish to ascertain whether the privatisation of grasslands has played a role in the changes in livestock production of pastoral areas. Despite an abundance of academic arguments and government reports on the results of the privatisation of grassland, there is a lack of quantitative studies, especially based on large-scale areas and long-term observations (e.g. ====, ====, ====). Moreover, the existing literature is short of empirical analysis targeting the impact of grassland privatisation on livestock production, although some studies are concerned with ecological effects. Nevertheless, animal husbandry provides livelihoods to millions of people in pastoral areas and has the potential capacity to meet the rapidly increasing global demand for livestock products which is stimulated by growing populations, urbanisation and rising disposable incomes (====). In this regard, livestock production in pastoral areas is an issue of high societal relevance and one which deserves being paid close attention to.====In the following section, we first describe the land tenure reform and the current livestock production in the research region. Next, in ====, the data collection method is explained and a descriptive analysis based on the collected data is used to elaborate on the changes in livestock production in the pastoral areas compared to crop farming areas. In ==== and ====, we present the empirical model used in the study and the estimation results. In ====, we discuss the model results and their underlying reasons. We conclude this paper with some final observations on the effects of grassland privatisation on livestock production in pastoral areas.","How does land tenure reform impact upon pastoral livestock production?

Our results demonstrate that the overall impact of reducing the deviations (i.e., reducing meat/egg consumption and increasing fruit/vegetable/dairy consumption) can improve both diet quality and environmental sustainability. The results also imply that reducing cereal and fruit prices may facilitate achievement of both the CDGs' targets and environmental sustainability by reducing meat consumption and increasing fruit consumption. If the recommendation of the CDGs is followed with additional environmental costs, it will be important to discuss how to minimize them.","In China, following its rapid economic development, dietary patterns have been drastically changing from its traditional diets (primarily of cereal products and starchy roots, with few animal source foods or caloric sweeteners) to diets that contain more energy-dense foods and are high in fat, particularly saturated fat, and low in carbohydrates (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). Dietary change is often considered as a key driving force behind the recent increase of obesity and the prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes and hypertension) in China (====, ====, ====, ====).

This study examines and compares the key determinants of perceptions of security of tenure over contract land and wasteland, two types of land that are characterized by tenure being formally and informally ascribed. The material is drawn from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, an ethnically heterogeneous region which has more complex tenure systems than elsewhere in China. Empirical estimations based on a survey of 352 households, complemented by interviews with key informants, demonstrate that formal institutions (measured by official land documents) do not significantly contribute to households' perceptions of tenure security on either type of land, and that both interpersonal trust and political trust significantly enhance perceived tenure security on either land type in our research area. The empirical evidence further shows that perceptions of tenure security on both types of land are more sensitive to trust towards village cadres than trust in villagers.","Given its growing scarcity, access to agricultural land has gained global political and social importance. Within this context, small farmers, particularly in developing countries, are confronted by multiple threats, partly caused by tenure insecurity. Policies aimed at enhancing tenure security, mainly by granting formalized private property rights, have been widely implemented in many developing countries (====, ====). It is often argued that the level of tenure security under community ownership is lower than that under a private property regime (====), and this has led neoclassical and neoinstitutional economists to be supportive of land privatization (====, ====, ====). This raises a pertinent question: do legal formalized property rights contribute to increased tenure security in China, particularly in regions where cultural traditions strongly influence the implementation and outcome of economic and policy reforms? This study seeks to answer this question by looking in detail at the case of small cotton farmers in rural Xinjiang, China.====There is evidence to show that land-titling campaigns can enhance tenure security (====, ====, ====). However, this approach can also be criticized since, in practice, land titling often fails to improve the tenure of security of poor and small-scale farmers (====, ====, ====). Moreover, the provision of tenure security through the legal formalization of property rights is often time-consuming and costly, and usually caters primarily to rural elites (====, ====, ====).====, ====). Informal institutional arrangements play an important role in this as they are cost-effective and involve a degree of social acknowledgment in the process of land occupation and access to land rights (====, ====, ====, ====). Available empirical evidence also shows that land related investment activities can strengthen landholders' land tenure security (====, ====, ====). However, these arrangements may also be a source of insecurity (====), as informal institutional frameworks lack the legal protection of state agencies (====, ====, ====, ====). In addition, community-based titles may encounter difficulties in land transfer when faced with growing land market demands (====). As such, ==== has argued that under informal settings without full usufruct rights, it is difficult for landholdings to be used as a marketable (and bankable) asset.====Thus, opinions about the effects of ¡®informal (or customary)¡¯ and ¡®formal¡¯ institutional arrangements on land tenure security vary considerably (====).==== Despite the large body of work on the impact of the two approaches there is still no consensus on the role of institutional forms in shaping land tenure security (====, ====). This leads us to examine the factors that influence land tenure security under specific tenure regimes.====We analyze tenure security in China by examining the extent to which formal (legal) tenure institutions enhance small scale farmers' perceptions of tenure security. The study has both theoretical and practical significance, the latter because it provides a fascinating perspective on the outcomes of tenure reforms in the period following the household responsibility system (HRS) era of the early 1980s. Several rounds of tenure reforms aimed at enhancing tenure security have been carried out since then, and rural land in China is described as ¡®quasi-private¡¯ (====). Farmers are granted long-term use rights, albeit with substantially variations between villages (====). However, the threat of land eviction and disputes over ambiguous ownership are still widespread (====, ====, ====), since households' tenure status is insufficiently protected (====). To date there has been very little empirical analysis of the role of formal and informal institutions in shaping farmers' perceptions of their tenure security in rural China,==== and particularly whether formalizing land tenure security has any significant effect.====Our study focuses on rural Xinjiang, which has China's largest population of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, and is one of the poorest regions in China (====). This region is characterized by two different tenure regimes with that apply to contract land and wasteland.==== In rural Xinjiang it is often problematic to maintain access to land as local governments retain control over land due to concerns about local and regional food security and social stability. Rural Xinjiang's combination of ethnic heterogeneity and relatively complex tenure regimes provides an interesting context for exploring the role of institutional factors in shaping land tenure security - a topic which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously analyzed.====This paper investigates and compares the key determinants of perceptions of tenure security on both contract land and wasteland within a context of multi-ethnic community. It particularly focuses on the role of land certificates, formal contracts and (interpersonal and political) trust. Such an analysis can contribute to a broader theoretical understanding of land tenure security under different land tenure regimes. It can also contribute to a better understanding of how contract land and wasteland are claimed and ¡®secured¡¯ within coexisting formal and informal settings in rural China - a country where agriculture is in a crucial stage of transition, in which relatively weak legal structures occur alongside the rapidly expanding influence of markets. As such we intend that our analysis of this case study in Xinjiang should make a worthwhile empirical contribution to the debate on perceptions of land tenure security and the mechanisms that shape these.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== portrays the key land tenure reforms in the post-HRS era in rural China and includes a summary of the results of a qualitative study undertaken in rural Xinjiang, that looks at how small farmers' perceptions of tenure security (on contract land and wasteland) is shaped within contemporary, differentiated, land tenure regimes.

Given that meat consumption can be regarded as a proxy for dietary quality, this study sheds light on the link between meat consumption and democratic governance using a cross-national panel dataset for 125 countries covering the period from 1972 to 2013. Employing a two-stage demand system, we find that democracy is positively correlated with meat consumption (including bovine, poultry, pig, and mutton and goat meat). A one unit improvement in democracy score, as measured by Freedom House, increases per capita total meat consumption by 3.57%. Furthermore, our results show that the effect varies according to meat product. In particular, a one unit qualitative improvement in democracy score increases the consumption of bovine, pig, poultry, and mutton and goat meat by 2.9%, 2.5%, 3.8% and 3.2% respectively.","The human right to food is acknowledged in numerous legal instruments; nevertheless, approximately 800 million people around the world were undernourished in 2014¨C2016 (====).

However, the improvement in energy use efficiency had offset the impact from income growth and dietary transition and led to the drop in China's food-related carbon emissions from 1992 to 2007.","Food systems have profound impacts on global climate change and human health. Throughout the entire food system, the input of fertilizers and animal feed during preproduction activities, agricultural practices and land-use changes during production activities, and the input of food processing, transportation, retailing, and storage during postproduction activities can contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in both direct and indirect ways. Globally, food systems have been estimated to be responsible for between 19% and 29% of anthropogenic GHG emissions (====). Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests a link between dietary transition and human health (====, ====). In conjunction with the rising incomes and transitions to modern urban lifestyles, global consumers are in the midst of a nutritional transition (====). The switch from a traditional plant-based diet to a more animal-based westernized diet has led to potentially serious health risks (====, ====). The current obesity epidemic in developed countries is considered to be correlated with the excessive consumption of animal-based foods (====). The transition to diets that rely heavily on meat and dairy products may, in addition to obesity, also increase the incidence of several chronic non-communicable diseases, including type II diabetes, coronary heart disease and some cancers (====, ====).====Diets heavy in meat and dairy products can not only do harm to human health, they also produce much higher GHG emissions compared to traditional plant-based diets. Evidence has shown that there are huge differences in the climate impacts of various food types (====). From a life cycle perspective, the GHG emissions from red meat have been shown to be approximately 4 times larger than those from vegetables in the USA (====). ==== have also found that, per unit, meat consumption resulted in GHG emissions that were more than ten times as high as GHG emissions from grains. Based on a national economic input-output life cycle assessment model (EIO-LCA), ==== have indicated that in Finland meat products account for 25% of the carbon footprint of food consumption, while grain products only account for 11%. Concerns about the food security, human health, and climate change trilemma have gained increasingly more attention in recent years, and the climate and health benefits of different dietary choices have been explored. Reducing the intake of animal-sourced foods has been found to simultaneously result in significant GHG emission reductions and positive health outcomes (====). ==== have indicated that the adoption of German Nutrition Society dietary recommendations ¨C with reduced meat consumption compared to current levels ¨C can achieve 11% of GHG emission reductions from the food sector and generate valuable health benefits. ==== have also proven that adoption of a healthier diet with less meat and more vegetables would result in a 1.8 Gt yr==== reduction in GHG emissions worldwide, which is equal to the total of worldwide transportation emissions in 2010. According to a study conducted by ====, dietary shifting to fewer animal-based foods and more plant-based foods could not only reduce global mortality by 6¨C10%, it could also cut food-associated GHG emissions by 29¨C70% compared with a reference scenario by 2050. Monetizing the value of co-benefits, the economic benefits of improved diets have been estimated to be equivalent to 0.4¨C13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050.====With the accelerated growth in household income, food consumption has increased significantly and the composition of foods consumed in China has changed considerably in the past several decades (====, ====, ====). On the one hand, total energy intake has increased from 1742?kcal per capita per day in 1950 to 2386?kcal per capita per day in 2000 (====). On the other hand, China is also transitioning to a more animal-based westernized diet. Meat consumption increased by 349% from 1963 to 2003, while the consumption of cereals peaked in the late 1990s and then showed a declining trend (====). In terms of nutrient intake, the proportion of energy from fat increased from 21.8% in 1991 to 32.0% in 2011, and this increase was even larger in mega cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing, which was 36.9% in 2011 (====).====China's increased food consumption and its transition in dietary structure may make major contributions to climate change. As the largest food consumer and the biggest GHG emitter worldwide, China is also facing the food security, human health, and climate change trilemma. To guarantee the food supply for 1.3 billion people, China's grain output has increased greatly, mainly due to increasing use of fertilizer in the last several decades. From 1980 to 2010, emissions emanating from fertilizer manufacture and use in China tripled. In particular, nitrogen fertilizer-related emissions contributed 7% of national GHG emissions in 2010 (====). Moreover, in 2006 China surpassed the USA and became the world's largest emitter of CO====; it emitted 8.33 billion tons of CO==== in 2010, which accounted for 25.1% of global emissions (====, ====). To reduce the impact of climate change, in 2015 China submitted ¡°Enhanced Actions on Climate Change: China's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions¡± to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. According to the document, China intends to reach the peak of its carbon dioxide emissions in approximately 2030 and to lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% of the 2005 level (====). In terms of national GHG emission reduction, understanding the climate impact of food consumption and dietary change, which account for a large proportion of national GHG emissions, as well as the drivers of change in food-related GHG emissions, is thus very important.====In this study, an economic input-output model has been applied to estimate the CO==== emissions of food consumption from 1992 to 2007 in China. To investigate the impact of household characteristics on food-related emissions, a non-parametric estimate and parametric analysis have also been conducted.

The UNCED changed to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio?+?20) in 2012, which was one of the largest conferences ever held by the United Nations (UN) (====). Later, participants of the 2015 conference adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (====). Sustainable development is complex and comprehensive and one of the indispensable components of it is sustainable food consumption and production. How food is produced and consumed has a great implication on the conservation of natural ecosystems and environments (====). This is particularly true for China which has limited natural resources to feed the world's largest population. Whether China can develop a sustainable consumption and production system will significantly affect its food security, food safety, environment, and ecosystems (====).====Sustainable food is food produced by taking into consideration its environmental impact, economic viability, and social justice principles (====, ====). A sustainable food consumption and production system is consumer-driven. Individual lifestyles, diets, consumption habits, and food preferences have an influential impact on the amounts, the types, and the ways that food is produced (====). Before the twentieth century, people had limited knowledge of the effect of food production on the environment, ecosystems, and human health. Take for instance the globally promoted Green Revolution which focused on the use of modern agricultural technology and chemicals to improve food production output (====). With increased understanding of the effects of the heavy use of fossil-based chemicals, the Green Revolution was criticized for its negative impact on biodiversity, human health, income distribution, and sustainability (====, ====). As a result, people became increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of food production, and began changing their food choices (====, ====, ====, ====). China experienced the same type of changes. Chinese organic market value increased dramatically from $500 million in 2007 to $1.1 billion in 2008. Compared to 2012, the 2013 sales of organic honey and organic cereals in the Chinese market increased by more than 45%, valued about $0.97 billion. Meanwhile, the organic certifications to products also saw a surge of 50% in 2013 (====; ====). To meet the increasing but heterogeneous demand for safer and more environmentally friendly food products, the Chinese government adopted a three-tier system that certifies Safe Food, Green Food, and Organic Food (====). Due to the influential role of consumer food choices, identifying consumer preferences of sustainable foods and the important factors affecting consumer preferences would provide important information to develop and promote a sustainable food consumption and production system.====Most of the current literature on consumer preferences of sustainable foods focuses on food labels, such as organic labels (====, ====, ====), eco-labels (====, ====, ====), fair trade labels (====, ====), animal welfare labels (====, ====, ====), and local food (====, ====). These researches show that consumers generally are willing to pay more for food with certain types of sustainable labels and that heterogeneous preferences exist among consumers. While foods carrying these labels are produced in certain sustainable ways, sustainable food is a more comprehensive and complex concept, with few researches specifically investigating consumer preference of foods carrying the sustainable label. One exception is the ==== which examined UK consumers' perception of the Sustainable Agriculture label. The definition of the sustainable label in this study is narrowed down to ¡°labels that indicate the products were grown with practices that had a low impact on the environment¡± (====). Nevertheless, evidence shows that previous research has not examined consumer preference of sustainable labels that reflect the comprehensive economic, social, and environmental responsibilities regarding food production.====The literature on Chinese consumer preferences of different types of sustainable labels is rather limited, mostly focusing on organic, green, and fair trade labels. ==== conclude that consumers are willing to pay a premium as high as 130% for organic food in some cities of China. ==== show that Chinese consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for green-labeled and eco-labeled seafood is higher than those for non-certified seafood. In addition, green-labeled seafood receives a higher premium than eco-labeled seafood. ==== demonstrate that Chinese consumers are willing to pay 47% and 40% more for green vegetables and meat, respectively, than for their conventional counterparts. ==== show that Chinese consumers have a positive attitude and WTP for fair trade coffee. The higher WTP for organic or green food may result from the intention to protect both self-interests and social-interests, especially natural food resource sustainability (====). The impact of age, income, food expenditure, and education on consumer WTP and purchase intention of these foods is unclear. Research shows that income has a significant positive effect on consumer WTP and purchase intention for some but not for others (====, ====). ==== demonstrate that education has a significant positive impact on consumer WTP for eco-labeled seafood, while ==== and ==== do not find any significant impact of education on Chinese consumer WTP for different types of sustainable labels.====Obvious gaps exist between current knowledge and the need for a better understanding of Chinese consumer preference and demand for sustainable food. More information on consumer preference of sustainable food will help develop policies and programs that can more effectively promote sustainable food consumption, which is an indispensable part of the sustainable development of China's agriculture and food system. The objective of this research is to fill this gap by identifying Chinese consumers' perception of sustainable foods and their WTP for these foods. Perception has a significant impact on consumer preference formulation (====). Determining consumer perception of sustainable food is important because sustainability is often confused with ¡°good for the environment¡± green labels and/or eco-labels (====).====In this study, we determine Chinese consumer perception and preference of sustainable fluid milk, which is produced with less impact on the environment, improved animal welfare, etc. We choose milk because dairy products provide nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, and potassium that are essential for individual health, and fluid milk accounts for about 95% of Chinese consumers' dairy consumption. Although historically under-consumed by Chinese consumers (====), milk has become an integrated part of Chinese consumers' daily diet, with consumption increasing at an annual rate of 10% from 1990 to 2016 (====; ====). Increased consumption not only provides market opportunities, but also places great pressure on domestic dairy producers. Mainly due to the mismatch between the fast growing dairy industry and effective regulations and food safety control, the Chinese milk industry experienced several severe food safety incidents (e.g., the 2008 milk scandal) that damaged consumer confidence in domestic milk products (====, ====). The dramatic increase in the number of dairy cattle also creates some environmental problems because many dairy farms are small and lack the incentives and facilities to produce milk in socially responsible ways that are both environmentally and animal friendly (====). These evidences suggest that promoting sustainable milk consumption may be an important approach to alleviate many of the problems in the dairy industry regarding food safety, animal welfare, the environment, and social responsibility. On the one hand, if the dairy industry can produce milk sustainably, it may recover Chinese consumers' confidence in domestically produced milk products. On the other hand, if consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable milk products, the dairy industry will have more incentives to produce high quality dairy products in an environmental and animal friendly and social responsible way.",Chinese consumer quality perception and preference of sustainable milk,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X16300591,28-May-16,2016,Research Article,415

We use implementation measures of family planning policies as ==== in the estimations, and find that being raised in a one-child family significantly increases the weight, body mass index, and probability of being overweight or obese for children. By examining mothers' care-taking behaviors and their children's dietary habits and nutritional intake, we identify the following channels linking one-child families with childhood obesity. (a) In one-child families, parents prefer spending money to using their time to care for their children. (b) In one-child families, children eat more high-sugar, high-fat, and high-protein food. A time¨Cmoney trade-off could be a plausible mechanism of the effects we document.","Childhood overweight and obesity are becoming major public health concerns for China. With the rapid rise in living standards over the past three decades, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased steadily. National surveys on the health of schoolchildren have shown that the obesity rate among children aged 7¨C18?years increased fourfold between 1985 and 2000 (====). According to a 2015 report on nutrition and chronic diseases among Chinese children aged 6¨C17?years, the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4%¨C5.1% and 4.3% higher, respectively, than in 2002. The situation is the most serious in larger cities. In 2000, the prevalence of obesity and overweight in boys aged 7¨C18?years was 11.3% and 6.5% in Beijing, 13.2% and 4.9% in Shanghai, and 9.9% and 4.5% in large coastal cities (====). According to a report from China's Working Group on Obesity in 2004, 21.7% of 2- to 18-year-olds was obese (====). Childhood overweight and obesity not only affect children's physical and mental development (====), but also directly threaten their quality of life in adulthood (====). Of people who are overweight, 75.9% have at least one metabolic abnormality and 20.4% have metabolic syndrome (====).====The main theories on which our hypothesis stands are those exploring the mechanisms in the accumulation of children's human capital. One of the most widely known and intensively studied of these is the quantity¨Cquality (Q¨CQ) trade-off theory. Briefly, the concept can be traced back to Malthus, who first theorized about economic constraints and population growth. After ==== and ====, ====, ====) tend to support the Q¨CQ theory, more recent studies are less conclusive. ==== find that children with more siblings are less likely to attend private school. ==== and ==== show that family size has a negative effect on children's education, particularly in areas with poor public education systems. ==== do not find any negative consequences of having more siblings. ==== report that family size has only a negligible effect on child quality after the birth order effect is controlled for. ==== argues that having a second child raises the school enrollment rate of the firstborn child in rural China. ==== finds a negative effect of family size on children's stature and health status in China.====Overweight and obesity are crucial factors affecting the health capital of children, so it is natural to consider taking them as measures of general quality==== under the Q¨CQ framework. In this paper, we examine the relationship between family size and childhood obesity. For China, the OCP, which exogenously constrained family size, brought unique patterns to family size and composition across the country. According to a population survey, China had approximately 110¨C120?million only children aged 0¨C19?years in 2005, constituting approximately 20% of the child population (====).==== Such a population structure may have profound influences on several generations' living quality and on the country's future development. Because of the uniqueness of this subpopulation, we focus on the differences in body weight between only children and those with at least one sibling. Thus, the results could also be considered an indicator of the policy effect of OCP from the perspective of public health. Taking advantage of the exogenous regional variations in the implementation of the policy, we document a causal relationship between being the only child and being overweight. We also explore possible channels for this causal relationship. Children from one-child families generally consume more high energy-dense food and receive less care-taking time from their parents, especially mothers. A time¨Cmoney trade-off mechanism is proposed to link the two findings and explain the channel; specifically, because of the economies of scale in care-taking behaviors with respect to child number, mothers tend to spend less time caring for only children, and compensate for this by spending more money on high-energy food for them. To our knowledge, few research directly studies the consequence of OCP on childhood overweight: As a supplement result, ==== find a negative correlation between body weight and being a twin. They do not control for the body height, and do not take the concept of overweight and obesity into consideration. We use BMI related variables, which are commonly taken as measurements for overweight and obesity. ====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ==== provides an introduction to the OCP and some of its consequences. ==== briefly presents the conceptual framework of the time¨Cmoney trade-off. ==== introduces the data and variables. ==== provides the main empirical results, evidence for possible channels, and robustness checks of the results. ==== concludes the paper.",One-child policy and childhood obesity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1630058X,25-May-16,2016,Research Article,416

We first examine in detail the list of products subject to additional tariffs, and then use the model to estimate the economic impacts of the trade conflict. Based on the direct and indirect impacts on the energy sector of each country, we then extend the analysis to the issue of global energy demand. Our empirical results indicate that both China and the U.S. suffer from the conflict, although the impacts on China are greater Both countries experience a reduction in energy demand and a ==== slowdown. Although certain countries may benefit from the China-U.S. trade conflict in short-run, a general negative impact on the global economic prospects can affect all.

Taking 2017 alone, that trade deficit reached US$275.8 billion, accounting for 47% of the total trade volume between China and the U.S. (from China Customs). In June and July 2018, the U.S. government announced to raise tariffs twice against a list of imported Chinese goods worth US$50 billion and US$200 billion, respectively.====This bilateral relationship has become one of the major challenges for not only the Chinese economy but also global economic development. It is obvious that the China¨CU.S. relationship has profound impacts on all aspects of the global economy, and a trade conflict between the two giants can certainly affect global energy markets. Indirectly, the impacts of the China-U.S. trade conflict will spread to other countries, which could cause a global economic recession, and induce further negative effects on energy demand across the world. In general, it is timely to investigate the extent to which the dispute between China and the U.S. may affect energy markets.====Our research makes two main contributions to the existing literature. First, we consider the industry-level nature of our model as an advantage over the macro-economic models, because differences in the industrial composition of all Chinese products with the additional 10% ad valorem rate of duty are explicitly taken into account. In the context of the current process of globalization, the total impact on trade is not the only concern: The impacts on key industries and sectors, especially related to energy demand, must also be considered. Second, our model allows us to address direct and indirect impacts due to sector interconnections. For example, raising tariffs on non-energy goods may have no direct impact on the energy sector; the tariffs might, however, induce indirect losses to the energy sector through sector input links. The strict dichotomy between quantities and prices can be considered a downside of our model, but is less of an issue as long as the focus is on the analysis of the short-run effect.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In ====, we present a brief literature review of the trade conflict, the reasons behind them, the economic impacts, and the energy impacts. In ====, we investigate the lists of tariff-targeted goods presented by China and the U.S. in their trade conflict, and extract the energy-related items. In ====, we introduce the main methodology and describe the data. In ====, we analyze the impact of the China-U.S. trade conflict on the global economy and energy demand under different scenarios. In ====, we summarize the paper and provide policy implications.====The key underlying assumptions of the ISM are that neither imports nor exports are perfect substitutes for the corresponding domestic products (====), and the import demand in a certain economy can be explained by domestic residents' income and relative product price (====; ====; ====; ====). Therefore, the ISM needs to satisfy two conditions: First, in the short term, if the importing economy changes the tariff rates, the exporting economy cannot immediately adjust the price. In this case, the growth in the value of the exports of a certain product equals the growth in the quantity of exports of that product. Second, in the export demand function, the price is exogenous to avoid bias. In other words, the price elasticity of the supply of exports is large enough that the demand function can remain stable even when the supply function changes.====The ISM assumes there are two economies¡ªEconomy 1 and Economy 2. Economy 2's demand for imports from Economy 1 equals the exports from Economy 1 to Economy 2. Economy 2's demand function for imports from Economy 1 should be determined by the national budget constraint of Economy 2, the price of domestic products in Economy 2, and the price of imported products from Economy 1:====where ==== denotes Economy 2's demand for imports from Economy 1, ==== denotes Economy 2's importing price for Economy 1's products, ==== denotes the domestic price of the corresponding products in Economy 2, and ==== denotes residents' nominal income in Economy 2¡ªin other words, the national budget constraint of Economy 2. If the income elasticity and the price elasticity of the demand for imports stay constant during the observed period, then Eq. ==== can be adjusted to:====where ====, ====, ==== represent the import demand income elasticity, the import price elasticity of the import demand, and the domestic price elasticity of the import demand, respectively. The residual is denoted by====. ====?=?====?+?==== denotes national budget constraint. If the domestic price====, importing price====, and national budget constraint ==== had the same growth, the resident indifference curves and the national budget constraint would remain stable, and their tangent point, which determines the level of consumer demand that maximizes utility, would also remain stable. This characteristic of the ISM indicates that the consumer has no money illusion. Such homogeneity of the demand function is expressed by dividing the right side of Eq. ==== by ==== so that the two determinants of the demand function become the level of the residents' real income deflated by the domestic product price in Economy 2 (====) and the relative price of the imported products from Economy 1 (====). Thus, Eq. ==== can be adjusted to:====Eqs. ====, ====, ==== form the framework of the traditional ISM.====According to consumer theory, a consumer's objective function is not simply to maximize current utility but long-term utility. In other words, a consumer will properly arrange her income over her lifetime, that is, dynamically adjust her consumption structure to maximize utility over his lifetime. Similarly, import demand depends not only on the current domestic residents' income and domestic prices but also on the domestic residents' income and domestic prices in past years, the global trade environment, cost increases, etc. Thus, the domestic residents' income and domestic prices in previous years should be taken into consideration in estimating import demand. Based on that, this paper adopted the polynomial distributed lag model (PDLM). For each given product, Eq. ==== can be adjusted to:====The demand for each given import is determined by the residents' real income in the past m periods and the relative price of the imported product in the past n periods. ==== denotes the quantity of product i imported from Economy 1 to Economy 2 in period t. ====denotes the fixed effect of product i. ==== is the income elasticity of demand for imported product i with time-lag m; ==== is the price elasticity of demand for imported product i with time-lag n.====We use T to represent the tariff rate. If Economy 2's initial import tariff on imported product i from Economy 1 is ====, it will increase to ==== after a tariff change. Assuming that in the short term, the exporter cannot adjust the export price, the change in the tariff would be completely added into the importing price. Then the relative price of the imported product i from Economy 1 between before and after the tariff change would be:====Then, the growth of the quantity in Economy 2 of imported product i from Economy 1 (or the growth of the quantity of Economy 1's exported product i in Economy 2) is:====As the export price remains constant in the short term, the growth of the value of the exported products equals the growth of the quantity.====To solve the collinearity problem of Eq. ====, we introduce the PDLM for coefficient estimation. Then, Eq. ==== is rewritten as follows:====where==== is the explanatory variable vector, ====?=?(====1,?====2,?¡­,?====)====is the vector of coefficients, and ==== is treated as a lagged variable.====The PDLM assumes that the coefficient ====obeys the following form of p-order polynomials:====where c is constant, ====.====Then, Eq. ==== can be rewritten as:====where====To identify the optimal value of p, we select ====?=?2,3,4,5,6 for testing.

Yet, while the effects of homeownership on various aspects of children's objective wellbeing are well documented,==== the effect of homeownership on children's subjective wellbeing (SWB)==== has received very little attention in the literature. Some studies have considered the SWB of children (see e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). There is only one study that considers the relationship between homeownership and SWB of children. In a cross-sectional study of the determinants of SWB of 11?years old children in the UK, ==== find that children living in rental houses had lower SWB than those living in houses owned by their parents.====We test whether homeownership status has a causal effect on the SWB of children in China and examine the channels or mediators via which it may affect the child's SWB. To do so, we use nationally representative longitudinal data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Compared with other national datasets that contain information on children, such as the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), CFPS has the advantage that it contains data on both the SWB of children and whether their parents own their home, along with a rich set of controls that are potentially correlated with the child's SWB.====There is by now a considerable amount of literature on the determinants of SWB in China (see e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) of which, a subset has examined the effect of homeownership (see e.g. ====; ====) on the SWB of the adult population. There is also a growing literature on the determinants of different aspects of SWB of children in China. For example, ==== studies the effect of China's one-child policy and finds that being an only child significantly lowers the SWB of children. Other studies include ==== and ====, who find that perceived parental warmth, the level of engagement of one's family and level of social capital at school are determinants of various aspects of SWB of children in China. There are, however, no studies that examine the relationship between homeownership and SWB of children in China.====Our contribution is related to two strands of literature. One strand of literature are studies focused on the relationship between homeownership and objective outcomes. Studies have shown that children of homeowners receive better grades (see e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====); are better behaved (see e.g. ====; ====; ====); have better health (====); experience lower rates of teen pregnancy (see e.g. ====; ====), have lower rates of criminal conviction (====), are less likely to end up on welfare (====) and have better lifetime prospects in general (see e.g. ====) than children of renters.====A related literature to which we contribute are studies on housing status more generally, including housing insecurity, housing quality, overcrowding and residential mobility, and subjective child outcomes, such as cognitive development, emotional and social well-being and mental health. One set of studies finds that children living in homes owned by their parents have fewer emotional and behavioral difficulties (====). A third set of studies has found a negative association between excessive moving and children's cognitive and emotional outcomes (see e.g. ====; ====). A fourth set of studies find that children who live in poorer quality housing experience lower emotional wellbeing and poorer mental health (see review in ====). Other studies have found that overcrowding contributes to children's emotional problems (====).====Our novel contribution is that we present the first study to examine in depth the relationship between homeownership and the SWB of children. We differ from ==== in important respects. The first is in terms of focus. While our focus is on homeownership and SWB of children, homeownership was just one of many variables that ==== considered in a more general study of the SWB of children. The second is that while ==== used cross-sectional data and do not address endogeneity, we use panel data and employ a range of approaches to address endogeneity.====In presenting the first comprehensive study of the relationship between homeownership and SWB of children, we contribute to the existing literature on housing status and child outcomes in several important ways. First, existing research on homeownership and child wellbeing has focused on factors likely to affect children's future wellbeing or becoming. However, ==== suggests that just focusing on future wellbeing gives only a partial picture of the child's overall wellbeing. To get a holistic overview of the effects of homeownership on the child's wellbeing, it is essential to also consider the effect on their present wellbeing, reflected in their SWB. Second, there is increasing interest in what determines children's SWB, including housing status, that has not been explored in the literature (====). This interest reflects greater attention among economists to indicators of social progress other than GDP more generally (see e.g. ====, ====; ====). Third, while studies have considered the relationship between housing status and emotional outcomes more generally, these studies have focused on emotional problems in children. The positive psychology movement (====) has shifted the focus from factors associated with problematic outcomes to consider those factors that improve our wellbeing or make us happier. The existing literature on housing status and child outcomes does not address the role that housing status can play in contributing positively to children's happiness.====Our preferred results suggest that children of homeowners have 2.79 percentage points higher SWB than children of non-homeowners. Moreover, we find heterogeneity in the SWB of children across genders, residential location and migration status of the household. Our results remain robust to a range of checks, including alternative ways to address potential endogeneity of homeownership, parental income and the SWB of the child's father.====This result contributes to the literature on the welfare implications of long-term social policy ¨C in this case housing policy ¨C change. Over the last decade, the Chinese government has expanded its affordable housing programs - such as the Economical and Comfortable Housing Program and the Housing Provident Fund Program ¨C as vehicles to promote homeownership (see e.g. ====; ====). Our results suggest that programs, such as this, designed to increase housing affordability, can increase the welfare of Chinese children. In an era in which Chinese parents are going to increasing lengths to ensure the happiness, and secure the future of the ¡°little emperor¡± generation (====), our results also have important practical implications for parents.

Different officials have different policy preferences, and their incentives and restraint mechanisms vary according to the individual situation. Thus, political turnover will lead to changes in economic performance (====; ====; ====; ====The existing literature has focused on the relationship between political turnover and regional economic performance. Research shows that political turnover has a significant and negative effect on economic growth, but its effect however varies greatly according to individual factors, such as ages, turnover frequency and so on (====; ====; ====). Additionally, political turnover may help terminate relationship network which is established on the basis of geographic advantage (====; ====; ====). In recent years, an increasing number of scholars investigated the effects of political turnover on business operations from a micro perspective. Researchers reveal that political turnover has a significantly negative effect on firm investment (====; ====; ====; ====) and R&D expenditures (====; ====). Furthermore, firms increase their rent-seeking costs in order to establish new connections after political turnover (====; ====), and hence their dividend and bonus are reduced accordingly (====). It is shown that political turnover also significantly influences financial markets (====; ====; ====; ====). These influences are more obvious during economic recession (====; ====).====; ====). However, many scholars have criticised these methods which ignore the role of local governments. The existing literature focuses on whether government behavior leads to a ¡°race to the bottom¡± or ¡°race to the top¡± in environmental standards (====; ====). Some documents show that local governments pursue the ¡°race to the bottom¡± strategies when they use weak environmental standards to attract or retain economic activities in their jurisdictions (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Research also shows that government officials have incentives to support local firms through tolerating their heavy pollution and even protecting them from being penalized for producing excessive pollution (====; ====; ====). Therefore, fiscal decentralization and GDP growth assessment imply that local governments lack enthusiasm in environmental protection.====However, the existing literature mainly focuses on the effects of political turnover on economic growth and business operations. It fails to analyse the role of government officials who are the decision makers. Local government officials have control over a lot of resources and their decision-making has far-reaching influence on economic growth and resource allocation. In addition, previous studies emphasise how political incentives caused by fiscal decentralization affect government performance in environmental regulations at the macro level. They pay little attention to the officials' behavior associated with political exchange, tenure system and so on.====In this paper, we manually collect the biographical records of 643 mayors and 612 Party secretaries during 2007¨C2015, and combine firm-level information with official turnover data to examine how political turnover affects pollution discharges of Chinese listed firms. To deal with possible ====Our study makes several contributions. First, this paper extends the literature in the field by investigating the relationship between political turnover and environmental pollution. Although extant work indicates that environmental pollution may be affected by fiscal decentralization and government regulation (====; ====; ====), there is very little information about how political turnover influences corporate environmental performance. The existing literature tested the role of political leaders in determining government priorities in environmental protection. For example, ==== find that environmental policies proposed by US governors change when they face binding term limits. ==== document the role of prefecture-level leaders in affecting environmental treatment. Their findings suggest that public investment in environmental improvement rises in a prefecture if the environmental quality is explicitly linked to the prefecture leader's chance of promotion. ==== investigate the effects of political leaders' characteristics on environmental pollution using data of 230 prefecture-level cities in 2002¨C2014. All these studies provide insight into environmental pollution in China according to the theory of the new political economy. Two papers investigated the relationship between political exchange and environmental pollution, which are most closely related to our work. The first paper by ==== uses a panel dataset of 86 Chinese cities from 2004 to 2009 to test whether there is an association between environmental quality and an urban leader's probability of being promoted. Their empirical results suggest that local leaders are more likely to be promoted if their cities experience environmental progress. The second paper by ==== uses daily air quality index data and major air pollution indexes from December 2013 to June 2016 to study the short-term effect of municipal party secretary turnover on air pollution. Their results show that the concentrations of SO2 decrease significantly one month before and one month after municipal party secretary turnover, while other indexes show no obvious changes during turnover period. Our paper is distinguished from the above two works by identifying the causal relationship between political turnover and environmental pollution at the firm level. We adopt the instrumental variable approach to address the potential endogeneity in the model. Using these empirical strategies for identification, we find that political turnover is positively associated with firms' pollution discharges.====Second, this paper also extends the literature on political connection by highlighting how political connection moderates the effects of political turnover on firms' environmental performance. To the best of our knowledge, several papers examined the relationship between political connections and environmental performance. For instance, ==== uses comprehensive environmental information disclosure data of China's listed firms to study the relationship between political connections and corporate environmental responsibility. Their empirical results show that political connections have significant and positive impacts on corporate environmental responsibility. Using survey data from family-owned firms in 31 Chinese provinces in 2008, ==== provides strong evidence to show that political connection is significantly and positively associated with corporate environmental misconduct. ==== explores how political connections between local governors and key officials in the center affect environment pollution and finds that political connections strengthen the career concerns of politicians and increase the marginal payoff of pollution. Our paper shows a similar phenomenon and further reports the additional possibility of establishing political connections once local officials are transferred. The findings of our study present a dynamic view of political connections when firms face political turnover.====Finally, this paper contributes to the recent literature investigating whether and how political turnover affects firm performance. While the existing literature concludes that political turnover may affect corporate activities, such as investment (====; ====; ====) and innovation (====; ====), it is still unclear how political turnover influences firms' environmental performance. China has the right environment to study the relationship between political turnover and environmental pollution for two reasons. On the one hand, unlike other countries, China has undergone frequent political turnover because local officials are often transferred every several years to prevent them from establishing too many political connections and hence becoming corrupted (====). On the other hand, corporate environmental responsibility is increasingly viewed as an important business strategy by researcher and investors (====; ====; ====). Once local officials are transferred, the political connections between ex-officials and polluting firms become uncertain or even disappear. Naturally, a firm's pollution decision will be adjusted accordingly. Thus, we propose a mechanism-based theoretical framework to explore possible negative effects of political turnover on firms' environmental performance and investigate the channels through which political turnover may crowd out firms' investment in R&D and weaken the enforcement of environmental regulations, resulting in an increase in firm pollution discharges.

To do so, we quantify the source and extent of temporal changes in bodyweight and then decompose the increase in obesity prevalence into two components: a rightward shift of the bodyweight distribution (mean growth) and a (re)distributional skewing. Our analysis reveals a clear rightward distributional shift combined with a leftward skewing. Although the relatively large size of this skewing in the first decade analysed reflects an increase in obesity ====, this inequality growth subsides in the second decade. Nevertheless, over the entire 20-year period, obesity inequality increases significantly, especially among females, younger age groups, residents in rural and western provinces, and individuals with low socioeconomic status.","The ever-rising levels of overweight and obesity worldwide make obesity one of the most prominent issues in global public health (====), with over 1.9 billion adults aged 18 and older being overweight in 2014 and a further 600 million being actually obese (====). Nonetheless, recent trends in adult obesity rates vary substantially across countries, increasing rapidly in most developing countries like China but slowing or stabilizing in some developed countries such as the U.S. and UK (====). In all regions, however, being overweight or obese is linked with an increased prevalence of chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and a subset of cancers (====), as well as particular social and mental health risks (====).====China presents a uniquely interesting case of weight change because of its rapid transition from historical undernutrition to a sharp increase in overweight and obesity (====; ====). China has also witnessed a major shift in diet ¨C most notably, an increased intake of edible oils, fried foods, animal-sourced foods and snacks ¨C accompanied by a sharp decline in occupational and domestic physical activity (PA), which combination tripled the prevalence of adulthood overweight from 11.7% in 1991 to 29.2% in 2009 (====). China's rates of obesity-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have also increased dramatically and have become the major risk factors for morbidity, disability and mortality (====). The country's prevalence of diabetes, for instance, nearly quadrupled between 1994 and 2008 from 2.5% (====) to 9.7% (====). As a result, China spends 24 billion yuan annually, 2.46% of its annual national health care expenditure, on overweight, obesity and their complications (====). This expenditure clearly indicates the magnitude of the challenge posed by this rapidly increasing obesity to China's health care system (====).====Statistically, the rise in obesity prevalence (or mean bodyweight) in China can be attributed to two factors: a rightward shift of the bodyweight distribution, indicating that the entire population is growing heavier, or an increase in distributional left-skewness, reflecting more rapid weight gain in one population subset (notably the more obese) and thus rising obesity inequality ¨C or a combination of both. Understanding which is the case is important because the former would call for population-wide policies, whereas the latter would signal a need for policies targeted at groups particularly affected by obesity. Obesity inequality may also play an important role when assessing obesity's persistence: On the one hand, general increases in a population's bodyweight (i.e., a rightward distributional shift) may alter norms and perceptions of ideal bodyweight in the entire population, which can cement higher obesity rates. On the other hand, an increase in distributional skewness, by mainly affecting only a specific portion of the population, may not have such lasting effects. In fact, there is empirical evidence that perceptions of ideal bodyweight are changing. In the U.S., for example, the percentage of overweight (but not obese) individuals who describe their weight as ¡°about right¡± (rather than ¡°overweight¡±) has increased significantly, from 14% to 21% among women and from 41% to 46% among men (====). ==== also show that, for a given level of overweight, the wider an individual's deviation from the average weight within a region, the stronger his or her feelings of being overweight. Given the large body of evidence on obesity's negative psychological effects (e.g. ====), which increase with the deviation from the overall population (====), a rise in obesity inequality could accentuate obesity-related stigma and discrimination.====Yet despite the importance of knowing how a country's bodyweight distribution has changed over time, little research on this topic exists (exceptions being ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our study thus aims to provide the first analysis of long-term distributional changes in bodyweight among Chinese adults aged 20+ by examining changes in both the BMI and waist-circumference (WC) distributions over the 1991¨C2011 period. This approach is important because in China central obesity is much more prominent than general obesity whose negative health effects are less severe (====). In addition to applying ==== technique to decompose total change in obesity prevalence into a mean-growth and a redistribution component, we also employ conventional inequality measures (Gini and generalized entropy) to provide a univariate assessment of obesity inequality. Lastly, we decompose obesity inequality into within-group and between-group to throw light on whether disproportionate obesity increase is a population-wide phenomenon or the result of changing demographic composition.",Obesity inequality and the changing shape of the bodyweight distribution in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301099,16-Sep-19,2019,Research Article,422

The endogeneity of family size is an important identification issue in the test of the quantity-quality tradeoff. We use variations in a mother's exposure to various phases of China's family planning policies by ==== type, ethnicity and regional differences in fine rates as instruments to identify the causal effects of family size. We find that family size has a negative effect on children's education. Using family fixed effects model, we find a positive birth order effect. In addition, both the family size and birth order effects are more pronounced for families where first-born children are females than those where the first-borns are males. Birth order effect is more evident in financially constrained families.","The relationship between family size and economic development has attracted the attention of social scientists for decades. One critical impetus for economic development is the advancement of the human capital of the population. At the family level, as the theoretical framework of ==== and ==== suggests, a reduction in the quantity of children tends to increase the resources available for investment in the human capital per child so that (average) child quality will rise. Numerous empirical studies using data from various countries and over different time periods have attempted to test the quantity-quality tradeoff, but the findings have been mixed: some have confirmed the prediction of a negative correlation between family size and child quality (e.g., ====; ====; ====, ====; ====), some have found little evidence (e.g., ====; ====, ====), while ==== has found a positive effect of an additional child on school enrollment of the first-born children for one-child families.====Birth order is also considered an important determinant of child quality in several theories, which attribute differences in child quality to variations in childhood environment. Childhood environment may be affected by the child's intellectual environment. The confluence model in psychology (====; ====; ====) uses the average age of family members as a proxy for a child's intellectual environment. Since later-born children are born into an inferior intellectual environment due to having one or more (possibly young) siblings, this model predicts a negative birth order effect on educational attainment.==== Childhood environment may also vary with parental time and financial resources. The dilution model in economics (====; ==== However, if parents are financially constrained and capital market imperfections make borrowing difficult, the birth order effect may be reversed since parents may be better off later, when higher-ordered children need investment (====). Moreover, more experience and higher productivity in parenting and increased maturity may also benefit later-born children (====). The empirical findings in general support the theoretical predictions of a negative birth order effect on a child's education and earnings (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====) and non-cognitive abilities (====) in developed countries, with less of an effect on a child's health (====). But a positive effect may occur in financially constrained families living in developing countries (e.g., ====; ====; De ====).====The present paper examines the effects of family size and birth order on children's educational attainment in China using the 2013 Chinese Household Income Project survey (hereafter?CHIP 2013) data. First, we test the existence of the quantity-quality tradeoff for children born over the period of 1949¨C1989. The identification challenge is that both child quantity and quality are endogenously determined by unobserved parental preferences and family characteristics (====, ====). The crucial method for tackling endogeneity is to use the exogenous variations in family size introduced without parental control. Widely employed instruments for family size include the occurrence of twin/multiple births,==== sex of the first child or the sex composition of the first two children,==== and family planning policy-related measures.==== We identify the exogenous variations in family size based on the ====- and ethnicity-specific mother's exposure to various phases of China's family planning policies that can be broadly defined by the stringency of the birth quota after the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. There was no birth quota during 1949¨C1962, a leniently and narrowly implemented birth quota during 1963¨C1970, a strongly and broadly implemented birth quota during 1971¨C1979 and the one-child policy during 1980¨C2013 (====). We construct policy exposure measures for the last two phases with strict birth quota, each of which is a summation of indicators for whether a mother at each age during her standard fertile age range (15¨C49) is exposed to each policy phase, weighted by the probability of childbearing at each age in that policy phase over 15¨C49. Since the intensity of China's family planning policies differ by ==== type (urban/rural) and ethnicity (Han/non-Han), the two policy exposure measures are then interacted with indicators for mother's ==== and ethnicity. Since the last phase's policy intensity also differs across provinces, the policy exposure measured in this phase is interacted with the average provincial fine rates. We correspondingly also include mother's ==== and ethnicity indicators and the fine rates as instruments.====Second, to study the effect of birth order on educational attainment, we estimate a within family fixed effects model. The identification challenge here is that birth order is strongly related to family size in a sense that a new and higher birth order has to be introduced by an increase in family size. This correlation renders birth order to be also correlated with unobserved parental preferences and family characteristics. Therefore, separation of the birth order effect from the family size effect and dealing with endogeneity are the key issues in the identification of the birth order effect.==== ==== successfully solve both problems by estimating within-family birth order effect captured by birth order indicators separately by family size.==== The identification strategy in the recent literature follows ==== and typically relies on regression models including family fixed effects to rule out the possibility that the estimated birth order patterns are driven by differences in family size or in any other unobserved family characteristics shared among siblings (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====).====Our two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation shows that having an additional sibling reduces educational attainment by 0.39?years. Relative to the family size category (eight or more children) with the lowest schooling of 6.66?years, the magnitude of the family size effect is modest. The family fixed effects model estimation reports that being born one birth order higher in family of a given size on average tends to increase education by 0.095?years. The birth order effect is modest in size relative to the average education of 8.76?years for the first-born children in multiple-child families. We test the exogeneity of the instruments in the first stage of the 2SLS, the potential impacts of omitted variables on the estimated family size effect, such as sibling sex composition and concurrent events or policies that occurred along with the family planning policies, and the potential influence of omitted variables in the estimated birth order effect, such as birth spacing between two consecutive children. The results, in general, survive these checks. In addition, we find that the family size and birth order effects are heterogeneous across families: both effects are more pronounced for families where first-born children are females than those where first-borns are males, which can be explained by the son preferences; the positive birth order effect is more evident in financially constrained families.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in several aspects. First, we provide a long-run estimate of the impact of family size on Chinese adult children's educational attainment. Our sample covers children born over the period of 1949¨C1989. This long time span allows us to exploit the temporal variations in various phases of China's family planning policies as instruments for family size. In addition, we use years of schooling for adult children aged 25?years or older as the measure of educational attainment, while most existing studies in China use enrollment in schools of different levels (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====) or level (years) of schooling of teenagers (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). Our age cutoff ensures that almost all children have completed their education, which reflects parental investment in this aspect of child quality in a more complete manner.====The second contribution of this paper is that we exploit the ==== and ethnicity-specific temporal and regional variations in statutory fertility policy and its compliance as instruments for family size. In contrast, family planning policy-related instruments in previous studies by and large exploit a single aspect of the policy. For example, ==== uses the eligibility for having two children; ==== uses the eligibility for having two children, monetary fines for unsanctioned births and their interactions; ==== constructs a continuous one-child policy measure equal to the number of years covered by the one-child policy during a woman's primary fertility age (21¨C35) over the total number of primary fertility years; ==== exploit the geographical variations in one-child policy enforcement intensity by constructing a quantitative indicator of the extent of local violation of the one-child policy using the percentage of Han mothers of primary childbearing age who gave a higher order birth. Our instruments also circumvent the potential problems suffered from using twinning==== or sibling sex composition,====The third contribution of this paper is that we use information on the entire sibship of families instead of only looking at the first-borns. This enables us to examine the average impact of sibship size on the average quality of all children in a family while avoiding the sample truncation problem. In addition, this information allows us to explicitly consider the effect of birth order on human capital development which tends to be overlooked in the test of quantity-quality tradeoff in China.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We find that for the data on real GDP growth, the panel data approach reveals the best performance under the criteria of evaluating the quality of a model. The estimation results show that Xiangyang's real GDP growth rate rose by about 1.43% annually after the renaming reform. However, further discussions show that the annual growth rate of the tertiary ==== decreased by 1.59%, which contradicts the mechanism of the brand effect of the reform. The statistical inference demonstrates that even if a city did not implement the city-renaming reform in 2010, the probability of obtaining an effect as large as Xiangyang's would be 25.9%. Therefore, the effect of the city-renaming reform is insignificant and other policy interventions¡ªrather than the city-renaming reform¡ªpromote economic growth in Xiangyang. In summary, policymakers cannot win a ¡°Promotion Tournament¡± by renaming cities.","In post-reform China, officials who encourage local economic growth are likely to be promoted (====). Therefore, local governments across China have launched a GDP-stimulating competition known as the ¡°Promotion Tournament¡± (====) and increases firm value (====; ====). Similarly, the city brand represents the image of a city, and increasing the brand effect of the city may promote its economic growth. Thus, officials in a city have incentives to rename it (or restore its previous name) to promote local economic development.====Xiangyang is located in the northwest of Hubei Province on the Han River. With a history of more than 2800?years, it is a famous military and cultural center as well as an important member of the urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and a sub-central city of Hubei Province. However, after 1949, because of the ==== of Xiangyang and Fancheng, the first words of the two cities were taken and the newly merged city was renamed Xiangfan. For various reasons such as retaining the historical and cultural connotations of the city name and promoting economic growth, Xiangfan was officially renamed Xiangyang on December 9, 2010. Hence, Xianyang is a good case study for examining the treatment effect of a city-renaming reform.==== show that this city-renaming reform has increased annual nighttime light images in Xiangyang by 10.1%. However, this effect may have arisen from other factors. For example, on April 25, 2010, the Xiangyang Economic and Technological Development Zone was approved by the State Council. The establishment of such zones can significantly promote economic growth (====). On May 4, 2012, the Hubei Provincial Government also approved the ¡°Overall Plan for the Construction of the Xiangyang Dongjin New District,¡± and the Dongjin New District became the first urban new district approved by the Hubei provincial government. Subsequently, the large-scale construction of infrastructure such as roads and bridges began. In this study, we find that annual real GDP growth in Xiangyang rose by 1.43% after the city-renaming reform. But by using statistical inferences, we demonstrate that the effect of the city-renaming reform was insignificant. Therefore, this effect was caused by other interventions rather than the reform itself.====To examine the impact of renaming on Xiangyang's real GDP growth rate after 2010, we need to estimate the counterfactuals of this rate in the absence of the policy intervention. Here, the treatment effects of the policy intervention are the difference between the actual observed real GDP growth rates and counterfactuals. However, the fundamental problem in treatment effect analysis is the difficulty of estimating the counterfactuals.====The parametric method is the simplest and most commonly used method to estimate counterfactuals. For example, to study the impact of smoking on lifespan, we use the following parametric model:====where ==== is lifespan, ==== is a constant, ==== is a vector of the covariates that affect lifespan, ==== is a vector of the coefficients, ==== is the dummy endogenous variable (====?=?1 if ==== smokes and ====?=?0 otherwise), the coefficient ==== is the treatment effect, and ?==== is the idiosyncratic error term with ====(?====)?=?0. If individual ==== smokes, we can only observe lifespan under smoking. Therefore, we need to estimate the counterfactual of lifespan in the absence of smoking. The difference between them is the effect of smoking on lifespan, which is the coefficient ==== in this case. Ordinary least squares (OLS) applied to (1), however, may give rise to biased estimates of ====). Such a hypothesis is almost impossible to set up because lifestyle and genetic differences lead to different impacts of the instrumental variable on different individuals.====The synthetic control method (====; ====), panel data approach (====), and machine learning method==== (LASSO, ====; elastic net, ====) could be considered as alternatives to the parametric method to estimate the counterfactuals for program evaluation. In the Appendix, we compare the performance of these three methods using a simulation experiment and provide guidance for empirical studies.====The advantage of the three methods is that they use data-driven procedures to select suitable control groups instead of discretion, forcing users to show the affinities between the treated and untreated units using the observed variables. Therefore, they have recently been widely used in program evaluation.====The idea of the synthetic control method is to assign an appropriate weight to each control unit based on the similarity of the pre-intervention characteristics between the treated unit and control units. To avoid extrapolation, the synthetic control method requires each weight to be positive and sum to one. ==== were the first to propose the synthetic control method in a study of terrorism in the Basque Country. ==== later perfected the theory of the synthetic control method to study the effects of California's tobacco control program.==== conclude that ¡°the synthetic control method results in a post-treatment mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and mean error with a smaller interquartile range, whenever there is a good enough match.¡± However, we show in the Appendix that the conclusion in ==== is not convincing. In addition, ==== shows that the fit before the city-renaming reform made by the synthetic control method is very poor. ==== argue that the counterfactuals constructed by the synthetic control method are unsuitable if the fit is poor. Hence, we consider the panel data approach as an alternative to evaluate the impact of renaming on economic growth in Xiangyang.====The panel data approach has two advantages. First, only outcome variables are used to assign weights to control cities. The covariates that explain the outcome variables are excluded. Second, the panel data approach allows for traditional inference by using the asymptotic distribution of the average treatment effect derived by ====. Consequently, it is a suitable alternative to the synthetic control method. In recent studies, the panel data approach has been widely used for policy evaluation (====; ====; ====).====Social scientists often focus on the relationship between the response and covariates, so that a parsimony model is more popular (====; ====). In the Appendix, we find that the machine learning method selects too many control units. Therefore, it is mainly used for checking the robustness of results.====; ====; ====). Are the results we obtain driven by other policy interventions? To answer this question, we use the inferential technique, which is similar to a permutation test, proposed by ==== to construct a distribution of the average treatment effects to determine whether the effect of the city-renaming reform is significant.====The statistical inference demonstrates that if we were to assign the city-renaming reform to a city in the donor pool randomly, the probability of obtaining a treatment effect as large as Xiangyang's would be 25.9%. Therefore, the estimated effect for Xiangyang is small relative to the distribution of the effects estimated for other cities. These findings suggest that the effect of the city renaming is insignificant. Therefore, other policy interventions rather than the city-renaming reform have promoted economic growth in Xiangyang after 2010. We also study the effect of the city-renaming reform on economic growth in Pu'er and obtain the same results.====Our study makes three potential contributions. First, when researchers use different methods developed in the literature for policy evaluation, they can follow the procedures in this paper. Second, it is not a good idea for policymakers to win a ¡°Promotion Tournament¡± by renaming a city. Third, our analysis provides us with a warning that statistical inferences must be made when using the synthetic control or panel data methods to evaluate policy interventions; otherwise, the opposite conclusion may be drawn.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ====, we empirically compare the three approaches to select the appropriate prediction method. ==== presents the estimation results. ==== discusses the statistical inferences.

However, the requirement of continuous production and exogenous output level might be a serious barrier for responding to TOU price, as these are different across industrial sectors, firm scale or even seasons. Thus, the extent to which heterogeneous firms respond to price signals is still ambiguous and worthy of exploration. Based on a regression discontinuity approach, we disentangle the firm-level effects of TOU pricing for industrial and commercial firms. While the overall result shows a nonsignificant average response to TOU pricing, the firm-level analysis concerning individual heterogeneity indicates that smaller firms are much more sensitive to TOU pricing than larger firms. Moreover, this effect is much more significant in the commercial sector. This study expands understanding of the heterogeneous effects of TOU pricing with consideration of firm-level information and fills the gap between different estimation results from the previous literature. The results also indicate a price policy failure and unbalanced effects on industrial and commercial firms.","The electricity demand in China has been dramatically increasing with rapid economic growth and the decreased priority of energy conservation innovation since the initiation of the ¡°12th Five Year Plan¡± (====). Considering total electricity consumption, industrial and commercial sectors are responsible for more than 84% of total electricity demand. The overall increase in electricity use has also been accompanied by a soaring peak-load demand. To shift the load pressure from peak to off-peak time, time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing has been adopted in industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai. Critical peak pricing was also introduced by allowing for an almost 50% increase above the original price====; ====), fewer studies can be found studying industrial customers' responsiveness to price signals aiming to smooth the load curve. Research on firms' electricity consumption behavior under TOU pricing can obviously be helpful for policy design around both price and demand control (====).====Theoretically, a firm's demand for input changes based on its price through the substitution effect and production constraints from the purpose of cost minimization(====; ====; ====). However, the requirement of production continuity==== weakens the output effects(====). Moreover, because electricity costs account for 2.4% of the total production cost on average, with labor costs accounting for 13%,==== the efficiency of TOU pricing is highly dependent on the trade-off between increasing electricity cost during peak time and extra wages during nonpeak time.==== Therefore, the overall effect of TOU pricing becomes uncertain across sectors, firm sizes and firms' input structures, which is one possible reason that studies on behavior change motivated by price signals have not reached consensus. For example, an empirical study of Israel finds that there is a large variation in customer response to TOU pricing in the small and medium-sized business sectors (====). The number of labor shifts within a day and weather are potential determinants driving these responses. The price elasticity varies by sector and season, but not by firm size. However, natural experiment results from ====By employing a newly developed dataset monitoring specific firms' accumulative electricity use, this paper attempts to fill this gap by conducting a discontinuity-based estimation with a data-driven bandwidth selection process (====; ====) on high-frequency firm-level electricity consumption to test how firms respond to price variations and identify the heterogeneous effects among firms. This paper considers detailed and comprehensive hourly electricity consumption data at the firm level by collaborating with the State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company and obtaining firm-level information from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. Based on the data and method described above, this paper provides empirical evidence on firms' heterogeneous responses to TOU pricing. The results show that on average, TOU pricing does not drive any significant consumption change. This result is consistent for either the price change on 1st June corresponding with the coal price change or the TOU price change in summer on average, regardless of the daily==== or hourly level. The result further provides evidence that TOU pricing failed to change the electricity consumption curve; its original aim was to shift the peak load to off-peak times, yet it only adds the production cost instead. Using firm-level data, a heterogeneity analysis is also performed to test the correlation between firms' responses and their individual characteristics, and this further provides evidence of a significant positive correlation between firm size and the level of consumption change due to the TOU price, indicating that smaller firms respond more to the price than larger firms. This result is extremely important for commercial firms. The TOU price is mainly effective for smaller commercial and business firms and only leads to a limited peak-load shifting effect while increasing the energy cost of production in total.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first empirical study providing evidence for such a rich set of heterogeneous firms on the TOU price effect at the hourly level. As we mentioned above, due to the lack of detailed micro data, the previous literature has not been able to conduct sufficient studies at this micro level. Second, this paper provides new evidence on TOU pricing policy failure on average. Our result shows that on average, there is no significant peak-load shifting effect on firms in Shanghai and that although some small firms change their energy consumption due to the TOU price in the summer, the number of firms that engage in consumption reduction is relatively low. Third, the result of this paper fills a gap in the previous literature. We conduct the study based on detailed firm information and prove that firms exhibit a heterogeneous response, especially among commercial and industrial firms, as well as the potential correlation between response level and firm size. Therefore, the conflicting results from previous studies can be explained.==== Fourth, this paper finds that the effect of TOU price has a positive correlation with firm size, which indicates different levels of production requirements among firms. The result also presents the paradox of price policy and the purpose of the peak-load shifting, noting the unfairness in how the energy price policy affects larger and smaller firms, which conflicts with recent policy guidance in China encouraging the growth of small firms.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== summarizes the previous research on the electricity demand of industrial and commercial users. ==== describes the data collection and summary statistics of the data and provides a detailed introduction to industrial and commercial electricity prices in Shanghai. ==== presents the empirical strategy of the paper, ==== reports the empirical results, and ==== discusses the policy implications of the results and concludes this paper.====In this section, we conduct a robustness check on both the window selection and the polynomial order of our daily and hourly regression discontinuity model. In the main model, the sample bandwidth is selected using the CCT and IK methods. To confirm that the bandwidth selection will not affect the stability and reliability of our results, we expand our window to test the robustness of the model.==== The polynomial form may also be one issue affecting our results. To check the robustness of our model, we also provide results for a different order selection of the polynomial form. ==== reports the results of both of these two robustness checks of the daily regression.

This allows us to derive cross-price elasticities unlike studies which focus on one type of energy. We implement a two-stage approach and explicitly account for electricity, domestic fuels and transportation demand in the first stage and gasoline, coal, LPG and gas demand in the second stage. We find income inelastic demand for electricity and home energy, but the elasticity is higher than estimates in the rich countries. Demand for total transportation is income elastic. The price elasticity for electricity is estimated to be ?0.5 and in the range of other estimates for China, and similar to long-run elasticities estimated for the U.S.","The rapid growth of energy consumption in China has generated a huge literature discussing its characteristics and environmental impacts. The residential portion of national energy use was only 12% in 2015, but is growing rapidly, at 6.0% per year during 2005¨C2015 compared to the 5.0% national energy growth rate. Residential electricity consumption is growing even faster than total residential energy, at 9.6% per year during that period. The ownership of automobiles among urban households went from 3.4 per 100 households in 2005 to 35 in 2016. Ownership of household appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators exceeded 90% since 2005 while air-conditioners rose from 0.81 per urban household in 2005 to 1.2 in 2016.====, ====, ====and ==== used household survey data to estimate price and income elasticities for electricity demand which Cao et al. then used to project electricity demand. ==== used the tier structure in electricity prices to estimate price elasticities while ==== relates electricity consumption to the characteristics of appliances owned by households but do not consider price effects. ==== uses the CRECS survey of households to estimate the effectiveness of various demand side strategies to reduce electricity consumption.====For coal and gas demand there is little research based on household level data; ==== use total provincial coal consumption while ==== estimated price elasticities from aggregate national data.

These specifications capture the most important variables but the broader energy demand literature also recognize key roles for housing and equipment in determining electricity demand and thus a more general specification should include the prices of housing and equipment.====For non-electrical energy, ==== estimated a VAR using national data on coal and oil, but only include the price of coal without other prices. ==== used the provincial price of coal and gasoline for estimating provincial coal demand, while ==== has the richest price specification for city-level natural gas demand, using city prices of gas, LPG, electricity and coal. ==== estimated of provincial gasoline demand uses the provincial price of gasoline, instrumented by the price of diesel. ==== is one of the few studies of China using a multiple equation system where the household demand for coal, gas, electricity and gasoline are simultaneously estimated using prices of all four energy types.==== and ====, ==== and ==== allows a set of cross-price effects from substitutes, while four of the electricity studies consider only two prices ¨C electricity and gas. We might also note that when the different energy types are estimated independently, as in ==== Other CGE models use flexible demand systems that takes bundles of commodities into account with cross-price elasticities, for example, the use of a translog utility function in a U.S. model by ==== and in a China model by ====, and an AIDS model for the EU by ====.==== There are, however, very few estimates of consumption demand systems covering all commodities in China that can be used in such CGE models. ==== is one of the few papers using the system approach, it however, considers a 4-input function for food, consumer goods, services and housing; energy demand is part of services and part of housing and not explicitly identified at this stage. This means that the income and demographic effects for household energy demand are not well identified even if the price effects are given in the lower tiers of the consumption model (discussed further in the next sub-section).====Our paper thus has two aims. One is to develop a dataset of expenditures and prices that can be used for household demand analysis for detailed energy commodities. This provides far more detail than the residential energy studies noted above that rely on provincial or city-level averages. The second is to estimate a flexible demand system that will provide income and price elasticities, including cross-price elasticities, for electricity, other household energy (coal, LPG, gas, heat), and transportation for urban China. The demand function also relates energy use to household characteristics such as location, equipment ownership and characteristics of the household head.

Typically, the regulators face challenges of incomplete and imperfect information on the minimum improvement in energy intensity that industries would achieve in baseline cases and the maximum technical potential of energy efficiency that industries are able to achieve. By applying a two-tier stochastic frontier model based on provincial panel data 2006¨C2015 in China, we disentangle the impacts of information asymmetry between the governments and firms on industrial energy intensity from other major regulatory, technological and economic factors. Results show that, on average, nearly 75% of the unexplained variation in industrial energy intensity is attributed to the information gap between firms and governments. On average, the realized energy intensity is upper biased by 7.25% due to the information gap compared to the expected level without the information gap although the net impacts vary considerably across provinces and over time. One observation is that firms have much stronger impact on the energy intensity in the period when the government prioritized economic growth rather than energy savings. In addition, the impact of firms and governments varies markedly across the quartiles ==== level, technological progress, policy stringency, and energy resource endowment.","An energy efficiency gap is well known as a wedge between the cost-minimizing level of energy efficiency and the level actually realized (====; ====; ====). A huge body of literature shows that ex ante engineering-economic analyses systematically overstates the savings associated with energy-efficiency investments (====). Meanwhile, China has been the world's energy efficiency heavyweight over the past decade. It is estimated that energy efficiency across China's major energy-consuming sectors has improved by 19% over the period 2000¨C2014 (====). China succeeded in lowering energy intensity, namely energy use over gross domestic product (GDP), to 19% and 34% below the 2005 level in 11th five-year plan (FYP 2006¨C2010) and 12th FYP (2011¨C2015) periods, respectively, with energy efficiency being improved at an average annual rate of 4% from 2006 to 2015.====Target setting is an important component of the energy efficiency landscape in China. China's 13th FYP (2016¨C2020) sets an interim target of reducing energy intensity by 15% below the 2015 level. If met, this will represent a 44% reduction in energy intensity between 2005 and 2020. Like many jurisdictions across the world, establishing an incentive-compatible target faces challenges of incomplete and imperfect information on the minimum improvement in energy efficiency that firms would have achieved in the business-as-usual case and the maximum technical potential of energy efficiency that the firms are able to achieve. This information asymmetry on real energy efficiency potential may result in less ambitious energy efficiency targets than would otherwise be the case, causing investments inefficiency of the energy efficiency market.====In many cases, firms are reluctant to commit themselves to an ambitious target of energy efficiency due to multiple reasons. Firms may face an important upfront cost of energy efficiency measures and lack information on technologies and associated benefits (====; ====; ====). Energy management may also cause disruption to the production process (====; ====; ====China provides an ideal experiment for investigating the impact of information asymmetry between governments and industries on energy efficiency improvements. In practice, China's ==== aims to pursue ====, ====). For example, the targets set for the eastern advanced provinces are usually higher than those of the less developed central and western provinces, because stringent energy-saving constraints are considered disadvantageous for the local economic growth. For this purpose, the Chinese central government has shut down 95,630?MW of power production capacity, 930 million tons of cement production capacity, and 147.8 million tons of steel production capacity over the period 2006¨C2014 (====).====Since 2006, there has been a mandatory energy savings programme for the largest enterprises, targeting on energy-intensive industries with financial support through a dedicated government-backed fund. The Chinese government also introduced an energy saving obligation programme for the Top 1000 enterprises in nine energy intensive industries during 2006¨C2010. These enterprises accounted for 33% of the country's total energy consumption and 47% of industrial energy consumption in 2005. The energy efficiency also became part of performance evaluation for managers in state-owned companies. Overall, the programme has saved 150 Mtce, representing 183% of the original target (====). The scope of this programme was extended to the Top 10,000 Programme in 2011. A total of 14,641 enterprises are now regulated with an energy savings obligation. The targeted industries also expanded to almost the whole economy. By the end of 2014, the Top 10,000 programme has already saved 309 Mtce annually, about 20% more than the target of 250 Mtce (====). While it is certainly a positive signal, it also raises a question about whether governments set targets that were not ambitious enough vis-¨¤-vis industries energy efficiency potential (====).====In this study, we apply a two-tier stochastic frontier model (====; ====) to disentangle the effect of information asymmetry between the governments and firms on industrial energy intensity from the effects of other major regulatory, technological and economic factors at the province level. The two-tiered stochastic frontier model enables to identify two sided noises, and thus particular suitable to analyze the behavior of incomplete information on both sides of the energy efficiency market, leading to surplus that firms and governments can extract. Depending on the opposite impacts of both sides, the net impact will make the observed variation in energy intensity lower or higher than the expected level.====Based on a provincial panel data from 2006 to 2015 in China, we constructed and estimated several specifications of two-tier stochastic frontier models to identify the impacts of information asymmetry between provincial governments and industries in China. Our study shows that the information asymmetry leads to the realized energy intensity upper biased by over 7% on average compared to the expected level with considerable variation across provinces over time. In 19 provinces, the industrial firms extracted more surplus than the governments, leading to energy intensity above the expected level that should have occurred under the perfect information. In the other 11 provinces, the government dominated the net impact and thus lowered the realized energy intensity compared to the expected level. Particularly, the firms dominated the net impact in the years when the governments prioritized economic growth rather than energy savings.====This analysis has important implications for the future energy efficiency policy making. Our study suggests that the current energy efficiency target setting and policy ecosystem in China may not fully reflect the potential of energy intensity improvement across provinces and may further enlarge the gap among the major jurisdictions. It is evident that targets should be set for industries considering various circumstances of economic structure and technological change, such that the impact of information gap on energy savings potential between firms and governments is mitigated. It would improve the target setting process by improving the information sharing between governments and industrial firms.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides our analytical framework of energy efficiency target setting and transform it into an empirical two-tier frontier model, as well as describes our dataset. ==== presents and discuss empirical results. ==== concludes with policy implications.",Energy efficiency gap and target setting: A study of information asymmetry between governments and industries in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19301026,20-Aug-19,2019,Research Article,427

The results show that emission effect and per capita emission effect indeed promoted energy use and even surpassed output effect at the beginning of stage two (2001¨C2005). The changes in energy use followed those in output effect at stage one, emission effect and per capita emission effect at the beginning of stage two, and energy intensity effect at the latter period of stage two. It indicates that energy efficiency has gradually been becoming a dominate role in energy use changes. The impact of energy mix effect was comparatively small.","The design of policy aimed at addressing energy issues related to the environment and economy is a major challenge. A rapid increase in energy demand and closer interdependence of countries enhance its essential and vital role in economic growth. Climate change associated with the use of fossil fuels threatens sustainable development. Policy design aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions will benefit from identifying factors that influence energy use. China, as one of the rapid growing and urbanizing economics, suffers from serious extreme weather events and air pollution. Primary energy consumption in China was about 3.1 billion tons of oil equivalent in 2017, accounting for 23% of global energy use (====), and is increasing (====).====Numerous studies in recent years have investigated factors that affect energy use in China. ==== decomposed factors that influence changes of energy use into the scale of economic activities (activity effect), sectorial technological level (intensity effect), and economic structure (structure effect) during the period of 1973 to 1990. The activity effect and structure effect were associated with increased energy use throughout the study period, while the intensity effect decreased energy use from 1980 to 1990. Increased energy use is associated with economic growth, foreign trade, and changes in industrial structure==== (====, ====; ====).====However, the results of statistical tests on the causal relationship between energy consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) differ across countries (====). China and India show a long-run bi-directional causality between coal use and economic growth during 1980¨C2011 (====). An interesting result from ==== shows that economic growth is one the most important factors affected China's energy use, exhibiting a negative impact from 1990 to 1994 and a positive impact between 1994 and 2008. Possible explanations for this result include different specifications of decomposition variables such as GDP and energy.====Changes in energy structure can have a positive impact on energy use in both developing and developed countries (====). ==== showed that energy input mix had a major active influence on energy demand in China from 1987 to 2007. ====; ====). Focusing on China's 30 provinces from 2007 to 2012, however, ==== found that energy mix==== had little effect on changes in energy use.====Energy intensity, as measured by energy use per unit GDP, is a factor associated with energy consumption (e.g., ====; ====). A decrease in China's energy use between 1981 and 1987 was mainly the result of a decline in energy intensity driven by improvements in energy efficiency(the degree of energy that effectively used) (====). ==== attributed the fall in China's energy use in the following period 1987¨C1992 to a decline in energy intensity. ==== also found that 88% of the total energy saving in China's industrial sectors from 1990 to 1997 was a result of the change in energy intensity. From both of the production and final-demand side, ==== explored driving forces of energy consumption in 7 seven regions of China (including Northeast, North China, East China, South China, Central China, Northwest, and Southwest) from 1987 to 2007 and found that reducing energy intensity is key to achieve regional energy conservation. Distinguishing domestic and interregional trade, ==== unveiled the drivers of changes in provincial energy consumption from 1997 to 2011. They found per capita final energy demand, energy intensity, and production structure, had a positive effect on provincial energy consumption.====The relationship between carbon emissions and energy has been the focus of recent studies. Using a sample drawn from 58 countries, for the period 1990¨C2012, ==== found that carbon emissions had a significant, positive effect, on energy use. Using a panel provincial data for China, ==== found that hotter summers exhibit more influence than colder winters, indicating that global warming increases electricity consumption all year round. This result supports an earlier claim by ==== that climate change promotes more energy use and increases more electricity consumption. Climate change caused by energy-related carbon emissions influences use patterns and purchasing decisions of firms and households for heating and cooling appliances, and further impacts energy use.====, ====, and ====; ====; ====).====Causality tests between energy use and carbon emissions for mainland China have yet to be undertaken. Although ==== incorporated carbon emissions as an explanatory variable into a statistical analysis of changes in energy use and found that carbon emissions had a significant and positive effect on energy use, lack related explanation and further discussion for this result. This study endeavors to fill the gap and make the following contributions. First, we examine Granger-causality between carbon emissions and energy use in China spanning the study period 1953¨C2017. Second, we estimate the impact of carbon emissions on China's energy use. Based on the LMDI decomposition model, we disaggregate factors that influence China's energy use during 1978¨C2015 into an emission effect and per capita emission effect as well as three conventional factors viz. energy mix, energy intensity, and output. We find that bi-directional causality exists from carbon emissions to energy use in the long-run. Although carbon emission mainly plays a positive effect on energy use, the negative effect shows up during 2014¨C2016. In addition, we measure and compare the contribution of each factor to energy use. Third, the cumulative effect of each factor during 1953¨C2017 is analyzed first (holistic analysis); and then we divide the study period 1953¨C2017 into two stages in 2001 (stage analysis).====The rest of this study is organized as follows. ==== tests the statistical relationship between energy use and carbon emissions. ==== describes the methodology of LMDI and ==== presents the empirical results and further discussion.

Specifically, we compare the quality implications of research collaboration and joint patent ownership for the quality of U.S. and Chinese patents. Overall, we find that domestic inventor collaboration is associated with higher quality results for U.S. patents than Chinese patents. However, for China, international collaboration is associated with more positive quality outcomes; for U.S. patents, international collaboration implies lower quality than that associated with domestic U.S. collaboration. Part of this disparity is due to substantially different quality outcomes associated with joint U.S.-Chinese patents ¨C quality gains for China and quality reductions for the U.S. We also investigate the quality implications of different organization-centered research, including dyadic and triadic collaborations, for patent quality as well as the quality implications of various assignee-inventor relationships, operating through incentive and scale effects. While most firms, particularly those in the U.S., appear to exploit advantages of fewer owner-assignees coordinating the scale benefits of more inventors, universities and research institutes in China appear to rely less on coordination-scale effects and more on the incentive effects associated with assigning patent ownership to inventors.","Recent studies, reviewed in the following section, have concluded that the role of team research has grown substantially in generating successful innovation outcomes. In this paper, we attempt to distinguish the implications for patent quality of domestic collaboration versus that of collaboration across countries. Toward this end, we utilize three measures of patent quality: backward citations, claims, and forward citations. We further investigate the role of patterns of patent ownership assignment ¨C both inventor collaboration and joint assignee ownership ¨C as joint ownership may relate to measures of patent quality. Our data further enable us to investigate the role of different types of organizations ¨C firms, universities, and research institutes ¨C as their sole or joint participation in the innovation process is associated with patent quality.====Our research objectives include the following:====Our key findings fall into four areas. The first is that domestic collaboration in the U.S. is associated with larger increments to patent quality than equivalent team research in China. On the other hand, the quality advantages of international inventor collaboration for Chinese patents are substantially greater than the benefits accruing to U.S. patents; in fact, as compared with the quality advantage of U.S. domestic collaboration, U.S.-China patent collaboration yields a substantial quality drop-off.====The second key finding relates to the assignment of patent ownership. While the finding of less positive outcomes for domestic collaboration for China than the U.S. and more positive outcomes for international joint assignees for China than the U.S. are not as robust for assignees as for inventors, the differences for patterns of assignee ownership nonetheless parallel those for inventor collaboration====Third, we are able to identify the differences in patent quality in relation to various organizational configurations ranging from a single corporation to the triadic corporation-university-research institution combination. Whereas in the U.S. all of the dual and triadic configurations show patents with quality levels that exceed those of single corporate patent producers, in China corporate-university and corporate-research institute collaborations alone stand out as being associated with patents of relatively high quality.====Finally, we construct various ratios of inventors to assignees, proposing that high ratios leading to high quality outcomes imply the presence of coordination and scale effects; conversely, low ratios, with more inventors also serving as assignees, being associated with high quality outcomes may imply that inventors enjoying assignee ownership rights respond with greater effort. Our results suggest notably different results between the U.S. and China, with the U.S. exhibiting uniform coordination and scale effects and China exhibiting a mix of outcomes.====These and our other findings all control for each patent¡¯s technological characteristics, as determined by the 490 technology classifications in the United States Patent Classification system.==== Notwithstanding this control, we allow for the possibility that within-classification endogeneity may persist. We do not claim strict exogeneity. Our fundamental concern is that where technologies are being researched by inventors or assignees, who have chosen to collaborate, in settings in which the collaboration results in either systematically higher or lower quality patents, the collaboration may have been necessitated by the nature of the technology. Endogeneity arises when the quality of the patent outcome correlates with both the intrinsic nature of the technology and the solo vs. collaborative character of the research team. Again, we assume that at the detailed 3-digit USPC patent and technology classification level, the range of intercepts is able to control substantially for this factor. We discuss this matter further in ====.====It may also be useful to underscore the fact that our measures of patent quality are not solely of academic interest. As referenced later in this paper, using data for the biotech sector, ==== finds that the financial valuation of the venture-backed biotech firms is highly associated with the average breadth or scope of their patent portfolio, measured in terms of claims. ==== show a similar relationship between firm value and forward citations.

A theoretical model of dual-track interest rates and financial frictions is studied. In the model, bank loans are provided to state-owned enterprises with the control-track interest rate, private enterprises resort to shadow banking with the market-track interest rate. The interest rate wedge between these two interest rates distorts capital allocation, even driving a sector out of production. Full interest rate liberalization which eliminates the interest rate wedge alleviates cross-sector capital misallocation. However, the net effect on aggregate TFP is ambiguous due to the within-sector effect. Under calibrated parameters, full interest rate liberalization improves aggregate TFP moderately, unless the financial reform aimed to have SOEs and POEs face the same degree of financial frictions is also implemented.","Interest rate liberalization is considered as an essential component of China's financial reforms. The gradual process of interest rate liberalization reform improved the efficiency of capital allocation and maintained financial stability in the past. By October 2015, most administrative restrictions (ceilings and floors) on deposit and lending rates had been lifted, which marked the completion of the ¡°narrowly defined¡± interest rate liberalization (====; ====). However, China's financial market still implements a dual-track interest rate system. Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), stated at Boao Forum for Asia in April 2018 that ¡°China currently implements a dual-track interest rate system with deposit rates still based upon a benchmark rate and money market rates now fully determined by market forces. ¡­ The best strategy for us is in fact to have these two interest rate tracks gradually unify ¡ª this is the market reform we want to achieve.¡± Full interest rate liberalization or ¡°the unification of interest rates¡± demands the equivalency between the control-track interest rate and the market-track interest rate. This paper examines capital misallocation caused by dual-track interest rates and whether full interest rate liberalization alleviates capital misallocation based on the institutional arrangements of China's economy.====The credit market is dominated by the big state-owned banks at present in China. Bank deposit/loan rates and the advancement of bank credits are controlled by the government through benchmark bank deposit/loan rates, window guidance and bank credit volume limits and so on. The low-cost bank loans flow to the state-owned sector, and the gap between loan rates and deposit rates ensures a healthy net profit margin for state-owned banks. This interest rate control policy remains one of the root causes of capital misallocation and aggregate productivity loss in China. Despite the urgent appeal for full interest rate liberalization for a long time,==== policy makers are worried that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state-owned banks are ill-equipped to compete and survive in an interest rate sensitive environment.====).====Shadow banking is essentially treated as a partial liberalization reform for the conventional banking system because of fewer regulations on interest rates and the advancements of credits. The control-track interest rate of conventional banking and the market-track interest rate of shadow banking constitute China's dual-track interest rates (====). Due to the SOE-biased feature of bank loans, private enterprises (POEs) are unable to obtain enough credits through conventional banking, even if they are willing to afford a much higher loan rate, resulting in their more intense reliance on shadow banking for external financing.====; ====). As a result, China has experienced a gradual reallocation of capital from SOEs to POEs, which has been considered as an important driver of its growth performance up to 2008 (====). Moreover, the problems caused by the implicit government guarantees and the soft budget constraints of SOEs and local governments have become more serious after the stimulus (====; ====). Thereafter it is more difficult for POEs to obtain external credits.====Based on China's ==== arrangements, we develop a theoretical model of dual-track interest rates, where there are three sectors: SOEs, POEs and banks. Banks, as the sole credit intermediary, conduct bank loans and shadow banking transactions simultaneously in the model. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that inefficient SOEs obtain bank loans, whereas more efficient POEs borrow from shadow banking. Due to dual-track interest rates, the interest rate of conventional banking is lower than that of shadow banking. With a lower financing costs, more capital is allocated to SOEs, resulting in capital misallocation and a loss in aggregate TFP (total factor productivity). The interest rate wedge between two tracks of interest rate has an important effect on capital allocation and even drives a sector out of production. When the interest rate wedge is big enough, the excessive market-track interest rate makes production unprofitable for POEs, and POEs then save to provide additional credits for SOEs. When the interest rate wedge is narrow enough and POEs is more productive enough than SOEs, the excessive control-track interest rate makes production unprofitable for SOEs. Then SOEs save in conventional banking.====Interest rate liberalization, narrowing the interest rate wedge, has a cross-sector capital reallocation effect by allocating more capital to POEs and improves the efficiency of capital allocation. However, there exists a within-sector effect on sectoral TFPs which may offset the cross-sector capital reallocation effect. Interest rate liberalization reduces the market-track interest rate, boosts the credit demand of POEs and reduces the sectoral TFP of POEs with an increase in the debt default probability of POEs. On the contrary, it increases the sectoral TFP of SOEs by elevating the control-track interest rate. Overall, interest rate liberalization has an ambiguous net effect on aggregate TFP, whose sign is dependent on the parameter values and the function forms in the model.====In order to quantify the impact of dual-track interest rates and full interest rate liberalization on aggregate TFP, the model is calibrated to match China's data. The interest rate wedge is calibrated to the gap between the average annual expected return rate on WMPs issued by banks and the 1-year benchmark bank deposit rate.==== Nevertheless, the debt ratio gap between SOEs and POEs is far smaller than its data counterpart, if the model only considers one type of financial distortions ¡ª dual-track interest rates. It is well known that there are multiple sources of financial distortions in China, resulting in the unfavorable financial condition faced by POEs in the credit market. Therefore, SOEs and POEs are supposed to face different degrees of financial frictions to match the debt ratio gap in the data. Obviously, the calibration result shows that POEs face more serious financial frictions than SOEs.==== Under calibrated parameters, full interest rate liberalization only brings a trivial improvement in aggregate TFP, but the financial reform that makes SOEs and POEs face the same degree of financial frictions improves aggregate TFP significantly.====Considering that China experienced a massive stimulus-driven credit boom during 2008¨C2009, the case of a similar-size credit boom is further investigated in the numerical exercises. The model economy replicates some stylized facts of China's economy after the stimulus. Aggregate leverage and the leverage of SOEs both rise sharply, while the leverage of POEs increases a little. In contrast to the leverages, aggregate and sectoral TFPs decline dramatically. The output share and capital share of SOEs increase substantially. What the model characterizes shed light on the current trends of rising macro leverage, deterioration of capital allocation, and ¡°Guo Jin Min Tui¡± (¡°¹ú½øÃñÍË¡± in Chinese) ¡ª state-owned enterprises advancing, private enterprises retreating ¡ª in the Chinese economy.====The model is built on the classical Costly State Verification (CSV) framework (====; ====; ====; ====) and takes into account China's unique institutional characteristics. In particular, it generalizes the CSV model to a two-production-sector environment, including a state sector and a private sector. These two sectors differ in average productivity and face different financing conditions in the credit market. Therefore, this paper relates not only to the emerging body of research on capital misallocation caused by financial frictions (====; ====; ====), but also the recent literature about interest rate liberalization in China (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====In recent papers on interest rate liberalization, ==== imposes an ad-hoc adjustment cost in banks' financial activities. In our context, financial frictions constitute the micro-foundation of the adjustment cost. In addition, there only exists the cross-sector reallocation effect in their paper, because firms within the same sector are homogenous in productivity. However, we assume that firms within the same sector are heterogeneous in productivity, giving arise to the within-sector effect. ==== considers both financial frictions and heterogeneous productivity, and they define interest rate liberalization as the removal of the gap between the bank deposit rate and bank loan rate. We instead define interest rate liberalization as the elimination of the interest rate wedge between the control-track interest rate and the market-track interest rate. Based on a different theoretical framework, ==== draws a similar conclusion that interest rate liberalization improves economic efficiency only if reforms on credit interventions are carried out simultaneously. They consider two types of credit interventions ¡ª the bank credit volume control and the interest rate repression.==== By contrast, we only consider dual-track interest rates in order to distinguish it from other sources of financial frictions in the theoretical model. At the same time, they assume firms are homogenous within one sector, like ====.====There are other papers about China's capital allocation and shadow banking, but not emphasizing interest rate liberalization. ==== investigates the credit allocation across firms during China's 2009 economic stimulus plan and finds that the stimulus-driven credit boom disproportionately favored SOEs. ==== shows that bank credit is disproportionately allocated to real estate and heavy industries during the stimulus. ==== demonstrates that stricter liquidity standards may trigger unintended credit booms.====In what follows, ==== reviews China's institutional background briefly. ==== introduces the theoretical model. ==== analyzes the theoretical results. ==== presents the numerical simulations and some counterfactual experiments. ==== concludes.",Dual-track interest rates and capital misallocation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300999,8-Aug-19,2019,Research Article,430

We also check the impact of missing low-income individuals on inequality assessment and find that the missing low-income data does not appear to underestimate inequality.,"The issue of missing high-income data in household surveys continues to be raised among researchers and public policymakers whenever the quality of household surveys and inferences drawn from survey data are discussed. In the literature, the main efforts on the investigation of the missing high-income data issue are directed to either drawing a general conclusion about the quality of household survey data or incorporating its impact on related measurements. For example, ==== argued that with the high-income households missing, the expenditure and income relationship for high-income households would be missing, too. This suggests that the picture of the relationship between expenditure and income, usually shown by the rising expenditure to income ratio with income growth, is incomplete. ====The main approaches used to make a best ¡°guess¡± on the missing high-income data involve employing the implied linkage either between micro and macro income data or between the income and consumption expenditure at the micro level. For example, ==== also raised the same argument for the case of India. By comparing the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) and the average Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) across zip codes, ==== found that the highest-income households in the US are less likely to respond to surveys when they are sampled.====, ====, and ==== use the Pareto Distribution to formulate and supplement the top-income data; ==== use the Hurun Rich List to supplement the information on top-income individuals; ==== collected the top income data from different sources, such as Hurun Rich List (2003¨C2017), Forbes Rich List (2003¨C2017), and Online Celebrity (2016¨C2018).====Our approach in this paper differs from the previous literature in two aspects. First, the traditional way to estimate the income distribution based on household survey data is to assume that there is no ¡°missing¡± high-income issue in the survey. Conditional on this assumption, a group of the most commonly used distribution specifications will be estimated or tested to find which distribution fits the data best. Pioneer work goes back to ====, where he provided a comprehensive framework that summarizes the income distributions and their relationships by assigning different values to the parameters. Following ====, ==== extended the application of the Beta II distribution to estimate the income distribution given that only grouped income information is available at country and regional level. However, neither of them took the missing high-income data problem into account. Second, the recent efforts to incorporate the impact of top-income are mainly focused on collecting the top-income data, such as ====, ====, and ====. Among the ones using the statistical distribution, such as ====, the efforts are dedicated to use the Pareto distribution to fit the top-income data rather than accommodating the potential missing high-income into the distribution by using a unified distribution for the whole range of incomes as what we will do in this paper.====In our analysis, we assume that the issue of ¡°missing¡± high-income households is present, but we do not know the detailed information about their respective incomes due to the absence of such data. We assume that the maximum income in the survey is the truncation point for income. Any income higher than the maximum income (the threshold) is not observable. Starting from this ¡°truncation¡± assumption, we estimate and test which distribution describes the income the best. We estimate the three most commonly used distributions: lognormal, Singh Maddala, and Beta II==== distribution for both ¡°non-truncated¡± (traditional method) and ¡°truncated¡± (missing high income) assumptions.====To our best knowledge, this is among the pioneer studies that attempted to evaluate the issue of missing high-income households in the distribution estimation using a ¡°truncated¡± distribution technique. Our method has two advantages. First, our method does not require additional information other than income data. Second, our method can be easily applied to inequality analysis for any country where household income or ====Based on the maximum log-likelihood method and the bootstrap technique, we find that the Beta II distribution with the truncation assumption best fits the data for 2002/2007/2013 Chinese Household Income Project Survey (CHIPS), while the Singh Maddala distribution with the truncation assumption best fits the data for 2002/2007/2014 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) in the US. Using the ====, we found that there is a significant difference in the estimated mean values of the inequality measures between the sample and the simulated sample with the truncation assumption. For 2007 CHIPS, the Gini coefficient is 0.4654 for Beta II distribution with the truncation assumption, while it is 0.4421 calculated for the sample. Additionally, 0.4421 is significantly lower than the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval. That is, the Gini coefficient based on the sample is significantly underestimated, compared to the one based on simulated income distribution with the missing top-income included. In the case of the US, the Singh Maddala distribution with truncation assumption outperforms all the other distribution assumptions. The impact of including the missing high-income on the Gini coefficient and Theil index is significant for 2007 and 2014. That is, based on the Gini coefficient, for China, inequality has increased after the inclusion of the missing high-income households for 2007 while, for the US, the inequality has increased after the inclusion of the missing high-income for both 2007 and 2014. Our analysis also shows that the inequality had reached to its highest level in 2007 (before the Global Financial Crisis) in China whereas the inequality started decreasing before 2007 (with the highest inequality in 2002) and increased a little in 2014, but not reached the level as in 2002.====The main contribution of our paper to the existing literature is that we provide a generalized method, which can be easily applied by researchers and practitioners to correct the potential bias generated by the missing high-income data based on unified income distribution for the whole population when estimating the income distribution from survey data.====This paper is organized as follows. ==== illustrates the key concept of this study, which is the truncated distribution. ==== discusses the three distributions: lognormal distribution, Singh Maddala distribution, and Beta II distribution. ==== describes the survey data for both China and the US. ==== provides the empirical estimation results. ==== carries out several robustness checks, including a counterfactual check with high-income celebrities, Pareto distribution test for the missing top-income, and the assumption with the bottom-income truncated. ==== concludes the discussion.",Does the "missing" high-income matter? -Income distribution and inequality revisited with truncated distribution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300987,8-Aug-19,2019,Research Article,431

Asset turnover and credit are viewed as the channels through which corruption fosters private firms' likelihood of survival.","High institutional quality, especially for the market institution, is important for the survival of private firm because of the lower fixed cost (====), lower transaction cost (====), and high legitimacy (====). With regard to private firms in a transition economy, survival pressure rises due to market institutional void. Consequently, private firms in transition economies commonly suffer more severe survival pressure than do firms in developed countries from the institutional perspective. A significant part of the solution to the institutional void, in reality, is to secure either official or political favoritism.==== Corruption is viewed as an alliance with officials (====) and results into political favoritism for private firms in a transition economy. However, whether and how corruption shapes private firms' survival remains under-researched. Our study intends to fill this gap.====Corruption, defined as the misuse of public power for private gain (====), seems to be rampant in transition economies (====; ====There are two views of the economic effects of corruption. On the one hand, corruption is treated as the ¡°sand in the wheels of commerce¡± by most researchers (e.g., ====). This view underscores the negative influences of corruption. On the other hand, corruption is considered as ¡°grease in the wheels of commerce¡± (e.g., ====; ====) by a growing body of literatures, which highlights the positive influence of corruption. Despite the well-recognized economic importance of corruption, few empirical studies track private firms' survival in transition economies, which display many differences (e.g., government governance, economic freedom) from those of developed countries.====Following transition cost, a prior study based on both developed countries and transition economies shows that corruption decreases a firm's likelihood of survival (====). For these cross-country studies, question is that the national unobservable characteristics are particularly difficult to control (====) and the influence of corruption may differ across countries (e.g., ====; ====) due to national heterogeneity in term of culture, economics, and political institutions. Apart from the abovementioned national heterogeneity, another problem that has received less attention is that the influence of corruption differs with firms' ownership (e.g., ====). Within Chinese context, a recent study based on the answer proportion to the question whether it is necessary to have strict policy against corruption implies that corruption is associated with private firms' survival likelihood (====). The most theoretically under-researched question is to what extent and under what conditions does corruption shape private firms' survival in transition economies. In addition, another possible drawback of prior tests results from endogenous corruption. Given these gaps, novel explanations and empirical tests are needed to better reveal the effect of corruption on private firms' survival in transition economies.====We fill these gaps by investigating the influence of regional corruption on private firms' likelihood of survival within the context of a single transition economy. Our analysis is based on the Chinese context for four reasons. First, like most transition economics, China, the largest transition country, is characterized as having high levels of corruption. Meanwhile, the corruption level varies greatly across regions (e.g., ====). Second, the co-existence of high corruption and private firms' flourishing is salient (====; ====). But their relationship and reasons remain unclear. Third, private firms suffer discrimination (e.g., ====), and they actively seek political favoritism. Forth, nowadays private firms' operating circumstances are undergoing dramatic changes, stemming from the harsh anticorruption campaign. And the Communist Party intends to establish a new relationship between government and firms through anticorruption, clarifying a clear boundary between capital and political power (====). However, the suspicion about the economic outcome of anticorruption rises (====). These situations provide a quasi-natural experiment to help understand the effect of corruption on private firms' survival.====Our study proposes that regional corruption facilitates private firms' likelihood of survival in China from a political favoritism perspective, which differs from past cognition based on transition cost (e.g., ====). By clarifying the features of corruption in China and business discrimination consisting of barriers to entry and financial constraints, we can see that corruption entails retribution. And corruption is viewed as access to favoritism from corrupt officials in the case of business discrimination. Thus, private firms' asset turnover is accelerated, and they can obtain financial support (e.g., credit and government subsidy). Therefore, we clarify the not yet investigated channel through which private firms' likelihood of survival arises out of regional corruption.====Echoing the under-researched topic on the distributional effect of corruption (e.g., ====; ====), we incorporate the power in our analysis of the effect of corruption on firms' survival. We firstly focus the power of officials to allocate resources in the market. Traditionally, because of the additional rents involved, it has seemed that official's discretionary power over red tape would harm firms' survival. However, in the case of business discrimination, the trouble caused by additional rents gives way to unfair treatment regarding private firms. Therefore, unlike the traditional implication, we argue that, if local officials are placed more centrally in terms of their power to allocate market resources, private firms that have a corrupt relationship with officials are more able to obtain officials' favoritism and reap benefit from corruption. We then analyze the distributional effect of corruption based on officials' power stability or instability. Inspired by ====, if local officials keep the power stability, private firms are more able to secure favoritism from corrupt officials, partially because of transparent bribery and bilateral trust. We hence propose that the positive influence of corruption on survival likelihood is strengthened under strong and stable power of officials.====Finally, we address the largely unexplored issue of the distributional effect of corruption (====) on likelihood of survival based on firms' power. Prior studies tended to overlook firm's strategic response to the opportunities presented by corruption (====). In fact, some firms are more powerful than others and are more able to shape the system in their existing circumstance (====). Moreover, firms' strategic responses to officials depend on their power relative to each other (====; ====). Following these logics, we believe that firm's power help them to deal with corrupt officials and exploit opportunities for corruption. Consequently, one of our key arguments is that strong power regarding private firm strengthens the positive influence of corruption on survival likelihood.====We use subnational (regional) registered corruption cases (====; ====) to measure corruption level. Combined with the ====Our study makes two contributions. First, we provide a fresh explanation of the fostering effect of corruption on private firms' likelihood of survival, thus adding to the literature on the co-existence of the flourishing of private business and rampant corruption in China (e.g., ====; ====; ====). In the Chinese context and from the perspective of official favoritism, we believe that corruption helps private firm to overcome business discrimination stemming from barriers to entry and financial discrimination, thus fostering their asset turnover and credit and subsidy levels. In doing so, we clarify the mechanism through which corruption improves private firms' survival. Accordingly, our studies echo the concern that corruption improves the economy in poorly-governed countries (e.g., ====), and add to the literature on ¡°grease in the wheels of commerce¡±. Second, our studies extend the distributional effect of corruption. Relative to these under researched studies on the distributional effect of corruption (====; ====), the innovation of our paper is to investigate the distributional effect hand-in-hand with power. We clarify the causal pathways through which the power and power stability of corrupt officials as well as firms' power influence the relationship between corruption and private firms' likelihood of survival.====This article proceeds as follows.

Regression results show that after controlling for social network, human capital, and other endowment characteristics, the effects of the appearance characteristics become smaller and statistically insignificant. The decomposition results of the wage-appearance differentials show that higher wages for good-looking workers are mainly attributable to differences in individual characteristics. Among them, the ==== for shorter males and higher wages for thinner females are mainly attributable to the unexplained parts of discrimination. Males suffer more from ¡°shortness penalty¡±, whereas females may earn from ¡°pretty face¡±.

The first explanation is that someone¡¯s appearance reflects differences in individual health and cognitive abilities (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), as well as affecting communicative confidence, opportunities, and abilities (====; ====; ====), thereby leading to differences in working capacities and wages. The second explanation is that differences in working capacities cannot fully explain the beauty premium, there exists appearance discrimination in the labor market (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====;====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====There are many questions worthy to answer. Is there beauty premium in the Chinese labor market? If yes, what are the causes of the beauty premium? Is it mainly due to working capacities differences (e.g., because of health, education, social networks, and other forms of labor capital differences) or due to discrimination based on appearance?====Some studies have confirmed the existence of the beauty premium and appearance discrimination in the Chinese labor market. For example, a statistical analysis conducted by ==== showed that some companies require that candidates have good looks or they set minimum height requirements. In addition, ==== found obvious discriminatory behavior against female height and weight in the Chinese labor market. ==== explored the discrimination based on facial attractiveness and found strong discrimination for individuals with lower than average facial attractiveness.====However, research into this issue is still lacking in China and the economics of beauty has not been sufficiently discussed. The previous studies only try to find evidence for the existence of appearance discrimination and mainly focused on whether appearance itself would affect wage ""significantly"" in statistical sense. The discussion about the ""significance"" of appearance discrimination in economic sense and how important role it plays in beauty premium is still not enough. Furthermore, a very important factor, the social ability (or opportunity), is omitted in previous empirical studies of appearance discrimination. As social ability (or opportunity) is affected by appearance (====; ====) on one hand, and it is a kind of working capacity and play an important role in productivity and wage on the other hand, the omission may have led to overestimation of appearance discrimination in labor market.====The main contributions of this study are as follows. Firstly we use social network as an indicator for social ability (or opportunity) to improve the estimation of appearance discrimination in labor market. Secondly we further decompose the sources of beauty premium into discrimination part and capacity difference part, and explore the significance of discrimination in beauty premium.

Specifically, we explore the firm's hierarchy and promotion patterns as well as the relationship between promotions and compensation. Unlike previous works, we focus on promotions throughout the firm's hierarchy including rank-and-files and promotions across branches. By doing so, we hope to shed new light on the black box of a firm's internal hiring and promotion practices and improve understanding of the internal labor market.","Economists' interest in personnel economics within firms increased considerably after the publication of ==== criticism of ¡°too many theories, too few facts¡±. Though it is a hot topic, empirical evidence on promotion within a firm has been poorly documented. In particular, we know little about promotions across branches, such as whether promotions occur predominantly within the branch, whether promotions between branches are common, and whether the benefit of promotions within a branch is different from the promotion benefit across branches. Moreover, most existing papers, like ====, ====, and ====, have employed personnel data from mature firms in developed economies, which already have a sound personnel system and survive in a near-equilibrium economic environment. However, we still do not know whether the shield of the internal labor market exists when the firm is immature in a developing country with many uncertainties. How do branches develop dynamically in a firm experiencing tremendous growth and facing dramatic change in its market? How do promotion patterns change in such a developing environment?====To answer these important questions, we employ unique personnel data from a large, fast-growing firm. It is a leading ====Specifically, in the first task, we have some interesting findings. First, consistent with the previous literature, we find some evidence for a stable internal labor market. During its rapid development, the firm maintained a stable ====, and career paths within the firm were simple and straightforward, providing solid evidence for an internal labor market even in a dramatically changing economy. Such career paths were even open to the rank-and-file employees in our data, but their promotion rate was low. Second, in the early years, the fast growth of the firm was due to both the increasing number of branches and the expanding headquarters, whereas, in later years, when the firm was still experiencing tremendous growth both in employees and assets, some branches even shrank and the size of the headquarters was stable. Third, promotions across branches existed but were far fewer than promotions within branches. Meanwhile, lateral transfers between branches were more common than promotions between branches. In the communication between the headquarters and branches, employees were more likely to flow from the headquarters to branches than the other way around. Fourth, when a new branch was established, recruits other than insiders filled all new positions, which sheds a wavering but important light on the prior literature regarding the communication between the internal and external labor markets.====To achieve the second task, we focus on two points. The first point is the wage premiums upon promotion. We improve previous estimations by measuring the discontinuous wage change upon promotion objectively and by adding a time trend in regressions to avoid overestimation. Moreover, we extend the discussion about wage premiums upon promotions by categorizing promotions into three types and comparing the three wage premiums upon promotions among job levels. It shows that the wage premiums upon promotion had an inverted U-shape with job levels, and promotions between job categories had a ==== premiums upon promotion in the short run, but either wage growth was high after promotions in the long run or promotees would avoid glass ceiling in the hierarchy. The second point is an exploration of where promotees came from. We show that promotees came from all salary deciles and verify that influence activities, the inconsistent order of pay and ability, and task-specific human capital might be the reasons that the firm promoted workers from the bottom salary deciles.====This paper is related to a large body of literature on personnel economics in general and on promotions within firms in particular. Because the internal labor market was described as distinct from the external labor market in arrangements (====; ====), it has attracted much attention in the literature and developed rapidly into a strand of literature called personnel economics (====). According to reviews of personnel economics in ==== and ====, researchers in this subfield have explored many topics in the study of human resource management, such as compensation, promotion, turnover, and teamwork. Among these topics, promotion is one of the most discussed topics, because it has important implications for not only incentive design in the internal labor market but also wage policy within the firm. Theoretically, researchers regard the role of promotion in firms as a signal (====; ====), as an incentive (====; ====; ====; ====). Meanwhile, empirical research has documented factual evidence regarding firms' hierarchies and promotion process and verified promotions' incentive effects. Because researchers have studied the effects of wage premiums upon promotion on CEOs of listed companies (====), on participants in laboratory experiments (====), and on competitors in sports events (====), rather than on employees within a firm, it is not surprising that more papers focus on the empirical evidence of the promotion incentive effect than on promotion facts. In other words, though a few papers have been published on this topic (====; ====), studies based on promotion facts are still few.====Therefore, our study contributes to the existing literature in three dimensions. First, we extend the analysis of internal labor markets to the firm's rank and file and provide insights different from those of prior papers. Thanks to our rich data, we can observe the whole job ladder from rank-and-file employees to vice presidents rather than managerial employees only. There is few evidence from rank and files in the literature, except ==== and ====. ==== focused on the topic of wages in the internal labor market, and mentioned little about promotions of staff workers. ==== emphasized promotions of clerical grades, and documented that the clerical grades are different from managerial grades. But clerical grades in their paper are very special because they are more in the nature of a training system with standards-based promotions, where all employees are expected to complete. Our paper finds a different pattern of promotion for rank-and-file employees that their promotion rates are similar to those in the management levels. This finding contributes to the literature by providing new evidence on promotions from true rank-and-file workers. We document many facts that prior work has not shown: What do the careers of the rank-and-file employees look like? Is there any glass ceilings through the whole job ladder? These facts will enable us to create a more detailed picture of the internal labor market.====Second, we document new contents of promotions by using the information on where employees are employed. For instance, are promotions predominantly within the branch, or are promotions between branches also common? Is the firm's growth mainly due to increases in the number of branches or are existing branches also expanding? By answering these questions, we provide new facts for the literature, and we also contribute new evidences for the existing theories as well. For example, we show that promotions within branches are more consistent with the tournament theory than other types of promotions. Because wage premiums upon promotions and future promotion opportunities are clearly the main incentives in the promotion competition within branches, while other types of promotions have different incentives such as wage rise in the long run and avoiding glass ceiling. Theories of hierarchical structures and monitoring in hierarchies (====; ====) imply that the number of job levels would grow with firm size, which were not supported by the previous studies like ==== and ====, but we find supporting evidences in some branches rather than in the firm as a whole.====Third, we offer new evidences from China regarding the internal labor market. Still, previous studies based on a single firm like ====, ====, and ==== et al. could not deny that generalized results are in doubt, and most studies like ==== are based on data from developed economics and mature firms, whereas there is considerably less evidence from developing countries and immature companies. Thus, there is clearly ¡°room¡± for additional studies, even some are to a large extent descriptive.

Both high and low quality borrowers provide collateral more often than medium quality debtors do. Using models that explicitly incorporate heterogeneous borrower qualities, we find a positive relation between collateralization and risk of default for loans issued to debtors with low credit ratings. In contrast, collateral provided by debtors with high credit ratings is negatively associated with the risk of default. These results suggest that low quality borrowers may be required to provide collateral at the bank's request to mitigate moral hazard problem. On the other hand, high quality borrowers may provide collateral willingly to signal quality in order to mitigate adverse selection problem when competing for getting access to bank loans.

After a loan is issued, asymmetric information makes it difficult for banks to monitor borrowers' behavior, so moral hazard problem arises if borrowers increase the risk of invested projects. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems not only increase the risk but also the cost of bank loans (====). To mitigate these problems, bank loans frequently include provisions of collateral using borrowers' property or other assets to secure the loan; especially for loans made to smaller or riskier borrowers. ==== report that approximately 60% of small business loans are collateralized in the US, while majority of bank loans in China have collateral requirements (====). In the unfortunate event of borrowers failing to make the promised payments, banks can seize the collateral to recover loans or limit losses.====), China has experienced a phenomenal growth in credit financing averaged at 20% a year since 2010. It is now home to four of the five largest banks in the world. In light of the weak investor protection in China, and the sheer size and importance of its banking system, we would like to provide some empirical evidence on the effect of collateral requirement on bank loan performance in China.====Our study makes incremental contributions to literature by shedding new light on different roles that collateral plays for bank loans made to high- and low-quality borrowers in a market with both adverse selection and moral hazard problems. In particular, we find that both high- and low-credit quality borrowers are more likely to provide collateral than medium-credit quality borrowers are. However, collateralized loans for low-credit quality borrowers have higher default risk than non-collateralized loans, while collateral for loans made to high-credit quality borrowers reduces the risk of default. We conclude that collateral has different information content for bank loans under heterogeneous borrower qualities.====Previous studies of collateral for bank loans focus either on adverse selection or moral hazard models. ==== find that high-quality borrowers are willing to provide collateral as signal of quality due to concerns about the adverse selection problem, in order to avoid being priced out of the market (====, ====; ==== and ====). ==== argue that overcollateralization is the optimal strategy for high quality borrowers in an environment with significant information asymmetry. High-risk borrowers, on the other hand, prefer to accept higher interest rates in exchange for pledging lower collateral (====).====Other empirical studies present different results, claiming that high-risk borrowers pledge collateral more frequently than safer borrowers do (====; ====; ==== and ====). Previous studies also show that collateralized loans have higher default risk than non-collateralized loans ex post (====; ====; ====; ====), consistent with the moral hazard argument. However, collateral pledge may trigger moral hazard problem (====), or create adverse selection problem in borrowers having limited liability when the market value of collateral moves (====).====From banks' point of view, provisions of collateral can discipline borrowers and motivate them to work harder so that risk of default is reduced by reducing the moral hazard problem (====; ====; ====; ====; ==== and ====). In the event of a default, collateral allows the bank to recover at least part of the loan through capitalizing on the collateral (====; ==== and ====).====In summary, adverse selection and moral hazard are both important reasons for collateral requirement on bank loans market. While adverse selection theory predicts a negative relation between the likelihood of collateral pledge and borrowers' quality, moral hazard theory predicts a negative relation between collateral and the probability of loans' default. ==== claims that certain loan and borrower characteristics (firm size, loan size term to maturity) can affect monitoring cost measured by loans' interest rate spread. ==== find that a number of borrower characteristics have significant impact on the likelihood of collateral pledge including business size, equity intensity, credit rating and bank vs nonbank borrower. ==== report that collateral is more likely to be provided by younger and larger firms with more liquid assets. A number of other factors also affect collateral pledge including bank-borrower relationship (====; ====), competition on the credit market (====), costs of screening and rents from screening (====). In addition, ==== and ==== find that borrowers' consumption preference and risk attitude are important factors for explaining the default risk of personal bank loans.====However, empirical studies on the role of collateral for bank loans in emerging economies are scarce. ==== report that banks in Thailand frequently require small and young firms to put provide collateral. More recently, several studies using data from China emerged. ==== and ==== find evidence supportive of the moral hazard argument. ==== and ==== report evidence of banks exhibit moral hazard problem as they issue more risky loans following increases in non-performing loans. These studies, however, implicitly assume homogeneous information content of collateral supplied by borrowers of different credit qualities. This is not the case in real world. We argue that it is entirely possible for collateral supplied by borrowers of different qualities to have heterogeneous information contents. As it is crucial for banks to understand the workings of collateral in risk management and safeguard of their assets, we attempt to shed some new light on this topic by allowing heterogeneous borrower qualities to study a unique dataset obtained from a major state-owned commercial bank in China. Our results contribute to the better understanding of the workings of collateral in emerging economies largely neglected so far in academic studies.====This study presents two interesting findings. First, we find that both high quality and low-quality borrowers are more likely to provide collateral than their medium-quality peers are. Second, we report that collateralized loans made to high-quality borrowers have lower default risk while collateralized loans issued to low-quality borrowers have higher likelihood of default. These results are particularly interesting in the sense that they indicate that collateral placed by borrowers of heterogeneous qualities have different information contents. More specifically, collateral from high-quality borrowers signals quality, while collateral from low-quality borrowers indicates risk. The former is consistent with the adverse selection argument, while the latter is consistent with the moral hazard model. Although both signaling of quality and indication of risk have been previously reported for bank loan collateral, our study is the first to observe both effects using the same dataset obtained from the same market; shedding new light on the understanding of the information content of collateral for bank loans. More importantly, our results bring out explicitly the significance of heterogeneous borrower quality in interpreting the information content of collateral. Our findings have important policy and practical implications for banks in contracting and managing risk of bank loans.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as the following.

We find that the trustworthiness of the local government has a statistically significant role in individuals' decision about self-employment and that the marginal effect on self-employment is context dependent and increases with the quality of the institutions. The trustworthiness of the local government prompts self-employment in provinces where the market institutions are well developed and suppresses it in other regions. Heterogeneity concerns on rural-urban and generations are also explored. We also find that the quality of market institutions increases self-employment, and the scale increases with the trustworthiness of the local government.","Entrepreneurship is one of the most important ways to reduce unemployment figures and to promote economic growth. In the last 20 years, given the availability of survey data, researchers have increasingly paid attention to the role that trust plays in economic activity (====; ==== and the references therein), although the importance of trust was already recognized by ==== more than 40 years ago. There is a large amount of recent researches on the role of general trust on entrepreneurship (====; ====;====; ====), whereas there is little research on the role of trust in government, which is the main research interest of this paper.====As the local government (including courts and regulatory authorities) is the formal third party (authorized by the Constitution, statute and/or common law)that enforces fair implementation of economic transactions, social trust in the local government would directly affect the expected cost of self-employment and thus, influence individuals' self-employment motives.====The potential for expanding entrepreneurship in China continues to remain strong. In the US, there were 10 enterprises per 100 people in 2015, whereas the number (including non-registered businesses) in China was just half.==== The Chinese central government continuously enacts new policies and encourages entrepreneurship. In developing countries, such as China, where the formal market institutions are weak, trust plays an important role in economic interactions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the trustworthiness of the local government and individuals' incentive for self-employment by using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS).====In previous studies about the effect of trust on entrepreneurship, researchers usually assume that all individuals in the sample have the same understanding of and explanation for their surrounding economic institutions, which may not be applicable especially in transitional societies. In ==== definition, trust is a belief, which can be measured as a probability that the corresponding agent (neighbors, strangers, government, etc.) will perform an action that is beneficial for us (====). When working with strongly reduced trust categories in social surveys, researchers commonly face a translation problem and a problem of understanding, which mainly depend on one's knowledge and experiences: ¡°All thinking, knowledge, and experience are living tools and the life's foundation. The past experience is the tool to help for one's future living¡± (====). This is a major challenge, especially for research on the role of the trustworthiness of the local government in China, which is a transitional society from the planned economic system to the market system.====In transitional China, the recognized action set for government officials, who devise the constraints that shape and guide human action, is different for individuals in different regions. ==== stated that ¡°Institutions provide the structure for exchange that (together with the technology employed) determines the cost of transacting and the cost of transformation. How well institutions solve the problems of coordination and production is determined by the motivation of the players (their utility function), the complexity of the environment, and the ability of the players to decipher and order the environment (measurement and enforcement).¡±During the period of the socialist planned economy, the government was in charge of everything, including employment, housing, consumption, and so on, which destroyed private incentives for entrepreneurship. After the Chinese reform and opening-up in 1978, the central government transformed the government's role in a market-oriented economy. A particular institution determines the kinds of employment choices that are profitable and viable for individuals. Today, most individuals' economic activities are driven by market factors, such that individuals need to look for and compete for employment opportunities themselves.====However, ¡°creating a system of effective enforcement and of moral constraints on behavior is a long, slow process that requires time to develop if it is to evolve¡± (====, p.60), and large development disparities exist among regions in China. In some provinces, a state-owned and collective economy still dominates; Premier Li Keqiang once created the metaphor that the economy in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces will catch a chill if Daqing or First Auto Company (two of the largest state-owned firms in China) sneezes. Many traditional planning roles of the government still exist in such provinces. The central government tried very hard to transform the government's role in the economy and asked local governments to avoid the idea of ==== during the planned economy period. Therefore, in regions where individuals still rely on the government for everything, a trusted government may hinder entrepreneurship, and in regions where the market economy is well developed, the government's trustworthiness facilitates individual entrepreneurship.==== The unique transitional context in China with varying institutional qualities makes research on government trustworthiness and entrepreneurship especially intriguing.====Therefore, in this paper, we take the quality of institutions into consideration when we explore the impact of the trustworthiness of the local government on self-employment. The first finding we obtain is that the trustworthiness of the local government has a statistically significant effect on individuals' self-employment decision and prompts self-employment only in provinces where market institutions are well developed (e.g., Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai in the east). The result is intuitive and reasonable. In less-developed regions where market institutions play a non-significant role, people still believe that the government will give a helping hand if they have employment problems and that the government will substantially intervene in economic activities such that doing self-help by entrepreneurship is costly. However, in more developed provinces where the market works well and the private economy prospers, people believe that building their own business is less costly if they trust the local government more.====Considerable differences in beliefs and economic activities exist between cohorts because of rural-urban and generational differences. Therefore, we also explore the role of the trustworthiness of the local government on self-employment for different cohorts. We find that the trustworthiness of the local government plays a statistically significant role for the rural subsamples regardless of the institutional measures involved, and the role of the trustworthiness of the local government remains for urban subsamples only if they also have the urban ====. Regarding generational differences, the trustworthiness of the local government plays no role for those born in the 1950s and 1990s, which are not the typical ages for entrepreneurship.==== emphasized that ¡°enforcement in Third World economies is uncertain not only because of ambiguity of legal doctrine (a measurement cost), but because of uncertainty with respect to behavior of the agent.¡± Therefore, the belief in and the trustworthiness of the local government directly influence the efficiency of formal institutions. The result suggests that in addition to institution building and transformation, trust building is important for a transitional economy where political trust is low.====There are mainly two streams of related literature.====First, studies on the relationship between trust and entrepreneurship have emerged recently. Several researchers (====; ====; ====) have examined the effect of general trust on individual motives for self-employment by using data from different countries. ==== use a pseudo-panel data at the country level and find that trust in strangers and in public institutions facilitates entrepreneurship; however, they do not take different institutions into account, despite controlling for country fixed effects. ==== provide some summary descriptive statistical facts that entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs have different levels of trust in the local government in China, but they provide no empirical analysis. By contrast, the present study enriches and contributes to the literature and finds that the role of trust in the government is context dependent and relies heavily on the quality of market institutions.====Second, in the last decade, several studies have linked institutional factors to self-employment. Using country-level data, several researchers (====; ====; ====; ==== and ====) find that economic freedom tends to increase entrepreneurship. However, the quality of institutions may vary across regions within a country, such as the case in China. ==== provide some summary descriptive statistical facts that entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs perceive the quality of institutions in China differently. The present study enriches research in this area in two directions: it uses micro-data at the individual level within one country, and it finds that political trust, measured as the local government's trustworthiness, plays a large role and influences the scale of the effect of formal institutions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide a conceptual framework and introduce the hypotheses, describe the data sets and how we select the samples, and present the ==== in Section 2. In Section 3, we explore the impact of the trustworthiness of the local government and the quality of the institutions on individuals' self-employment decision. In Section 4, we explore the heterogeneity and robustness concern in this study. We conclude the paper in Section 5.","Trustworthiness of local government, institutions, and self-employment in transitional China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300902,1-Aug-19,2019,Research Article,436

We extend a quality index based on internationally comparable citation data from international search reports (ISR) to consider foreign, domestic, and self citations. Whereas foreign citations show that Chinese PCT patent applications reach only a third of the non-Chinese quality benchmark, the extension towards domestic and self citations suggests a higher quality level that converges to or even surpasses the benchmark. We investigate these differences based on firm-level regressions and find that in China, only foreign citations, but not domestic and self citations, have a significant and positive relation to R&D stocks.

China is already leading in patent applications (====) and ranks second in applications made under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (====). In recent years, China's patent applications have risen disproportionately against its R&D expenditures, resulting in decreasing R&D inputs per patent.====The Chinese government uses patent targets, subsidies, and other policy instruments to incentivize applications. The National Patent Development Strategy (2011?2020) targets 75,000 PCT patent applications in 2020, which would make China the leading PCT applicant country (====). It is well documented that patent subsidies are a driver of patent quantity in China (====; ====; ====Typically, patent applications are determined by R&D inputs and the expectation that the economic value of a patent exceeds its cost (====). Following the theoretical argument that a cost reduction, e.g. through subsidies, disproportionately incentivizes patents of marginal value (====), the increase in China's patent quantity may have happened to the detriment of patent quality.====The empirical assessment of China's patent quality is challenging. One issue is that China's patent office does not publicly disclose citation data that is widely used to measure patent quality (====We extend the original ISR index (====), which is based on foreign citations, by adding domestic and self citations.

Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey, we examine how dose education expansion have an effect on the intergenerational transmission of education (ITE) by using the exogenous surge brought by CHEE. Our finding is that, after carefully addressing the interference induced by the Compulsory Education Laws and the selection bias caused by intergenerational co-residence, CHEE reduces ITE when educational achievement is measured by schooling years. However, when taking the quality of higher education into account, we find that CHEE does not have a significant effect on ITE, which suggests that the intergenerational ==== in higher education remains. Moreover, we identify the mechanism that the inequality in the quality of high school education extends to tertiary education to explains our findings. To account for the mixed findings in previous literatures, we further propose a general framework for understanding the effect of education expansion on ITE.","). Intergenerational mobility is an important research topic because lower intergenerational mobility can harm long-term investments in human capital and limit economic development (====; ====). Moreover, ==== show that intergenerational transmission of human capital is the core mechanism of intergenerational mobility. Hence, in this paper, we study intergenerational mobility by intergenerational transmission of education (hereafter ITE).==== Negatively related to intergenerational mobility, ITE is positively correlated with the gap in educational attainment between advantaged and less-advantaged children. When ITE is high, equivalently intergenerational mobility is low, children from disadvantaged families are more likely to obtain lower educational achievements, and thus fall into ¡°the trap of low human capital¡±. Education expansion increases the supply of higher education. If disadvantaged children can obtain more educational opportunities compared with advantaged children, then intergenerational mobility of education will be greater. The effect of education expansion on intergenerational mobility of education is an important research topic in this field.====In the twentieth century, the supply of higher education rapidly expanded worldwide (====). The rate of college enrollment in some developed countries is over 50% and, in some cases, even 80%, foreshadowing the possibility of universal higher education. In 1999, China, the largest developing country in the world, also introduced a strategic policy to increase the supply of tertiary education. Between 1998 and 1999, college enrollments increased by 460,000 and the rate of college admissions, which indicates the likelihood of a senior secondary school graduate attending college or university, increased from 34% to 56%. In the following 10?years, this policy provided 500,000 newly-added higher education admissions on average per year, and has been referred to as a great leap forward in higher education (====).====China's higher education expansion (hereafter CHEE) policy has aimed to rapidly increase the provision and popularity of higher education. So far, >70 million people have attained a tertiary education due to CHEE. The dramatic increase in college enrollment is exogenous to the trend of China's economic growth (====). Therefore, CHEE can serve as a quasi-experiment for identifying the effect of education expansion on ITE through the exogenous increase in the supply of higher education.====Previous studies have drawn mixed conclusions on the effect of education expansion on ITE (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These mixed findings are most likely due to the different backgrounds of the education expansion policies implemented in different countries. Moreover, the potential mechanism of the effect of education expansion on ITE may differ across countries. Several recent papers have studied the effects of CHEE on ITE (====; ====; ====). ==== investigate the effects of the Compulsory Education Laws and CHEE on ITE mainly in terms of the rural-urban divide.==== In addition to the inconsistent findings on the effects of CHEE on ITE, few studies have examined the potential mechanisms of these effects. The lack of evidence on the mechanisms means the causal effect remains a black box and the external validity of the empirical results is restricted (====). This paper seeks to complement to the literature by identifying a valid mechanism through examining how high school attendance affects the attainment of higher education.==== show that the Compulsory Education Laws had a significantly negative impact on ITE. Thus, the evidence suggests that the effect of CHEE on ITE is intertwined with that of the Compulsory Education Laws. However, few studies have examined this problem. Only ==== qualitatively analyze the potential influence of the Compulsory Education Laws rather than providing direct empirical evidence. This paper seeks to rule out the effect of the Compulsory Education Laws by restricting the sample and conducting precise quantitative empirical analyses.==== and ==== show that intergenerational co-residence is not a random behavior and is associated with many family economic decisions. Thus, the co-residence sample could be prone to encounter selection bias, which would lead to a biased estimation of the effect of CHEE on ITE. In addition, ==== finds that CHEE increases the probability of rural residents who have been affected by CHEE moving to the city. However, numerous studies have either ignored this problem or directly deleted the cases of children who do not live with their parents. This paper takes this sample selection issue into consideration.====Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey (CHIPS), we find that CHEE decreases ITE when we use schooling years to measure a child's educational achievement. After taking the quality of education into account, the empirical results show that CHEE has no significant effect on ITE. In other words, CHEE succeeds in quantitatively decreasing educational ==== in terms of the years of education, but does not make it happen in terms of the quality of education. These results are robust after we deal with the potential endogeneity concerns and rule out the potential confounding effects of the Compulsory Education Laws, intergenerational co-residence, and other random factors.====To provide a general explanation for the mixed findings in the literature, we propose a general framework to analyze the effect of education expansion on ITE based on the classical theories of Maximally Maintained Inequality (====) and Effectively Maintained Inequality (====). The theory of Maximally Maintained Inequality implies that the effect of family background on educational attainment progressively diminishes as the level of education becomes universal. Thus, if CHEE provides sufficient newly-added higher education enrollments, the gap in schooling years between advantaged and disadvantaged children will decline and thus ITE decreases, which is in accord with our findings. In contrast, the theory of Effectively Maintained Inequality emphasizes the quality of education, and argues that family background has a powerful and persistent influence on the quality of education that a child can obtain. The gap in the educational quality attained between children from different family backgrounds remains constant even though the level of education has become universal. In other words, in our context, although all of the children attend college or university after CHEE, advantaged children are still likely to receive a higher quality education, which is also consistent with our findings. Basing on the theories of Maximally Maintained Inequality and Effectively Maintained Inequality, we propose a general framework for understanding the effect of education expansion on ITE and show that the correlation between the supply of higher education and ITE takes an inverted U-shape when educational achievement is measured by the schooling years.====Our analysis of the mechanism of this effect shows that attending a key high school is crucial for gaining admission to college or university, and plays an even more significant role in enabling access to higher quality education. The empirical results show that CHEE fails to reduce the gap in the probability of attending a key high school between advantaged and disadvantaged children and insignificantly weakens the effect of high school educational quality on the quality of tertiary education attained. Hence, the inequality in elementary education extends to higher education and CHEE ineffectively promotes intergenerational mobility with respect to educational quality. Finally, we find rich heterogeneities in the effects of CHEE on ITE in terms of gender, the type of Hukou, and the educational track.====This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on the effect of education expansion on ITE. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to discuss the mechanism of the effect of CHEE on ITE. Based on this mechanism, we argue that an efficient way to promote intergenerational mobility is to reduce the inequality in elementary education. A second contribution is that we draw reliable conclusions by effectively addressing the potential interference of the Compulsory Education Laws and sample selection bias induced by intergenerational co-residence. Our data contain basic demographic and education information on the parents of the householders and their spouses, which enables us to match the intergenerational information even when the respondents do not live with their parents.====Finally, this paper enriches the empirical research on the effects of education expansion on ITE by examining the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of education. In addition to using the commonly used measure of educational achievement, schooling years, we examine ITE from the aspect of educational quality. The differential results obtained based on these two perspectives provide an overall investigation. Moreover, using the theories of Maximally Maintained Inequality and Effectively Maintained Inequality, we construct a general framework to offer a more comprehensive interpretation of the empirical findings on the effect of education expansion on ITE and enhance our understanding of this effect.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In contrast with neutral tax incentives without government selection, the certification of HNTEs is based on a system of selection criteria, and only firms operating in specific areas can be certificated as HNTEs. In addition to a reduction of the tax burden, certificated HNTEs are eligible to automatically benefit from other types of support provided by local governments, including subsidies, innovation funds, etc. Due to such benefits, firms have strong incentives to apply for HNTE certifications, and some fraudulent HNTEs even manipulate key indicators in order to meet the criteria, with the help of professional application agencies. The uniqueness of the program makes it an interesting case for investigation.====This paper contributes to the existing literature on the effectiveness of government support for innovation by examining a unique HNTE program implemented in China.

Rather than simply distinguishing between HNTEs and non-HNTEs, the dataset records the exact events and times that firms were certificated as HNTEs. While most studies have evaluated the static effect of government programs at a given point of time, the longitudinal dataset allowed us to investigate the dynamic effects in subsequent periods following HNTE certification. Instead of focusing on either input or output additionality, we investigated the effects on firms' R&D intensity and productivity.====Second, it allowed us to investigate the persistence of HNTE certification and its heterogeneous effects. The persistence of program participation is a fairly under-explored issue in the existing literature (====). As HNTE certifications are valid only for three years, it is interesting to investigate whether the impacts of HNTE certification are heterogeneous between firms that acquire certificates for the first time and repeatedly certificated firms. Combined with a dynamic effect analysis, we sought to identify the time lag structure of HNTE certifications. Such analyses may provide insights on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the HNTE program.====Third, we were able to address the concern of fraudulent HNTEs. As mentioned above, some unqualified firms are reportedly manipulating their key indicators regarding eligibility requirements so as to obtain HNTE certifications. To address this concern, we distinguished firms certificated only once and those that were highly qualified as HNTEs. Highly qualified HNTEs are defined as firms whose R&D intensity is higher than our defined cutoff levels three years prior to being certificated as HNTEs. By separately estimating the ====, we were able to make inferences regarding the existence of fraudulent HNTEs and to examine whether government agencies are able to identify such HNTEs and terminate their certification. Our definition of qualified HNTEs also provides cues for the government to identify fraudulent HNTEs.====The methodological challenge of this paper is to deal with the ==== arising from selection bias; that is, HNTE certifications are selective and not randomly assigned. To correct this selection bias, we combined the propensity score-matching (PSM) approach with a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator. Specifically, we made efforts in the following aspects: (1) treated and control samples are matched on the lagged outcome of R&D intensity to ensure that the post-treatment outcome differences are not driven by pre-treatment selection bias; (2) instead of the outcome levels, the before-after difference of innovative performance is employed as the outcome variables to eliminate time-invariant unobservable confounding factors; (3) the inclusion of firm productivity as the outcome variable can partially address the endogeneity problem, because firm productivity is mostly unobservable and exogenous to the selection of the HNTE program; (4) the results are robust to a DID identification approach based on the matched samples.====Overall, the results confirmed a significantly positive effect of HNTE certification on firms' R&D investment and productivity. The effects were persistent over the certification period of three years. However, the positive effects were mainly driven by repeatedly certificated firms, while the treatment effects were mostly insignificant for firms certificated for the first time. While one-time certifications had no significant effects, certifications granted to highly qualified firms significantly improved the recipients' R&D intensity and productivity. The results imply the existence of fraudulent HNTEs and provide cues for government agencies to identify unqualified HNTEs.====The reminder of the paper is structured as follows.

Moreover, the relationship between corporate philanthropy and trade credits is affected by the local social trust environment. A good social trust environment is amicable for firms to use corporate philanthropy in obtaining trade credits. The research findings have important policy implications.

In China, corporate donation has become the backbone of philanthropy. According to the Chinese Charity Donation Report in 2017, corporate donation amounted to 96.33 billion yuan in 2017, accounting for 64.23% of the total donation. Private enterprises played a critical role as they contributed over half of the total amount of corporate donation in the same year.====As a general means of fulfilling social responsibility, philanthropic activities have drawn great attention from academic researchers. From the strategic philanthropic viewpoint, philanthropy has some potential strategic value for private firms (====). Those actively engaging in philanthropy and other social responsibilities are expected to meet the expectation of stakeholders and therefore gain moral legitimacy (====), build brand loyalty and popularity (====), enhance organizational reputation (====; ====), improve image (====), and then create competitive advantages. The positive image and good reputation will in turn help firms to gain the support of stakeholders. From the financial perspective, a number of studies prove that corporate philanthropy can reduce capital cost (====), help enterprises to build a good relationship with government (====), and improve corporate debt financing ability (====). From the moral perspective, ====However, the instrument view of social responsibility considers that, as a profit seeking organization, a private company may engage in corporate social responsibility in the hope of covering its misbehavior, concealing bad information or achieving some business objectives (====; ====). For example, some Chinese family-owned firms are found to divert public attention from their environmentally unfriendly behavior by taking part in philanthropic activities (====). Worse performers may be more likely to make charitable contributions than better ones to attract social attention and business (====).====The conflicting views aforementioned have led to two different arguments with respect to the impact of corporate philanthropy. However, the exact mechanism leading to the inconclusive viewpoints has not been well researched. Some studies suggest that only through stakeholder perceptions on philanthropy behaviors can corporate philanthropy exert real influences on stakeholder decisions (====). Such perceptions, however, are affected not only by corporate behavior per se but also by relevant corporate characteristics and/or the local business environment. For different corporations in different business environments, the same behavior is likely to generate different perceptions, which will lead to dissimilar decisions by stakeholders.====As to the impact of corporate philanthropy on corporate financing capability, the existent studies have mainly focused on how corporate philanthropic engagement may facilitate bank loans or reduce capital costs. The relationship between corporate philanthropy and trade credit financing remains largely unexplored, although trade credits play an important role in short-term financing, especially for private firms (====; ====; ====). There are only a few exceptions, such as ====, that have started to examine the impact of corporate social performance on trade credits. Corporate social performance is found to have a significant impact on trade credits, but this correlation is only significant for private firms. It is worth noting that they have only discussed this issue from the perspective of reputation. To a large extent, however, they have neglected the fact that philanthropy may work as an instrument for firms to obtain government resources or cover up some financial deficiencies.====).====Based on the above discussion, this paper will study whether and how firm characteristics and business environment may affect the relationship between corporate philanthropy and trade credit financing for China's listed private firms.==== In particular, it aims to reveal the importance of supplier heterogeneous perceptions towards corporate donation through examining the moderating effects of financial capability, political connection and trust environment on the relationship between philanthropic activities and trade credit financing. It differs from previous studies as it effectively integrates the moral and instrumental views of philanthropy and points out the importance of various potential factors that may cause the heterogeneous perceptions of credit suppliers towards corporate philanthropy.====This study makes several contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, it differs from the existing literature in that it examines this issue from both the strategic and instrumental perspectives. Previous studies mainly focus on the ¡°goodwill¡± of corporate philanthropy and examine its promotional effect on firm financing ability from the moral perspective. Secondly, it considers supplier heterogeneous perceptions on corporate philanthropy and incorporates firm characteristics with respect to financing ability. In particular, it analyzes the differences in supplier perceptions on corporate philanthropy with different financial capabilities and political connections. The research findings show that suppliers are more likely to have the perception of impure motive on a firm's philanthropic behavior when the firm has political connections and insufficient capital. Thirdly, it takes the environmental factor into account and proves that the local trust environment is a prerequisite for the effective transmission of philanthropic activities into the actual improvement in trade credit financing.

The measurement of the productivity gains and identification of the underlying drivers thereof are important facets of policy analysis. The commonly used Total Factor Productivity (TFP) measures often lack such desirable properties as completeness or independence of the direction of the optimization (orientation). In this paper, we take a top down approach by beginning with a TFP measure and then decomposing it into three mutually exclusive, exhaustive elements. In particular, we begin with the additively complete Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen (LHM) TFP indicator that takes into account both input and output changes when measuring productivity and then additively decompose it into measures of technological progress, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. We develop a generalized decomposition of the LHM TFP indicator which encompasses both input-oriented and output-oriented changes over time. We illustrate this additively complete LHM TFP indicator using agricultural data from 31 Chinese provinces over the period 1997¨C2015. Our empirical results show that Chinese agricultural productivity growth (3.05% per annum) was mainly driven by technological progress (2.35% p.a.), with relatively small contributions from scale efficiency change (0.65% p.a.) and technical efficiency change (0.04% p.a.). We also found that productivity change and the relative importance of its components varied across both time and provinces.","; ====; ====).====Given that China is one of the world's largest food producers as well as food consumers, its agricultural TFP growth is very important. While China's agricultural productivity grew rapidly following the ¡°reform and opening up¡± policies of 1978, the rate of growth slowed in recent years. But with 18.4% of the world's population and only about 8.4% of its arable land (====), rising living standards and changing food consumption patterns, and an increasing reliance on agricultural imports, China's agricultural productivity impacts global food markets and the influence of its policy on productivity is very important.====Both domestic (e.g., support policies) and external (e.g., climate change) factors shape the Chinese agricultural sector. For example, to promote farmers' income and farming viability in general, the agricultural policy in China turned from taxation to subsidization from 2006 onwards (====; ====). Input subsidies have allowed Chinese farmers to expand their scales of operation and acquire higher quality inputs (====); however, the support programs did not yield structural changes and small-scale farming still prevails in China. ==== found that industrialization and rising wages have led to the substitution of machines for labor (supported by the development of markets for machine rentals and machine services). Constraints on land sales, however, limit the expansion of firm size; in ==== sample, mean farm size was just 6.42 mu==== in 2008, which was little changed from 2004, but substantially smaller than in 1985.====Accurate measurement of TFP growth and its drivers, at both the aggregate and disaggregated levels, is essential for designing policy and assessing its effectiveness. ==== concluded from a meta-analysis of the literature on TFP growth in China that empirical findings on TFP vary widely by data sample as well as by choice of method used to measure TFP growth. Our paper contributes to the literature on Chinese agricultural TFP growth by developing an additively complete Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen (LHM) productivity indicator that simultaneously accounts for both input change and output change. Ratio-based productivity measures such as the Malmquist index are undefined when one or more of the variables used to construct them are equal or close to zero; this is not a problem for additive productivity measures such as the LHM productivity indicator. Furthermore, the LHM indicator is additively complete because it is the difference between an output aggregator and an input aggregator. An incomplete productivity measure may be a biased measure of TFP change since it does not simultaneously account for the effects of both input and output changes. As a complete measure of productivity based on directional distance functions that simultaneously expand outputs and contract inputs to move observations to the frontier of technology, the LHM indicator can be separated into output growth and input growth effects. Our second contribution is to propose a decomposition of the additively complete LHM productivity indicator that yields three mutually exclusive and exhaustive components¡ªtechnological progress, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Our third contribution is to present the non-parametric linear programming models (data envelopment analysis [DEA] like models) needed to compute the directional distance functions used to construct the LHM TFP indicator and its components. Previously, ==== applied the LHM TFP indicator to the analysis of agricultural productivity in the US. However, they proposed particular cases of the LHM indicator (either input- or output-oriented), while, as noted above, this paper proposes a comprehensive LHM TFP indicator that includes both the input- and output-orientations. In our illustration, we find that each component of the TFP indicator has the same signs and similar magnitudes under the input- and output-orientations, but this need not be the case. In cases in which the magnitudes and/or signs differ across orientations, using just one orientation could result in biased information on economic performance, which could be detrimental to successful policy making. Finally, we illustrate the proposed measures using provincial level panel data on China's agricultural sector over the period 1997¨C2015. The period covered coincides with two recent cycles of economic reforms of the agricultural sector (====). Aggregate, regional, and provincial level findings for TFP and its three components are discussed, as are the separate roles of input growth and output growth on the components of TFP. We find that technological progress is the key driver of TFP growth in Chinese agriculture, but results vary over time and space.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review on the major approaches toward the measurement of TFP and their manifestations for the Chinese agriculture. Section 3 begins with the building blocks of the LHM indicator, and then presents the LHM TFP indicator along with its decomposition into technological change, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Section 4 illustrates the calculation and decomposition of the LHM indicator using data from China's agriculture sector over the period 1997¨C2015. Both the data and the insights gained when the LHM is used to investigate productivity change in Chinese agriculture are discussed. The application demonstrates the value of using an additively complete TFP measure to examines productivity change over time.

A robustness check using court verdicts of all bribery cases in China indicate the same result, i.e., coal mining is conducive to local corruption at all levels. Furthermore, we show that the mechanism is not through demand side, i.e., corruption is not a consequence of economic boom around the coalmines but directly linked to the coal mining itself.","An abundance of and/or dependence on natural resources tends to be associated with deteriorating economic development, poor-quality institutions, and undemocratic political regimes. In their influential work, ==== noted that ¡°one of the surprising features of modern economic growth is that economies abundant in natural resources have tended to grow slower than economies without substantial natural resources.¡±====; ====).====The existing literature provides mixed evidence for the relationship between natural resource abundance and corruption. Many studies have found a positive association between natural resources and corruption, whether corruption is measured at the local or national level (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). ====, ====, ==== and ==== found that an abundance of natural resources led to more corruption, regardless of the type of natural resources (e.g.,oil and minerals). Although some studies using 1990s data failed to find such an association (e.g., ====; ====; ====; and ==== suggested that the quality of institutions and governance, such as corruption, influences natural resource dependence indicators such as the ratio of natural resource exports to GDP proposed by ====.==== ==== also questioned the negative impact of oil and mineral wealth on both growth and institutions. ==== argued that the coexistence of positive and negative channels through which natural resources affect economic development can explain the lack of statistical significance of subsoil natural resource reserve variables.====; ====; ====; ====; ====)====. However, cross-country studies have often been criticized for omitting country-specific characteristics. ==== used US data to show that natural resource dependence contributed to poor economic growth, poor developmental performance, and less competitive politics. Others used anecdotes to establish the causality. For instance, ==== showed that before mining, geographical conditions such as ruggedness played important roles in shaping institutions; thus, institutions were established before natural resource extraction took place. ==== presented evidence that oil discoveries increased vote buying and corruption. Meanwhile, ==== argued that the Haber-Menaldo results might not hold for data after the 1980s since oil wealth has blocked democratic transition post-1980s as a result of governments in developing countries capturing oil profits previously siphoned off by foreign firms. ==== used the disintegration of the Soviet Union as a natural experiment to show that natural resource abundance does not lead to poor institutions or lower per capita GDP. ====, in a study quite similar to ours, investigated mining and local corruption in Africa and found that mining increased local corruption.====Previous studies have not investigated the association between natural resource abundance and local corruption in China. The current study fills this gap. This work is important for at least two reasons: first, as the world's largest developing country, China has rampant corruption (====), and its impact on economic development remains understudied; second, a careful intranational investigation can avoid the problem of omitted country-specific characteristics. This paper postulates two (null) hypotheses: (1) whether natural resource abundance is positively correlated with local corruption; and (2) whether mining leads to more rampant local corruption or if local corruption invites mining activities (if the ore reserve is unobservable and mine output is used as the indicator).====This paper focuses on coal mining industry, whose data are the most transparent in China. Our results confirm the positive and robust link between coal output and local corruption (prefecture party secretary) after controlling for various confounding factors. Our instrumental variable regressions establish the causality running from coal mining (natural resource extraction) to the incidence and/or magnitude of local corruption. In one of the robustness checks, using total number of corrupt officials as a dependent variable from all court litigation cases, we find that coal mining positively affected local corruption, confirming the presence of a resource curse. In examining the mechanism of coal mining to take effect on local corruption, we do not find a demand driven mechanism, i.e., the corruption is not a mere byproduct of increased economic boom around the active mines, but directly connected to coal mining. Thus, this study provides clear-cut implications. Abundant natural resources==== in China lead to more corruption at both local-governor and grassroots official levels because the rents generated by mines are easily grabbed by local officials. Our findings echo those of ==== but with the following differences: first, in Africa, mines were initially located in less corrupt areas, but no such pattern was found for China; second, our findings imply an orthodox resource curse.",Corruption as a natural resource curse: Evidence from the Chinese coal mining,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300756,9-Jul-19,2019,Research Article,442

Adaptation actions specific at the national level (====). In China, the policies of the government are focused on the climate change issue (====) and they are designed to reduce carbon emissions (====). According to China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2017), dedicated endeavor has reduced the national carbon intensity by 6.6% during 2015¨C2016 (Z. ====). Moreover, China's use of non-fossil fuel has reduced by 13.3%. These facts exemplify the recent substantial decline in carbon emissions in China (X. ====).====Energy consumption and energy structure, which are the main drivers of carbon emissions (====), have been linked with the rise in global surface temperature (====). In China, the consequence of enormous consumption of coal and inefficient energy use has been huge volumes of carbon emissions (====). To control carbon emissions, many nations have established carbon markets. In 2016, >40 nations, including 20 cities, adopted a definite carbon price in the trade of over 700 million tons of CO2, accounting for 13% of global carbon emissions (====). China established its carbon market to control carbon emissions. Although it represents an efficient means to reduce emissions, further measures should be taken in the near future (====), especially in relation to cooperation among the Chinese provinces (====).====With further development of climate change, carbon emissions efficiency will become a very important index (====; ====). Many previous studies have concentrated on how best to calculate carbon emissions efficiency (====; ====; J. ====; ====). Some research has suggested evaluating this index using carbon emissions per unit GDP (carbon intensity), which can be considered an important national metric (====). However, this index might be most applicable to the situation of developed countries because of their high GDP (R. ====). Consequently, other research has used the MCPI method to determine the 18 nations with the highest carbon emissions, and then the primary influencing factors were established (====). In addition, some research has considered the use of the distance function to calculate carbon reduction costs. Research in China has focused on the need to evaluate national carbon emissions (J. ====). Research in China based on the use of the DEA model to calculate carbon emissions efficiency during 1986¨C2008 found that improving carbon emissions efficiency through innovation was an effective measure (====). It was also established that the difference in carbon emissions efficiency between provinces was attributable mainly to the industrial structure rather than to innovation (====). Some studies have highlighted that the difference between provinces could be very narrow (====). Much of the previous work mentioned above was based on the calculation of carbon emissions efficiency as an independent factor (====) and the closer the regions, the greater the degree of correlation between them. According to this concept, regional carbon emissions efficiency should become less correlated with increasing distance. Carbon emissions, which are largely the undesired byproduct of industrial production and development, reflect energy use efficiency.

Meanwhile, other fundamentals, including the external balance position, export share in the tradable sector, and the stage of development, play roles in determining the effects of FERR. Last, we apply the empirical results to run simulations on China from 1994 to 2007 to highlight the role of FERR in the country's export-led growth.","). The empirical work by ==== indeed finds that the exchange rate regime does not matter for the real exchange rate. In addition, the FERR tends to cause larger damages than a floating regime when negative shocks hit a country (====). On balance, empirical research does not find a robust relationship between the FERR and growth (====); ==== even find that the FERR systematically hurts growth in developing countries. The gap between the reality and the existing literature thus begs a more careful study.====In this paper, we offer a study on how different rates of productivity growth in the tradable and nontradable sector, coupled with nominal wage rigidities, could warrant a role of the FERR in promoting faster growth. In a country on a successful path to full industrialization, labor productivity often grows much faster in its tradable sector than its nontradable sector. In the meantime, its labor market often has slacks, which undermines workers' bargaining power, so nominal wages may not fully rise to respond to productivity growth. As a result, the Balassa-Samuelson effect (BS effect) (====; ====) may be suppressed by the FERR. Compared with a floating regime, the FERR causes real undervaluation, which may in turn promote growth by encouraging more export.==== rate so the profit in the tradable sector increases. Therefore, whether real undervaluation caused by the FERR promotes faster growth depends on the tradeoff between wage losses and profit increases in the tradable sector. To make faster growth possible, undervaluation has to draw more labor into the tradable sector.====We use data provided by the World Development Indicators (WDI) and the Penn World Table 9.0 (PWT9.0) to empirically test our theoretical results. Specifically, we test four hypotheses derived from our model concerning, respectively, the FERR's role in causing real undervaluation, slower rates of wage growth, faster expansion of tradable-sector employment, and its advantage in promoting growth. We also study how the external balance position and the share of export in the tradable sector interact with the FERR to depress the BS effect. In addition, we conduct a comparative study for developed and developing countries. Last, we provide a simulation study for China's export-led growth based on our empirical results.====It is acknowledged in the literature that different definitions of the FERR can lead to very different research results (====). We adopt five definitions of the FERR derived from the exchange rate regime categorization systems provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF); ====; ====; ====; and ====.==== The suppressive role of FERR on the BS effect holds relative to the floating regime under RR and IRR, the two prevailing categorization systems for de facto exchange rate regimes. We also follow ==== to use the exchange regimes of similar countries to form the instrument for a country's exchange rate regime. We arrive at results similar to our original results.====The main methodological novelty of our paper is that we consider a key economic fundamental, namely, faster productivity growth in the tradable sector than the nontradable sector, when we study the role of the FERR. Our approach concurs with ====Our study also differs from some of the other studies on real exchange rate management. For example, ==== assumes that in developing countries there are more distortions in the tradable sector than the nontradable sector. His model then shows how real exchange rate management can serve as a way to overcome those distortions. In contrast, real undervaluation is useful in our case because labor productivity in the tradable sector is progressing more quickly than the rest of the economy. In addition, instead of treating real undervaluation as a ready policy tool, we show how the FERR can serve as a policy tool to cause real undervaluation.====Next, in ==== discusses our data sources and the definitions of the FERR. The empirical results are presented in ====. ==== then conducts simulations on China based on the empirical results. The simulations are useful because China is the most significant and successful case of the export-led growth model in the past three decades. ==== concludes the paper and discusses the policy implications of our results.====Under the floating regime, the exchange rate, IRER, and labor allocation, ====, ====, ==== and ====, are determined by the following system of four equations:====Write ====, ====, ==== and ==== in ====, then ==== is implicitly determined by:====Claim 1: The solution to ====(====) exists.====: Since ==== and ==== (for ==== small enough or ==== large enough), by continuity of ====(====), a solution ==== exists.====Claim 2: ==== decreases with ====, while ==== increases with ====.====: Let ====?=?====?ln?====/====?ln?====, then according to the first-order Taylor expansion of ====(====), we get====Since ====?<?0, ==== decreases with ====.

By building up a dual production structure with oligopolistic competition in urban manufacturing, this paper investigates the distributional and welfare effects of capital market distortions. We find that in the short run, an increase in the capital market distortion in favor of urban firms can lower both the skilled and unskilled wages. However, in the long run, the preferential policy on reducing capital cost to the urban sector attracts new entry of firms, which can worsen the skilled-unskilled wage inequality in the economy. This firm-entry effect of the capital market distortion on wage inequality is empirically confirmed for China.","The uneven economic development between rural and urban sectors is a salient feature observed in many developing economies. As pointed out in the seminal study by ====To facilitate the transformation of the economy toward modernization and urbanization, various preferential policies concerning investments mainly in the urban sector have been implemented by the Chinese government (====). The practice of assisting the urban sector is in line with the famous dictum by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: ¡°Let some people get rich first¡±. ====Due to the great effort introduced during that period, the Chinese economy advanced but with structurally unbalanced growth between state versus private firms, eastern versus western regions, and urban versus rural sectors. Two other related issues concerning high investments in certain areas and large current account surpluses have also been documented (====; ==== suggest that the problem of overinvestments is mainly caused by the repressed factor costs, particularly in the heavily distorted capital market.==== and ====, firms in China face differential access to capital markets. The reduced capital costs are available mainly to urban state-owned enterprises rather than to town and village enterprises in rural areas. Consequently, shortages of investment funds in the rural sector co-exist with sizable low-return investments in the urban sector. Other studies also discover similar patterns in China's capital market by firms, regions and sectors. For instance, ==== find that capital in urban cities, e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjing, has a 20¨C40% lower price than in other cities.====The above mentioned phenomenon in China is consistent with the regional version of the Lucas paradox (==== A similar phenomenon applied by has also been documented in India (====), with substantial interest rate differentials between formal and informal loans in the banking system.====As pointed out in ====, interest rates (especially deposit rates) in China are regulated and capital account is not opened internationally, while financial distortions and frictions exist between state-owned and private-owned firms. Abundant funds with implicit guarantees and reduced costs have been induced toward financing low-return investment projects, while dampening of credit could hurt activities in other sectors of the economy. The misallocation of capital toward the urban sectors has led firms to invest in low-return projects.====The existence of distortions and regulations in the capital market, in addition to the labor market, in developing economies gives rise to misallocation of capital between regions and sectors. Moreover, what have caused the imperfections in the capital market? ====, identifying two sources for capital misallocation by policy-induced distortions specific to regions/sectors and financial frictions specific to firms, concludes that 70% of China's capital misallocation between firms and sectors can be attributed to policy-induced distortions. ==== show that the misallocation of resources across firms could lower GDP of the economy through the reduction in the efficiency of factor productivity in terms of MRPK. Using the MRPK approach, ==== find that resource misallocation causes the aggregate loss of total factor productivity (TFP) in China by a magnitude from 30 to 50%, leading to a reduction of 2% in China's GDP. In a survey article, ==== claim again that misallocation of resources across firms in an economy can lower its aggregate TFP. Recently, ==== suggests that capital misallocation alone can lower China's aggregate TFP by 20% in later 2000s. To mitigate the losses in productivity and hence the reductions in GDP, China has gradually relaxed the policies, such as on the household registration system (====) that restricts labor regional mobility and on strict control over allocation of capital fund cross sectors.====As documented in the literature (e.g., ====), wage inequality in the developing country can be a consequence of the policy-induced labor-market distortion favoring urban workers. Nonetheless, distortions in the capital market are also notable in developing economies like China. By using a dual production structure with oligopolistic competition in urban manufacturing, this paper aims to analyze the distributional and welfare effects of capital market distortions in a developing economy. The contribution of the paper is thus on whether wage inequality could be worsen if a capital market distortion is introduced along with the labor market distortion already existed in the economy. We claim that in the short run with given firms, the increase in the capital market distortion in favor of urban manufacturing firms can lower both the skilled and unskilled wages in the economy. However, the preferential policy, which provides reduced costs of capital to urban firms, can attract new firms to the urban sector in the long run. This firm-entry effect brings another prominent channel to influence wage distribution in the economy, since skilled wages could increase through a higher demand for skilled labor while unskilled wages could fall by an increased cost of capital. Thus, the existence of capital market distortions can worsen wage inequality via the firm-entry effect in the economy.====A decade ago, ==== warned the consequence of repressed factor costs (especially in the distorted capital market) on causing imbalanced growth of firms, industries, regions and sectors. As they noted, the growing imbalance problem in China has not only led to excess capacity by overinvesting in certain industries, such as aluminum, coal, iron and steel, but also caused the deteriorations in China's income equality. The first-best solution to tackle the imbalance problem hence rests on the implementation of market-oriented reforms on factor markets, along with an open capital market in the long run. This paper supports their view on how to achieve a sustainable and balanced growth for the Chinese economy.====This paper is organized as follows. A general-equilibrium model is laid out in ==== for a dual developing economy with a capital market distortion in favor of the urban sector. ==== investigates the income distribution and welfare effects of an increase in the capital market distortion in the short run with a fixed number of urban firms, followed by the long-run situation analysis with entry of urban firms in ====.

If China wants to maximize tax revenues, the direct tax rate should be 35%. We conduct a variety of sensitivity analyses and conclude that the government tax peak is always 5¨C10% earlier than the apex of the Laffer curve. So, if a country has reached the top of the Laffer curve, this paper strongly recommends that tax cuts will have positive implications for the economy and government revenue.","A ==== is a mandatory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or other legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures. Taxation is a very important policy tool. Moreoever, many aspects of taxation affect our lives. Therefore, research on taxation is very important and necessary.====Taxation and the economy are interactive (====; ====). Conditions, growth rate and structure of an economy affect the revenue, growth rate and structure of taxation. Taxation also plays a role in supporting economic growth, structural adjustment, and welfare improvement (====). The issues about tax and economy are always a hot and interesting topic (====). ==== examined dynamic revenue effects of a permanent tax cut on labor and capital income by applying Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. ==== tested whether the 2003 dividend tax cut stimulated corporate investment and increased labor earnings. ==== analyzed the impact of a carbon tax on the Chilean economy using CGE model. ==== confirmed the theoretical prediction: agglomeration forces can reduce firms' sensitivity to tax differentials across locations. ====There is relatively a myriad of literature studying the Laffer curve. We list almost all the studies relative to the Laffer curve. ==== demonstrated that the ¡°Laffer curve¡± phenomenon does not always reflect a conventional income-leisure trade-off through a controlled experiment. ==== believed that, instead of tax rate per se, ¡°transfer-adjusted¡± tax rate is the critical variable in Laffer effect. In recent years, Laffer curve aroused researchers' interest again. ==== found a very flat Laffer curve for all capital taxes, and predicted that total tax revenue would increase by about 0.3¨C1.2% when cut the tax in US. ==== explored the peak of Laffer curves in the US, the EU-14 and individual European countries and they found that the government can increase taxes by up to 30% and 8% in the US and the EU-14, moreover, they found that household heterogeneity may not be important. ==== investigated the Laffer curves in Japan, and indicated that labor tax rate is smaller than that at the peak of the Laffer curve, while the capital tax rate is very close to, or larger than, that at the peak of the Laffer curve. ==== found that dynamic Laffer curves fail to arise incorporating a moderate initial debt level into the model. ==== found that the maximum tax revenue of the two main cities Madrid and Barcelona is obtained at a tax rate of 34%, which results are estimated by means of least squares. ==== established a formula for the revenue maximizing top tax rate is derived as a function of three elasticities, which may be used to predict the top of the Laffer curve. ==== found that the conditions under which a Laffer curve and a green paradox emerge are mutually exclusive in the long run. ==== found that strategic response of noncompetitive enterprises to changes in taxation flattens the Laffer curve by analyzing detail data of retail sales of alcoholic beverages from Pennsylvania.====However, most studies focused on the impact of tax rate on government revenue. Those studies focused on the residents and the government, but to some extent ignored the existence of the enterprises, as well as the whole society. Few studies focused on the impact of labor tax rate on both government revenue and economic performance. Thus, this paper addresses the knowledge gap to analyze the impact of labor tax rate from a more macro perspective. It should be noted that as Laffer curves may be found in tax on labor income or capital income, this paper focuses on the former, or explores the issue using direct tax on labor income as an example.

We find that income inequality has negative impacts on appliance penetration rate across specifications, except for the initial development stage. On average, households start adopting air conditioners at a threshold of over 60,000 (2011 RMB) based on annual income, much higher than TV, fridge and washer (8500¨C9000 RMB). The empirical results validate the S-shape curve of appliance established in the literature. To understand the magnitude of the impact and policy implications, we further simulate the impact of ","China has experienced booming energy consumption growth over the years, with the soaring economy as well as acceleration of industrialization and urbanization. It not only represents a great proportion of the world energy consumption, but also remains to be the driving force of the energy consumption growth in the coming decades. From 2000 to 2016, the total final energy consumption of China has more than doubled, from 781,194?ktoe (1000 tons of oil equivalent) to 1,969,366?ktoe, at an average annual growth rate of 6% (====). With the rapid growth, the energy consumption of China surpassed that of the United States in 2019, where the total final energy consumption fluctuated around 1,500,000?ktoe. By contrast, the total final energy consumption across the world grows at 2%. There is no doubt that China is a main driving force of world's energy growth.====Along with the economic boom and the growing purchase power of the households, the energy consumption in the residential sector has become the second largest energy-consuming sector after the industrial sector. It grows steadily from 14% in 2010 to 16% in 2016 of China's total final energy consumption (====). In comparison, under Chinese government's policy to encourage energy saving and control emission in the 11th and 12th Five-year Plans (====). If we expect Chinese households to catch up with their western counterparts, this gap points to great growth potential. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing residential energy consumption in China is essential for predicting China's energy consumption.====Among the components of residential energy consumption, electricity consumption has more than quadrupled, rising from 12,485 toe to 72,404 toe during 2000¨C2016, rising exceedingly faster than and becoming a larger portion in the total residential energy consumption, with rapid shrinking of biofuels and waste (====). This indicates an ongoing structural shift of residential energy consumption from biofuels and waste to electricity. It has been pointed out that household electricity demand growth is driven by household electric appliances increasingly (====). Meanwhile, the adoption of electric appliances by consumers, especially in urban areas of China, has been astonishing. Thus, learning more about electric appliance will contribute to a more precise prospective of future energy growth in China.====Previous studies have examined an S-shaped relationship between energy-using assets and household income. Based on S-shape, the adoption of appliances only increases after income reaches a certain threshold, below which the income elasticity is very low. The household-level S-shaped relationship has implication for aggregated energy consumption, which is critical for estimation and forecast of total energy demand in the residential sector. If we consider two communities with the same level of average income, the community with extreme income inequality would have lower appliance ownership in total based on the theoretical prediction of S-shape, compared with the community with more even income distribution. As pointed out in ====, most widely used estimation and prediction model use aggregated data that are usually available at provincial level or even country level. Almost all of them neglect the income distribution. ==== shows that the impact of inequality is overall negative, however, it does not illustrate how significant the magnitude is, which makes it difficult to judge whether we should consider the inequality factor in modeling. The panel data at provincial level also limit the total number of observations for analysis, which is improved in our case through using the community level data instead. We examine appliance ownership instead of the direct electricity consumption because electricity consumption is usually not reported in surveys. Even when reported, the number could be less reliable than appliance ownership, which is very straightforward to count. The downside of using appliance ownership is that the usage pattern and technology efficiency could vary when the count of appliance is the same. Nonetheless, accurate understanding of appliance ownership is itself meaningful to energy demand estimation and forecast.====At the macro level, previous literature have established that inequality hinders human capital accumulation and skills development, undermines education opportunities, lowers social mobility, increases social conflicts (e.g. ====) and violent crime levels (e.g. ====), thus ultimately leading to lower economic growth (e.g. ====; ====). At the micro level, there has been evidence showing that increase in income inequality contributes to the rise in household economic distress (====), compared to the inverted-U relationship between inequality and individual happiness (====), as well as between inequality and health (====). ====, in the book ====, examines the trend in income inequality and its boarder consequences.====In addition to the implications to the energy modeling and forecast, this paper also contributes to the general understanding of inequality impact by using appliance penetration rate as a proxy to modern living standards. For urban households living in developed regions such as Beijing and Shanghai, it is almost impossible to imagine living without TV, washer, fridge and air conditioner (AC). These electric appliances provide basic services to modern households, including cooking, entertaining, heating, cooling and cleaning (====; ====). As stated by ====, ¡®Energy practitioners often emphasize that energy is desired not for its own sake, but for the services that it produces¡¯.====More specifically, we use panel data at the community level, from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), to estimate the impact of inequality on appliance penetration rates for TV, fridge, washer and AC. Expanded on the ====, we find that inequality has a negative impact on penetration rates. This relationship holds for most specifications and for most parts in the income distribution. Only for communities at the initial development stage, inequality is shown to have positive effects. These findings are consistent with the S-shape relationship established in the literature (====; ====; ====). By using a wide range of percentiles in calculating the share of population under the income cutoff, we are able to identify income thresholds for appliances adoption: 8500¨C9000 RMB for TV, fridge and washer and >60,000 RMB for AC, based on annual household disposable income (in 2011 RMB).====To understand the magnitudes of the impact, we simulate (i) the effect of poverty alleviation policies and (ii) inclusive versus exclusive growth paths. It is worthwhile to note in advance that both simulations are based on strong assumptions and should be interpreted with caution. With relatively low poverty lines (<3000 RMB, roughly $500 per year), poverty alleviation is shown to have limited impacts on the penetration rates. This suggests that, absent subsidies for appliance adoption, higher poverty lines have to be set, if the poor are expected to catch up in terms of using electricity in daily life.====Given the high growth rate in China, change in income distribution is shown to have negligible effects on penetration rate. This has to be interpreted carefully, as the effect of inequality could be much more substantial for regions and countries with lower income growth rates. This has important implications for the least developed regions in China, as well as less developed countries in the world. For example, in Brazil, which is relatively wealthy but unequal, the government actively pursued policies aimed at reducing poverty and promoting social equality (====). Our results suggest that a more inclusive growth==== path could promote appliance adoptions, which implies that a model that neglects income distribution might underestimate the future penetration rate.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== describes the data, highlights the trends in inequality and appliance penetration and confirms the representativeness of our sample. ==== summarizes the empirical results and ==== concludes and discusses the limitations and future steps.",Household appliance ownership and income inequality: Evidence from micro data in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300707,15-Jun-19,2019,Research Article,447

In such a decision situation, where the marginal benefits of contributing are zero while the costs are positive, the standard model of rational and selfish behavior predicts zero contributions. Contrary to this prediction, however, we observe costly and voluntary contributions to global public goods. There is, for example, a positive demand for green electricity tariffs (e.g., ====; ====) and other studies also show subjects' preferences in contributing their own money in order to realize CO==== emissions reductions (e.g., ====, ====; ====; ====). On the one hand, positive contributions to a global public good are explained by altruistic behavior, such as the ¡°warm glow¡± of giving, image motivation and moral norms. On the other hand, it might be expected that some subjects are willing to contribute only under the condition that others also do so (====; ====). Those subjects' behaviors are conditionally cooperative. A conditionally cooperative subject will only contribute if they can be sure that other subjects in the group will also ¡°bear their share¡± of the costs. However, it remains unclear whether conditionally cooperative behavior can also be observed for the provision of a global public good like climate change mitigation, where the ratio of the marginal benefits and marginal costs of contributing is zero.====China is the world's largest CO==== emitter (9839 Mt. in 2017), and estimates show that, by now, China's CO==== emissions should have reached the same levels as that of the European Union, as measured on a per capita basis (i.e., 7 ton CO====/person, see Global Carbon Project).==== At the same time, China is suffering from air pollution and its associated health problems, such as premature death (====); so this is an important channel through which to address this issue because it affects subjects' well-being (====, ==== emissions by the year 2030 or even earlier (====).====Besides the necessary collective action to mitigate climate change on a global and national level, it is also important to address the issue to what extent (and under which circumstances) individuals are voluntarily willing to contribute to CO==== emissions reduction.

For this purpose, we sold CO==== emissions permits under the Beijing emissions trading scheme (ETS) to a sample of subjects in Beijing.

Our results contrast with conclusions drawn from the traditional growth accounting literature on labour reallocation effects in China because our simulation method allows for endogenous capital accumulation dynamics.","A key feature of China's growth miracle has been the migration of more than 200 million workers from rural to urban areas.

We use counterfactual simulations to determine the importance of labour migration to China's growth both historically and under alternative future growth scenarios.====Consistent with recent growth accounting studies we find that the impact of labour reallocation on TFP growth is relatively small - specifically 0.85 percentage points per year out of China's annual GDP per worker growth rate of 8 percentage points per year. Nevertheless we also find that, once we allow for induced capital accumulation, the impact of labour reallocation on per capita GDP growth is amplified to approximately 1.7 percentage points per year, twice as large as is suggested by growth accounting. Thus we find that the overall effect of labour reallocation on growth is approximately one fifth of China's per capita GDP growth in the past three decades.====We also find, that a relaxation of Hukou would add 1.4¨C2.0 percentage points to China's growth over the next decade. In the context of China's expected slower growth this represents a significant increase. Thus we find that, Hukou reforms could provide an important transitional source of growth as China's economy slows.====The paper is organized as follows.

We find that greater proficiency in Mandarin improves self-reported health, mental health and capacity to perform activities of daily living. We also examine the relationship between Mandarin proficiency and health ==== and the decomposition results show that differences in Mandarin proficiency account for between 2% and 20% of health inequality in urban China, depending on the health indicator. Our results suggest that promoting ¡®standard Mandarin¡¯ can serve as a vehicle to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequality.","Language skills are a significant component of human capital and play an important role in determining an individual's socioeconomic and health status (====; ====). For instance, the role of language proficiency in health outcome production is an integral aspect of bidirectional communication (sender and receiver) abilities that, akin to formal education or number of schooling years, could affect the efficiency with which the patients and the health care practitioners transform communicated information to improved health status. This in turn can be work productivity- and income- enhancing, as health (like education) is human capital.====In 2014 China had a total population of 1.37?billion, accounting for just under one-fifth of the world's population, making it the most populous country in the world (====). The economic reforms, initiated in the late 1970s, have been accompanied by tremendous progress in some key socioeconomic indicators. Life expectancy increased from 66?years in 1980 to 76?years in 2014 (====), while mortality rates for those aged less than five decreased from 62.4 per thousand live births in 1980 to 11 per thousand live births in 2015 (====). The reforms of medical system have built a basic medical insurance system (====). Income growth and mobility have been improved (====; ====) and the returns to schooling have also increased (====). Yet, despite these achievements, in other areas health indicators, such as the health effects of air pollution, show worrying signs.====). The World Health Organization has encouraged countries to reduce health disparities between regions (====). In China, in its ¡®Healthy China 2020¡¯ initiative, the Ministry of Health has stated that ¡®the health equity of people should be set as an indicator to measure social justice and fairness¡¯ (====). Thus, when assessing the factors associated with shaping health status, it is natural also to consider the contribution of these factors to health inequality.====There exist several studies that have examined the relative importance of different SES dimensions in shaping health status in China, such as the impact of education, income and political resources on various health measures (====; ====; ====; ====), adherence with medical advice and satisfaction with medical treatment (====; ====).====We examine the relationship between proficiency in Mandarin and health outcomes as well as the relationship between Mandarin proficiency and health inequality in urban China. To do so, we use longitudinal data from the 2010, 2012 and 2014 waves of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). There are 10 major regional dialects and hundreds of sub-dialects spoken in China (====). ¡®Standard¡¯ Mandarin is championed by the national government as the official language, in order to promote national unity and cohesiveness, as well as to provide a medium to facilitate cultural, economic and political exchanges between China's 56 ethnic groups who all speak their own languages or dialects (====). The development of Mandarin, from the Beijing dialect, as a national language dates back at least to the Republican period. As ==== describes it, ¡®universalized Mandarin [was designed to] facilitate nationwide communication that previously had been stymied by the nation's extensive multilinguality¡¯. Proficiency in Mandarin is important, hence, because ¡®standard¡¯ Mandarin is the common language, which most people understand, albeit to differing degrees. Equally important, as we discuss below, medical training is in standard Mandarin and doctors may not be able to communicate the precise medical terms in the local dialects, particularly, if they are not from that local region.====We contribute to the literature on language and health in three important ways. First, the existing literature has almost exclusively focused on the effect of proficiency in the host language on the health outcomes of immigrants to developed countries. Most studies have examined the effect of proficiency in English on health outcomes of immigrants or ethnic minorities in Canada or the United States (see eg. ====; ====), although there are also studies examining the relationship between host language proficiency and health outcomes for immigrants to European countries, such as Germany and Switzerland (====, ====).====Through focusing on the effect of proficiency in Mandarin on health outcomes in China, we extend this literature in the following novel directions. One is that this is the first study to consider the relationship between language proficiency and health status in a developing country. Another is that this is the first study to consider the relationship between proficiency in the national language and health status for a broad sample of non-immigrants who do not belong to a specific ethnic minority. In most countries, this issue does not arise because the overwhelming majority of the non-immigrant population can speak the national language well. But, this is not the case in a country such as China, in which there are so many dialects and sub-dialects. People using different dialects often have difficulties in communication due to the existence of many grammatical, lexical and phonological differences. It has been noted that in China people who are just 100?km away from their homes can encounter a different, and largely unintelligible, dialect (====). While the common language spoken throughout China is Mandarin, for many people this will be their second language after their dialect. Thus, there can be considerable heterogeneity in ability to speak Mandarin, which, in turn, can have an impact on the ability to access appropriate health care.====A second contribution is that the existing literature on language proficiency and health outcomes has largely overlooked the endogeneity of language proficiency. We employ several approaches to address potential unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality in examining the relationship between Mandarin proficiency and health outcomes. We adopt a two-way fixed effects panel model to control for unobserved time-invariant and time-varying individual characteristics. This also at least partly controls for personality, although we also control for optimism. Moreover, existing evidence has shown that causality between SES and health can run in both directions (====; ====). Health status could adversely affect an individual's language ability through reduced earnings and social interaction (====; ====A third contribution is that this is the first study to specifically examine how differences in proficiency in the national language contribute to inequalities in health. We employ the concentration index (CI) to analyse Mandarin proficiency related inequality in health indicators. This approach has been widely used in previous studies as a standardized tool to quantify the degree of SES-related inequality in health (====; ====). Moreover, we go beyond quantifying the magnitude of CI to explore the contribution of Mandarin proficiency to health inequality using a regression-based approach to decompose CI.====We find that those who speak better Mandarin have better self-reported health (SRH), mental health and are better able to engage in the activities of daily living (ADL). We do not find Mandarin proficiency to be correlated with the incidence of chronic disease. We find that differences in Mandarin proficiency account for between 2% and 20% of inequality in SRH, ADL and mental health.","Health outcomes, health inequality and Mandarin proficiency in urban China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300665,15-May-19,2019,Research Article,451

Besides, the effects of economic policy uncertainty on corporate tax burden are primarily significant in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), non-high-tech firms, firms from the eastern areas and service industry firms. The evidence illustrates that keeping the transparency and stability of economic policies helps to cut tax burden effectively.","Uncertainty about government policies and their potential effects can impose profound impacts on the macro economy, the financial market and firm behavior (====; ====; ====). Since the financial crisis in 2008, national governments around the world have enacted a variety of economic policies as attempts to minimize the impact of the global financial crisis. However, the different potential implementation processes and effects of these policies also increase the economic policy uncertainty (====; ====), employment (====; ====) and economic development (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), increases the risk premium of municipal bonds (====), and causes bank credits to contract or even damages their overall financial function (====). In addition, prior researches indicate that when firms face higher economic policy uncertainty, they will be more conservative in making investment decisions (====; ====) and lower their investment level (====; ====; ====; ====;====; ====), increase cash holdings (====; ====; ====) and reduce leverage ratios (====; ====).====Our study is closely related to the research on the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and corporate tax avoidance. ==== argue that economic policy uncertainty after the election is higher, firms face the risk of significant shifts in the business and tax environment, which might undermine existing tax avoidance strategies. So firms will increase tax avoidance before the election and reduce it after the election. Based on the theory of political relations, ==== find that economic policy uncertainty caused by policy turnover is negatively related to corporate tax avoidance. On the contrary, ==== propose that enterprises will increase tax avoidance to increase cash holdings after new leaders take office. Furthermore, ==== and ==== and ====, the economic policy uncertainty measured by national election or political turnover have some deficiencies as follows. First, they can't measure the short and medium term variations of uncertainty. Second, the election indicator does not capture the variation in policy-related uncertainty in nonelection years, while the policy turnover only measures the economic policy uncertainty at the local government level. In order to address these problems, we use the ¡°Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for China¡± developed by ==== to measure Chinese economic policy uncertainty. It targets to capture uncertainty concerning the current and future policy actions of decision makers as well as the effects. This uncertainty can be about monetary, fiscal, or other regulatory policies (====; ====). The indicator can measure not only the economic policy uncertainty at the local government level and the central government level, but also the short and medium term variations of uncertainty. Besides, we not only identify fiscal pressure as primary channel through which uncertainty affects the intensity of tax collection, but also indentify tax collection as an important channel through which policy uncertainty affects corporate tax burden. Moreover, we introduce tax quotas that have significant influence on transition economies in the research, and find that when tax quotas are higher, the positive effect of economic policy uncertainty on corporate tax burden is stronger. Our findings contribute to the literatures and offer meaningful insights to policy makers: transparency and stability of the economic policies help to cut tax burden effectively.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops our hypotheses. Section 3 introduces data and discusses empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the empirical findings. Section 5 shows the robustness checks.

For producers, the magnitude of such response depends on the operating flexibility. However, the precise; role of operating flexibility in rebound effect is still unknown because of difficulties in measuring operating flexibility. Over the past four decades, the Chinese government has implemented a wide range of reforms aiming at market-oriented transition, which increase operating flexibility of micro-units. It is natural to be questioned whether China's market-oriented reform increases energy rebound effect. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of marketization on rebound effect. Using partially linear functional-coefficient ==== to avoid prior criteria in model specification and smooth the change of rebound effect across regions, we found that about 20% of originally expected energy conservation from energy efficiency improvement would be rebounded in 2013. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that in line with China's uneven reform across regions, coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangdong, have larger rebound effects, which may be connected with their larger operating flexibility. The findings can enhance our understanding on the mechanisms of rebound effect as behavior responses. We also anticipate our paper to provide knowledge and broader implications toward optimal policy designs alongside China's ongoing market-oriented reforms.","Potential energy savings resulting from cost-effective energy efficiency improvements may be less than the originally expected because efficiency-induced price decreases would encourage the consumption of energy services, boost productivity, increase output and potentially impact energy use throughout the whole economy (====). In economics, this phenomenon is usually called rebound effect. Rebound effect has drawn great attention of economists and policymakers because it raises doubts about the role of energy efficiency, and more fundamentally about the role of technological advances, for curbing energy consumption and addressing global warming (====).====There is a growing literature devoting to explore rebound effects in different economic levels such as countries, regions, industrial sectors and household. The existence of rebound effect is widely accepted, but its magnitude is rather controversial. ==== provide some evidence for large rebound effect. On the contrary, ==== claim that the rebound effect for efficiency is over-played, and the magnitude of the direct rebound effect is around 5%¨C10%. ==== review empirical literature and find evidence for the moderate rebound.====The empirical evidence from the existing studies also show great variations of rebound effects in different countries and regions. For example, ==== find that the magnitudes of rebound effects are quite substantial in 55 countries, ranging from 18% for Dominican Republic to 117% for Russia. However, very few studies have attempted to explore the source of variations of rebound effects in different countries and regions.====To understand the variations of rebound effects in different regions, we need to come back to its mechanisms. Rebound effect originates from energy efficiency improvement. The improvement of energy efficiency induces a decrease in the real price of energy service. The producer would respond to this by adjusting their production decisions. First, they would use more energy to substitute for other inputs since energy becomes cheaper. Second, the decline of energy service price would lower their production cost which in turn leads to the decrease in product price. Consequently, it simulates product demand which requires the producer to consume more energy.====The mechanism that flexibility affects rebound effect have been well discussed in the literature (====; ====), however as far as we know, few studies have empirically explored this mechanism. The major challenge to analyze the above issue comes from the difficulty in measuring operating flexibility. It is widely believed that the operating flexibility of economic agents directly links to the market system (====; ====). The degree of marketization would influence the operating flexibility of the firms which in turn affects the rebound effect. Taking an extreme example, if the production decisions of firms come from the government, producers cannot adjust the output and other inputs (labor and capital) in response to change in energy efficiency, thereby inducing no rebound effect (As shown in ====, the production activity moves from Point A==== to Point B====).====Over the past four decades, the Chinese government has implemented a wide range of reforms aiming at market-oriented transition. With the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy, operating flexibility of micro-units in the transition economies would have been increased gradually. It motivates us to empirically explore how China's market-oriented reform impact energy rebound effect. One of typical features of China's reform is that marketization is particularly uneven in China's regions (====). It also provides us with an opportunity to examine whether the variation in China's regional rebound effect can be explained by the diversity in China's regional marketization.====, ====, ====, and ====, etc. However, this approach has been criticized as it requires two strong assumptions that energy price does not impact on energy efficiency and changes in energy price and energy efficiency are symmetrical (====). In view of this, we follow ====.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides an overview of the market-oriented transition in China. In ====, we introduce the methodology in details. ==== presents the empirical analysis and discussions. ==== concludes the paper.====In literature, researchers have developed several indicators to measure economy-wide energy efficiency. For example, ==== developed a total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) indicator based on the Shephard input distance function. ==== and ==== introduced similar indicators based on the Shephard energy distance function. ==== compared the Shephard energy distance function and the traditional Shepard input distance function, and concluded that the former is more suitable for measuring energy efficiency.====Conceptually, the aforementioned indicators measure the energy efficiency as the ratio of the theorectical minimum energy input to the real energy input at the given period. In this sense, these indicators are static indicators which cannot reflect the change of production technology (the shift of production frontier). In view of this, ====, ====, and ==== proposed dynamic indicators which consider both pure energy efficiency change and energy technological progress. Following this strand of literature, this paper measures energy efficiency as describes as follows.====Referring to ==== and ====, we consider a neoclassical production framework. Suppose there are ==== assessed decision-making units (DMUs) and each of them uses capital (denoted by ====), labor (denoted by ====) and energy (denoted by E) to produce desirable outputs (denote by ====). We can use the following equation to describe the production technology at the period ====:====Based on the sequential DEA technique,==== we can formulate the production technology as:====Following ==== and ====, we define the Shephard energy distance function as:====The Shephard energy distance function requires reducing energy input as much as possible within the production possible set while leaving other input and output unchanged. Similar to ====, we define the period-wise dynamic energy performance index (PDEPI) as:====The Eq. ==== measures the change in energy efficiency performance between time period ==== and ====+1. It consists of two components: change in energy use efficiency (namely, pure energy efficiency change, denoted by PEECH) and technological change alongside the energy direction (ETECH):====In the chaining analysis where ====?=?1,?¡­?, ====, the DEPI series for DMU ==== is defined as:==== tracks the change of energy efficiency of DMU ====. A ====of 1.2 can be interpreted as the 20% improvement of energy efficiency compared the based period (namely, ====?=?1).====To calculate ====, we first need to estimate the Shephard energy distance functions. This can be easily done through linear programming techniques (See ==== for more details). Data on labor (L) and output (Y) are obtained from the CSMAR database. Data on energy are obtained from China Energy Statistics Yearbook. Data on capital stock (K) are obtained from ====. Nominal variables have been deflated into 1978 constant prices.

To understand the origins of persistence, specifically, why some students learn more than do others, researchers have identified certain sources of the problem. Few studies, however, have paid attention to the role that low levels of cognitive development of students play in their academic performance. To address this gap, this study focuses on the role that cognition may play in terms of the academic achievement of rural students. We analyze data from more than 10,000 primary school students from private migrant schools in Beijing and Suzhou and from public rural schools in Henan and Anhui, using the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test. Our results show high rates of developmental delay (about 33% of the students have Ravens scores that are less than one ==== lower than an international mean). Further, the rates of delay are large among all subgroups in the study, including rural children who attend migrant schools in cities and those who live in rural areas and attend rural public schools. The results also suggest that the cognition of students is highly correlated with their educational performance and, in fact, is by far the most important factor in their academic achievement.","The literature shows that, among rural children across China, there are large gaps in learning (====). Research that uses learning data that are representative of rural children across China shows that the distribution of academic achievement is quite flat (====). Specifically, research has shown that there are many students who have high levels of learning when they are in primary school as well as many students in which learning levels are substantially lower (====). Other research finds that more than half of the primary school-aged children in rural areas of China are not ready for the next stage of their education (====). Finally, ==== and ==== show divergence in learning among students in rural junior high schools.====To understand these differences among students, researchers have identified a variety of factors. Notably, the education system puts rural children at a disadvantage at different points in the educational process. Some schools have certified, highly educated teachers, while others have poor quality, temporary contract teachers (====; ====). Further, health and nutrition problems plague some rural elementary school students in China¡¯s impoverished regions (====). The quality of boarding facilities also has been shown to have a negative impact on the learning of the large share of rural students who live at school during the week (====).====Although research has focused on these systemic factors (both inside and outside of China), scant attention has been paid in the literature in China to the lifelong importance of the development of high levels of cognition and language ability early in a child¡¯s life. In contrast, there is a large and growing literature internationally (====; ====; ====). ====, for example, show strong correlations between low levels of cognition in 2- to 3-year-olds and their later school performance and eventual attainment. In a systematic review, Nores and Barnett reviewed a total of 38 control studies and 30 intervention studies in 23 countries and found that children in a variety of countries receive sustained cognitive, behavioral, health, and schooling benefits from early childhood interventions focused on improving those development outcomes. The underlying argument is that a child¡¯s cognition and certain other skills are largely developed when a child is young, e.g., before reaching the age of 3 years (====). If a child is developmentally delayed when young, the delays can persist through school age and into later in life.====In China, an emerging literature has shown that there may be a large share of rural children who experience developmental delays in early childhood. Although studies have found that samples of urban infants and toddlers appear to have normal development (====; ====; ====), the same is not true for rural children. ==== found that 54% of children in rural mountainous communities; 48% in rural plains communities; and 42% in migrant communities, urban communities where rural families live, are developmentally delayed (<-1 SD). Likewise, testing also shows high levels of language and social-emotional delays (====). Assuming that the samples in the studies are representative of large areas of rural China, as the authors argue, this could mean that one of the reasons for the education gaps among rural students is low levels of cognition when they are young (e.g., 0¨C3 years old). To our knowledge, however, there have not been any studies that empirically assess the role that low levels of cognitive development play among primary school children in the context of the poor educational attainment in rural China.====To address this gap, this study aims to estimate the influence of cognitive development on levels of educational performance of rural elementary school students in China. To meet the study¡¯s objectives, we collected data on more than 10,000 Grades 3 and 4 primary school students who were attending 119 schools in migrant and rural communities across China. Specifically, the sample covers 59 private migrant schools in Beijing and Suzhou and 60 public rural schools in the Henan and Anhui Provinces. In addition to collecting data about student and family characteristics and administering students standardized academic achievement tests in math, we used the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test to measure the level of cognitive ability (or IQ) of the sample students. Using these data, we conduct several empirical exercises. First, we develop a measure of the prevalence of students who suffer from cognitive delays, defined as having an IQ of 1 SD less than the international norm. Second, we identify student and family characteristics that are associated with high versus low levels of IQ. Third, we test the correlation between IQ and student academic performance, while holding constant other factors and controlling for school and class fixed effects. Finally, we examine the magnitude of the coefficients to assess the relative strength of the associations between IQ and other factors and their relationship with student academic performance in math.====, and school performance. Indeed, according to our findings, if two children have IQs that vary by 1 SD, their math scores vary by more than 0.32 SD. When this result is coupled with the high proportion of rural children who are developmentally delayed, we believe that this is evidence that the differences in cognitive outcomes among rural students is an important factor in the education gap between the relatively high- and low-performing rural students.====This study makes several contributions. Although there is research that explore the sources of the gaps in education among rural students, to our knowledge, there is no research that focuses on the role of poor level of cognitive development of rural students. To do this, we first show, in representative samples of rural students that are drawn randomly from schools in two different schooling environments, that large proportions of rural students have cognitive delays. We then show strong correlations, holding a large number of other variables constant, between these levels of delays and the performance of students on a standardized math test. We demonstrate that the strength of the association between cognitive delay and poor academic performance is much stronger than are other determinants of academic performance, such as preschool attendance, family wealth, or parental education. Although future research still needs to focus on fully identifying the causal effect of student cognitive abilities on school performance, the evidence in this paper is sufficiently novel and important to constitute a contribution to the literature.====In reading this paper, we caution the reader with one important caveat. It is possible that other factors, which we have not included in the analysis (such as non-cognitive personality traits), that have been shown to be correlated with IQ and also an explanatory factor for schooling outcomes, may be important (and need to be studied in the future¡ª====). However, the literature also is clear that ¡°skills begets skills¡± (====, page 32). When a child¡¯s cognition does not develop fully when a child is young, it affects the formation of non-cognitive skills. Hence, in this sense there is a strong developmental tie between low IQ and poor schooling outcomes.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In ====, the levels of cognition of elementary school-aged children are presented, and comparisons are made between three types of students: the children of migrants who are living with their parents and attending school in the cities (====), children who are living in rural areas with their parents (children living with their parents, ====), and children who are living in rural areas with a relative while their parents live and work in the city (left-behind children, ====). In ====, we present the estimation strategy for the analysis of the descriptive (univariate) correlates with IQ and the relationship between IQ and educational performance. ==== presents the results of the multivariate analysis that measures the conditional relationship between IQ and school educational performance, and, finally, ==== concludes the paper.","Better cognition, better school performance?

However, this period has also been accompanied by extensive grassland degradation in China, which has raised the question of whether a tragedy of privatisation has occurred. This paper investigates the impact of land tenure reform on the changes in grassland condition, using data from 60 counties in Inner Mongolia between 1985 and 2008. A fixed effects model is employed to control for time-invariant factors. Two alternative model specifications in terms of land tenure reform and time-variant factors are conducted to verify the robustness of the estimation results. The results show that land tenure reform did not affect the grassland condition significantly, and the major drivers of grassland degradation include the land use change and the increase in market demand (meat prices). Thereby, we provide empirical evidence that the privatisation of grasslands did not cause grassland degradation in Inner Mongolia, China.","The tragedy of the commons, a concept based on the case of grassland use presented by ==== ¡®freedom in the commons brings ruin to all¡¯, has long been part of the conventional wisdom in ecology, economics and political science (====). The essence of Hardin's theory was that resources held in common, such as pastures, oceans, rivers and air are subject to massive degradation due to the overuse by individuals (====; ====). Theoretical research contended that the degradation of common resources was inevitable unless the commons were either privatised or maintained as common land with clear rights of entry and use (====). Similarly, in the theorem of property rights (====), a clear assignment of property rights is proposed as a precondition for economically efficient resource allocation and environmental sustainability. As a consequence, the privatisation of property rights or use rights over resources has been implemented widely by governments around the world (====; ====; ====; ====). This privatisation trend is observed both in Inner Asia and Africa regarding the reform of grassland tenure (====; ====; ====).====; ====; ====). Many studies questioned Hardin's theory and provided evidence of users being able to restrict access to the common resource and establish rules among themselves for its sustainable use (====). Some scholars (e.g. ====; ====) found that traditional common use systems of grasslands often met the criteria for sustainable Social-Ecological Systems (====), such as the exclusion of outsiders and the self-organization of resource users (====; ====). A growing number of academic studies criticises the effects of the prevailing privatisation of grassland property rights or use rights on the grassland condition. In this regard, some studies ¨C especially those based on the theory of equilibrium versus non-equilibrium grassland systems ¨C assert that grassland privatisation puts an end to mobile pastoralism by introducing inflexible boundaries and identify this as a main driver for grassland degradation (e.g. ====; ====; ====). Contrary to the well-known ¡°tragedy of the commons¡±, the existence of ¡°a tragedy of privatisation¡± has been claimed (====; ====). In this view, it suggests that the privatisation of grassland property rights or use rights resulted in grassland fragmentation, which has impeded the mobility, flexibility and reciprocity of grassland use (====; ====; ====). However, mobility is a way to make sustainable use of grasslands by pastoralists, both economically and environmentally, as a response to strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity in resources of grassland and livestock nutritional needs (====; ====). Flexibility can be an important risk management strategy and cope with spatial variability of vegetation and vulnerability of grasslands (====). Reciprocity of social relationships at different scales (among households, villages or regions) in terms of access to grazing and other productive resources supports the mobility and flexibility of resource management strategies (====; ====). ====, using satellite images, revealed that grassland degradation was much less severe in Mongolia ¨C which kept the common use system for grasslands ¨C than in the Russian and Chinese parts of Inner Asia where the privatisation of grassland property rights or use rights was implemented. Nevertheless, these arguments are mainly based on a qualitative analysis or a simple quantitative comparation without considering the impacts from other factors. Empirical studies have been barely conducted to verify ¡°the tragedy of privatisation¡±. Therefore, our paper aims to provide empirical evidence of whether there is ¡°a tragedy of privatisation¡± existing in the case of China's grasslands.====Grassland degradation has been a worldwide problem in recent decades. It has been illustrated that about 40% of global grasslands experienced degradation between 1982 and 2006, based on the long-term data of remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for global land degradation (====; ====; ====). ==== estimated that about 20% of global pasture and 73% of the grasslands in the drylands have been degraded. According to Chinese governmental reports, 10% of the total area of grasslands was degraded in the 1970s, increasing to 30% in the 1980s and 50% in the middle of the 1990s (====). By the 2000s, about 90% of the grasslands were degraded to various extents, with significant regional variation (====; ====). Grass production per hectare has decreased about 40% since the 1950s, and weeds and poisonous grasses have thrived at the expense of high-quality species (====). The manifestation of grassland degradation involves a reduction in the extent of grass cover, a reduction in the density of grass cover, a reduction in the output of forage material, an increase in unpalatable grass species, an increase in soil compaction, changes in plant functional groups or a combination of all of them (====; ====; ====). An important and far-reaching question for us is whether land tenure reform is one reason for China's grassland degradation.====In China, land tenure reform started with the Household Production Responsibility System in the cropland areas in the late 1970s and spread to the pastoral areas by the early 1980s (====). The land tenure reform in the pastoral areas aims at privatizing use rights of grasslands to individual households and displacing traditional common use (====). It is noted the grassland privatisation in this paper mean that the use rights of grasslands are contracted to individual households for a duration of 30¨C50?years. Some differences have been observed in the tenure reform of grasslands among the provinces. For instance, the grasslands tenure reform started in Inner Mongolia in 1982, Ningxia in 1983 and Heilongjiang in 1984 (====). Furthermore, the privatisation of grassland use rights in some provinces was ahead of the national decision about the tenure reform of grasslands, as the first Grassland Law of China was introduced only in 1985. Nevertheless, it is reported that most of the grasslands in China have experienced various degrees of degradation since the 1980s (====). The concurrent deteriorating grassland condition has led to policy debates on whether the land tenure reform caused the grassland degradation in China (====).====Climate change and human activities are commonly found to be the main driving forces of worldwide grassland degradation (====; ====; ====; ====). ==== showed that, in the case of South Africa, the grassland condition deteriorated with the introduction of privatisation. Although some studies exist that discuss the impact of the land tenure reform on the grassland condition in China (e.g. ====; ====), there is a lack of empirical analysis based on long-term data on a large-scale (====). This paper addresses this gap and uses information on the changes in grassland condition and progress of the land tenure reform in a typical pastoral area in China over a relatively long period (1985¨C2008) to estimate the effect of land tenure reform on the grassland condition. Grassland condition is measured by using spatial information based on remote sensing technology. Estimating a fixed effects model, our results show that the land tenure reform has had no significant impacts on the grassland condition. In other words, the analysis shows that the privatisation of grasslands is not a driver of China's grassland degradation, which provides the empirical evidence against the existence of ¡°a tragedy of privatisation¡±.====In the following sections, we first provide background information about the grassland tenure reform in China, including the progress in the assignment of formal use rights and the actual private use of grasslands. Next, the materials of our empirical research are described, and the empirical model is presented. After that, the consistent model results under two model specifications are reported and discussed. We conclude with remarks about the privatisation of grasslands in China and the related policy implications.==== presents the estimated results under the Eqs. ====, ==== that include the variable of the growth rate of livestock population. The coefficients of the variables of land tenure reform are still not significant in all the models. The model results in ==== are consistent with that in ====, ==== of Eqs. ====, ====.

In this study, the Difference-in-Differences estimation method is used to examine the impact of the SSCA reform on residents' participation in community governance. With residents' participation as the mediating factor, the mediating effect model is used to study the impact of the reform on community debts risk (CDR). When the household, community, and economic variables are controlled, the probability of residents in communities that have undergone reform being willing to participate in community governance is 5.6% higher than those in communities that have not. The results are significant at the 5% level. In terms of CDR, the SSCA reform has significantly reduced the debts¨Cassets ratio by 7.9%. These findings have passed a series of robustness tests. This conclusion provides new ideas for promoting communities' democratic participation and debts risk management.","The reform of the shareholding system for collective assets (SSCA) was implemented in 2015 and is still being extended to more areas. Prior to the SSCA reform and as early as the 1990s, there had been the restructuring of township enterprises and reforming of the property rights system for rural collective assets. However, many problems exist in the reform of the property rights system for collective assets, which treats the community as the basic unit. Examples included the lack of a definite status of the legal entity, the issue of cadre economics caused by village cadres having control over power, and the lack of capital management and operational capabilities within the collective economic organizations (====; ====). The problem could be attributed to the method by which the collective property rights were divided between collective ownership and members' shareholdings, and especially the means by which to expand and improve the rights associated with those shares.====The SSCA reform implemented in 2015 focused on clarifying the possessory rights and usufruct of shareholdings in collective assets.==== The ownership of collective assets is the right of community members to participate in the distribution of shares, as well as the ability to control and allocate affirmed shares. With usufruct, collective members are entitled to dividends from their shareholdings based on the business status of the collective assets. In other words, the collective assets are quantified and divided into shares for distribution to community members, thereby increasing the property incomes of residents. This reform made it easier for residents to participate in community governance by granting them more rights. Political scholars have always regarded citizens' political participation as the concept that interrelates the citizens and the democratic polity, meaning that the latter is a prerequisite for political participation. In addition, ordinary citizens should have the rights to select their leaders (====).====Among the theories on citizens' political participation, the more widely applied include the totalitarian authority model and the interest group theory. The model emphasizes the mobilization and control of citizens by the power holders or political elites, and had extremely high social recognition in the 1950s¨C60s. Political control weakened by the end of the 20th century and with the ending of the Cold War. This led scholars to believe that all sectors of society play extremely important roles in political participation, while the masses began to care about and pursue their own vital interests (====). Citizens' political participation not only gives them the opportunities to lodge appeals and protect their personal interests, but also has the important roles of maintaining a relationship of mutual trust between the government and the citizens, and ensuring that the government is executing its administrative tasks legally (====).====To date, many problems persist with regard to citizens' political participation, such as low participation rates and an imperfect mechanism for participation (====). The main form of participation was citizens being acted upon. After examining the factors that affect citizens' participation, scholars have found that apart from the institutional, economic, and cultural factors at the macroscopic level, the main problems occur between the community and the masses at the microscopic level. For example, the sense of belonging by the masses to the community was lacking, the community's existing management system had imperfections, the residents did not have sufficient interest-driven motivations, and the channels for residents' participation were inadequate (====; ====; ====). The core issues included the linking of interests between a community and its residents, as well as lacking of the sense of community identity (====; ====). Although scholars have proposed a series of methods to increase residents' participation, these were largely limited to changes in form. A breakthrough that substantively links the interests of the residents and the community was still missing. The SSCA reform was precisely that much-needed approach for expanding democratic participation.====Collective assets affect residents' participation in two ways. First, residents have usufruct. Community members can obtain dividends from the collective assets, thereby increasing their property incomes. This was one of the reform's purpose. By interest-driven, community members will actively monitor the way that community manages and uses the collective assets. Second, community members have possessory rights of the collective assets, while the community committee (village/neighborhood committees) only has execution rights. This leads to the formation of a fuzzy client¨Cagent relationship between the residents and the community. Residents are then obliged to participate in the supervision of community management to prevent the agent problem.====On the other hand, grassroots self-governing organizations (referred to as ¡°communities¡± in China) are different from government ministries and departments. Despite not having any political power, communities must accept work instructions from the township government, assist the government in the execution of projects, and organize the villagers to complete various tasks assigned by the township government. In this sense, the community represents the interests of the community members. This was especially the case after publication of the ==== (CPC), which proposed the four democracies of village self-governance, namely democratic elections, decision-making, management, and supervision. The community is thus treated as the basic unit for the realization of democratic participation.====The 2016 data of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) indicated that the average value of communities' collective assets was as much as 5 million RMB. An important topic in community governance has always been the identification of the means by which to organize and manage collective assets, so as to reduce operational risks and generate additional revenues. Since democratic participation or supervision is the most fundamental way to improve the quality of collective asset management within communities, the intention of the SSCA reform is to motivate residents to participate in community governance. At the same time, communities are made to accept supervision by community members, develop and enhance the value of collective assets, reduce financial risks, and strive to increase the returns from collective assets, so that community members can enjoy higher returns. Since scholars in the field of community financial management generally pay attention to debts risk, this study had selected it as the research focus for the communities.====To date, the academic community has made multiple attempts to define the factors affecting debts risk. First is the economic factor, which includes economic growth, fiscal revenue, and weakening of a community's collective economy (====; ====; Survey on Rural Debts in China, 2009). Last but most effective is the management factor. Examples include encouraging local governments to establish information disclosure systems (====; ====), unreasonable mechanisms of rural governance, and poor awareness of democracy among community members (====; ====). This being the case, effective democratic management of community members is an important factor in the reduction of community debts risk (CDR). Therefore, this study focused on the ways by which CDR was affected by the political participation of community members, through their roles in democratic supervision and management.====The data used in this study were obtained from the China Household ==== Survey (CHFS) and China Grassroots Governance Survey (CGGS) conducted in 2015 and 2017. Both databases were published by the China Household Financial Survey and Research Center, and facilitated sample matching at the individual, family, and community levels. The control group comprised communities that did not undergo the SSCA reform in both 2015 and 2017, which accounted for 95.7% of the total number of communities; the experimental group included communities that did not undergo the SSCA reform in 2015 but had done so by 2017, which accounted for 4.3%. The DID estimation method was first used to examine the reform's impact on political participation by the community members, which showed a significantly positive relationship. Next, community members' political participation was treated as a mediating factor in the reduction of debts risk. The mediating effect model was then used to study the reform's impact on CDR.====A series of robustness tests were further carried out. First, members of the control group were randomly divided into virtual control and experimental groups for falsification tests. Second, similar dependent variables were substituted. The main dependent variable for residents' participation was their willingness to participate in community governance. In addition, residents' level of attention to community affairs and their level of satisfaction with community services were selected for robustness tests. Third, the top 25% of communities in terms of assets and incomes were chosen as the experimental group for falsification tests. This was because the higher levels of government were more likely to select those communities with high asset values and good incomes for the reform. Fourth, after ====, the resultant range of common values was subjected to DID regression. Fifth, a fixed effect model was used to reduce the unobservable heterogeneity in the samples.====The findings indicate that when the household, community, and economic variables were controlled, the probability of residents in communities that had undergone reform being willing to participate in community governance was 5.6% higher than those in communities that had not. The results were significant at the 5% level, and passed a series of robustness tests. For CDR, a community's debts¨Cassets ratio (DAR) was used as the main dependent variable to process the samples as a community-level panel before regression using the DID model. After controlling the community and economic variables, the SSCA reform was found to have significantly reduced the DAR by 7.9%, with the findings having passed various robustness tests. Heterogeneity mainly referred to the differences in impact that the reform had on residents' participation at the individuals' level. The following demographic groups were found to be more active in terms of residents' participation in community governance: the middle-aged, those with lower educational qualifications, those earning lower incomes, and females.====In summary, this study made contributions in several aspects. First, survey data at the national level were used to test the policy effectiveness of the SSCA reform. The findings were more representative and stochastic than that of previous studies, which focused on surveys done at the level of a single county or city. Second, the DID identification method was used to study the impact of the reform on two dimensions: residents' behaviors (in terms of participation) and CDR. Changes to property rights arising from the reform were found to be important breakthroughs in achieving a win-win situation between personal interests and the community's collective interests. Third, the study examined the impact mechanism by which the reform reduced CDR, and the mediating effect model was used to discuss the effect of residents' participation in community governance as a transmission mechanism for CDR management.","Reform of the shareholding system for collective assets, residents' participation, and community debts risk",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300495,9 April 2019,2019,Research Article,458

After early work focusing on the effects of European colonization,==== the subsequent literature has branched in many directions, for example, the rise of Europe (====; ====), the consequences of the slave trade for African development (====; ====), and the current effects of pre-colonial African institutions (====).====Most of these studies focus on the fact of historical persistence itself, aiming to disentangle the effects of a historical event per se from the more prosaic hypothesis that geography or some other persistent variable had effects in both historical times and today. ==== provides a fascinating example, showing that regional and functional patterns in colonial government spending in West Africa match current patterns. She provides convincing evidence that the adventitious features of colonial policy are important determinants of spending today. But when searching for mechanisms that might explain why history has such persistent effects, ==== stops at a conclusion similar to that of many papers, ¡°I do not have a clear explanation for the persistence of public investments.¡±====This is exactly the point that ==== stresses when examining future directions for research: ¡°Moving forward, the second major task for the literature to tackle is to better understand channels of causality. In the past decade, we have made significant progress empirically testing whether historical events have lasting impacts¡­.What is less clear is exactly why it matters.¡± The central goal of this paper is to contribute to Nunn's second task, to help understand the mechanisms of persistence in one historical case.====Our example is afforded by regional patterns of joint ventures (JVs) in early post-reform China. China's history offers three distinctive features that allow us to generate insights from these patterns. First, in the 19th and early 20th centuries many cities in China were colonized by Western powers.==== The colonists established their own institutions in the colonial cities, following their own domestic models. These institutions varied significantly across Chinese colonial cities and were far different from indigenous Chinese institutions, which held sway in a majority of cities. Second, Chinese professionals living in the colonial cities accumulated human capital that was complementary to the different types of institutions set up by the colonial powers. Third, the convulsive first eight decades of the twentieth century destroyed virtually all formal institutions relevant to the conduct of day-to-day legal matters connected to business issues. And the post-1978 reform years saw no efforts to revive those old institutions.====Remarkably, when China opened up to foreign investment in 1978, after three decades of minimal contact with foreigners, firms from former colonial powers had an affinity for the former colonial cities of their country. In our empirics, we establish this affinity, examining JV location choices across 205 Chinese cities. To accomplish this, we use a unique data set on all JVs established in China between 1979 and 1996. We estimate a conditional logit model that captures the choices of Western firms as they deliberated on which Chinese cities to invest in.====We follow ====, ==== in identifying four broad categories of mechanisms of persistence¡ªinstitutions, human capital, culture, and path dependence in selection among multiple equilibria. We examine selection among multiple equilibria by exploiting the fact that the colonial powers not only had colonial cities but also divided the complete territory of China into spheres of influence. The defining characteristic of a sphere of influence (outside the colonial cities) was the commonly agreed principle that, within its own sphere, a specific country was to be favored in any economic activities that involved foreigners. We find no evidence that historical patterns in sphere of influence match the patterns in JV location during the 1980's and 1990's and therefore reject the multiple-equilibrium hypothesis.====The hypothesis that the patterns of JV location can be explained by persistence in formal economic institutions can be quickly dismissed. Colonial institutions were completely eradicated more than three decades before the beginning of reforms. The set of formal institutions at the beginning of reforms¡ªwhen colonial effects on JV location were already present¡ªwas based on a non-market model that hardly could have reflected any element of the old colonial institutions. Additionally, Western-style market-oriented institutions¡ªwhich did have the possibility of imitating the old colonial institutions¡ªwere created very slowly, not having developed enough to have any significant effect in the period covered by our data. We therefore examine whether human capital and culture provide the explanations for the effects of the colonial past.====JV location could be affected by relative transaction costs in different locations,==== which are a product of underlying factors such as complementarity between human capital in the Chinese city and the firm's human capital. Given the importance of legal expertise in establishing joint ventures, one type of relevant human capital is that relating to legal matters. Thus, if some memories of colonial legal matters survived in the city, then it could affect the stance of city officials in a manner recognizable to investors from the city's former colonial power. We examine this hypothesis in three ways.====First, we divide city-country colonial pairs into those that had civil-law colonial legal institutions and those that had common-law colonial legal institutions. As the tradition of codification and interpretation is more compatible with the more centralized political system dominating China's history (Li 2003), we hypothesize that civil-law legal human capital would resonate more with China's civil-law regime (under both the Guomindang and the PRC) and thus would survive longer than common-law legal human capital.==== Consistent with this, the effect of a colonial tie is larger for civil-law city-country pairs than for common-law ones.====Second, we examine whether this human-capital complementarity occurs when the legal type of the colonial institutions of the city matches the legal type of the firm's country, even though there was no city-country colonial tie. We find evidence for complementarity within these non-colonial legal ties¡ªfirms from civil-law countries have an affinity for cities that had civil-law colonial regimes implanted by any colonial power.==== The analogous effect is not present for common law.====Third, we examine whether this complementarity between the human capital of a city and that of a firm is more important in those sectors where transaction-cost problems loom larger, and therefore where legal-human-capital complementarities are more important. Those sectors are ones that use contracts intensively or have a greater need for external financing (====; ====). We find that both colonial ties and non-colonial legal ties are especially important in these sectors, confirming the importance of legal complementarities between firm and city.====We also examine the interaction between colonial ties and the nature of the JV's output by examining differences in the colonial-tie effects for three product types: services, differentiated goods, and standardized goods. That effect is strongest in the service sector, which is plausible given that a service sector JV is most likely to have a large proportion of sales in the city of its location. Then, there are two possible reasons. First, there could be local cultural affinity for products associated with an old colony. Second, there might be human-capital complementarities between the firm and the potential buyers of the service. Crucially, the service-product effect is found for both colonial and non-colonial legal ties. These results cannot be explained by general cultural affinity alone since only the human-capital hypothesis¡ªand not the cultural one¡ªis applicable in the case of non-colonial ties.====Finally, we examine the influence of general cultural familiarity, using data on the size of each Western country's presence in the colonial cities at the beginning of the twentieth century. The effect of colonial population is consistently statistically significant but rather unimportant economically. Had these results shown colonial population to be of large importance in addition to the colonial tie effect, then we would have been forced to conclude that general cultural affinity is important. But this is not the case, consistent with our emphasis on the effect of inherited human capital.====Thus, the principal conclusion of our paper is that inherited human capital is the major pathway explaining the colonial-tie effect. The empirical findings, however, do not allow us to test whether it is the Chinese officials who received the inheritance or citizens of the country of the Western JV partner. But substantial legal education received by Chinese individuals during the colonial period, both from abroad and at home, suggests that the inheritance on the Chinese side may be important. Perhaps, memories of colonial law were still present in Chinese cities and perhaps memories of how to apply law in China were present among the Western citizens.====In addition to its contribution to the more general research on historical persistence, our paper also adds to a growing literature on persistence within China. ==== shows that the old Chinese treaty-port system has impacted economic development to this day. ==== provide empirical evidence that the spread of Protestantism in the early twentieth century generated significant positive effects on long-term economic growth, educational development, and health care outcomes. And, ==== find that the degree of family control of a business is associated with whether the region was administered by Great Britain in the late Qing Dynasty.====Because these papers on persistence in China do not identify specific mechanisms, our results can add insights to their findings. For example, since there is a considerable degree of overlap between the cities that had treaty ports and those that were colonies, our results might help explain those patterns emphasized by ====. Similarly, given that we find greater importance of inherited human capital in industries with higher contract intensivity, our results could provide justification for the methodology of ==== argue that Protestantism has lasting effects through improvements in education and health care outcomes, and these are sectors where human-capital inheritance could be important.====Additionally, our paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of the location of JV's in China, which has in fact helped to guide our empirical specifications. We find that our results are complementary with several existing papers. ==== and ==== use conditional logit to examine the effects of institutions on the location of US investment across provinces. In contrast to our investigation, they focus on a later time period after the new institutions of post-reform China had time to develop. Using similar methods and data as in their earlier study, but adding several FDI source countries, ==== show that the effect of institutions is more important for host countries that are more distant culturally from China. ==== examine FDI at the province-industry level, endorsing the importance of agglomeration and institutional effects. Closest to our paper is that of ==== in emphasizing the historical roots of current investment (and trade) patterns by showing that Japanese trade and investment is less in those areas in which the deaths in the Sino-Japanese conflict were highest.==== Since such deaths were higher outside the Japanese colonial areas, the results of ==== are complementary with those we present below.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In ====, we describe the pertinent colonial and legal history of China. In ====, we describe the formal structure of the conditional logit model that captures FDI location choice. ==== describes our dataset along with details of all other variables used in the analysis. In ====, we establish the affinity between Western firms and the former colonial cities of their own country. ==== introduces hypotheses on the mechanisms by which past colonial experience might influence the location of modern JVs, providing preliminary empirical results by examining each hypothesis individually. ==== examines which hypotheses are supported when competing with one another to explain JV location. We conclude in ====.====where ¡®settlements¡¯ was used if foreign powers shared equal rights and ¡®concessions¡¯ if only one foreign power had special rights. In defining our colony variable, we included only the first two. The logic of that decision follows.====In settlements without the Chinese government's consent, ¡°foreigners congregated in an area and set up a quasi-municipal organization, assessing themselves for the upkeep of roads, sanitation, etc., with the tacit but not explicit consent of the Chinese government.¡± (Johnstone 1937). These were informal settlements in which the level of authority of the foreigners did not reach that of a colonial government.====Settlements with Chinese government in full control comprise small parts of cities where foreigners wanted to do business and the Chinese government set aside areas for foreigners to live. But the Chinese government controlled these settlements: ¡°the Chinese government retained full jurisdiction as to taxation, policing, etc. Gradually these settlements were absorbed into the Chinese city, and they cannot now be distinguished as separate areas.¡± (Johnstone 1937).====Regarding National Concessions, we take Johnstone (1937) as our major source. Johnstone (1937), whose analysis is hardly rigorous, classifies the concessions into four different categories: granted, never formally recognized, granted but never taken up, and present (i.e., 1937) status in doubt. We include the concessions with the status of granted and exclude the concessions with the status of granted but never taken up or never formally recognized. For those national concessions whose status was in doubt for Johnstone, we referred to later sources (Yan 1955 and Fei 1991). Since neither Yan (1955) nor Fei (1991) include Yochow, we did not include it as a colony. We include all other national concessions whose status was in doubt for Johnstone, since at least one of Yan (1955) or Fei (1991) mentions them (and in a majority of cases both do so).====Johnstone (1937) listed only two international settlements, in Shanghai and Amoy (Xiamen). In our data coding, we treat these two settlements as if they are colonies of both the UK and the USA because these two powers were primarily responsible for the formation of these two settlements and then dominated governance there throughout the colonial period. For example, in the Shanghai International Settlement, all of the 56 chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Council from 1854 to 1941 were from either Great Britain or the US. Britain and the US also had the largest number of seats on the Council and headed all the municipal departments. Similarly, in the Amoy International Settlement the Chairmen of the Kulangsu Municipal Council were either from Britain or the US in 34 of the 39?years preceding 1941.====In determining which city-country pairs can be classified as colonies due to leasehold status, we rely on Wang (1957). In determining which city-country pairs can be classified as due to their status as railway zones, we rely on Tang (1957), ManshiKai (1988), and Tan (2016).",Memories of colonial law: The inheritance of human capital and the location of joint ventures in early-reform China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1930029X,8 April 2019,2019,Research Article,459

The results show that PITI information disclosure has a positive influence on pollution emissions reduction, however, some existing literatures may overstate the effect of public participation on environment improvement in China, the empirical results show that government administrative measures still play essential role at current stage. The paper also finds that the influence of public participation exists in eastern China rather than in central and western China. In addition, the results of using environment technology efficiency as outcome variable show insignificant effect, but eastern China has positive environment technology efficiency, suggesting that economic development may increase enterprise technological input, hence achieving mutually beneficial achievements of economy and ecological efficiency.","For the past three decades, China has been achieving a serial of remarkable economic and social successes but also has come at the tremendous cost of resource depletion and environmental deterioration. In 2017, 239 of the 338 cities across the country exceeded the standard of air quality, with a proportion of 70.7%. Of the groundwater monitoring stations throughout the country, 51.8% showed poor level of quality, and 14.8% showed heavily poor level.==== Moreover, as the household income increases, so as the energy consumption. As the world's top producer of energy-intensive goods, China's energy consumption growth rate is 2.9% in 2017, which is twice as much as in 2016, driven by the strong domestic industrial demand.==== China's coal consumption accounts for 60.4% of its total energy supply in 2017.====Environmental pollution may come from energy sources consumption by using fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas. For instance, coal production increases the emission of harmful pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and small particle matter known as PM2.5 and PM10. Long-term exposure to these pollutants can threaten human health by suffering various diseases including respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (====). The air pollution in China becomes severe these years for the main reason that China is the world's largest consumer and producer of coal.====That public health is affected by environmental pollution with the economic growth is well documented. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health (2017) found that diseases caused by pollution were resulted in an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, moreover, rapidly growing cities in industrializing countries, are largely affected by pollution. Pollution has become a severe constraint for economic development and increased wild public health concern, leading to greater public commentary about pollution in press and social media. According to the China Environmental Statistical Yearbook 2017, public complaints and protests about air pollution are growing exponentially, and the letters of complaint about air pollution during the period 1996¨C2010 increased by 48.5% per year. Environmental conditions, especially poor air and water quality in China have intensified worries among the public, they urge government and enterprises to take more initiatives in ==== improvement. This forced central government in China to make a variety of efforts on handling environmental issues.====). However, China's traditional environmental regulation process - ¡°from top to bottom¡± and ¡°initiative government, passive enterprises, inactive public¡± - sees that environmental regulations fail to be effectively implemented and there are frequent cases of enterprises evading environmental authority supervision (====). ====).====Solving environmental problems in China requires an approach that integrates government, enterprises and public. As a third-party force besides government and enterprises, public participation can supplement information, restrain authority, and solve asymmetric information and supervision problems between the government and enterprises. The government trends to respect more on public's environmental right in recent years. ====, implemented in September 2015, officially stipulates the legal status of public participation in the environmental regulation process. The fifth plenary session of the 18th CPC (Chinese Communist Party) National Congress and ¡°The 13==== Five-Year Plan¡± also emphasized that green development requires an environmental regulation system jointly regulated by government, enterprises, and the public.====The first step of this joint movement is environment information disclosure. Environment protection is the obligation of every enterprise and citizen, but the prerequisite is that public have the environmental right to know current environment situation. ==== play an important part in connecting public and government. These organization are more professional in analyzing environmental information, and they are also closer and more approachable by the public. In 2008, two professional environmental NGOs, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), have jointly developed the Pollutant Information Transparency Index (PITI Index). With the release of this index, the two NGOs report the preliminary assessment result of the level of pollutant information transparency in 120 cities across China annually. This assessment project evaluates the level of environmental information disclosure among 120 cities.====This paper focuses on public participation, which is a newly emerging force, in China's urban environmental regulation system. The study is based on the difference-in-differences method to evaluate the impact of public participation on environment pollution emissions reduction and environment technology efficiency improvement by exploiting the PITI, which has been made public by environmental NGOs since 2008, to form a quasi-natural experiment. Therefore£¬the paper provides empirical evidence for environmental NGOs' participation in environmental improvement in the period of 2003¨C2015, finding that most of existing empirical literatures may have exaggerated the impact of NGO's participation in pollution emissions. By further excluding the effect of government environmental governance, NGOs' participation plays supplementary but not essential role in environment improvement. At current stage, government administrative effects are still at the heart of pollution emissions reduction.====The paper is structured as follows.

In general, our results reflect a relatively optimistic picture in urban China, but a less favorable pattern in rural areas. For the urban sample, both the Compulsory Education Law (CEL) and college expansion policy increase the probability of upward mobility at lower parental education level, and the college expansion policy further increases the intergenerational education mobility in urban China. In contrast, each of the two policies indeed reduces the intergenerational education mobility for the rural sample, and the effects found on upward mobility in urban China are non-existent for the rural sample. The unfavorable results in rural China can be attributed to poor enforcement of the policy or the lack of demand-side education reforms.","; ====; ====). Recent literature has investigated channels through which income is transmitted from one generation to the next, and education is the most well-established channel (====; ====; ====; ====). Children from rich families access better education than their poorer counterparts, and enjoy higher future earnings. For example, ==== adopted the decomposition method and used data from the Chinese Household Income Projects in 1995 and 2002 to find that education mobility contributes most to intergenerational income mobility.====Education is particularly important in China's context because China has experienced dramatic changes in the labor market from the mid-1990s (====). Since then, job-seekers have become free to choose jobs, and employers have more flexibility to make decisions on hiring and firing compared to the pre-reform period when jobs were largely assigned to individuals by universities, communities, or local governments (====; ====). As a consequence of these market-oriented reforms, the education level has become an important determinant of income, and the return to schooling has risen sharply since the 1990s in China, which is now comparable to western economies (====), making it urgent to better understand how educational inequality would transmit from one generation to the next.====As ==== pointed out, mobility means different things to different people. In the literature on intergenerational education mobility, two commonly used concepts are time dependence and upward mobility. Time dependence focused on how dependent is the children education on their parental education (====; ====). A related but different concept called upward mobility pays attention to the situation in which children get the same or higher education than their parents (====; ====). We will utilize both concepts in the present paper. To avoid confusion, we refer to intergenerational education mobility as the concept of time dependence and use the upward mobility to denote the situation defined as above. For clarification of the first concept, larger dependence (or persistence) across two generations in education corresponds to smaller intergenerational education mobility. Previous studies have reached a consensus that larger intergenerational education mobility or more upward mobility is desirable from the society point of view. We also follow this normative view throughout the paper.====Although there have been numerous studies examining the pattern of intergenerational education mobility in China as well as in other countries (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), few studies explored the policy prescription to increase the intergenerational education mobility. As ====; ====; ====).====In this paper, we use the CHIP 2013 dataset to investigate the effects of two important education policies on intergenerational education mobility as well as upward mobility in China, including the Compulsory Education Law (====) implemented in 1986 and college expansion policy (====) started from 1999. The two policies both aim to offer more education opportunities to children at different levels, with the first policy targeting on primary education and the second policy aiming to increase the access to colleges.====From the theoretical point of view, offering more education opportunities does not necessarily increase the intergenerational education mobility or the probability of upward mobility. It depends on who benefit more from the reform and the initial education distribution (====; ====; ====). ==== built a theoretical model to examine the role of public education in determining intergenerational education mobility, and showed that for mobility to increase during the process of development, the share of resources devoted to public education needs to be large enough to offset the relative advantage of having educated parents in academic attainment. Thus, it is an empirical question to investigate the effect of the two education policies at different levels on intergenerational education mobility in China's context, which is the research objective of this paper.====As ==== summarized, studies on intergenerational education mobility have mostly followed two methodological approaches. The first type computes a transition matrix between parental education and children education. Starting with ====, this method has been used by a number of scholars such as ====, ====, etc. This is basically a descriptive approach without analyzing the impact of other variables on such transmission. However, this method is unable to explore the causal relation between parental and children education when several other possible explanatory factors are present. This gives rise to the second method which is more rigorous in nature and typically regress children's education on parents' education along with a set of other control variables (====; ====). Though the regression approach has been in favor in recent times, it is sometimes criticized on the ground that the association between parental and children's education can be non-linear over the education level of parents (====). For these reasons, we have used both approaches in the present paper and employed a non-linear regression method to complement our results.====We first present a complete education mobility profile in China in order to show a bird view of the pattern and evolution of China's intergenerational education mobility, and then explore the policy consequences of two important public education policies including the Compulsory Education Law and college expansion policy. To identify the policy consequences, we rely on the facts that the Compulsory Education Law was carried out at different timing in different provinces around 1986 and the gradual feature of the college expansion policy over time since 1999.====Several important findings appear from our empirical analyses. First, the patterns of intergenerational education mobility are different in urban and rural China. For urban areas, we find larger mobility at lower education levels but smaller mobility at higher education levels. This may occur because urban areas have more good schools and educational resources, which enable people to accumulate their advantage over generations. Nonetheless, rural China exhibits the opposite pattern characterizing lower mobility at lower education levels but larger mobility at higher education levels.====Second, the estimations for the policy consequences suggest that the two education policies did not have an expected effect on increasing intergenerational education mobility due to either poor targeting and enforcement or the lack of demand-side reforms. Even worse, we observe significantly negative effects of the two education policies on intergenerational education mobility in rural China. The unfavorable results in rural China can be attributed to poor enforcement of the policy or the lack of demand-side education reforms. For example, the college tuition also rose along with the increased access to colleges, which makes children with better family background benefit more from the policy.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses previous relevant research and specifies our contributions, and Section 3 introduces the background of two education policies examined in this paper. Section 4 describes the dataset and presents some ====. Section 5 shows the intergenerational education mobility profile by presenting the transition matrixes in different dimensions.

For China, the improvement in agricultural production capacity and the steady progress of urbanization are fundamental guarantees to mitigate unbalanced urban-rural development and alleviate urban-rural conflict. However, previous studies have paid little attention to the effects of agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilizers on urban-rural income disparity. Based on a data set of 30 provincial-level regions in China over 1997¨C2015, we use the system generalized method of moments to investigate the impacts of agricultural production inputs and urbanization on urban-rural income disparity. The results show that increasing urbanization has a significant effect on mitigating urban-rural income disparity. The intensity of chemical fertilizer application also has a significant impact on the disparity, but the impact depends on the level of urbanization. For the provinces with relatively low levels of urbanization, an increase in the intensity of chemical fertilizer application can moderate the disparity, while a decline in the intensity of chemical fertilizer application can narrow the disparity in more urbanized provinces. The threshold levels of urbanization present a time-varying characteristic; however, the threshold effects are significant over the entire sample period. Therefore, during the process of further urbanization in China, it is necessary and urgent to appropriately adjust the pattern of chemical fertilizer application and thus reduce the over-dependence on chemical fertilizers in agricultural production.","The socioeconomic problems caused by income inequality can result in some potential risks of low-efficient economic development (====; ====; ====; ====). Although in recent years, the urban-rural relationship in China has been improved to some extent, the urban-rural dual structure is still very obvious and the urban-rural income disparity remains high (====; ====), curbing the long-term growth of China's economy and the improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation (====; ====; ====At the end of 2016, China's population was 1.3827 billion and the urbanization rate was 57.35%.==== In the same year, there were 134.921 million ha of arable land in China,==== but the arable land per capita was only 0.0976?ha, which was almost half of 0.192?ha¡ªthe world's average.==== These specific national conditions imply that the discrepancy between grain demand and supply in China will remain in the long term, and the prominence of the discrepancy between population and land will increase with the acceleration of urbanization. Once agricultural production encounters negative shocks, the process of urbanization and the coordinated development of urban and rural areas will be hindered (====; ====; ====). In the face of such pressures, to increase grain yields and secure food supply, China's agricultural production has become increasingly dependent on agrochemicals, such as chemical fertilizers.====The characteristics of high input and high output of China's agricultural production are clear. From 1978 to 2016, China's grain production doubled, and the total amount of agricultural fertilizer application increased over 5.77 times.==== At present, China applies the greatest chemical fertilizers in the world, accounting for approximately one third of the global total. In terms of intensity, China's agricultural fertilizer application is 328.5?kg per ha, which is substantially higher than the world average of 120?kg per ha (====).====The main cause for the staggering amount of chemical fertilizer application in China over the past half century is the yield-increasing effect of chemical fertilizers on agricultural production (====). ==== argued that the contribution of the household contract responsibility system (HRS) to the total value of agricultural output over the period 1978¨C1984 was 46.89%, and the contribution of chemical fertilizer application was 32.20%. After the HRS was fully promoted in China, the contribution of chemical fertilizer application over the period 1984¨C1987 was as high as 53.71%. ==== found that the contribution of chemical fertilizer application to grain yields over the period 1978¨C2006 was the greatest among all agricultural inputs, which was just <57%. While the population-land relationship is particularly tense in China's rural areas, the increase in grain yield caused by chemical fertilizer application implies that agricultural productivity has increased. This is generally regarded as one of the main reasons for the release of rural surplus labor forces from their lands in China (====; ====).====The significant yield-increasing effect of chemical fertilizer application is related to China's rural revitalization, helps maintain reasonable and stable agricultural product prices, and provides guarantees for the coordination of the urban-rural relationship. However, thus far, the mechanisms regarding how the application of chemical fertilizers affects the incomes of urban and rural households remain unclear. Does the application of chemical fertilizers mitigate urban-rural income disparity by directly improving agricultural production conditions and thus increasing farmers' agricultural income, or by promoting urban-rural migration and thus increasing rural households' wage income? Moreover, what impacts will urbanization have on the application of chemical fertilizers and urban-rural income disparity?====Although some of the literature has focused on examining the role of urbanization in narrowing urban-rural income disparity (====; ====; ====), ==== found that the increase in the level of urbanization would significantly reduce the total amount of chemical fertilizer and pesticide application. They argued that the income-increasing effect of urbanization reduces the dependence of agricultural production on agrochemicals. Therefore, if the application of chemical fertilizers plays an important role in mitigating urban-rural income disparity, the indirect effect of urbanization mentioned-above should not be ignored. In addition, although some studies have examined the impacts of inputs, such as agrochemicals and agricultural machinery, on farmers' incomes (====; ====), few have directly assessed the impacts of agricultural production inputs on urban-rural income disparity. Using a panel data set of 30 provincial-level regions in China over the period 1997¨C2015, this paper conducts a novel empirical examination of the contributions of the intensity of chemical fertilizer application, urbanization, and their interaction regarding the mitigation of urban-rural income disparity.====; ==== and the ==== in 2015. These two zero-growth programs put strict limits on the amount of chemical fertilizer and pesticide application in China. On the one hand, if the application of chemical fertilizers helps farmers increase their income and thus mitigates urban-rural income disparity, policymakers should actively explore other means to narrow urban-rural income disparity while the zero-growth program aims to reduce the excessive dependence of agricultural production on chemical fertilizers. On the other hand, and more important, is whether the restrictions imposed by the MOA on the application of chemical fertilizers will have policy impacts on the growth of farmers' incomes and urban-rural relationships. To accurately assess the policy impacts of the zero-growth targets, it is necessary to examine the direct impact of chemical fertilizer application on urban-rural income disparity.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review and theoretical mechanism. The empirical methodology, variables, and data are detailed in Section 3. Section 4 offers the empirical results on the impacts of chemical fertilizer application, urbanization, and the interaction between these two variables on urban-rural income disparity. Section 5 further identifies the threshold effects of chemical fertilizer application on narrowing the urban-rural income gap and the impacts of other agricultural inputs, such as pesticides and agricultural plastic films, on the urban-rural income gap.

In recent decades, numerous studies have explored the factors underlying household financial market participation, such as individual characteristics (====; ====; ====; ====; ====); household characteristics (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====); social interactions, trust and social capital (====; ====; ====; ====; ====); emotions (====; ====); and culture (====). Some recent works have emphasized the role of financial literacy (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In addition, some studies focus on the effect of housing (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), crowding-out effect (====; ====; ====; ====) or both effects (====). Furthermore, the above studies usually investigate financial literacy, housing and financial market participation separately but not in combination. In addition, most existing studies are based on cases in Western countries, and few cases are related to China. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to explore the results obtained using a new dataset, especially in China, given the statistics showing the importance of property investments in households for financial market participation and how such investments and financial literacy combined affect household financial market participation.====According to the China Household Finance Survey in 2011, the household financial market participation rate is 11.5%; of the overall participation in the market, the stock market participation rate among Chinese households is 8.8%, while the fund market participation rate among Chinese households is 4.2% (====). These results indicate that Chinese household financial market participation is low. However, with the continuous development of China's financial market, financial products are becoming diverse and complex, and households are increasingly actively involved in the financial market. Meanwhile, the development of China's housing market over the past decades has added value to families' housing wealth. According to the China Household Finance Survey data, the proportion of household housing assets to total assets increased from 62% in 2011 to 66% in 2013, and China's per capita real estate wealth in 2016 was $13,100. Real estate plays a vital role in Chinese households' everyday investment decisions in most aspects, including those in the financial market (====). However, lacking financial knowledge, households do not know how to make investment decisions. Our goal in this paper is to fill the above gaps in the literature by examining how financial literacy and housing value jointly affect household financial market participation in urban China to provide important evidence and policy recommendations to policymakers and help residents improve their financial literacy and optimize their investment strategies. We set the study in urban China because the housing value is mainly reflected in urban housing, and rural housing could may not be accurately valued.====Our work contributes to the literature in two key respects. First, the specific advantage of our study is that the Chinese urban setting and our unique dataset enable us to explore the effects of both financial literacy and housing value on household financial market participation in Chinese cities, the role of which has been examined separately in the existing literature. The findings show that there is a significant positive association between financial literacy and household financial market participation, while the housing value has an obvious ¡°crowding-out effect¡± on household financial market participation in urban China. Further research finds that the role of financial literacy in household financial market participation in households with a low housing value is stronger than that in households with a high housing value. Furthermore, the study of the regional differences shows that among households with high housing values, financial literacy plays a more significant role in household bond market participation in less-developed cities. Among households with low housing values, improvement in financial literacy plays a more significant role in household fund market participation in less-developed cities and under-developed cities.====. Our work not only sheds light on China's policymaking but also provides a useful reference for other countries.====The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. ==== reviews existing studies. ==== describes the research design. Our empirical findings and robustness checks are presented in ====. ==== presents an extension analysis of the regional differences. ==== provides the conclusion, a brief summary and policy implications.","Financial literacy, housing value and household financial market participation: Evidence from urban China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300343,21-Mar-19,2019,Research Article,463

In 2005, China's overall ==== of household income per capita would decline from 0.512 to 0.476 if marriages were randomly matched. In urban areas, assortative marriage in education increased the Gini coefficients from 0.321 to 0.338 in 2009. The decomposition exercise shows that the rising returns to education contribute most to the increase in income inequality in urban areas between 1990 and 2009, while the change in marriage assortativeness plays a minor role.","). Rural areas experienced a slower increase in returns to education, but education is nevertheless important in determining the earnings and employment opportunities of rural residents (====; ====; ====).====Given the income gap between educated and less educated workers, household educational attainment will influence income inequality, which is referred to as a composition effect. To assess this effect, most researchers either use income and education information at the individual level or construct measures at the household level (e.g., the education level of the household head or the average education levels of all household members). In both cases, the correlation of education attainment between wives and husbands is largely neglected. This paper examines the assortative pattern of marriage in terms of this aspect and analyzes its impact on income inequality in China.====Whether marriage is positively or negatively assortative could have major implications for income inequality (====, ====). Positively assortative marriage (as observed in many societies) makes human capital more unevenly distributed across households. However, its impact on income inequality depends on many other factors. It is possible that couples choose only one member to participate in the labor market to facilitate labor division within household (====). In such cases, assortative marriage will not significantly influence household income inequality. By contrast, if both spouses participate in the labor market, educated couples will earn more than less educated couples to a greater extent, thereby increasing income inequality. Thus, both the assortativeness of marriage in terms of education and its impact on income inequality deserve systematic empirical investigation.====This investigation is of distinct interest in the Chinese context for the following reasons. First, as noted, the returns to education and income inequality in China have increased continuously since the early 1990s (see ====; ====; ====; ====). Second, China experienced dramatic education expansion during the reform period. In particular, its higher education sector has greatly expanded since the late 1990s. While the increased education attainment for individuals is well documented, studies on its distribution at the household level are scarce. Third, through the expansion process, the educational levels of women have been nearing those of men. Thus, it is becoming easier for a man with a college degree to marry a woman with a similar education level. Education expansion and the narrowing of the gender gap in education attainment inspire another question: to what extent is the change in marriage assortativeness caused by changes in the marriage pattern itself rather than by these compositional changes?====We document China's educational assortative marriage and its evolution using census and household survey data between 1990 and 2009. The results suggest that positive assortativeness in education increased significantly for marriages in China since the early 1990s, as well as in urban areas and different provinces. To assess the impact of assortative marriage on income inequality, we calculate Gini coefficients for the hypothetical scenario in which couples are randomly matched. In 2005, if marriages were randomly decided, then the Gini coefficient of household income per capita would decrease from 0.512 to 0.476. In urban areas, assortative marriage in education increased the Gini coefficient by approximately 2% (from 0.321 to 0.338) in 2009.====Although assortative marriage is important for shaping income inequality, its contribution to changes in income inequality is small. By contrast, changes in the relative income across different types of households explain a major proportion of the increase in income inequality. Education expansion, which changed the marginal distributions of husbands' and wives' education, plays a nontrivial but relatively minor role. This role is expected because changes in the returns to education and education levels are larger than the changes in assortative marriage. However, the results of our calculations suggest that both education expansion and increased returns to education have made assortative marriage more important in shaping income inequality.====This paper is the first to evaluate the role of assortative marriage in shaping China's income inequality. Our major contribution is our use of counterfactual analysis to assess the relative importance of educational expansion, increasing returns to education, and assortative marriage to income inequality. In addition, we use a method that allows us to investigate the changing pattern of assortative marriage when holding education levels constant. Our finding that positive assortative marriage has increased is consistent with the finding of ====. However, the increase in assortative marriage in terms of education does not necessarily indicate an increase in assortative marriage in other aspects. A recent study by ==== examined the change in age gap in Chinese couples and found that age homogamy decreased in recently born cohorts. Our study complements rather than contradicts these studies.====This paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly introduces related literature and background information. ==== describes the census data for 1990, the 1% population survey for 2005, and the urban household survey data for 1990 and 2009. ==== documents the assortative marriage pattern in China since the early 1990s. ==== estimates the effect of assortative marriage on income inequality by calculating counterfactual inequalities for different scenarios. ==== concludes the paper, discusses weaknesses of the current study, and suggests directions for further research.","Education expansion, assortative marriage, and income inequality in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300331,20-Mar-19,2019,Research Article,464

Using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms and conditional on human capital-related controls, we find that firms with a greater share of female workers demonstrate lower productivity. However, our results suggest that increasing the fraction of highly educated female workers significantly improves firm performance. This effect is evident for all private firms regardless of their trade orientation and foreign firms undertaking purely domestic sales. However, the effect does not exist in the case of state-owned and export-oriented foreign enterprises. Compared with medium-sized and large firms, small firms benefit more from gender diversity at high education level. Finally, the share of highly talented female workers indicates better firm performance in more feminized ====.","Workforce composition plays a critical role in firm performance. Based on employer¨Cemployee matched data, numerous studies have analyzed the impact of workforce composition on firm performance in terms of age, gender, and human capital. Concerning gender issues, most extant studies have argued that ceteris paribus, firms with a higher level of productivity are associated with a lower fraction of female employees (====; ====; ====; ====). In parallel with this finding, one strand of literature has compared male¨Cfemale gaps in wage and productivity by jointly estimating wage and production functions (====; ====). Researchers have generally found that the male¨Cfemale gap in wages is greater than that in productivity, indicating female wage discrimination. However, more recent European studies have found contrary results. For instance, ==== suggested that the share of female employment is positively related to productivity for Norwegian manufacturing firms. ====Another line of literature has hinged on the impact of female CEOs and gender diversity in the boardroom/senior positions on corporate performance (====; ==== Evidence from U.S. and European countries has demonstrated positive or unclear relationships between gender diversity in senior positions and firms' financial performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). A small, burgeoning body of literature has shown that the impact of female leadership on firm performance increases with the share of female workers (====; ====). Accordingly, the impact of female workers on business success remains an empirical issue.====As a growing body of literature has challenged the conventional viewpoint that female workers are less productive than their male counterparts, more in-depth investigations on the role of female employees in determining firm performance are needed. This study utilizes a large and nationally representative dataset for Chinese manufacturing firms to explore the potential channels through which gender equity may affect firm performance. China represents an interesting case for at least two reasons: First, its female labor force is the largest in the world. Therefore, exploring the contribution of female labor force to firm productivity relative to that of male labor force would be noteworthy. Second, it is one of the most rapidly developing countries, whose experiences in economic transition are widely emulated by other developing and transitional economies. Although our dataset is essentially cross-sectional, rather than employer¨Cemployee matched, it uniquely contains comprehensive information regarding gender workforce composition in terms of education and ==== in China.====This study contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, unlike most prior research that uses the fraction of female workers to total employees as a measure of gender workforce composition, this study classify workers in terms of gender and education/skill levels. It enables us to clarify whether and how female employees affect firm productivity. Second, this study compares firms by various ownership types, as well as ownership with trade orientation, in order to investigate the heterogeneity or potential channels behind the linkage. Compared with domestic Chinese firms, foreign affiliates in more gender-equal cultures proportionally employ more women. Combined with firms' export status, different findings may exhibit among firms with various types of ownership and trade orientation. The impact of firm size and industry-specific characteristics (e.g., feminization) on the relationship is also worth investigating. Third, by linking the data priori and after the main dataset in 2004, we used ==== semi-parametric method to estimate firms' total factor productivity (TFP) to mitigate the endogeneity in input choice. This method is more appropriate as technological change could be gender-biased, thereby affecting the reallocation of men and women in production (====). To address the potential simultaneity problem, we also used subsequent one-year TFP as an alternative measure of dependent variables for robustness checks.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: ==== provides conceptual discussion on gender and productivity.

In their opinions, if the inequality of some outcomes is generated by differences in individuals' efforts, then this type of inequality may be good for the society since it can motivate people to work harder. In contrast, if the inequality is due to factors beyond people's control such as family background, this type of inequality should be ethically unacceptable.==== incorporates the concepts above into an economics model and divides the factors determining income into two categories: those people can control (called ¡°efforts¡±), and those beyond people's control (called ¡°circumstances¡±, e.g. gender or family background). Given this distinction, he defines ¡°inequality of opportunity¡± essentially as the extent to which important outcomes¡ªsuch as income¡ªare determined by circumstances beyond people's control. According to this distinction, economists have developed a set of methods to empirically measure inequality of opportunity in different countries, such as ex-ante versus ex-post measures, parametric versus non-parametric estimations, and etc. (====£»====; ====; ====; ====).====Although many studies tried to measure inequality of opportunity in different countries, few of them examined its economic consequences empirically. Furthermore, these few studies overwhelmingly explored the effect of inequality of opportunity on economic growth. For example, ==== investigated whether inequality of opportunity can affect economic growth using data from the US. Their findings suggest that inequality of opportunity was negatively associated with economic growth in the United States in 1970, 1980 and 1990. However, using the cross-country dataset, ==== found that while inequality of opportunity is negatively associated with economic growth, the estimates are insignificant.====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Furthermore, as an important component of education investment, household education expenditure has a large influence on children's education and human capital accumulation, and thus has gained sizable attention from researchers (====; ====; ====; ====).====Second, the inequality in household education expenditures in China is quite high, which may result in larger inequality in children's educational outcomes and, in turn, widen social inequality (====). It is also possible that income inequality in the older generation is passed down to younger ones through inequalities in education expenditures. As ====The inequality of opportunity within a region may affect people's education expenditures through the change in incentives. As previous scholars said, by definition, high inequality of opportunity means that most of the determinants of individuals' income are beyond people's control (====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====In fact, several existing studies have examined the effect of total income inequality on household education expenditures, but they have not obtained consistent results. One the one hand, some studies find a positive relationship between income inequality and education expenditures. For example, ==== find that income inequality measured by the provincial Gini coefficient has a positive effect on household educational expenditures in urban China. ==== adopt the measure of village-level income inequality to obtain similar results. Their explanation is the so-called status seeking hypothesis. That is, as income inequality rises, people may save more and invest more in education in order to strengthen their ability to seek high social status in the future (====; ====).====; ====Although many studies have tested the effect of total income inequality on household education expenditures, few of them realized that different aspects of income inequality may have different effects on household education expenditures, which may lead to inconsistent results shown in preceding paragraphs. In particular, studies on examining the effect of inequality of opportunity on education expenditures are very rare. To our knowledge, only one theoretical attempt has been made to examine this potential relationship. ==== build a theoretical model which suggests that a higher degree of inequality of opportunity is associated with lower average level of human capital and a lower fraction of individuals investing in human capital. Similarly, several other papers argue that high inequality of opportunity would reduce people¡¯ efforts such as household education investments (====; ====).====Our present paper contributes to the literature by offering one of the first pieces of empirical evidence on the impact of inequality of opportunity on household education investment using a nationwide panel dataset from China. The second contribution of this paper is that we attempt to examine the effect of within-region inequality, especially inequality of opportunity, on household educational investment, compared to the numerous existing studies focusing on micro-level determinants of education expenditures (====). Finally, our paper is among one of the first attempts to explore the effects of inequality of opportunity on people's economic behavior at the micro level. The existing literature overwhelmingly measured the level of inequality of opportunity in different countries or examined its effects on economic growth at the macro level (====; ====).====In summary, this paper will utilize a nationally representative tracking survey (China Family Panel Studies) in three waves (2010, 2012 and 2014) to examine the effect of inequality of opportunity on household education expenditures. The household fixed effect model shows that the effect is significantly negative, which is robust to a series of robustness checks. Furthermore, for relatively disadvantaged households (household heads with less education, income, or rural hukou status in 2014), inequality of opportunity has a larger negative effect on their education expenditures.====The paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the research background in China and reviews the relevant literature. ====. ==== provides several robustness checks to our main results, and ==== concludes.",Inequality of opportunity and household education expenditures: Evidence from panel data in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300288,15-Mar-19,2019,Research Article,466

We also find magnet class experience can improve the probability of entering high-quality academic universities. By comparing the effects of two cutoffs with different student abilities, our findings support the claim that the effect of elite school/magnet class enrollment depends on student abilities.","; ====; ====; ====). Second, enhanced resources, such as experienced teaching staff, are assigned to elite schools. Teacher qualification have been found to have positive effects on student performance (====; ====). However, the empirical literature offers mixed findings regarding the effects of elite schools on students' academic performance. A most possible reason is that score gains from elite school experience may differ across student abilities. For example, highly selective elite schools admit smaller group of students with high abilities. If elite school effectonly exists among high-ability students, then researchers who examine effects on low selective schools will find minor effect.====This study attempts to analyze a unique dataset with two admission lines. Students compete for slots of two elite schools according to a uniform examination in a county. The winners are further ranked to be determined whether can enter magnet class in the two elite schools. Therefore, we have two score cutoffs: one reflects relatively low selective process (elite school) and the other reflects high selective process (magnet class). The two cutoffs are like a cumulative multi-cutoff (====). Borderline students near the magnet class cutoff have higher abilities than borderline students near the elite school cutoff. However, the two groups of students have same language, culture, and social environment. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the influences of elite schools and magnet classes on student achievement using a unified dataset. The previous studies are limited in that they cannot give a consistent explanation of the mixed results given that the cutoffs they used are not comparable to a certain extent. Our collected data enable us to compare borderline students selected by high and low enrollment standard and students with different abilities. We provide evidence that the effect of elite school/magnet class varies with student abilities.====Our research also contributes to the existing literature from three other perspectives. First, the small effect of the elite schools can arise from the possible offsetting effects masked in the average effect estimation (====; ====). To avoid that issue, we carry out quantile estimation to explore the treatment effects of admission to elite schools and magnet classes on the entire distribution of student achievement. Second, there should be an investigation of the effects of elite schools or magnet classes beyond those on student achievement (====; ====). Enrolling in different types of schools determines one's future choice, for example, doing research vs. being a technician. This issue is important for policy makers because it enables them to understand whether elite school and magnet class experiences can increase the number of technicians or the number of people doing research. Thus, we examine the effects of elite school and magnet class enrollment on admission to different tiers of universities. Finally, teacher and peer effects are the two possible channels that contribute to the positive effect of elite school/magnet class. The existing literature on elite school/magnet class effect do not separate the two effects. We provide suggestive evidence of the relative importance between teacher and peer effects functioning in magnet class enrollment.====In our analysis, the ==== (hereafter, RD) is used to compare the scores of students who barely pass the admission cutoff to the scores of those who fall just below it. Students near the admission cutoff (i.e., those in the bandwidth) are assumed to be without heterogeneities. Therefore, differences between the students enrolled in elite schools/magnet classes and the unsuccessful applicants arise solely by chance. Taking into account the fuzziness of enrollment, we employ a fuzzy RD estimate approach. In the fuzzy RD, a dummy for clearing the admission cutoff is used as an instrument, after which the two-stage least square (hereafter, 2SLS) estimation is implemented. In this case, the difference in quality of education can be examined by comparing the achievement of successful applicants with that of unsuccessful participants. A quantile RD estimate is also performed to identify the effect of admission across the achievement distribution. The non-parametric RD estimation method provides robust checks for our finding.====Our analysis produces four main findings. First, the 2SLS estimates show that the marginal applicants admitted to elite schools do not perform better in the college entrance examination (hereafter, CEE) than those who are not enrolled in elite schools. In comparison, the impact of magnet classes on student performance has a positive sign: students admitted to magnet classes generally achieve 0.435 ==== better CEE test scores than those in regular classes. The non-parametric estimates show similar results with those in 2SLS. Therefore, by comparing the effects of two cutoffs with different selective rate, our findings show that the effects of elite school and magnet class enrollment depend on the abilities of students. In particular, studying in a good environment, including studying with high-selective qualified peers and being taught by experienced teachers, benefits high-ability students.====Second, we estimate effects on the entire distribution of the CEE scores and find that elite school enrollment has small and insignificant effects on most quantiles of the score distribution. With respect to the magnet class enrollment, we find that the score gains of arts students are mainly those on the top end of the distribution, whereas the score gains of science students are mainly those on the low end of the distribution. Hence, our result indicates that previous findings on the minor effect of elite school enrollment are not attributed to the offset of the impacts between the high- and low-achieving students.====Third, we find that the probability to pass the tier 1 university (or academic university) cutoff increases if a student has magnet class experience. Such an effect is especially significant for arts students. Because students educated in Chinese academic universities are more competitive in labor markets, our results conform to the literature showing that elite school experience has long run effect (see ====; ====).====Finally, with multiple cohorts in our data, we try to separate teacher effects from peer effects ¨C the two possible mechanisms functioning in magnet class effect. Without considering the noncompliance and assuming that teachers are randomly assigned among magnet classes, we provide informative evidence that teacher effect is roughly 40% of the magnitude of the peer effects. Hence, the peer effects on CEE score would be approximately 0.31 standard deviations that are associated with score gain in magnet classes. Therefore, our results show that peer effects contribute a sizeable effect of the score gain for students studying in magnet classes.====), but we find magnet class enrollment can promote the probability of student's choice to an academic university, with the implication that it could produce meaningful long-term impacts for students.====This paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the related literature. ==== introduces background on the high school entrance system in the surveyed county and our collected data. ==== presents the methodology and the empirical results. ==== provides the robustness checks and other related results. ==== provides interpretations for our findings. The last section concludes the paper.====The original dataset consists of 7356 students who participated in college entrance examinations. We drop (1) student majoring in art, music, and sport (223 observations); (2) students with one or more subjects having missing or zero values of HSEE score (319 observations); (3) students with missing demographic characteristics (97 observations); (4) multiple matches (258 observations). The screening process leaves the final sample with 6459 matched students.====Students majoring in art, music, and sport are excluded from our analysis because they apply to universities through a special program. The score composition and university enrollment process for students applying in special programs are very different from the common CEE. For students participating in common CEE, the overall points of the four subjects (Chinese, mathematics, English, and comprehensive science/social science) received by the students is used for applying for universities.==== By contrast, students who apply for university though special programs ¨C except for taking Chinese, mathematics, and English tests ¨C are also screened using additional criteria imposed by some art departments of university or sports programs organized by official institutions. The overall score weighs the special subject (i.e., art or sport), which usually accounts for more than 60%. Therefore, those students will pay more attention on the special subject than the academic subjects.====Students with missing HSEE scores and individual characteristics are marked as invalid observations. We match HSEE and CEE scores using student's name and gender. Hence, students with duplicated name and gender cannot be precisely matched and thus are dropped.==== presents the raw HSEE scores, raw CEE scores, and demographic characteristics between the included sample and excluded sample. The characteristics of the students are similar between the included and excluded samples. For HSEE and CEE scores, the excluded students achieve lower scores than included students, arising from the fact that students majoring in art, music, and sport perform worse than other students.","Elite schools, magnet classes, and academic performances: Regression-discontinuity evidence from China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300306,13-Mar-19,2019,Research Article,467

In particular, the widely present illegal shipments of the non-reusable and hazardous wastes testify to imperfect monitoring and policy enforcement.==== Understanding the effects of national monitoring and inspections is therefore important for explaining waste trading and transboundary waste management.====How does the enforcement of national policies affect the international trade of waste? In this paper, the deterrent effect of border controls on waste imports is explored by exploiting a unique natural experiment in border enforcement called ¡°Operation Green Fence¡± (OGF) in China. From February to November 2013, Chinese customs officials launched this campaign by taking a series of operational measures at the customs in order to decrease the quantity of illicit recyclable material entering China. The need for effective enforcement is especially imperative for China, a leading importing country of waste. Of various waste management policies introduced by the Chinese government, the OGF is viewed as a landmark step in combatting waste imports. More importantly, regulations and enforcement were unpacked so that the isolated effect of enforcement could be identified and highlighted. Thus, the OGF is utilized for this analysis.====This paper explicitly investigates how this OGF campaign affected the amount and price of imported waste entering China. Rigorous enforcement of regulations regarding waste transboundary shipments could behave as trade barriers by forcing exporters to reduce illegal shipments and could lead to lower import prices given China's important role in the world secondary resource market.==== The import responses depend on the effectiveness of this policy change in the presence of illicit waste trade, and it becomes an empirical question to be explored.====By utilizing the Chatham House Resource Trade Database (CHRTD), we evaluate the impacts of this national customs enforcement on waste trade. The difference-in-difference (DID) identification strategy is employed. Our outcomes of interest are the import amount and the import price, which are proxied by the import weight and the import unit value, respectively. The CHRTD records bilateral trade in natural resources by resource type in which products at different stages of the same value chain are grouped. Of all China's imports, waste commodities are subject to much stricter examinations during the 10-month long initiative. The family of all these imported waste products is classified as the treated subclass (¡°waste¡±). The imported products that are not wastes are expected to be little affected by the enforcement of OGF, and this family is regarded as the control subclass (¡°non-waste¡±). The baseline data used are from 2011 to 2015 at the exporter-product (HS6) level in this work.====We examine how the change in the waste imports before and after the imposition of the OGF differs from that in the non-waste imports. While waste and non-waste subclasses may vary with family characteristics, differencing outcomes within each subclass before and after the OGF eliminates biases associated with any time-invariant family attribute. We show that the time trends of the two subclasses before the OGF are comparable with both the descriptive evidence and the regression results of parallel tests.====Our fundamental finding is that the OGF exerted a significant deterrent effect on the waste imports into China. Specifically, we find that the import weight of waste grew by 9.48 percentage less and the import price declined by 7.6 percentage more compared to those of the non-waste. The results are statistically significant and supported by a series of robustness checks. In addition, by comparing the results for China with those for other regions generated in the same way, we provide counterfactual evidence that supports the benchmark results.====This work is related to two strands of literature. First and foremost, it contributes to the empirical literature on trade and the environment that has taken the international waste trade into account.==== The literature has provided insights into the determinants of waste trade by considering various socio-economic, institutional and policy factors (e.g. ====; ====). It places a strong emphasis on examining the role of environmental policy differences. ==== is the first to explicitly test the waste haven effect in an international context and finds compelling evidence using bilateral waste trade data. Then, the waste haven effect has been widely examined using country or regional data samples (e.g. ====; ====; ====). Additionally, the effects of multilateral environmental agreements have been evaluated (e.g. ====; ====).====Few of the empirical works consider the national border-enforcement policy explicitly.==== Moreover, only waste trade data are employed for studying the international waste trade in the existing works. By contrast, our methodology of using comparable non-waste trade data as controls in this work is novel.==== Empirical investigations of deterrence have been conducted in many environmental settings such as air pollution (e.g., ====), water pollution (e.g., ====; ====; ====), and toxic and hazardous waste (e.g., ====; ====).

From an external perspective, the process of global economic recovery in the post-financial crisis period is still slow, the total factor productivity continues to decline (====; ====), and the rise of populism in developed countries and the intensification of trade disputes between China and the United States of America have increased China's economic growth uncertainties. According to the definition by ====). These not only directly lead to a decline in the investment rate of the real economy (====; ====). Therefore, it is of great practical significance to accurately assess and actively deal with the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty for the realization of sustained and stable economic growth.====In recent years, resource and environmental constraints faced by Chinese cities have been increasing, and production of fossil fuel has a significant effect on greenhouse emissions (====The main contributions of this study are as follows.

Some research has confirmed the positive impacts of reforms on the efficiency improvement of transmission and distribution sector, e.g. ==== ====, ====.====China has also launched a series of reforms to enhance efficiency since 1980s. In 2002, the State Power Grid Corporation was split and two grid enterprises were established to break the monopoly (====; ====). The 2002 reform has made considerable achievements but also created numerous problems (====). The market is not competitive as the two grid enterprises monopolize the process of electricity transmission, distribution and retail. Especially, the on-grid price and retail price are regulated by the government, where the retailing price plan is jointly drafted by provincial grid companies and the local government and then submitted to the central government for approval (====).====For further development, Chinese government has begun a new round of reform in 2015 and issued a document named ¡°Furthering Reform of the Electricity Market¡± (====). Price mechanism reform is of great importance in this reform. The competition will be introduced into power retail side, and the former on-grid price will be replaced by the transaction price, which is decided by negotiation between the end users and generation plants (====). However, the transmission and distribution price is still regulated by the government. As for the grid companies, the significant requests of new electricity reform include that their profit mode will be gradually changed to obtain the net fee charged with regulated transmission and distribution price (====; ====).====The essence of this new reform is to improve efficiency and lower energy cost for other ====. The grid companies have been enjoying huge benefits created by monopoly in the past few decades. The government hopes to reduce energy cost by improving operational efficiency in the electricity industry. However, it should be noted that China's electricity market has its particularity. A deep understanding of the particularity is the basis for efficiency improvement.====The ¡°provinces as entities¡± is the main regulation frame in China's electricity sector and market power of grid companies varies across different provinces (====; ====). In China, the provincial power grid companies are not only affected by the upper-level but also by local governments, who hold gigantic power in the electricity market, especially, price regulation. The grid companies have been charged by political superiors, for example, political electricity power cuts for the goal of energy saving and emission reduction.====The operation of the electricity industry can be viewed as a game result and interest compromise between the local government's pursuit of rapid economic growth and grid enterprises pursuing their own profit maximization. Before new electricity reform, the retail electricity prices are controlled by local government and grid companies. As emphasized by ====, the local governments are major players in economic development, however regional government officials are appointed by the central government. In this regime, the central government has established a tournament and the regional officials drive the economic development under the supervision of central government (====).====Many studies have confirmed the negative influences of market power, e.g. ====, ====. As for the electricity industry, ==== emphasize that ownership concentration in a region would lead to an exercise of market power. ====). Poor service quality caused by planned or unplanned supply interruptions will lead to enormous losses, and thus reliable service quality is seen as a critical objective by regulators (====).====China is currently in the critical period of a new round ====. How to reduce the cost of enterprises and keep them growing is an urgent problem. Therefore, it is of great significance to reduce the electricity price and improve the efficiency of grid companies. What is the influence of market power on grid efficiency? How to regulate China's power grid enterprises with a view of new power reform in the future? Our paper is motivated by answering these questions.====We extend the empirical literature by applying a conditional-SBM method to study the relationship between market power and efficiency of grid companies, and in doing so contribute to the literature in several areas. First, power quality has been a hot issue. Though some scholars have analyzed China's power grid efficiency, service quality is rarely introduced into their models. Secondly, some previous studies show that market power hinders the development of the power industry. Few people have analyzed its impacts on power grid efficiency empirically. The final novel aspect is the employment of the conditional-SBM method, which can overcome the endogenous problems caused by the traditional two-stage DEA model. These results will give some insightful references to the future development of the power industry and electricity reform in China.====This paper is organized as follows.

This paper sheds new light on the role of geographic proximity in intra-group loans within business groups.,"This study examines the effects of geographic proximity on loan pricing in internal capital markets by focusing on the role of information. Prior studies provide evidence that geographic proximity plays an important role in investor trading, analyst forecasts, bank lending, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs (====; ====, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), indicating that geographic proximity facilitates monitoring and access to information.====However, knowledge about the effect of proximity on intra-group lending in internal capital markets is limited. Although proximity plays an important role in the determinants of intra-group loan pricing (==== provides detailed arguments on this point), previous studies on internal capital markets focus on the economic consequences or operational efficiency of firm activities and pay no attention to the role of proximity in internal capital markets. For instance, some scholars argue that an internal market may lead to efficient group-wide capital allocation by acting as an intermediary that enhances information flow and facilitates coordination among affiliated firms (====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====; ====). Other studies, however, provide evidence that internal markets create inefficiency in intra-capital allocation due to managerial power or the headquarters' socialistic biases (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The mixed findings provide no clear indication of the effects of proximity on intra-group lending.====The extent and mechanisms of the effect of geographic distance on the pricing of intra-group loans in internal capital markets are difficult to determine due to limited data availability. To estimate the effect, we must know the locations of borrowers and lenders, as well as specific loan terms, such as ====, amounts, and maturities. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effect of geographic distance on intra-group loan pricing using hand-collected data on entrusted loans in China's internal capital market.====In this study, we attempt to answer the abovementioned two issues using a hand-collected dataset on entrusted loans from the Chinese stock market. China provides an ideal laboratory for examining the relationship between proximity and loan pricing within a business group. Since its reform and opening up in the 1980s, the Chinese capital market has experienced the implementation of a development strategy dominated by the government, the restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and the reverse take-over (RTO) of private enterprises. Consequently, numerous business groups in China reallocate capital through intra-group loans, capital budgets, and cross-shareholdings. Moreover, China is a country with a vast territory, resulting in business groups that have affiliated firms located in geographically distant regions.====Chinese financial regulations prohibit firms from lending to each other directly, but entrusted loans are allowed.==== According to ====, approximately 80% of entrusted loans are offered to the lenders' subsidiaries, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) mandates that listed firms disclose all of their entrusted loans in official documents. Therefore, detailed information about loan contracts (e.g., interest rates, maturities, amounts, and collateral) and the locations of lenders and borrowers are available.====We use Google Earth to identify the latitudes and longitudes of firms' addresses and then calculate the aerial distances between the geographic coordinates. On the basis of the distance between lenders and borrowers, we regress the prices of intra-group loans on geographic distances and find that loan prices increase significantly with increments in distance between borrowers and lenders.====Our results may be biased due to endogeneity. A lender firm might endogenously select a borrower firm located at an optimal distance on the basis of the characteristics of the firm and the requirements of the lenders, which may be unobservable to an econometrician. Hence, the relation between distance and interest rate will interact with the effect of the lender's self-selection. We formally address this potential ==== by introducing a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to explore whether the interest rate decreases when places are connected by the high-speed railway (HSR). In particular, we construct a subsample of borrowers and lender firms located in different provinces. We match the opening time of the HSR in different cities with the sample. We find that the interest rate decreases significantly after HSR construction, thereby indicating the robustness of our finding that geographic distance has a significant effect on loan pricing in the internal capital market.====We also conduct a battery of cross-sectional tests to distinguish the effect of geographic proximity from the effects of other factors. In particular, we show that our results are strong (i) for lenders whose headquarters are time constrained; (ii) during the early years of our sample period, when the Internet and transportation infrastructure were less developed; and (iii) for borrowers for whom information uncertainty is likely to be substantial and soft information is likely to be valuable, such as young borrowers and borrowers operating in ==== that are dissimilar to the lenders' main industry.====We contribute to the literature on the role of geography in economic activities and on firms' capital allocation in internal capital markets. First, we directly show that geographic distance plays a significant role in internal capital markets, which means that the information collection and monitoring associated with distance are important determinants of capital allocation in business groups. Thus, we fill a gap in our understanding of loan pricing within internal capital markets. Second, our cross-sectional tests shed new light on the important externality of innovations in information technology and the development of transportation infrastructures; specifically, externality seems to facilitate the efficiency of firms' investments by reducing the costs of information collection and monitoring. Our results have important policy implications for regulators interested in the development of informal finance.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses related work and develops testable hypotheses. ==== describes the data, variables, and methodology. ==== reports the empirical results for the effects of geographic distance on loan pricing in internal capital markets. ==== concludes.","Proximity, information, and loan pricing in internal capital markets: Evidence from China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300227,April 2019,2019,Research Article,471

What create Chinese economic miracle? ==== leads us to a new thought==== of explaining economic growth that it is the country's institutional arrangements that provide the incentive structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth, stagnation, or decline. Recent experiences of transition and developing economies have also shown that a core barrier or assistor to economic development was from the governments, especially local governments (====), as their ability of local public provision might have either adverse or favorable effects on local achievements and economic development (====; ====; ====; ====).====In Chinese reality, one of the most powerful institutional incentives is the ¡°Promotion Tournament Game¡± (PTG) Pattern,==== in the sense that it bonds centralized executive power together with strong stimulates, thus the pursuit of the economic performance will never change no matter what transitions of the local leadership will be.====Under the incentive mechanism of PTG, officials' promotion not only depends on the individual characteristics of local officials, but also relies on the degree of contribution to the local economy, which reflects personal capacity on scarce resources allocation==== (====; ====; ====). As local officials, the most direct way to participate in the development of economy lies in the supply of public goods. Therefore, this paper first elaborates the promotion of municipal officials and then investigates whether official promotions will be affected by local public financial activities and how much influence of such effect. Through this way, we can thus detect a certain political mechanism that is consistent with local fiscal expansion and reflects the useful insights for constructive policy discussion.====In recent years, some empirical studies have been contributed to analyze the local official promotion (====; ====). For instance, ==== reported that Chinese central government consciously motivates provincial leaders through linking their turnover to economic growth and the promotion of local officials highly relies on provincial economic performance. However, the existing research is mainly at the provincial level. Accordingly, a series studies focused on expanding this issue to city level officials (====; ====). Choosing the city level data to analyze official promotion mainly ascribed to (1) municipal officials are in the major, and large samples can provide more accurate data reflection; (2) the promotion of provincial officials often have many political considerations, and municipal officials are relatively far from the center power, and thus the political influence could be minimized. For example, ==== used the official individual effects to predict promotion probability in city level data. In our view, compared with economic performance or regional economic growth rate, officials' fiscal behavior is a more direct reflection of officials' participation in the economy and their ability to control economic resources, and also better reflect officials' personal abilities. Therefore, the officials' financial behavior should be considered as explaining variable into the investigation of political officials' promotion. However, as far as we know, the influence of officials' financial behavior, as an explaining variables on local official promotion, has rarely been examined. Thus, the main contributions of this paper was to expand the study of local official promotion to city level officials on the basis of officials' financial behavior. Besides, this research covered 284 cities for the local official promotion over longer period (1990¨C2016) with the sample of both local Secretary of a City Party Committee (SCPC) and the Mayor.

Because of China's ==== (household registration) system and limited education resources in the city, migrant children are not unconditionally entitled to enroll in urban public schools (====; ====). Although policies have waxed and waned over time regarding the extent to which migrant children are allowed to enroll in urban public schools, the fact is that a large share of migrant children study at private migrant schools (====; ====), especially in large cities such as Shanghai and Suzhou (====).====This situation has led to the establishment of private schools for migrant children, which are quite unique in China. Several studies have shown that these schools have poor facilities, high tuition fees and a high teacher-turnover ratio (====; ====; ====). Therefore, there is reason to believe that the quality of education in private migrant schools might be low (====). Although the poor educational quality and inadequate management of private migrant schools have been seriously criticized, it is undeniable that these schools guarantee migrant children's right to an education, at least to an extent.====). The effective assignment of peer groups can also help optimize school academic performance, thus promoting the accumulation of human capital. Peer groups tend to form their own unique culture, learning environment and functional mechanisms, all of which influence their attitudes and actions, which in turn affect their behavior and academic performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). One possible mechanism of this approach is that students instruct each other. The second is that it helps reduce classroom disruption and enhance study atmosphere. The third is that it allows teachers to match more accurate instructions to students' specific needs (====).====Although numerous studies have examined peer effects on students' performance, only one such study has focused on children in private migrant schools with poor facilities and less educated teachers (====). Based on a randomized trial conducted with primary students in private migrant schools in Beijing, ====In previous studies, peer effects have been examined at both the grade or class level (====; ====; ====; ====) and the individual or group level within a class (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Average academic performance scores of all other students in a specific grade or class are normally used to test peer effects on an individual's achievement at the grade or class level (====; ====; ====; ====). For example, ==== investigated peer effects at the grade level using the data of high-school students from the 10th to the 12th grade in Jiangsu Province, China, showing that a 1% increase in the average score of other students resulted in 8¨C15% increases in an individual's score. At the individual level, ==== investigated the peer effects in 7th-grade students at a Chinese junior secondary school. The authors used the characteristics of deskmates and neighboring students (based on gender or average grades) to represent the peer effects of an individual, finding that the presence of a female peer could increase females' scores by 0.20 to 0.30 points.====The findings of previous studies of peer effects on student performance are also mixed (====). Most scholars believe that peers with good academic scores tend to have a positive influence on individual academic scores (====; ====; ====; ====). However, others find minimal or even negative peer effects on individual academic performance. Using data on medical students from 1996 to 1998, ==== found that after controlling the fixed effects of institutions, peer effects had a minimal influence on individual scores. Using data from Boston University, ==== found that peer scores had virtually no influence on individual scores. Meanwhile, peer effects are not static, and there is increasing evidence that peer effects vary by student ability, race, socioeconomic status, and gender (====). Hence, there is a need for additional empirical studies on peer effects in private migrant schools.====With respect to the methods used in assessing peer effects, randomized interventions (====; ====), natural experiments (====) and fixed-effects models (====) have been primarily applied in previous studies to control for the peer's self-selection effect and thereby are used to analyze peer effects at the individual level. Although the randomized test approach is ideal to address the issue of selection bias, its implementation is rather difficult and the randomization level is questionable, as the individuals in a controlled group are not sampled from the entire population. Thus, some researchers simulate randomized test conditions in studies related to natural experiments. The natural experiment approach can not only eliminate selection bias but also prevent both the implementation difficulties and the high costs of randomized tests. However, the correct conditions for natural experiments are difficult to find in the real world. Instrumental variables and fixed-effects models are also common options to control for the peer's self-selection effect. Compared to randomized interventions and natural experiments, they are very likely to be conducted. In this study, we use the education level of the peer's parents as the instruments for the peer's performance.====The analysis of this study aims to address the following questions: 1) do peer effects occur in the educational setting of private migrant schools in urban China? and 2) how do peer effects affect student academic performance in these schools? To answer these questions, survey data from more than 3000 students at 87 migrant schools in Shanghai and Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, are used. The two-stage least squares method with the instrumental variable is employed to control for the endogeneity of peer performance. The answers to the questions raised have important policy-related and practical significance with respect to optimizing the allocation of local education resources and increasing the effectiveness of investment of rural human resources. This study also adds to the limited literature examining peer effects on the academic performance of rural students at private migrant schools.====In the next section, we present our empirical models to examine peer effects on student academic performance at both the class and the individual levels.

We find that across schools, migrant students with better family background enter into schools with higher quality. Within the same schools, migrant students perform as well as their local counterparts, in both cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of within-school discrimination against migrant students within public schools, and the key to improving their education is access to better schools.","China has experienced unprecedented large-scale internal migration during the last several decades. Most internal migrants are farmers seeking job opportunities in cities. Among these migrants, around 20 million are school-age children who are brought to cities by their parents based on estimates from the 2010 Census (====). These migrant children are particularly vulnerable due to two reasons. First, most of them come from disadvantageous family backgrounds, as their parents are recent migrant farmers. Second, because they do not have local ====,==== migrant students do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as local ==== children. But nowadays, they consist a significant proportion of China's urban student body. According to estimates based on the 2010 census, one in four students in Chinese urban schools are migrants without local ==== (====), and the proportion is much higher in large cities.==== Education of this vulnerable population is not only critical to themselves and their families, but also has profound long-term consequences on China's future economic growth and societal development (====).====In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was very difficult for migrant children to enroll in public schools, and the majority of them had to go to informal migrant schools. However, the State Council issued a directive in 2001 requiring local governments to do two things. First, the migrant-receiving cities should take the main responsibility for the education of migrant children. Second, public schools should be the main places where migrant students receive education. Since then, local governments have gradually opened up urban public schools to migrant kids. As a result, most migrant students in cities now study in public schools. According to a State Council report, in 2014, around 80% of all migrant students in Chinese cities were in public schools (====).====Nevertheless, partly due to limited access, most of the existing research on migrant students neglected public schools and only focused on migrant schools (see e.g. ====, ====; ====; ====). This is particularly striking given that the government's ultimate policy goal is to enroll all migrant students in public schools. The only two existing studies on migrant students in public schools (====; ====) that we are aware of are on middle schools.==== Meanwhile, both studies analyze only the effect of migrant students on their local peers. Research is apparently lacking in extending the study of migrant students in public schools to the elementary school stage and focusing on the education of migrant students themselves. In response to such incompleteness, the current study intends to provide a thorough analysis of migrant children's education in public elementary schools, including school selections, performance on both the cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions, and possible discrimination within schools.====Using our self-collected panel data from 11 public elementary schools in Shanghai in 2010 and 2012, we find that within schools, migrant students perform as well as their local peers. The math test scores are the same for migrants students and local Shanghai students in the same schools. In addition, there are no systematic differences in a wide range of non-cognitive indicators, such as personal feelings about schools and their value systems. In addition, we find no evidence of within-school discrimination against migrant students within public schools, as they are equally likely to be selected as group leaders and receive good assessments from teachers.====Nevertheless, test scores of migrant students are still lower than Shanghai students on average, which are entirely due to between-school test score differences. Given that school choices are not random, we examine in detail sorting of students across schools. We use two indices of school quality to show that students with better family background are more likely to go to better schools, especially for those migrant students. As a result, migrant students are disproportionably represented in public schools that are of lower quality. We also confirm that the causality does not go the other way - these lower quality schools perform worse not because there are more migrant students.====Our study has important policy implications. There have been many misconceptions about what public schools can do and should do in the education of migrant children. Some people argue that school quality does not matter, as migrant children's parents do not care about and cannot help with their children's study. Therefore, it is not necessary to put them into public schools. Others caution that migrant children might be discriminated by teachers and students from urban public schools, so it is for their own interests to stay in migrant schools, or to be segregated into different classrooms from local students in the same schools. Still, many people, especially parents of local ==== students, worry that the inflow of migrants would lower the quality of education in public schools. Our empirical exercises from Shanghai find no evidence for any of these arguments. Rather, we show that to promote migrant children's performance, the key is to allow them to enter better schools.====The rest of the paper goes as follows.

We integrate the analysis by Lall and Albaladejo (World Development, 2004), based only on China and its main Asian competitors' market share dynamics, by estimating an extended version of a traditional export function, derived from the imperfect substitute model, including a proxy of non-price competitiveness. The key long-run elasticities for each Asian exporter are thus computed and discussed in a panel-data framework, and the different export performances are examined taking into account the interaction between the estimated parameters and the growth rates of relative prices, foreign demand and product quality. Lastly, we decompose the textile export growth differences between China and its rivals into the three main channels of trade competition, i.e. price, quantity and quality. Our findings show that China is crowding out most of its rivals with a competitive strategy based on a mix of low and decreasing relative prices and non-price policies aiming at stimulating export volumes. However, certain weaknesses in the Chinese trade prospects emerge when quality improvement is considered.","According to the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, countries tend to specialize in the production and export of goods which use as inputs the factors of production that are relatively more abundant. Consequently, as economic development proceeds, countries are expected to specialize increasingly in capital-intensive products and abandon labor-intensive ones. This implies, in general, that developed economies shift their output and export composition towards more high-tech products, while developing countries tend to concentrate on traditional sectors. International competition is thus stronger in countries with similar factor endowments, and vice versa.====In recent decades, the implementation and gradual abolition of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) and China's subsequent accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), leading to the dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers to exports, have triggered profound changes in the dynamics and composition of world trade,====Literature on the impact of Chinese export performance on world trade has flourished, and a survey of its main findings would require an entire ad hoc paper (see, for example, ==== and ====). Focusing on empirical studies investigating the repercussions of China's export success on its neighboring Asian economies, which are the most exposed to the Chinese competitive threat because of their geographical proximity and output specialization,==== ==== find that Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore suffered the greatest market share losses, with Japan also appearing as a vulnerable exporter. Similar conclusions are obtained by ====, who find that China has crowded out many high-income Asian exporters, while ==== and, more recently, ==== observe that the growth of Chinese exports has had a positive effect on high-income and middle-income Asian economies (Japan, Singapore and South Korea, and Malaysia and the Philippines, respectively), with negative effects confined to low-income Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka).==== find that, in high-tech products, China displaced its developing competitors (India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), with stronger effects especially in the period prior to the global financial crisis of 2008. With regard to textiles and clothing, ==== find that higher-income Asian economies fared better than their lower-income counterparts in the time period 1990¨C2005.====In line with the Heckscher-Ohlin theory, the extraordinary rise of China's market share in world trade has been accompanied by a notable change in its export structure, shifting away from traditional to more sophisticated goods (====; ====; ====; ====). In fact, China has also become one of the top high-tech exporters since 2013.==== However, and contrary to the implications of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, China has also become the top world exporter in a very traditional sector like textiles, where its world market share more than tripled in the period 2001¨C2016, rising from 10.66 to 36.22%.==== The clothing sector showed a similar performance, although at a lower rate, since the Chinese market share practically doubled in the same period (====, who consider however only the dynamics of relative export market shares during the 1990s and use data in monetary values. ==== thus overlook the behavior of quantities, absolute and relative prices and their interdependence with traded volumes. In fact, a change in the relative price of an exported good can have either a positive or a negative effect on the market share in value, depending on the price elasticity of its export function. If the export function is price-elastic, a variation in relative prices triggers a more than proportional change in quantities exported, with a consequent opposite repercussion on the dynamics of market shares in values. Hence a more accurate and thorough analysis of China's export performance needs to consider the joint behavior of relative prices and quantities, together with their interdependence as formalized by an estimated export demand function.====Thus, after an introductory analysis of market share behavior, we proceed with a panel-data estimation of an extended version of the traditional export function derived from the imperfect substitute model, which, following recent indications of ¡®new trade theory¡¯, also includes a proxy of non-price competitiveness (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== outlines the criteria chosen for the selection of China's competitors in world textile trade and briefly describes the main stylized facts related to this trade. ==== presents the empirical framework adopted and outlines the three channels through which export competition can occur and the conditions for testing China's export performance ==== its competitors. ==== describes the data used in the subsequent analysis together with their relevant statistics. ==== discusses the empirical results and their main implications for interpreting the observed events. ==== complements the previous results with an additional investigation of the similarity between China's textile exports and those of its competitors.

While the discrepancy of China-U.S. trade surplus has been thoroughly studied by scholars and policymakers, the discrepancy of China-EU trade surplus is barely discussed in literatures. This may lead to seriously bias in understanding China-EU trade relationship, and even cause unnecessary trade friction. In this paper, we discuss the reasons behind the discrepancy of China-EU trade and quantify the extent to which the discrepancy is contributed by transportation costs, re-exports and their markups. We also employ the input-output tables of both EU and China, and measure the China-EU trade balance of goods and services in both domestic value-added (DVA) terms as well as in gross terms. The discrepancy of China-EU trade balance in goods (and services) still exists after adjustments, but is significantly reduced. With the adjustments on price and re-exports, in 2016, the discrepancy of China-EU trade in goods and services of Chinese release over EU release would shrink from an initial estimation of US$90.6 billion to an estimation of US$20.4 billion in gross terms, and further to US$15.8 billion in value-added terms.","Similarly, significant discrepancy also exists regarding China-US trade surplus between the Chinese release and the US release, and has drawn extensive attentions not only from scholars (see, e.g. ====; ==== and ====; ====), but also from policymakers. In particular, the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) established a so-called joint statistical working group in 2004, composed by participants from the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese General Administration of Customs, as well as the US Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative, to analyze the reasons behind the statistical discrepancy of China-US trade surplus. Their report (====) highlighted reasons including (a). Chinese statistics fails to include goods shipped indirectly from China via Hong Kong and other intermediary countries or regions to the US (see also, ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), and (b). The value declared to the US customs at the time of importation was higher than the value declared to the Chinese customs at the time of exportation, mainly due to markups of processing products. A consistent finding is thus that the US releases overestimated China-US trade surplus. ====, for example, found that the China-US trade surplus is about $132 billion in 2015, only slightly more than a third of the US records at $367 billion, and focusing solely on the trade deficit records is misleading and ignores the significant benefits of the bilateral trade for both Chinese and the US economy.====While the discrepancy of China-US trade surplus has been thoroughly studied, the discrepancy of China-EU trade surplus was barely discussed. Although the level of discrepancies of China-EU trade surplus has dropped to US$53.6 billion in 2015, in 2016 it expanded again to US$62.2 billion, with the EU release higher than the Chinese release by 47.5%. This may distort the picture of China-EU trade balance and even lead unnecessary trade conflicts. In this context, our paper plans to fill the gap by exploring the sources behind the discrepancy of China-EU trade and reaching consistent estimations on China-EU trade balance. By doing so, we also hope we can help to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding in China-EU trade surplus and reach a consensus to its future development.====More specifically, in this paper we follow the studies on discrepancy of China-US trade especially ==== and ====, and quantify the extent to which the discrepancy of China-EU trade is contributed by re-exports and markups. In addition, it has been widely accepted that gross terms recorded by customs may overestimate the value-added a country received from its exports against the background of increasing international fragmentation. As a result, the domestic value-added (DVA) content in global trade gradually became a focus for academic institutions (see, e.g., ====, ====, ====; ====; ====, ====), governmental agencies (====With growing international fragmentation of production, the production process for products has been separated into different steps that are performed in different countries. As a result, the value-added are shared by many countries and regions instead of the final exporters. However, the rule of origin in current trade statistics fails to describe the entire production process. This led to double-counting to varying degrees and distorted the actual imbalance in bilateral trade, and may also result in misjudgment about trade decisions or macroeconomic policies. This problem becomes even more serious for countries with large processing trade, such as China. For example, the value-added of iPod created in China only amounted to 3% of the ex-factory price. A large share of the value-added was reaped by the US, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and other developed regions (====). Thus, the domestic value-added (DVA) content in global trade gradually became a focus for academic institutions, governmental agencies, and international organizations, such as WTO, OECD, and the World Bank since it can reflect the gain of the countries along the value chain more precisely.====The input-output model can give a detailed description of the interdependency between different countries/regions and different industries, so it has been widely used for tracing the goods flow from a GVC perspective. Currently, frequently used international input-output tables include the Asian International Input-Output (AIO) table, the World Input-output Database (WIOD), the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database, OECD-WTO TiVA databases,==== and the Eora multi-regional input-output (MRIO) database (see ==== for a review). These databases differ in terms of coverage, data resources, and construction methods.

This study examines the impacts of parental migration on the educational outcomes (specifically math achievement) and mental health (specifically anxiety) of LBCs using data covering 7495 children in a prefecture of Shaanxi Province (from three surveys conducted between 2012 and 2014). We distinguish between ¡°both parents migrating,¡± ¡°one parent migrating,¡± ¡°only a father migrating,¡± and ¡°only a mother migrating.¡± We also explore the impacts on male versus female LBCs. We find no significant impact of parental migration on the math achievement of LBCs. In terms of mental health, however, our results indicate that left-behind girls were negatively affected by one parent migrating, especially if the migrating parent was the father. The findings suggest that it may not be necessary for policy makers to design special programs to improve educational outcomes of LBCs in general. However, local committees, schools, and parents should pay particular attention to left-behind girls living with only one parent, as they may be more vulnerable to mental health problems than their peers.","Since the 1980s, China's rapid development, enabled by the Open Door Policy and an increasing trend of globalization, has resulted in unprecedented growth of economically-driven rural to urban migration (====; ====; ====). Consequently, a new subpopulation has emerged in China: left-behind children (LBCs), who stay at home while one or both of their parents relocate elsewhere to work for a significant length of time (====; ====). The estimated number of LBCs in 2013 was sixty-one million, three times higher than the number estimated in 2000 (====).====As the number of LBCs swells rapidly, researchers and policy makers have turned their attention to the educational development and mental health of this population. International scholarship has recognized both positive and negative impacts of parental migration. ====; ====). In China, the results from the existing literature on the impacts of urban migration on LBCs are not clear-cut: while some studies have underscored detrimental effects on education and mental health due to family disruption (====), others have considered urban migration as a household strategy which may significantly improve socioeconomic circumstances and thereby help LBCs perform at least as well as non-LBCs on various child outcomes (====).====One reason for the mixed nature of the literature is the heterogeneity of LBCs as a population (====When we examine the literature on primary school LBCs, we find that these studies, like the literature as a whole, has considerable variation in outcomes. Looking more closely, clear patterns emerge based on wealth. Students in poorer areas enjoy rising academic outcomes when their parents live and work in the city as migrants. In contrast, students in wealthier areas see negative impacts (====; ====; ====). The interpretation of this pattern is that when parents leave home and children stay behind, there is both a positive income effect and a negative absence-of-care effect, a dynamic that has been widely discussed in the literature (====; ====; ====). When households are poorer, the income effect appears to dominate, and students improve their academic performance. When households are not poor, however, the income effect may be weaker, and the care effect may begin to dominate; as a result, the academic performance of students suffers.====In contrast, mental health outcomes of primary school LBCs have the opposite pattern to that of academic performance. Although primary school students overall show worse mental health outcomes when parents migrate (====; ====;====; ====), several studies have found that the impacts of parental migration on mental health are worse for poor students compared to wealthy students (====; ====). This suggests that decreased care is the main factor impacting mental health outcomes for primary school LBCs.====This fairly consistent set of patterns of the impact of migration on left-behind children disappears when looking at samples of adolescent LBCs. One of the reasons for this may be that there are much fewer studies of adolescent LBCs than of primary school-aged LBCs. When we examine the literature on academic performance among adolescent LBCs, we find that one study shows a slightly negative impact of parental migration on the academic performance of adolescent LBCs (====); one study shows a slightly positive impact (====; ====); and one study shows no impact (====). These patterns, however, cannot be ascribed to baseline wealth levels, mainly because each of these studies uses data from mixed-income samples and do not examine the effects of wealth on academic performance.====Regarding the literature on mental health, only one study has examined the mental health of adolescent LBCs (====). Though this study found a negative impact of parental migration, it also is unclear how wealth mediates this impact, as this study examined students in a middle-income area of rural Guangdong and did not examine the role of wealth in affecting mental health. Overall, there is a great need for more information on adolescent LBCs ¨C particularly specific economic groups of adolescent LBCs ¨C to better understand the impacts of parental migration on academic performance and mental health.====In addition to these patterns, we examined the literature for patterns regarding parental migration type and gender. Unfortunately, few studies have examined either of these factors. Only two studies have analyzed how the exact type of parental migration (that is, one parent migrating or both parents migrating) may impact LBC outcomes, and both of these studies focus on mental health outcomes, not educational outcomes. ==== found that LBCs feel greater loneliness when both parents migrate compared to both non-LBCs and LBCs with one parent migrating. In contrast, ==== found that there are no significant differences in the anxiety levels of LBCs with both parents migrating, LBCs with one parent migrating, and children who live with both parents. There is little information to account for these differences, as these studies focus on different age groups (Sun et al. examine primary school students while Zhou et al. look at a mixed-age sample), and neither examines other factors such as wealth. To our knowledge, no study has examined the effects of parental migration type on adolescent LBCs specifically. Moreover, no study examines the role that the gender of the migrating parent may play in LBC outcomes.====Similarly, the gender of LBCs as a factor has not been closely examined in the literature. Research on adolescent psychology suggests that adolescent boys and girls react differently to family disruptions such as parental migration (====), indicating that there could possibly be gendered differences in LBC outcomes. In the context of rural China, where families have traditionally devoted more resources to boys (====; ====; ====), it also possible that the dynamics of increased income and decreased have gendered impacts. However, few studies have examined the different outcomes of LBC girls and boys. While two studies of LBCs of mixed ages (ranging from early primary school to late secondary school) have found that the academic performance of LBC girls is both more negatively impacted by parental absence and more positively impacted by increased income (====; ====In addition to the heterogeneity of LBCs, another possible reason for the mixed findings in the literature on LBC outcomes may be that the majority of studies are correlational and do not address causation. A number of studies on LBC outcomes rely on cross-sectional data (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), which makes it difficult to determine causality. Among causal studies, several have relied on samples of <2000 students (====; ====), which may not provide the statistical power necessary to accurately identify the impacts of parental migration. Additionally, other papers have relied on study samples consisting of a few towns or one county (e.g. ====) or areas with a high proportion of ethnic minorities (====) which are not representative of LBCs overall.====The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of the relationship between short-term parental migration and LBC development outcomes in low-income areas. To achieve this goal, we have three specific objectives. First, we will examine the both the correlations and the causal impacts of parental migration on the educational and mental health outcomes of LBCs. Secondly, we will identify how different types of parental migration, including ¡°both parents migrating,¡± ¡°one parent migrating,¡± ¡°only mother migrating,¡± and ¡°only father migrating,¡± affect the educational and mental health outcomes for LBCs. Finally, we will examine whether parental migration impacts differ according to the gender of LBCs.","Parental migration, educational achievement, and mental health of junior high school students in rural China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X19300070,April 2019,2019,Research Article,478

Employing the gravity-based method of ==== to calculate the market access available to firms located in each city, we test whether the elasticity of the wage with respect to local market access increased over time. We find that in all three years market access of the worker's location has a positive and significant influence on the wage. Consistent with extensive ==== of the late 1990s, the estimated wage elasticity doubles between 1995 and 2002 and is stable thereafter. Our estimates indicate that wages of all workers become more responsive to market forces in a manner consistent with NEG predictions, both skilled and unskilled and those working for state as well as private enterprises. We also provide evidence that these results are not driven by omission of other forms of agglomeration or by selection bias. Estimated spatial differences in nominal wages are large: a worker moving from an inland location to the coast in 2007 would have doubled his or her nominal wage. Counterfactual analysis indicates that spatial differences in market access contribute to wage inequality, but less so over time."," which remade employer-employee relations and expanded employment flexibility. Due partly to these reforms, the nominal annual wage of urban workers increased from 5500 yuan in 1995 to 25,000 yuan in 2007, with an 11.4% per annum real growth rate (====).====This wage growth was accompanied by rising inequality across a variety of dimensions. ==== examine the determinants of urban wages in China from 1988 to 2002 and find increased returns to education but decreased returns to experience. Meanwhile, gender wage inequality worsened. ==== use individual survey data to find that compared to the wages of female workers with similar observable characteristics, the wages of male workers were 10.5% higher in 1995, 17.4% higher in 2002, and almost 29.7% higher in 2007. At the same time, distinct features of the planned economy have eroded: ==== find that once prominent public-private sector earnings gaps decreased in urban China between 2002 and 2007.====The unleashing of market forces also increased spatial wage dispersion. ====, through an analysis of data from household surveys, find that about 11% of urban wage inequality is explained by the province in which the worker is employed. ==== report that in 2002, 19% of urban income inequality could be attributed to provincial differences in mean incomes. These nominal wage differences were offset to some extent by higher living costs in those cities experiencing rapid growth. ==== report that adjusting for spatial price differences among cities and incorporating rural¨Curban migrants into inequality calculations both reduce estimated measured inequality.====The emergence of such large spatial wage differences presents a challenge for inclusive growth. If China's product and factor markets are integrating internal and internationally, why are spatial wage gaps growing instead of shrinking? ====, Hering and Poncet estimate individual wage equations and find strong evidence of a positive and statistically significant relationship between nominal wages in 1995 and the market access of the worker's location. They also find that this relationship is stronger for skilled workers and for those employed by foreign-invested firms. Key innovations of the Hering-Poncet approach are their use of detailed Chinese customs data to structurally estimate market access and their use of microdata from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) for the wage equation.====While they speculate that deeper integration may worsen spatial wage disparities, ==== revisit the relationship between market access and wages in their study of 2002 wages in China. They find that nominal wages are strongly influenced by the market access of the worker's location in both 1995 and 2002.==== In particular, they find that the estimated elasticity of the wage with respect to market access of the worker's location more than doubles over the period. A shortcoming of the study, however, is its use of an ad hoc measure of market access, necessitated by a lack of access to detailed Chinese trade data.====We extend the analysis of spatial wage differentials by using NEG methods to measure market access and estimate wage equations with 2002 and 2007 microdata on Chinese workers. We link cross-city variation in wages to spatial differences in access to markets, with a particular focus on how the intensity of this relationship has changed over time and among different groups of workers. Beyond its contribution as further evidence of the empirical relevance of NEG models, the analysis documents the progression of market forces in shaping Chinese wages and, thus, bears further witness to the transformation of economic relations within the country.====A notable feature of our analysis, as in ====, is its reliance on detailed information on trade flows among Chinese provinces and between the provinces and foreign countries, as needed to implement the ==== empirics. The benefit of this approach is twofold. First, the resulting estimating equations are closely linked to the underlying theory, allowing estimated coefficients to be interpreted as structural parameters. Second, the gravity-like regressions used to measure market access provide useful information in their own right, on both the trade-diminishing influence of distance and on the extent of internal and external barriers to Chinese exports.====We estimate the strength of the hypothesized relationship between local market access and local wages using the 1995, 2002, and 2007 waves of the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). With these three cross-sections, we chart the influence of market access on wages over a period of intense domestic reforms and international integration. We are able to test whether this relationship differs by a worker's ==== or type of employer. Special features of the 2007 CHIP survey allow us to assess whether one form of selection bias affects our estimates. We address endogeneity concerns caused by inclusion of the worker's own-location in market access calculations.

We study the causal effect of education on personal religious beliefs and explore the potential mechanisms. The empirical results show that education can lead to secularization. More precisely, individual religious belief decreases by 1.5% with one additional year of personal education. In addition, the increase in regional urbanization significantly affects religious beliefs by replacing the insurance function of religion and reducing information acquisition costs. Moreover, there is an alternative relationship between religious activities and social activities, and women affected by the CEL experience a higher negative impact on religious beliefs than men.","European countries experienced massive secularization in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as a decline in church participation (====), which led to the emergence of secularization theory. Most of the existing studies on the theory of secularization are based on studies in developed countries whose process of secularization has basically formed; however, there is a lack of studies in developing countries. In particular, since the second half of the 20th century, most developing countries around the world have experienced an increase in the average level of education, and the extent to which education can explain those countries' secularization is an important question. As the largest developing country and a typical East Asian country, China provides a good background for testing the theory of secularization. ==== even thinks that applying secularization theory to China can help us explore the question of whether secularization is viable as a theoretical account of religious change. Therefore, we adopt the implementation of the CEL in China as the exogenous factor of individual education level and study the influence of education on secularization.====The secularization hypothesis was first proposed by ====. In the field of economics, Jacob ==== defined the concept of secularization as ¡°a lessening of the influence on ethical and economic thought of ecclesiastical authority and traditional church creeds, and a shifting of weight from dogma and revelation and other-worldliness to reason and sentiment and considerations of temporal welfare.¡± This definition was then accepted by ====, Barro and Mccleary (2003) and ==== and became an important topic in the study of religious theory. There are two types of literature on the secularization hypothesis, namely, demand-side research based on religious demand preference and supply-side research based on the religious market model.====The demand-side research based on religious demand preference mainly analyzes the motives of individual religious belief, such as education (====; ====; ====), personal income (====; ====), income inequality (====) and economic development (====; ====). For instance, ==== finds that income is the main factor affecting individual religious belief and higher income families have a higher frequency of religious participation. However, ==== argue that education (not income) is a major factor leading to secularization. In addition, the development of urbanization, economic growth and the improvement of educational levels can also diminish religious belief and the role of religious organizations (====).====; ====; ====; ====). Religious diversity in a country or region promotes religious market competition, so higher quality religious products affect religious participation and belief. ==== demonstrate that there is a competitive relationship between church participation and secularization. However, since both religious demands and religious supplies (such as the number of churches) are inherently relevant, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of these two concepts (====). This strand of literature focuses mostly on testing the influence of education on the hypothesis of demand-side secularization.====The argument that there is a positive or negative relationship between education and secularization has existed for a long time (====). Some scholars argue that the improvement of educational levels in natural science will reduce the belief in religious authenticity and supernatural forces (====; ====). Meanwhile, highly educated people have a higher cost of time, which also has a great influence on religious belief. ==== found that the spread of education and the decline in religious belief coexist in most countries. The conclusions of ==== and ==== also supported the same trend. Nevertheless, some other scholars believe that education enhances an individual's ability to perform abstract thought, which is advantageous for religious study and worship (====). In addition, education might also increase personal interest in religion (====; ====; ====), and advanced education groups could obtain higher returns from church-based social network (====). Therefore, people with a higher education may have a higher interest and demand for religion, raising the level of religious belief. ==== find that, although religion is inversely proportional to overall economic development, it is directly proportional to education. Inannaccone (1998), ==== and ==== reached the same conclusion.==== took the change of school-leaving age as an instrumental variable of the regional education level. Based on the exogenous impact of the CEL in Canada, the IV results show that one extra year of schooling can reduce the rate of personal religious belief by 4%. However, this article used regional data in the analysis, which discounted the influence of individual heterogeneity on religious belief. Meanwhile, the mechanism of the CEL on social secularization was not discussed in the article.==== used panel data in the German urban level from 1890 to 1930, applying the dynamic panel model and the instrumental variable approach (taking the number of schools as the instrumental variable for enrollment), which found that the spread of education has a negative impact on religious participation. However, there were three defects in the article of ====. First, due to data limitations, the article used macro level religious data. This is problematic because the article only controlled the state-level heterogeneity and ignored the individual-level heterogeneity. Second, the article only analyzed the effect of different school types and did not further analyze the impact mechanism of education. Third, the validity of the IV may not be satisfied. The economic growth of a region may not only affect the number of area schools but also affect the local religious belief rate. Therefore, the article took the number of schools as the instrumental variable to study the religious participation issue, but that may lead to the problem that the instrumental variable was incompletely exogenous.====Our analysis makes three main contributions. First, this paper provides evidence from developing countries for the controversy of the secularization hypothesis. Different from developed countries, developing countries are undergoing the process of secularization. However, the existing literature on the theory of secularization is mainly based on studies of Western countries, and there are few studies on developing countries and East Asian countries. Therefore, we study the influence of education on secularization in China, the largest developing country of the world, which helps to expand the literature of secularization theory. Second, this paper extends the literature of the CEL to the religious field. A large number of scholars have studied the influence of the CEL on individual economic behavior, such as income (====), returns to education (====; ====), health (====), teenage childbearing (====), and health (====). There is a lack of research on the influence of the CEL on individual sense of worth and religious activities. Third, based on the instrument variable approach, this paper solves the endogenous problems caused by omitted variables and selection errors. The implementation of the CEL in 1986 provides plausibly exogenous variation in the access to personal educational attainment.====This paper has five main conclusions. First, education has a significant negative impact on individual religious belief, and one extra year of schooling can reduce the rate of personal religious belief by 1.5%. Second, the implementation of the CEL can increase an individual's education years by 0.32¨C0.48?years. Third, after considering the implications of the floating population, eliminating Muslim groups, the placebo test and using other microdata, the above conclusions are still robust. Fourth, for individuals with the same educational level, the higher the urbanization rate in residence is, the lower the probability of religious belief. Fifth, the negative impact of the CEL on religious belief among women is higher than that among men. In addition, there is an alternative relationship between religious activities and social activities.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data source and estimation strategy. Section 3 presents the main results and the robustness of our results. Section 4 provides the possible mechanism analysis.

We first build an overlapping-generations model, where agents make endogenous fertility and old-age labor supply decisions in the presence of fertility constraint. In our model, children serve as an alternative saving technology since they provide intra-family transfer for their old-age parents. Our analytical results suggest that the impact of rising life expectancy on fertility depends on whether children are more like consumption goods or saving vehicles. Relaxing fertility control would induce more leisure in the old age, while a rise in life expectancy would lead to more old-age labor supply. We then calibrate the model to Chinese economy and find that a rise in life expectancy would discourage fertility as intra-family transfer becomes less important. In addition, the implementation of two-children policy rather than full relaxation of fertility control, a rise in child-rearing cost, and an expansion of social security would also reduce fertility, partly offsetting the effects of relaxing one-child policy.","Rapid aging poses a great challenge to the nation's pension system. Furthermore, a declining share of the young population suggests serious labor shortage to future China. And China is not yet a developed country. To cope with these problems, China's government has come up with some solutions. One important solution is to relax the fertility control. In late 2013, the government announces that one couple is allowed to bear two children if one of the parents is the only child of his/her family. By October 2015, it is announced in the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee that all couples are allowed to bear two children. The decades-long one-child policy has now been abandoned.====; ====). According to Census 2005, 41% of urban residents aged 65?years and over claim that their main source of old-age income is family support (====).==== It suggests that, in addition to the conventional argument that children are consumption goods, children also serve as saving vehicles (or investment goods). Households' fertility decision will thus be intertwined with old-age labor supply decision since individual labor supply is another important source of elderly income(====). Furthermore, a rise in life expectancy will also affect these two decisions through its impact on their returns.====In our theoretical analysis, we firstly look into households' optimal old-age labor supply decision, and find that relaxing one-child policy would induce less old-age labor supply since a higher number of children reduces savings and the level of the capital available in the future, causing wage tomorrow to decline. Ceteris paribus, the agent tends to depend more on intra-family transfer to support his old-age consumption, rather than working himself. Nevertheless, a rise in life expectancy would encourage the agent to increase labor supply in the old age. We then focus on households' optimal fertility decision, and find that the impact of life expectancy on fertility depends on whether children are more like consumption goods or saving vehicles. When life expectancy increases, lower lifetime income would reduce the demand for children as consumption goods, while a rise in return to children as saving vehicles would encourage fertility. Hence, the overall change of fertility relies on the importance of intra-family transfer.====When calibrated to Chinese economy, we find that the recent implementation of two-children policy, rather than full relaxation of fertility control may slow the convergence of fertility rate towards the steady state. A rise in child-rearing cost and an expansion of social security would partly offset the effects of relaxing one-child policy. In addition, a rise in life expectancy would also discourage fertility as intra-family transfer becomes less important.Therefore, the relaxation of fertility control may not be effective in increasing fertility and labor supply in China.====Our research is firstly related to the literature linking households' fertility decision with saving (====; ====; ====), social security (====; ====), and growth (====). Starting from ====, fertility decisions are made by altruistic parents who derive utility directly from bearing children. In our paper, the assumption that parents raise children to provide elderly support captures the family arrangements in China more aptly (====). Similar to us, ==== also study households' fertility decision in the presence of intra-family transfer, but their focus is on the effects of social security expansion, instead of a rise in life expectancy.====Our paper is also related to the literature on old-age labor supply. In particular, ====, ====, and ====Furthermore, our paper relates to the emerging literature that discusses the role of life expectancy. In most studies on life expectancy and fertility, children only serve as consumption goods, and a rise in life expectancy tends to reduce fertility (====; ====). In our paper, children are both consumption goods and saving vehicles, and the impacts of life expectancy depends on which role matters more. Recent studies by ====, ====, and ==== focus on longevity, schooling and lifetime labor supply.

First, we developed a bivariate dynamic ","During economic development, labor migrates from the agricultural sector to the nonagricultural sector in the favor of off-farm employment. This process has been particularly dramatic in China. In 2013, approximately 269 million members of the rural labor force worked in nonagricultural sectors for more than 6?months. The large-scale transfer to nonagricultural sectors has caused a substantial amount arable land in China to be used inadequately because of the shortage of land markets that allocate land efficiently for the following 2 reasons: farmers that work off-farm have insufficient time to cultivate their assigned land, and farmers with higher agricultural ability who want to cultivate more land have no access to obtain the arable land that is being inadequately used.====This situation has inevitably led to the land per rural household being scattered spatially. In most villages in China, the land was first partitioned by quality and then allocated by administrative methods to every rural household by family size, and not by the size of the family labor force or agricultural marginal output of every farmer (====Because land reallocation by administration methods has low efficiency, the land market chooses its own way. In 1992, the Nanhai district of Guangdong province implemented the first reform of land rental since 1978; subsequently, spontaneous land rental emerged across the China. At first, the authorities accepted informal land rental. Currently, the Chinese government encourages voluntary land rental and is attempting to establish formal land rental markets. Under these policies, land rental has developed rapidly in rural China. The share of the households renting in and out in a sample of all households was up to 25.3%, according to the data of this study in 2009.====Although the efficacy of land sales has been controversial, the theories and experiences have demonstrated that even though other markets such as labor, credit, and insurance markets are lagging in efficiency, a well-functioning land rental market can play a significant, positive role in optimizing the allocation of agricultural production factors and improving the welfare and equity of rural households (====; ====). To a certain extent, only well-functioning land markets can create the allocation of rural economy resources in an efficient and fair manner (====). Therefore, land rental markets are prevalent worldwide, especially in Asia. The share of land acreage cultivated by pure tenant farmers and owner-cum-tenant farmers in total land acreage in a sample of select countries is as follows: the Philippines at 51.3% in 1991, Bangladesh at 42.3% in 1996, and Indonesia at 18% in 1993 (====). This share is also very high for developed and African countries, such as the United States at 43% in 1992 and Uganda at 36% in 1999 (====).====Most of the empirical literature has provided information regarding the potential of land markets and contractual options (====; ====; ====), and performance of such markets in specific regional contexts (====). Studies have also attempted to identify the determinants of renting in and out and estimate the impact of renting in and out on the welfare of rural households.====The literature has used 2 methods to identify the determinants of renting in and out. One approach is that letting ====, ====, or the actual acreage rented in and out, respectively, be dependent variables. In this study, ==== and ==== are the dummies for ====, and rented in/out is 1 or 0 otherwise; next, the characteristics, for example, the agricultural ability, endowment of resources, transaction costs of land rental, and off-farm opportunities, of rural households are treated as independent variables in a regression model by using OLS estimation (====The second approach is developing a switching regression model defined by 3 market participation regimes and estimated by full information maximum likelihood that takes the renting-in equation as the upper threshold and the renting-out equation as the lower threshold (====). Although this approach considers the endogeneity of the behaviors of land rental, it omits the situation in which rural households simultaneously rent in and rent out the land. In rural China, the shares of the households who rented in and out simultaneously among all the households who participated in land rental were approximately 2.9%¨C3.9% from 2003 to 2009, according to the dataset of this study. Obviously, this scenario will result in a biased estimation to exclude the case; however, the case cannot be included in the switching regression models and requires a new method to identify the determinants of renting in and out.====Although the literature has investigated the impact of land rental on agricultural productivity (====; ====), the welfare consequences of land rental have received less attention (usually measured by the change in net income, consumption expenditure, and balance of disposable financial assets). Assessments of the welfare aspects of land rental are relevant to policymakers who determine the steps required for comprehensive land market development. ==== first used four-period panel data (2001¨C2004) of 8000 rural households to analyze the impact of land rental on the distribution of the income per capita and perform a household fixed effect regression of the net income (after rent fees) on the area rented in and year dummies to control for time varying factors. The results revealed that renting in increases incomes for the same household by approximately 10%.

Using the China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES), we find political connections contribute to innovative activities for those firms with innovative entrepreneurs but impedes innovative activities for those without innovative entrepreneurs. After solving the ","Political connections are a widespread phenomenon in both developed and developing countries (====). Innovation is a key determinant of firm competitiveness in both fast-growing high-tech sectors and more traditional sectors. In spite of a rich body of literature on the effects of political connections on innovation, the empirical evidence on their effects on the innovative performance of firms is mixed. Several studies find that political connections contribute to firm's innovative behaviors (====; ====; ====; ====). Given the uncertain nature of innovation activities, political connections help firms reduce future political uncertainties, enjoy more favorable policies, and acquire disproportionate government resources, thereby improving corporate innovation. In contrast, other studies suggest that political connections have a negative effect on corporate innovation (====; ====; ====; ====). They maintained that an incumbent firm could increase corporate investment in innovation to maintain sufficiently low residual demand for the goods produced by an entrant, or it can use its political capital to obtain various economic benefits and thus maintain high barriers to entry. Therefore, politically connected firms may not have enough incentive to conduct innovative activities if high entry barriers formed by political connections already make market entry unprofitable for potential entrants.====; ====; ====; ====). In other words, politically connected firms have easy access to sufficient financial resources for innovative activities. On the other hands, an innovative entrepreneur places great emphasis on product or service innovation to satisfy or create new demand, thereby gaining market share and profits. Therefore, we hypothesize that whether politically connected firms with financial support contribute to or impede innovation is determined by the spirit of innovation of the entrepreneurs. In particular, an entrepreneur with a strong spirit of innovation makes more investment in innovation after the firm establishes political connections.====Using a unique matched employer-employee survey data focusing on Chinese manufacturing firms from 2013 to 2015, we employ Big Five personality model to construct an index measuring the innovative spirit of a firm's entrepreneurs and attempt to reconcile the mixed effects of political connections on corporate innovation. We empirically find that political connections hamper innovative activity of Chinese firms. After including innovative spirit index and its interaction term with political connections, however, we find that the total effect of political connections on innovation becomes positive when the firm's middle or senior manager has a strong spirit of innovation. The baseline results do not change after we solve the ==== of political connections and correct the sample selection bias. Moreover, our baseline results are robust across different subsamples and different measurements of innovation and innovative spirit.====To complete our analysis, we further explore the reasons why firms with politically connected managers are likely to make more R&D investment if the managers also have a strong spirit of innovation from the two aspects. First, we observe that politically connected firms enjoy favorable treatments from the government, such as tax preference and government subsidies. In other words, politically connected firms have plenty of financial resources that could have used to conduct innovative activities. Second, we consider the firm's investment decision on fixed assets which can be regarded as comparatively low-risk projects, compared to innovative activities. We find that politically connected firms have a strong incentive to increase the fixed asset investment, which may drain economic resources away from other projects like innovative activities. But such positive effect of political connections on the fixed asset investment greatly reduces, and the total effect becomes negative when the firm's middle or senior manager has a strong spirit of innovation. These results provide a reasonable explanation for the change in the direction of the effect of political connections on corporate innovation.====This paper contributes to the existing literature in the following three aspects. First, this paper fills the void in the literature on the effect of political connections on corporate innovation in China. For some reasons like lack of data, researchers have paid little attention to this empirical question in China where political connections are a common phenomenon and universally important. For example, about 68.4% of the Chinese listed firms had some political connections in 2015.==== Moreover, China is now in a transitional period from a ¡°Made in China¡± economy to an ¡°Innovated in China¡± economy, and corporate innovation plays a key role in this process (====). Therefore, studying the effect of political connections on corporate innovation is of great significance for China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.====Second, this paper enriches the literature on political connectedness by demonstrating that the effect of political connections on corporate innovation is subject to entrepreneurship, which represents a step toward reconciling the mixed evidence on their relationship. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to incorporate the innovative spirit into the relationship between political connections and corporate innovation. Our paper also extends the research into innovation and entrepreneurship by introducing political connections that bring economic benefits to firms.====Last but not least, different from prior studies that usually employed publicly traded firms to estimate the value of political connections (====; ====; ====), this paper is one of the first to use a sample of non-listed firms. In most countries, listed firms only account for a small proportion of all enterprises. For instance, there are more than 50 million Chinese firms that only include 2818 listed firms in 2015.==== Importantly, listed firms are usually large-scale enterprises that are significantly different from non-listed firms, which may give rise to a sample selection problem if we only use listed firm to estimate the value of political connections. Therefore, it is hard to make a reliable assessment of the effect of political connections on corporate innovation if we only focus on a sample of listed firms. Our sample was developed by the China Employer and Employee Survey (CEES) and is mainly comprised of non-listed firms.====The paper is structured as follows. ==== introduces the institutional background in China and develops our hypothesis. ==== describes the sample data and introduces identification strategies. ==== presents the empirical results, tests the heterogeneity of baseline results, and conducts a variety of robustness checks. ==== further explores possible mechanisms that explain the main findings. ==== concludes.","Political connections, corporate innovation and entrepreneurship: Evidence from the China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301718,April 2019,2019,Research Article,483

Using provincial panel data of China, covering 30 provinces over the period 2000¨C2014, our results confirm that indigenous R&D investments play a leading role in promoting TFP. Linear analysis suggests that, except for export, the technology spillovers through openness are beneficial for TFP growth. However, a further discussion based on a panel threshold model suggests that the different behaviours of these technology spillovers are dependent on the technological absorptive capacity affecting factors, such as human capital and indigenous R&D investments. The human capital will strengthen the spillover effects of each technology spillover. However, R&D intensity initially tends to hamper their spillover effects. Once the R&D intensity exceeds a certain level, the negative spillover effect of export on TFP tends to be alleviated, and the positive spillover effect of foreign direct investment and import on TFP will increase.","Since the Reform and Opening up initiated in 1978, the Chinese economy has boosted, reflected by an average annual economic growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an unprecedented scale of almost 9.8%, and more than 10% during the period after 1992, reaffirming China's continuous economic opening (==== chose the actual use of FDI to reflect its spillover effect on TFP. ====, ==== defined the effect of FDI on TFP as the ratio of investment in fixed assets by foreign-funded enterprises to gross investment in fixed assets. ==== took the ratio of FDI to GDP to denote its spillover effect on Chinese provincial TFP. Inconsistent with these studies, ==== and ==== borrowed the framework of ==== and ==== (hereafter CH-LP) to investigate the influence of FDI on China's TFP. The same problems can also be found in studies exploring the effects of trade on TFP. Accordingly, the different proxy variables for either FDI or trade may result in biased or mixed regression results. In addition, a few papers have presented the concomitant impacts of indigenous R&D, FDI, export, and import on TFP in the case of China. Analysis and comparison of different technological factors that influence TFP must be conducted under one united framework.====Second, technology spillovers from FDI, export and import on TFP could be heavily influenced by a host country's specific characteristics, such as the stock of human capital, financial development, technological gaps, and indigenous innovation efforts (====; ====; ====; ====). Given that China is a large country with substantial variations in its economic development level across provinces, there is an enormous regional imbalance in terms of technological absorptive capacity, which may lead to different spillover effects (====; ====). Only a few of the previous empirical studies based on China's sub-province data examine this issue. In these extant empirical studies, the conventional linear regression method may suffer multicollinearity problems and fail to solve the problem of a structural break in the impact of technology spillovers on TFP. Consequently, this method only presents an average effect of technological factors on TFP, which is not an objective depiction of reality.====Third, the economic reform will also exert a strong effect on TFP. Countries with judicial and effective economic systems have high incomes and have an abundance of skilled labourers (====; ====; ====). They may have great incentives to develop and maintain a good contracting environment. In these countries, the resources are allocated rationally and the technological innovation factors flow reasonably. Furthermore, enterprises will have a highly appropriate business structure in terms of organisation and work specialisation, thereby encouraging them to specialise in adopting new technologies and management skills, which, in turn, promotes TFP. The effect of the economic reform on TFP has been captured by ====, ====, ====, and ====. The scenario that China's continual economic reform will influence provincial TFP in the long run is expected. However, only a few studies consider the impact of the economic reform on TFP.====To address these aforementioned problems, this study employs the CH-LP framework to examine the technological factors of China's TFP, using both linear and nonlinear analyses. The major contributions are threefold. First, this study considers technological factors, including indigenous R&D and technology spillovers through FDI, export, and import in a comprehensive and united framework, which enables us to compare their relative strengths in influencing TFP concurrently. Second, the roles that the domestic factors affecting absorptive capacity have played in TFP fluctuations are considered, which helps in accounting for regional heterogeneity and understanding how these technological factors affect TFP. Third, this study explores the role of the economic reform in improving TFP, which is seldom discussed in previous literature.====Our paper progresses as follows.

There are a number of mechanisms through which Chinese liberalised trade can effect the emissions of its trading partners. For example, shrinking trade barriers and lower transaction costs reduce the costs of Chinese produced goods allowing for more consumption. Lower trade barriers also alter relative prices causing consumers to increase their demand for lower priced imports, perhaps more GHG-intensive Chinese goods, by substituting away from potentially higher-priced, but less GHG-intensive goods, produced either domestically or abroad.

We focus on China's entry into the WTO because China is the largest exporting developing country, a significant contributor to the large increase in low-wage countries' share of the developed world's aggregate imports (see ====), the second largest source of GHG emissions, and China's admission into the WTO enables us to plausibly identify the causal effects of trade liberalisation on GHG emissions.

The robustness of the OLS results are investigated by using alternative estimators that rely on different identification arguments to identify the causal relationship between Chinese trade liberalisation and GHG emissions in importing countries. First, we exploit the fact that not all domestic sectors were exposed to intensified Chinese imports to estimate difference-in-difference estimators. Second, a concern raised in previous empirical studies is that trade and environmental quality are likely determined simultaneously (see ====We find empirical evidence that China's liberalised trade has had substantial effects on the GHG emissions of its trading partners. Increased trade with China tended to increase the growth of country-sector consumption-based emissions and lower the growth of production-based emissions in importing countries. The cause of the growing gap between consumption and production emissions was large growth of GHG emissions embodied in imports relative to the emissions embodied in domestically produced final consumption goods. Both scale effects and composition effects contribute to the growth of consumption emissions. Growth in the share of imports from China tended to increase consumption and imports and both became more emission intensive.====There are studies that examine the impact of Chinese liberalised trade on GHG emissions both within China and in a global context. For example, using an environmental computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, ==== concludes that China's entry into the WTO reduced carbon emissions in China, whereas ==== by linking the changes in China's exported emissions to changes to the emission structure of China's trading partners.====Our study also contributes to the literature quantifying carbon emissions embodied in international trade. For example, ==== report that 23% of global carbon emissions were traded internationally in 2004. Moreover, there is evidence that emissions embodied in international trade are increasing: ==== find that emissions embodied in international trade increased from 20% in 1990 to 26% in 2008. Perhaps more importantly, they find that the net transfer of emissions from the developing world to developed countries increased by almost 300%. Our study finds empirical evidence that one factor causing the transfer of emissions from developing countries to developed countries is trade liberalisation. Understanding the mechanisms driving the transfer of GHG emissions among countries is important and may assist in the design of future climate and environmental policies.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. We describe the data and the construction of the various measures of GHG emissions in section 2. In section 3, we discuss our empirical strategies and present the results.

This is an important gap in the previous literature because the findings on total employment may not be applicable to self-employment. Entrepreneurs differ from wage-earning workers in their nature: They are motived to be entrepreneurs by both exploring the market opportunity and achieving a better balance between work and family (====). Research that ignores such heterogeneity between self-employed and wage earning workers may incorrectly estimate the effect of work-family policies.====). However, a persistent gender gap in entrepreneurship can be observed worldwide. Women are less likely than men to participate in entrepreneurial activities and to run smaller businesses (====; ====). More intriguingly, the age profile exhibits a broad and lasting gender gap in entrepreneurship at the age of marriage and parenthood (====).====Previous research argues that the family perception of gender-specific roles is a critical impediment to female entrepreneurship (====). Women bear a disproportionate share of the burden of domestic responsibilities and child care compared with that of men (====). The temporary interruption in work after childbirth may lead to a permanent decrease in human capital and labor market attachment (====). In light of the extra tension between family responsibilities and income-generating activities that women undertake, governments in many countries have designed work-family policies to relax the constraint and encourage women's participation in the labor force through measures such as subsidized child care and parental leave. Previous research finds that subsidized child care can explain the country variation in women's participation in entrepreneurship rather than other policies such as parental leave and part-time employment (====).====The provision of more accessible and affordable child care increases the incentive of mothers to participate in income-generating activities because it reduces the price of purchased child care outside home (price effect). It is also possible that subsidized child care may crowd out informal child care==== (crowding out effect) and yield no impact on maternal employment (====). For this reason, a large group of literature that attempts to establish the causality between child care and maternal employment finds mixed results (see ====, for Canada; ====, for the U.S.; ====, for Argentina; and ====, for Norway).====With the current research, we extend the literature by exploring the causal effects of child care policies and accessibility of affordable child care on female entrepreneurship. This paper regards the self-employment as the measure of entrepreneurship and we also make an attempt to investigate the entrepreneurial motivation based on previous working status in follow-up discussion. We conduct the empirical analysis using a quasi-experiment of the first universal child care program in China. As a developing country, the inadequate supply of child care has been a serious constraint to women's employment (====). In 2010, the Chinese government launched a 3-year program to increase the establishment of child care facilities and enrollment rates of preschool-aged children. We utilize a differences-in-differences (DD) approach to exploit variations in the treatment intensity across regions generated by this 3-year expansion of child care facilities. To state it differently, the empirical strategy compares the entrepreneurial status of mothers with preschool-aged children before and after the policy change, from provinces where child care facilities expanded a lot and provinces where child care facilities expanded only a little. The change in the number of facilities is determined by the historical distribution of the child care infrastructure in a specific province, which arguably does not correlate with the entrepreneurial activities in the current period.====To preview the results, the OLS estimates indicate that female entrepreneurship is significantly and positively correlated with access to child care. This finding is confirmed by the DD estimates. The expansion of subsidized child care significantly increases women's participation in entrepreneurial activities. As contrast, neither OLS nor DD estimates show that access to child care influences the entrepreneurship of men with preschool-aged children or women without preschool-aged children. From this perspective, a more supportive work-family policy alleviates the gender differences in entrepreneurship by affecting the group of women with young children.====This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. This is the first paper that examines the causal effect of institutional context characterized by the degree of family friendliness and work-family conflict on women's entrepreneurship using individual data and a quasi-experiment. Researchers have only recently begun to examine the relationship between the institutional arrangement of work-family policies and the development of women's entrepreneurship. Both ==== and ==== study the institutional arrangement of work-family policies and female entrepreneurship using a cross country variation in institutional contexts. Cross sectional analysis usually suffers from the critique of endogeneity and leaves the causal interpretation of the results suspicious. Second, this paper extends the broad literature on the relationship between child care programs and women's employment by documenting and examining the impact of the first universal child care program in China. Findings in this paper add new evidence to research on child care in developing countries, which has become an emerging focus of study.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ==== introduces the child care reform and its influences. ====, ==== describes the empirical strategy and data.

Difference-in-differences tests show firms operating with ==== more movable assets expand access to bank credit and prolong debt maturity. However, the reform does not seem to improve the efficiency of credit allocation, as debt capacity of ","; ====; ====; ====), and the availability of collateral and debt capacity in the presence of contract incompleteness (e.g. ====; ====). Studies find that the lack of sufficient collateral is a key obstacle to access to external finance across countries. The problem is aggravated in countries with weak collateral laws, because inadequate legal infrastructure excludes important asset types, for instance, movable assets, from permissible collateral classes. On the other hand, legal reforms on collateral law also have a dark side: banks may rely excessively on collateral and reduce incentives for adequate screening, consequently allowing riskier borrowers to obtain loans and worsening credit allocation efficiency (====; ====; ====).====In this paper, we provide new evidence from China on how legal reform on permissible collateral affects firms' access to bank credit, credit allocation and firm performance. An investigation in the Chinese context is fruitful given the distinct features of the Chinese ==== sector: firstly banks are not fully commercialized yet and bank lending is often compromised by state intervention, and secondly, legal institutions are generally perceived as weak and inefficient, hence credit allocation is affected by both informal and formal institutions. Under these circumstances, it is a priori unclear whether legal reforms could effectively promote firms' access to finance and improve credit allocation efficiency. The answers to these questions may also provide new perspectives for understanding the accumulation of non-performance loans and the on-going debate on deleveraging in China.====To address these issues, we take advantage of the introduction of the Chinese Property Law in the end of 2006, which expanded the contracting space in secured transactions by allowing large classes of movable assets as permissible collateral. Before the Property Law, secured transactions were governed by the 1995 Security Law, which restricted the scope of permissible collateral to immovable assets (e.g. land and buildings) and a small class of movable assets (e.g. equipment and motor vehicles). Other important asset classes such as ==== and inventory were either excluded from the pool of permissible collateral or allowed only by way of possessory security interests. The Property Law removed these restrictions by allowing a broad class of movable assets as permissible collateral (see section 2). Moreover, accompanying the new law, a centralized electronic registration system was also established to facilitate a more easy creation of secured interests.====As the Property Law reform only pertains to movable assets, it should affect more the firms with intensive use of these assets. This policy wrinkle allows for an investigation in a difference-in-differences framework, which is ideal for such a quasi-experimental setting, because it eliminates observed and unobserved factors that affect treated and untreated firms alike (see e.g. ====). Specifically in this context, the effect of the Property Law is identified by comparing the responses of firms that ==== rely more on movable assets (high movable firms) with those of firms that rely less on movable assets (low movable firms).====Using a sample of listed firms from China during 2001¨C2011, we establish several main findings. Firstly, allowing movable assets as collateral expanded borrowers' access to formal finance, and prolonged debt maturity. Compared to low movable firms (control group), high movable firms (treated group) experienced a relative increase in both total leverage and long-term leverage after the reform. These changes are economically significant: for instance, long-term leverage increased by 4.8% more for high movable firms, amounting to 40% of the sample mean. In contrast, short-term leverage did not show differential changes for high movable and low movable firms. However, we also find such credit expansion was mainly driven by ==== low quality firms, indicating inefficiency in credit allocation. This evidence is consistent with the theoretical models of ====, ====, and ====Changes in capital structure due to the legal reform is also accompanied by changes in asset structure. We find high movable firms increased more in size relative to low movable firms, and such change was mainly driven by more fixed asset investments. Specifically, Fixed assets of high movable firms increased by 7.6% more than those of low movable firms, a highly economically significant result, as it amounts to 24% of sample average. These findings together with previous evidence that firms extended their debt maturity is consistent with the view that firms may have employed the extra credit to match asset and debt maturity (e.g. ====; ====). Finally, we do not find evidence that firm performance experienced differential changes across high and low movable firms after the Property Law.====These results are obtained controlling for firm and year fixed effects, which capture systematic differences across firms and general time trends. These effects are also independent from ==== (provincial) time-varying shocks, because we control explicitly for fixed effects interaction terms between industry (provincial) and year. In addition, we validate the parallel trend assumption by investigating whether our findings persist for placebo reforms, which is a crucial assumption for the difference-in-differences framework. Nevertheless, other confounding factors could provide alternative explanations to the previous findings. We proceed by investigating these possible explanations.==== investigate the reforms in Eastern Europe that permitted the use of movable assets (e.g. machinery and equipments) as collateral, and find that such reforms promoted access to external finance, and reallocated assets and employments towards firms with more movable assets. ==== analyze the reform of the Napolenoic Code in France, and find that increased access to collateral ¨C by expanding it to hard assets ¨C increased firms' debt capacity and prolonged debt maturity. ==== examine legal reform in Sweden that reduced the value of collateral (e.g. floating liens). They show that such reform reduced debt capacity and shortened debt maturity, and eventually contributed to distortions in corporate investment and asset allocation. ==== investigate the effects of the existence of collateral registries on access to finance across a large number of countries.====We contribute to this literature by providing new evidence from the largest emerging market economy that expanding the space of permissible collateral improves access to external finance and prolongs debt maturity. Most previous studies investigate economies characterized by a private banking sector, while our study focuses on China, characterized by a semi-efficient state-dominant banking sector. The results reported here suggest that even in such an environment, legal reforms that target directly the pledgeability of collateral could effectively expand firms' access to formal finance. This finding bears particular importance as China is often viewed as a counterexample to established results obtained in the law and finance literature, mostly for advanced economies (====). Our results also reinforce the claim of ====; ====; ====; ====).====This paper is also related to studies examining how enforceability of secured contracts affects lending (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====), and how the collateral channel affects capital structure and investment (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). These analyses focus on the value, availability or re-use of assets which have been permitted as collateral, while we focus on the permissibility of assets to be used as collateral in the first place.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the institutional background governing secured transactions in China. Section 3 describes identification strategy, data and key variables. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 discusses various alternative explanations and robustness tests. Finally, Section 6 concludes.====The difference-in-differences estimator relies on important assumptions. Firstly, it is important to validate the trends in the outcome variables are similar ==== the reform (the parallel trends assumption). Secondly, the enactment of Property Law must be exogenous to firms' financial decisions. The second assumption is plausible because the exact timing of the passage of the law is a product of complex political processes and thus exogenous from the perspective of individual firms. This notwithstanding, the possibility of reverse causality deserves closer investigation.====Moreover, specification (1) provides no sense of the dynamics of the outcome variables ==== the legal reform, i.e. how quickly firms adjust their debt and asset structure after the reform; and whether these effects accelerate, stabilize, or mean revert. To explore these issues, this section examines the dynamics of outcome variables with a lead and lag model in the spirit of ====. Specifically, it estimates a variation of specification (1):====Specification (A.1) replaces the ==== dummy in specification (1) with a sequence of dummies D====, where D==== equals one in the ====th year ==== the Property Law reform and zero otherwise. The model is fully saturated with year 2005 (====?=??1), the year right before the enactment of the Property Law, as the omitted category. The coefficients ¦Â==== therefore compare the level of the dependent variable ==== years ==== the Property Law, to the year immediately before the enactment of the Property Law.==== plots the coefficient estimates and the 95% confidence intervals. The pre-reform coefficients for debt measures (Panel A) and variables on the asset and profitability (Panel B) are all statistically insignificant, validating the parallel trends assumption and rejecting possible reverse causation explanations. After the enactment of the Property Law, firm changed their debt and asset structure almost immediately, and the effects are monotonic, suggesting the reform has progressively changed corporate debt and asset structure, and these effects are long-lasting. The exceptions are ==== and ====, which do not show post-reform differential dynamics, consistent with the finding in Sections 4.1 and 4.3.",Permissible collateral and access to finance: Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301676,April 2019,2019,Research Article,487

Recent research suggests that approximately two-thirds of the extra cost of the USD 11 billion per year required to achieve Goal 2 of SDG must be financed by governments (====). Nonetheless, as governments are increasingly facing tighter budgets in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it is crucial to allocate limited fiscal resources more efficiently among potential investments. As a result, there is a call for further research on the efficiency of public investment in food production (====).====In 2009, China announced its Hundred Billion Project (hereafter HBP), a large-scale public investment on agriculture, which was aimed at increasing China's food output by one hundred billion jin (or 50 billion kg) to ensure food security. During 2010¨C2013, the central government spent approximately RMB 143 billion on agricultural investment. These funds were allocated to 800 selected county governments that represent the country's major food planting areas. The funds were mainly invested in irrigation, land improvement and farm support. Thus, the HBP provides a unique setting in which to examine the impact of public investment on agriculture on food output.====This paper exploits this large-scale public investment as a natural experiment to identify and estimate the impact of public investment on food output. We employ a panel dataset of 1724 counties, containing 684 counties supported by the HBP and 1040 nonsupported counties,====We find that the HBP significantly raised food output by 4.34% on average from 2010 to 2013. The increase in food output conservatively reached 44.0%¨C81.8% of its first five-year short-term policy target under various forecasting assumptions. However, an ad-hoc benefit-cost analysis shows that the internal return rate (IRR) is only approximately 0.23% over a 20-year period.====Lastly, we verify several potential threats to identification, including the assumption of parallel trends (the trends of food output would be the same in both supported counties and nonsupported counties in the absence of the HBP) and confounding effect from an alternative policy. We provide evidence that our results are not subject to those threats to identification. Then, we show that our results are robust using a series of specification checks, including the inclusion of alternative sets of control variables, treatment of outliers and omitted variable biases.====Our study contributes to the literature on the effect of public investment on agricultural output. Agricultural investment varies across countries, where the ratio of investment to output value is 10% in developing countries and 20% in developed countries (====). Public investment in infrastructure and R and D explains the difference in agricultural productivity across countries (====; ====). Further, as reviewed by ==== and ====, infrastructure and input subsidy are shown to promote food security in various country-specific settings.====More relevant to our work, a growing literature examines public investment in agriculture in China. First, there is a strand of literature employing provincial-level data to examine the effects of public investment on agricultural output. Those studies show that agricultural output is boosted by public investment in R and D (====; ====; ====; ====), irrigation (====; ====), road and telephone (====). Second, few studies examine specific aspects of public investment in China with household-level data. ==== find that irrigation investment increase agricultural output. ==== find that input subsidy is small relative to the income of rural households, but ==== and ==== employ production function approach to show that irrigation and R and D promote agricultural output, respectively. This paper differs from the previous research by employing a quasi-natural experiment framework at county-level to examine the effect of public investment on food output. Further, our work highlights the role of public investment in boosting agricultural productivity, which in turn fosters structural transformation in China (====; ====).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the HBP. Section 3 discusses the empirical methodology. Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical findings. Section 6 concludes the paper.====This appendix examines the four variables that proxy the criteria stated in the official publication, which are different between the counties supported and not supported by the HBP. On average, ==== in supported counties is approximately three times greater than that in the other counties. 65.1% of food output was sold in supported counties compared to ?235.6% in nonsupported counties.==== The farmland acreage of supported counties is 127?ha, which is about two times that of nonsupported counties. The largest grid accounts for 53.6% of the gross farmland acreage in supported counties versus 22.9% in the nonsupported counties.====We estimate a logit model to verify that the four factors stated in the official publication are relevant for selecting countries to be supported by the HBP, and report the results in Table A.1. Columns (1)¨C(4) report the univariate results, and Column (5) reports the multivariate results.

More food production and sales increase the probability for a country to be selected for inclusion into the HBP. After controlling for output and food sales, the impact of the farmland is negative and significant.

We find that ==== differ in their reliance on relationship-specific investments. Provinces with better contracting institutions specialize in industries with more intensive relationship-specific investments. We implement two proxies to measure contracting institutions, including efficiency of the legal system and service of contract enforcement. The empirical results of this study indicate that contracting institutions play a role in shaping the patterns of industrial specialization. Specifically, the service of contract enforcement has the first-order effect on the patterns of industrial specialization in China; by contrast, legal jurisdiction plays a modest role.","Over the last decade, there has been a growing consensus among economists that the legal and law enforcement of a society, that is, its ¡°contract institution¡±, is an important factor that shapes the pattern of industrial specialization. ====, ==== suggests that countries with better contracting institutions generally have less under-investment and have a cost advantage in the production of goods requiring relationship-specific investments. As a result, the contracting institutions can affect investment scale and efficiency. Similar to physical capital, human capital, or technology, contracting institutions can be regarded as one production factor whose endowment and difference across regions shape the patterns of trade and industrial distribution according to the H¨CO model (====; ====; ====). Consistent with these arguments, ====, ====Notably, investigations on the relationship between contracting institutions and industrial specializations in emerging market economies have yet to receive much attention. Not only are the law and legal systems relatively weak but also is the access to law and legal service a challenge in emerging market countries (====). Although most emerging market economies have established their own legal systems, citizens still cannot fully protect themselves due to certain ¡°failures¡± during contract implementation and enforcement. Most importantly, they often face obstacles in accessing justice or contract services because of the insufficient supply of qualified lawyers. Generally, lawyers are crucial in enforcing a contract and solving a jurisdiction case as they provide professional legal services for their clients. However, the dearth of qualified lawyers may cause citizens an extra cost in legal disputes. Drawing on empirical evidence that suggests better contract institution can be a source of comparative advantage of specialization, we ask how this might be applied in the Chinese context.====More specifically, we separately evaluate the roles of legal system and service of contract enforcement on China's industrial specialization patterns in this study. In its planned economy, China has almost no formal institutions for contract similar to those in the west counties. Since its open door policy, China had strived to establish a legal system during the radical and successful economic transition from a planned economy to a market economy. The role of law in state governance was first recognized by the Constitution of P. R. China in 1982. In 1997, the report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China formally established the ¡°rule of law¡± as the basic strategy of governing the county. With the construction of a legal system in China, lawyer institution was established and improved gradually. Individual partnership law firms were legalized in 1996 as National People's Congress passed the Lawyer Law of the People's Republic of China in that same year.====With the progress of legal construction, the supply of professional legal service has increased significantly. According to the Law Yearbook of China, the number of law firms increased from 7263 in 1995 to 24,425 in 2015, and the number of lawyers increased from 90.6 thousand in 1995 to 297.2 thousand in 2015. These progresses significantly improved both the legal system and the service of contract enforcement in China. According to the World Bank survey, China's ¡°enforcing contracts¡± indicator ranked the 18th among 183 economies in 2009 (====). Therefore, using China as a case, this study can shed light on the relative importance of the formal legal system and contract service on industrial specialization in emerging markets.====Following ====, we measure the level of contract institution in China through two indices, i.e., the quality of legal system and the service of contract enforcement. For the former, we employ the index of legal system performance developed by ====, which conducts an annual survey of enterprises across China's provinces regarding legal environment and judicial efficiency on business activities (====). For the service of contract enforcement, we use the number of lawyers per 10,000 residents (====) in a province. This measure is based on the idea that the number of lawyers determine the availability and cost of legal service and facilitates legal procedures to settle commercial disputes. Thus, it highlights the close relationship between the ease of legal system and contract enforcement.====Based on the data of Chinese ====A large number of studies have examined the effects of resource endowments, externality, financial development, and other factors on industrial specialization (====; ====; ====; ====).==== The present study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on the effects of contract institutions on the patterns of industrial specialization in an emerging economy setting. Our study also contributes to a large body of literature about the effects of contracting institutions on economic behavior. Many studies have shown that contracting institutions are a primary determinant of economic performance (====; ====; ====). However, existing literature does not attempt to determine the relative role of standard legal and justice system and the legal service that facilitates contract enforcement. Inspired by western countries, most emerging market countries have introduced and established western-style formal legal systems. Nevertheless, the rule of laws and contract enforcement remain weak in those countries. Our study indicates that the transplantation of law and legal system to emerging markets is difficult and complicated. More importantly, an improved service of contract enforcement, such as qualified lawyers, should be established along with the formal legal system.====The article is organized as follows: Section 2 sets the context and formulates the two testable hypotheses, Section 3 describes the data and model, Section 4 presents the estimation results, Section 5 tests the robustness, and Section 6 concludes.",Does contracting institution affect the patterns of industrial specialization in China?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301561,April 2019,2019,Research Article,489

Banking efficiency is measured on the basis of optimal risk preference. The findings show that the moderate risk preference is the most appropriate strategy to achieve technical efficiency in the Chinese banking sector. However, the aggressive risk preference involving low risk costs, compulsory credit spreads and scale expansion played a critical role in promoting the development of Chinese banking sector, but its effect decreased rapidly.

Since then, risk factors are incorporated into many studies of banking performance (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====Risk preference is the banking characteristic that, on the premise of continuous operation and profit, individual banks are willing and capable to take the maximum amount of risks. In other words, it reflects the strategy adopted by an individual bank, and can be used to measure the effect of policy bonus. Indeed, when the policy bonus changes, the banking operation strategy (or risk preference) would change correspondingly. However, as risk preference is a subjective variable with self-selection property, it is hence an ambiguous variable to be measured quantitatively. Apart from the conventional risk preference measure by Arrow-Pratt framework, ==== classified different risk preferences through changing direction vectors in the DDF method, but the direction vectors in their study are exogenous, which does not satisfy the self-selection property of risk preference. It is thus important to incorporate endogenous direction vectors within the standard DDF to satisfy the self-selection property of risk preference. This is achieved by ==== and ==== who developed the multi-directions efficiency analysis (MEA) method with endogenous direction vectors. In this paper MEA is extended and applied to analyze efficiency of major Chinese banks.====In summary, this paper aims to investigate the effect of policy bonus and explore the development path of the Chinese banking sector based on the perspective of risk preference and efficiency.

Getting to an efficient market economy is more of an ad hoc experimental process.====Stating the goal in that general way, however, does not give one a guide as to what China had to do to create a modern efficient socialist market economy. There is a literature from the first half of the 20th century, however, that does try to spell out how a socialist market economy would work. It was written originally to counter the argument of scholars that argued that a ==== could not be efficient. Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner argued that it was possible to create an economy that was just like a capitalist market economy except ownership would rest with the state (or ¡°all of the people¡±) rather than private individuals. The key stumbling block to efficiency was that efficient outcomes required that enterprise managers maximize profits and private ownership of these profits provided the incentive to follow this goal. Lange and Lerner, however, countered that the managers of state owned enterprises could be simply ordered to maximize profits even though it was the public as a whole who ultimately receive those profits.====Lange and Lerner, therefore, solved the problem of whether a socialist market economy could be efficient, but neither they nor the Chinese Communist Party or the Chinese government has spelled out in an operational way what kinds of institutions needed to be created for a market economy to work in a way consistent with the theory or the goal of efficiency. That in turn has made it difficult for scholars and other observers to judge whether China is or is not making good progress toward achieving the goal of an efficient modern socialist market economy.

Due to SMEs increasingly important role in the national economy, the Chinese government has proposed ¡°massive innovation and entrepreneurship¡± and formulated a series of policies to encourage startups and boost entrepreneurship.====In this paper, we first document that Chinese SMEs face a serious difficulty in obtaining credit from financial institutes.==== Based on a national-representative sample at the household level, we find only 48.6% of entrepreneurs who are in need of credit is able to obtain bank loans during their start-up period. The nature of our data enables us to further explore the reasons for such low credit accessibility. We find a lack of collateral and no third party guarantees are the two most prominent reasons for being rejected. Somewhat surprisingly, however, an even larger share of constraints, more than three times that of rejection cases, results from the fact that firms never applied for loans although needed.====We next examine whether and how ==== from financial institutes affect entrepreneurial activities in China.====Credit constraints could discourage entrepreneurship. We find entrepreneurs of China's SMEs on average only have 10?years of education (====). If entrepreneurial ability and initial investment are substitutes, Chinese entrepreneurs might rely more on investment and thus be more likely to be affected by the accessibility of credit. Furthermore, there is a deficiency of formal financing channels for SMEs in China. The bank sector still retains the dominant position compared to other formal financing channels such as stock exchange. In the end, the non-standardized regulation and the potentially high borrowing cost of private lending makes bank loans as one of the preferable means.==== In any case, credit constraints from financial institutes could become barriers to business start-ups.==== Such relatively low start-up funding needs in addition to the fact that Chinese set great score by connections with friends and family members result in the start-up of business could be almost bank-independent, i.e., financing problem could be solved by borrowing from relatives and/or friends, even if potential entrepreneurs could not obtain credit from financial institutes such as banks. Second, China's financial market is still under-developed, implying that if there is any role in the private sector economy, it may not be as prominent as U.S. and other developed countries (====; ====).====Using the 2013 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data, we find credit constraints from financial institutes significantly decrease the probability of households' entry into entrepreneurship. According to our estimates, reducing the probability of being credit constrained by 10% would increase the number of businesses by 4.3 million, or equivalently, create 11 million jobs. This result is robust to alternative specifications and to the evaluation of omitted variable bias. Our results also indicate that the accessibility to credit would significantly increase entrepreneurs' initial investment, but this only applies to larger businesses, i.e., the ones with initial investment above the second quartile. Finally, we find SMEs in East China are the most dependent on bank financing compared to those in Central and Western regions.====). If the insufficiency of funds is essential for would-be entrepreneurs, then low-wealth households will be less likely to start a business than the high-wealth ones. Thus, testing for the role of liquidity constraints is equivalently to testing for a positive correlation between personal wealth and the decision to enter into entrepreneurship.====). This paper differs from previous work by testing the relation of an external liquidity constraint, i.e., the accessibility of credit from financial institutes, to business entry, conditional on internal funds, i.e., personal wealth.====In the end, we explore the sources of difficulty in credit accessibility in China; and results indicate that institutional deficiency plays a key role. Specifically, households in regions with higher degree of marketization or those with government-sector workers are more likely to access to credit when other relevant variables are conditioned. In particular, we find government-sector workers to be more important in helping to obtain credit in regions with weaker market institutions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the important role of SMEs in Chinese economy, describe the institutional environment where SMEs live through for the past thirty years, and document seriously low credit accessibility for these businesses. Section 3 presents the data and shows how the sample we utilize in the analysis is processed and finalized. In Section 4, we empirically examine how the financial credit constraint affects the probability of households entering into entrepreneurship and the initial volume of investment, as well as how its impact varies across regions.

Our analysis uses farm-level data from 345 Chinese broiler growers, and used an ","New technologies play an important role in increasing agricultural production, farmers' incomes (====; ====), and development of modern agriculture, but the diffusion of new agricultural technologies in developing countries has been slow (====). The literature has asserted that the reason for this phenomenon is often risk aversion among farmers (====) and that farmers in developing countries are generally risk-averse [see the example of ==== and ====]. In this context, low adoption of new technologies due to high-risk aversion could hinder agricultural sector development.====Several studies in diverse locations have demonstrated that risk aversion inhibits the diffusion of new agricultural technologies: adoption of site-specific technologies (SSTs) for farmers in Otter Lake Watershed in Illinois, United States (====); asset investment of small-scale farmers in Uganda, Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh, India (====); adoption of hybrid maize technology in Malawi (====); and adoption of new varieties by small-scale and subsistence farmers in South Africa (====). ==== subdivided risk preferences into risk aversion, probability weighting, and loss aversion and assessed how these estimated risk preference parameters affect the timing of technology adoption by farmers in China. The study found that farmers who are more risk or loss averse adopt a genetically modified ==== (Bt) cotton later and that farmers who overweigh small probabilities adopt Bt cotton earlier.====Contract farming has been shown to be an effective means for farmers to avoid risk. Production contracts can effectively protect the interests of farmers in the event of a market or production shock (====). For example, ====). ==== demonstrated that contract farming significantly increased total factor productivity of US pig farmers. Contract farming may play a major role in facilitating the adoption of new technologies by risk-averse farmers in developing countries. Notably, relevant empirical examples in the literature have been rare.====Regarding contract farming, risk preferences and technology adoption have practical significance. Using contract farming to vertically integrate production and the marketing of agricultural products has become common in the farm sector in many countries (====; ==== and ==== implied that farmers made technology adoption decisions independent of the use of marketing or production contracts, although contracting status plays a role. Considering the strong relationships among risk preferences and both contract participation and technology adoption, ignoring contract participation may confound estimation of the impact of risk aversion on technology adoption. This study focuses on the impact of risk preferences on technology adoption by farmers who have the option of entering a contractual relationship.====This study uses automatic feeding technology in broiler farming to demonstrate the relationship between risk preferences, use of production contracts, and technology adoption. The analysis is based on a questionnaire survey and risk preference experiment for a sample of 345 farmers. This study makes three innovations. First, risk preferences are decomposed into risk aversion, probability weighting, and loss aversion according to the risk preference experiment method of ====. According to our review of the literature, this is the first attempt to apply this risk preference experiment method in the analysis of contract use. Second, the discrete adoption decision and the amount invested in the new technology and timing of adoption are used as measures of technology adoption by farmers to provide a detailed description of how farmers adopt new technologies. Third, the impact of the initial contract participation decision and specific contractual arrangements (e.g., contract duration, deposit, and technology cost-sharing) on technology adoption by contracted farmers are examined to evaluate the differences in the transmission mechanism between the farmers' behavior, contract participation, and specific contractual arrangements.====The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section two describes the model, data collection methods, and design of field experiments. Section three discusses the ==== and the main findings. Section four presents the conclusions and policy suggestions.====To elicit the three prospect theory parameters, we designed three series of paired lotteries as shown in ====. Each row is a choice between two binary lotteries, A or B. We enforced monotonic switching by asking subjects at which question they will ¡°switch¡± from Option A to Option B in each series. They can switch to Option B starting with the first question, and they do not have to switch to Option B at all. In the first series of paired lotteries, Option A is a lower risk of the draw games, bonuses remain fixed; Option B is a risky draw game, and bonuses are rising. At the beginning of the game, the farmer may choose A, because B's attraction to the farmer is not big enough. With the rise in the Option B's bonuses (from the initial 34 yuan to the last 850), farmers will be more motivated to take risks. Eventually, farmers' choices will shift from A to B at some point (allowing farmers always choose lottery A). Risk lovers tend to switch to Option B earlier. Following ====, after participants completed three series of questions with a total of 35 choices, we drew a numbered card from a bingo cage with 35 numbered cards to determine which row of choice will be played for real money. We then put back ten numbered cards in the bingo cage and played the selected lottery.====Each farmer's corresponding risk aversion coefficient is calculated from the farmers' choice in the two Options. For any subject who switches at row N, we can conclude that he/she prefers Option A over Option B at row (N-1) and prefers Option B over Option A at row N. We can obtain a set of two inequalities from this switching point. For example, when a subject switches from Option A to Option B at row 7 for both series 1 and series 2, the following inequalities should be satisfied:====The range of ¦Ò and ¦Á can be obtained by solving Eqs. ====, ==== (taking the midpoint of the range as the estimated value of the parameter). With the increasing risk level of the first to seventh questions in the third draw, the proportion of households choosing the high-risk B option is constantly changing. The loss aversion parameter ¦Ë is determined by the switching point in Series 3. But ¦Ë cannot be inferred only from switching in Series 3.

The reason is, unlike corporate and personal income taxes, VAT has no direct effects on marginal costs (bankruptcy cost, agency cost, etc.) or marginal benefits (tax shield) of debt financing. Moreover, according to the pecking order theory, there are no explicit channels for VAT to send signals about firm operation. Consequently, the linkages between VAT and corporate capital structure are quite limited.====The good news is that the VAT reform in China serves as a valuable opportunity for empirical identification. Since VAT was first introduced in 1994 as a kind of shared tax between central and local governments, China¡¯s VAT has always been production-type, meaning that the purchases of fixed investments cannot be deducted from the sales of the final product when calculating a firm¡¯s VAT liability. Under the background of the then over-heated economy, advantages of production-type VAT include depressing over-investment and promising fiscal revenues (====¡± in Northeast China. After that, in July 2007, the VAT reform expanded to 8 industries in 6 provinces, 26 cities of Central China. Finally, on January 1, 2009, the VAT reform was introduced to all industries and cities.====A consumption-type VAT permits that fixed investment purchases be deducted from the sales of final product in calculating a firm¡¯s VAT liability, intending to lower the cost of purchasing fixed investments and encourage equipment upgrading. Such policy intention gained support in our data, in which appears a dramatic jump in fixed investment purchases, which is more significant in privately-owned firms and the Eastern region where private firms are the most active.====Among the several key time points of VAT reform, 2007 was characterized with the largest expansion scope and the cleanest policy effect. For the latter point, we mean that the reforms were the least intertwined with concurrent effects of other related policies, which will be explained in more detail in Section 2.1. Given that, we chose the 2007 VAT reform covering 26 cities and 8 industries in 6 provinces of Central China as the natural experiment to examine the effect of VAT reform on corporate capital structure, using a differences-in-differences (DID) approach. We found that the drop in VAT significantly lowered the ratio of liability to asset, similar with the effect of corporate income tax. However, a more interesting finding is that such decline in debt financing is not true for liabilities of different types. When total liabilities were separated into long-term and current liabilities, we found a dramatic rise in long-term debt and a decline in current liability in terms of the ratio to asset. To explain this, we ascribed the increase in long-term debt to the induced-demand of fixed investment purchases. According to the literature, firms prefer using long-term capital to buy fixed investments, which are determined by the properties of long establishment, operation and payback period (====).====This paper is suggestive for related future studies. First and foremost, when considering the effects of the tax policy on capital structure, despite traditional mechanisms, we need to consider the effects on corporate financing methods, including the debt maturity, especially in current market conditions in which various financial tools exist. Besides, within the structural changes of China, each policy reform cannot be valued in isolation. We epitomized that the VAT reform will affect corporate debt maturity and capital structure, imposing side effects on the capital market, as shown in this paper, liabilities of different durations can perform differently in response to VAT reforms. For China, this point may be especially important. According to this paper, even if the current risks associated with China¡¯s high leverage may not be serious in terms of aggregate level, some certain types of liability may be at high risks.====This paper is organized as follows.

We build an indicator of language barrier with geographical distribution information of Chinese dialect regions, and further separate the language effect from the migration effect by checking whether migrants move into a region with a different dialect. Results indicate a significant and negative impact of the language barrier on the health status of elderly migrants. Specifically, a language barrier results in poorer health conditions for younger elders. The mechanism test shows that a language barrier reduces migrants' abilities to build a social network, which is harmful to their health. Elderly migrants who are less-educated, live in host residence for a shorter time and move for business incentives suffer more from a language barrier. This study proves the power of a verbal language barrier to migrants' health.","Migration¡ªeither across countries or within a country¡ªhas been popular throughout the world, and has great socioeconomic impact (====; ====; ====; ====). However, most of the studies examine cultural-difference effects by using subject indicators (e.g., requiring migrants to self-report feelings of being real host residents or not). This could create methodological issues, as self-reported measures may not be accurate to reflect real cultural differences. In this paper, we analyze whether cultural differences lead to changes in migrants' health conditions. However, we aim to measure cultural differences between origin and target area by using a more objective indicator.====When people move to new places, they are always marked differently in terms of social values and behavioral norms by their distinguished languages. It is well accepted that cultural assimilation (or acculturation) occurs once migrants have become proficient in the host language (====). It then becomes easier for migrants to communicate, build social networks, show working competence, and, finally, improve both health status and labor performance. In other words, since language represents how people's thoughts and social behaviors are structured, migrants are more likely to reduce cultural differences if a language barrier does not exist. From this perspective, the existence of the language barrier faced by migrants may be a proper proxy which is more objective to measure cultural differences.====Therefore, how to measure language barrier becomes our main point of interest. Until recently, a majority of studies in this area measured language barrier by using a self-reported index known as ¡°host-language-proficient¡±. However, this indicator is greatly questioned in its validity as it may be misreported by the respondent (====). In our study, we address this concern by using the geographical distribution information of China's major dialect regions. China is well known for its broad geographic coverage and diversified cultural systems. Although Mandarin is the official language for both reading and writing, dialects are widely used during communication and social interaction (Chen et al., 2015). Each dialect has a totally distinguishable lexical usage, intonation, and grammatical form during speaking. Moreover, each dialect represents a group of population who live in a common region and share similar social values and behavioral norms. Once we consider these, we narrow the language barrier to a spoken language for our within-country analyses. Specifically, we rely on the dialects' geographic distribution information and check whether migrants move from one dialect region into another. This way, we isolate language effect from migration effect. Besides, this measurement is far less relevant to any self-reported styles.====Methodologically, the language barrier indicator is measured by a dichotomous coded variable. It denotes whether the migrant moves from one dialect region to which his origin area belongs into another dialect region where he moves to. The individual microlevel data we used is from the ¡°China National Health Survey of Migrants¡± (CNHSM). Here, we mainly focus on elderly migrants who are 65?years old or older. The reasons are as follows. First, most elders in China are unable to speak Mandarin as common Mandarin education was not available when they were young. This means that dialects are more important to the elders than young migrants. Second, to show better abilities, migrants are very inclined to invest in learning a second language (====). In light of this, the existence of a language barrier between different dialect regions may not have a meaningful effect on health status. However, the elders have the least learning abilities and willingness to grasp a second language.==== As such, by using the elders' sample, we mitigate concerns resulting from individual learning abilities that may bias the estimation and the interpretation to a great extent.====To outline our main results, we find significantly negative effects of a language barrier on elder migrants' health status. However, the negative language barrier effect mainly exists among the relatively young cohort (i.e., elderly migrants who were born during 1940s¨C1950s). Results are robust after several specifications that account for potential confounding factors. Specifically, we check four alternative explanations for a decrease in migrants' health conditions: remote geographic distance, host dialectical complexity, climate and dietary habit changes, and region-specific differences. We find none of these four factors could explain the decrease in elders' health conditions. It is the language barrier between two dialect regions that makes the health status of elderly migrants worse. We then investigate an underlying mechanism: ¡°friend-making ability.¡± We find that a language barrier reduces the possibilities of elderly migrants making friends in the host residence, which leads to deterioration in health. We also make several cross-sectional contrasts. We find that migrants who are less educated, live in host residence for a shorter period and move with business motives are more likely to have a worsening health condition because of the language barrier. Finally, we conduct two robustness checks, while results are very likely to support a negative impact of a language barrier on elderly migrants' health conditions.====We contribute to at least three lines of literature. First and foremost, the majority of previous literature used self-reported indicators to measure cultural differences, which may cause estimation bias and misinterpretation. We constructed the language barrier indicator to objectively represent cultural differences between regions of origin and target areas. This indicator is less affected by self-preferences. Therefore, we added to the validity of relevant studies on estimating cultural-difference effects. Second, we applied an ¡°as-if¡± difference-in-differences (DD) estimation technique that is suitable for cross-sectional analyses. Although we cannot interpret our findings as accurate causal effects, results are very reliable to support the existence of the language-barrier effect. Third, we added new evidence from the case study of China that acculturation has positive effects on social stability and integration with respect to migrants' health conditions.====The rest of this article is organized as follows. In section 2, we mainly review relevant literature and discuss, in more detail, how language barrier affects migrants' health conditions. Moreover, we discuss disadvantages of language barrier indicators used by previous studies. In section 3, we introduce the geographical distribution of dialects across China, and explain how dialects in China distinguish from each other to represent the language barrier. In section 4, we describe data, variables, and identification strategy.

Consequently, economists have been modeling crime employing ==== indicators as one of the explanatory variables, yielding mixed results. This paper argues that income polarization rather than inequality indicators should be used instead. Technically, in addition to income gaps that are measured by inequality indicators, the recently developed polarization index of Duclos, Esteban, and Ray (2004) also captures clustering, which implies social segregation and immobility, both potentially causing social tensions and conflicts. Thus, this polarization index is expected to be a better variable in explaining crime. To substantiate our arguments, provincial panel data from China are used to model the crime¨Cincome distribution relationship. Income polarization is found to be positively and significantly associated with crime. When both income polarization and inequality indicators are included in the models, the former remains a positive and significant determinant while the latter becomes insignificant.","As argued by ====). More generally, crime is an illness that attacks rights of individuals and impairs quality of life, adversely affecting happiness and health (====; ====). Some crimes directly cause fear, pain, and suffering (====).====To contain or fight crimes, it is vital to identify and analyze the determinants. One of them is income distribution (====; ====). As pointed out by ====). However, inequality indicators only measure income gaps. They do not capture clustering of individuals, which has implications on social segregation and mobility. As criminologists point out, those who are segregated in a community or society are more likely to commit crimes (====). In addition, in a segregated society or when some population are alienated, upward income mobility would be low for the disadvantaged. And, two societies with the same income inequality, the one with lower income mobility would be more unequal in the long run (====).====Thus, it appears preferable to use measures of income distribution that can capture clustering or segregation, not just income gaps when exploring the income distribution¨Ccrime relationship. Conceptually, polarization describes the extent of population clustering with homogeneous individuals within each cluster but heterogeneous individuals across clusters (====). Consequently, the recently developed polarization indices can capture segregation and immobility, as well as income gaps (====).

This article reinvestigates variation in the travel pattern of the 14th Dalai Lama to study how political tensions affect trading decisions of Chinese importers. Using monthly trade data from China Customs covering imports of machinery and transport equipment from 173 countries over the 2000¨C2006 period, our empirical results show a significant reduction of imports in response to foreign government members' meetings with the Dalai Lama. In line with the idea that Chinese importers face a trade-off between bearing costs from suboptimal trade transactions and costs from not accommodating the government, this ¡®Dalai Lama Effect¡¯ operates at the intensive margin, i.e., via a decrease in the import volume per importer. Examining differential effects across types of firm ownership, we find that the observed effect is driven by state-owned enterprises (and foreign-invested firms) and not by private companies. Moreover, while direct importers temporarily reduce their trade with Dalai Lama-receiving countries, there is some evidence that trade intermediaries fill the void. Overall, we find the effects to be much more short-lived than previously thought.","Politics and trade are intertwined. The linkages between bilateral political and commercial relations have received considerable attention in the literature (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====, ====). While there are arguments as to why political relations should play a smaller role in an increasingly globalized world (====), the state of political relations appears to remain pivotal in commercial relationships with states that have a relatively high level of state control over economic activities (====). There is also growing empirical evidence demonstrating the salience of political consumerism, i.e., consumers changing their decisions as a result of worsening bilateral political relations (====; ====; ====; ====). Still, little is known about the firm-level dynamics driving trade reductions during times of heightened political tensions between trade partner countries.====The travel pattern of the 14th Dalai Lama, a religious leader of Tibetan Buddhism and former political leader of Tibetans in exile, presents a particularly suitable case to study importers' response to non-militarized political tensions.==== His meetings with government members and other foreign dignitaries across the globe are usually accompanied with diplomatic tensions between China and the countries receiving him. The Chinese government interprets receptions of the Dalai Lama by foreign dignitaries as interferences into its internal affairs. Before each visit of the Dalai Lama, China warns the prospective host countries that it will respond to such meetings with a deterioration of bilateral relations and often threatens to weaken trade ties. ==== study whether these threats are actually carried out: they find that during the 2002¨C2008 period (i) countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama are punished through a reduction of their exports to China, (ii) such a ¡®Dalai Lama Effect¡¯ is primarily driven by the contraction in trade of machinery and transport equipment, (iii) the effect is the most significant for meetings at the highest political level, and (iv) the effect disappears in the second year after a meeting has taken place.==== It appears that the Chinese government sanctions Dalai Lama-receiving countries in order to signal resolve to discourage future receptions of the Dalai Lama. However, these findings at the aggregated level appear as a black box: to date, ==== Chinese importing firms respond to such political tensions has not been examined.====This paper unwraps the trade aggregate by examining firm-level data from China's General Administration of Customs, which includes the monthly transactions of all Chinese importers from 173 partner countries (and territories) between January 2000 and December 2006.==== In contrast to the yearly data used in ====, monthly trade data allow us to investigate whether importers respond differently during different stages before and after meetings at even shorter periods of time.==== We use transaction-level trade data by China Customs rather than data sourced from UN Comtrade or the IMF Directory of Trade Statistics to be able to compute the extensive and intensive trade margins and to disaggregate trade by firm-ownership type and trade mode. Our study focuses on Chinese imports of machinery and transport equipment, the only sector identified by ==== as robustly suffering from a temporary reduction in trade in the aftermath of foreign dignitaries' official receptions of the Dalai Lama. A thorough investigation of the firm-level dynamics at play will improve our understanding of the politics-trade nexus.====We argue that Chinese importers face a trade-off between bearing the costs from sanctioning firms of Dalai Lama-receiving countries and those from ==== sanctioning such firms. On the one hand, it is obvious that compliant importers face significant costs. They need to substitute their imports with the same or similar products from a domestic company or a foreign supplier based in a country whose government has not recently received the Dalai Lama. Such substitutes are likely to be more costly and/or of inferior quality. Even if this is not the case, the establishment of a new trading relationship itself is costly. Alternatively, the firm may be forced to postpone its imports until the political tensions have been relieved. On the other hand, costs from ==== sanctioning firms from Dalai Lama-receiving countries can be imposed by the Chinese government. For example, the government can cut subsidies to non-compliant firms or disadvantage these firms when awarding government contracts. Moreover, career prospects within the government or the Communist party may incentivize a firm's leadership to carry out sanctions against firms of Dalai Lama-receiving countries. It is important to note that our line of reasoning does not require that the government formally announces measures against or actually imposes costs on not-sanctioning firms; it is sufficient that the firm's leadership believes that it may suffer disadvantages in the future and thus acts preemptively.====This article analyzes whether importers' trade-off between the costs from sanctioning and those from not sanctioning Dalai Lama-receiving countries are reflected in import decisions along three dimensions. First, we relate to the literature on firm heterogeneity and trade (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Breaking down imports into the average import value of those Chinese firms that are active as importers (firm-level intensive margin) and the number of Chinese importers buying in the market (firm-level extensive margin), we expect to observe import reductions caused by Dalai Lama meetings mainly at the intensive margin of trade. Firms that want to accommodate the Chinese government should prefer to adjust imports at the intensive margin to avoid the additional fixed costs they would incur from setting up new trade relations. Establishing new trade relationships would incur search costs (e.g., ====) and these appear avoidable given the expected temporary nature of the tensions.====Second, we expect firms of different ownership types to respond differently to political tensions due to their varying degrees of political proximity to the government (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). ==== find Chinese (and Indian) imports through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to be more responsive to bilateral political relations compared to those through private firms. When China's administration threatens to sanction trading partners in response to official receptions of the Dalai Lama, we expect that these threats are more likely to be carried out by firms with strong ties to the government, which is the case for SOEs by their very definition, but also foreign-invested firms that are relatively more dependent on the Chinese government than private firms (====).====Third, we follow the literature on the importance of different trade modes in China (e.g., ====). Trade intermediaries are found to show different trade behaviors when compared to direct traders (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Following the logic of ====, political tensions, such as those caused by Dalai Lama meetings, should show up predominantly as decreases in imports by direct traders as they cannot cope with the additional costs of circumventing the import restrictions imposed by government action.==== Trade intermediaries in turn should possess the know-how to circumvent such restrictions and may even benefit from firms replacing direct imports with indirect imports sourced through them. By analyzing the differences in direct importers' and trade intermediaries' responses to political tensions caused by the Dalai Lama meetings, we can learn how the firm-level response to political tensions depends on the mode of trade.====Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the import-dampening effect of Dalai Lama meetings operates at the intensive margin (i.e., a decrease in the import value by importer). Second, we mainly find significant reductions in trade values for SOEs and¡ªto a smaller extent¡ªfor foreign-invested firms, but no such relationship for private firms. Third, we find the ¡®Dalai Lama Effect¡¯ to be driven by reductions of trade through direct importers, while trade intermediaries¡ªif anything¡ªappear to benefit and fill the void. We also find that the effect predominantly takes place in the second quarter after the meeting and then disappears. As such, the retaliation is much more short-lived than previously thought. These findings are thus in line with the idea that Chinese importers face a trade-off between bearing costs from suboptimal trade transactions and costs from not accommodating the government.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the estimation method and the data used to analyze how importing firms respond to political tensions. Sections 3¨C5 present the empirical results and discuss their implications. In Section 6, we provide several tests of robustness and account for the potential endogeneity of meetings with the Dalai Lama using an instrumental-variables strategy based on ====.

While researchers have found an asymmetric transmission in the US and other economies, China offers a specific rationale for asymmetries: the presence of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with preferential access to financing. To study the consequences of SOEs for ==== transmission, we differentiate between expansionary and restrictive policy shocks and argue that SOEs generally suffer less from a policy tightening and benefit more from a policy easing. Based on sector-specific ==== time series and a large firm-level data set, we provide evidence of a systematic and sizeable asymmetry in the transmission of monetary policy shocks in China. The nature of the asymmetry is consistent with the notion of explicit or implicit government guarantees of SOEs and has consequences for the adjustment of aggregate variables. In contrast to other central banks, the People's Bank of China seems able to ¡°push on a string¡±.",").==== As a result, tightening shocks should have larger effect on the real economy than easing shocks. As a motivation for asymmetric effects, the literature refers to downward nominal rigidities or one-sided financing constraints.====).====If SOEs are subject to governmental interference and face preferential access to financial resources, they should respond differently to monetary policy impulses than privately owned firms. In addition, the large SOE sector should also affect the way monetary policy affects the aggregate real economy. In this light, it is surprising that the role of SOEs for the transmission of monetary policy has not yet been studied. We fill this gap and study the transmission of policy shocks using disaggregated data for SOEs and private firms, respectively.====Our main hypothesis is that the presence of SOEs gives rise to an asymmetric adjustment to monetary policy shocks. Suppose SOEs are indeed characterised by (i) government interference into their operations and (ii) preferential access to finances. A policy tightening should have stronger effects on private firms and smaller effects on SOEs, since the latter is not equally exposed to an inward shift in credit supply as a consequence of the policy move. Now think of a policy easing: the state-owned sector might expand more than the private sector because authorities could interfere into the management of SOEs in order to use SOEs as a vehicle to support expansionary policies. As a result, SOE activity should expand more strongly than economic activity of private firms.====How does this translate to the aggregate level? If SOEs are a large part of the economy, as they are in China, this should translate into an asymmetry on the aggregate level. In fact, this should imply that easing shocks are more effective in driving GDP than tightening shocks ¨C a pattern that is the opposite of what researchers found for the US and other economies. In this sense, monetary policy in China is ¡°pushing on a string¡±.====We organise our contribution in three main steps: First, we estimate a series of linear vector autoregressive (VAR) models that include aggregate business cycle variables but also relative sectoral information. The latter is either the change in leverage of SOEs relative to that of private firms or the growth rate of SOE investment relative to the growth rate of private investment. A monetary policy shock is identified using restrictions on the sign of the impulse responses (====). Although the model is symmetric, the responses of the relative variables are informative about asymmetries in the adjustment to monetary policy. We find that a monetary policy shock has significantly stronger effects on SOE investment and leverage compared to private firms. Both investment and leverage expand stronger after a policy easing than in the case of private firms.====Second, we use local projections in the spirit of ==== to shed light on the asymmetric reaction to easing and tightening shocks, respectively. Owing to the fact that the previously used model is linear, we cannot use it to study whether sectoral policy transmission is asymmetric. In particular, the VAR is not able to reveal whether the responses to a policy tightening are similar in absolute terms to the responses to a policy easing. We believe this distinction to be important in order to understand the asymmetric policy transmission. To quantify the asymmetry, we estimate a series of local projections (====), which we extend to allow for different effects of positive and negative policy shocks, respectively. Local projections provide a very flexible alternative to VAR models and are ideally suited to analyse nonlinearities and asymmetries.====Using the exogenous change in M2 growth identified by ==== as our measure of monetary policy shocks, we find that on a sectoral level a monetary policy easing benefits SOEs more than private firms. For a monetary tightening, the results are less clear-cut, but tend to suggest that SOEs activity is reduced less compared to private firms. Thus, these asymmetries are in line with the hypothesis put forward before and support the notion of preferential refinancing conditions of the state-owned sector. These sectoral asymmetries also translate into the adjustment of aggregate variables such as GDP, electricity consumption and office space sold. In the aggregate, a policy easing is more effective than a policy tightening. Interestingly, however, the nature of the asymmetries is remarkably different from the US and other economies. In China, monetary policy is able to push on a string.====Third, we use firm-level survey data on 160,000 firms from 37 two-digit ====. The data is assembled by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), and contains information on firms' balance sheets such as total liabilities, total assets, as well as the ownership structure of the firm and several other control variables. We use this data to study the monetary policy impact on firm leverage for SOEs and non-SOEs. We also differentiate between a policy tightening and a policy easing. The results suggest that in general, SOEs' leverage increases when monetary policy is loosened. However, the leverage of non-SOEs decreases. The same is true when monetary policy tightens. The existence of SOEs fundamentally changes the transmission of monetary policy.====This paper contributes to the literature on asymmetries in the transmission of monetary policy, see ==== and others. We study the potential asymmetries against the backdrop of the large share of SOEs in China. Recent papers by ====, ==== and ==== argue that monetary policy in China is difficult to interpret as the PBoC uses more than one instrument to implement its policy and the policymaking process remains opaque. These papers propose ways to deal with the multitude of instruments in empirical studies. ==== and ==== claim that while the policy implementation stage in China is different from other countries, the transmission mechanism is similar. In this paper, we focus on the transmission mechanism and argue that the asymmetry involved is an important distinction with regard to the transmission process in other economies.====It should be noted that asymmetric responses to monetary policy shocks could also result from factors other than the ownership structure or the access to financing, respectively. Research for other countries finds that firms in different sectors or firms of different size respond differently to the same policy shock. Since SOEs are typically large firms clustered in heavy industries, the resulting asymmetries could also be observed even if SOEs and non-SOEs would face identical financing conditions. While the macro data does not allow us to control for firm properties other than ownership, the micro data used in this paper addresses this issue. We control for firm size and firms' asset structure in order to isolate the effect of ownership and, through ownership, the effect of access to financing. Unfortunately, however, we cannot control for industry-specific effects since the data does not allow us to associate a firm with a specific industry.====This paper also contributes to the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission. One of the main objectives of a monetary policy easing is to encourage firms to take more risk and increase investment. However, after a recession or a financial crisis, banks are reluctant to grant riskier loans, and firms are reluctant to take more risk, even in the presence of monetary policy easing. The result of this is that central banks try to ¡°push on a string¡± in order to escape the recession, which is not effective in many cases. The existence of SOEs with implicit government guarantee can help resolve this short run problem. Of course, the possible long-run cost is that SOEs could be less efficient.====This paper is organised as follows: ==== summarizes the main characteristics of SOEs highlighted in the literature. ==== introduces the data series used in the paper. The VAR model is discussed in ====, while ==== introduces state-dependent local projections. ==== completes the analysis with an analysis of firm-level data.

The treatment quality of a hospital is higher if relatively more medical services are provided with fewer deaths. Our research question is twofold: (i) Does the pressure of for-profit lower treatment quality by causing more deaths? (ii) Can government subsidy raise treatment quality by releasing the pressure from market competition? Our empirical results show that the treatment quality in China has been improving during the studied period. There are pieces of evidence that both marketization and government subsidies can boost the treatment quality of the hospitals sector. The co-existence of market force and government regulation is beneficial to the patients.,"The Chinese government has been reforming the hospitals sector over time. It started with administrative decentralization in 1980's and then added market forces to the hospitals sector in 1990's (====). However, the health-care reform has been changing back and forth between market-oriented policy and government-oriented policy (====). As discussed in the next section, the relative effectiveness of these two policies is controversial.====One major measure of market-oriented policy is raising the number of private hospitals. Such measure promotes competition to the hospitals sector in which hospitals pay more attention to costs and revenue. This will provide more medical services by utilizing less resources. However, deaths are unavoidable during the process of providing medical services. Thus, deaths are undesirable outputs in the production process and minimizing deaths is also an important consideration for providing medical services from the society's point of view. In this paper, treatment quality is in general defined as the amount of treatments (medical services) per death. However, higher treatment quality needs not be consistent with profit maximization. The net impacts of more competition on treatment quality are unknown. On the other hand, one major measure of government-oriented policy is direct subsidies to hospitals. With lower pressure of market competition, doctors can concentrate on curing patients and avoiding deaths simultaneously with more subsidies. However, lower competitive pressure can lead to lower productive efficiency. The eventual consequences of more subsidies on treatment quality are also unknown. Currently, private hospitals and public hospitals exist simultaneously in China. Whether more private hospitals should be encouraged is under hot debate. By ascertaining the impacts of a higher level of marketization and more government involvement on the treatment quality of the hospitals sector, this paper aims at providing implications on these two policies.====There are studies on the hospitals sector involving treatment performance and government subsidies, see ====, and ==== for examples. They did not consider simultaneously the variables for market-oriented measure and government-oriented measure. There was not an index that summarizes different dimensions of treatment quality, too. To conduct a thorough analysis of the performance of the hospitals sector in China, this paper adopts the production approach that can incorporate the multi-dimensional nature of production variables and treatment quality.====When we treat a hospital as a production unit, there are desirable outputs (medical services), undesirable outputs (deaths), and inputs. This paper adopts data envelopment analysis (DEA) to study the performance of hospitals in China. There are two dimensions of performance: (i) the productive performance which is measured by technical efficiency and productivity; (ii) the treatment quality performance which is measured by an index that reflects the degree of quality. Current literature using DEA approach to investigate the performance of hospitals focuses on technical efficiency and productivity, see ==== for a survey. Our research uses DEA approach to investigate the treatment quality performance of Chinese hospitals. By adopting the environmental performance index (EPI) introduced by ==== to reflect the quality of medical services provided by hospitals, we are able to find the patterns of treatment quality of Chines hospitals over the studied period and across regions. By examining the determinants of treatment quality, we can quantify the effects of market-oriented measure and government-oriented measure. This can help policy makers to design better policies in reforming the hospitals sector.====The rest parts of this paper are organized as follows: ==== describes the background information of the hospitals sector in China. ==== explains the methodology of estimating treatment quality. ==== describes the data and presents the estimation of treatment quality in China. ==== explores determinations of treatment quality performance and policy implications. ==== discusses policy implications and ==== concludes.",The impacts of marketization and subsidies on the treatment quality performance of the Chinese hospitals sector,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301457,April 2019,2019,Research Article,499

In some developing countries, public insurance programs have rapidly expanded to achieve universal health coverage. Policymakers and researchers are interested in the impacts of insurance on the reduction of people¡¯s financial burden. Previous findings are mixed. Some programs had reduced individuals¡¯ out-of-pocket expenditures, while others find no reduction or even an increasing pattern (====; ====; ====; ====). While the literature mainly focuses on impacts for the overall population, heterogeneity analysis has drawn more and more attention to policy evaluation, especially on the distribution of medical payments (====; ====; ====).====In 2003, China initiated a rural health insurance program, i.e., the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), with the aim to extend health insurance to the rural population and reduce their financial burden of medical expenditures. Since its implementation, there has been an extensive literature evaluating its impacts on a variety of aspects, including health care utilization, medical spending, health status, household savings, and consumption (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Most of the previous studies found no evidence on spending reduction for the overall population. Since subpopulations are different in various aspects, such as demographics, health status, and social economic status, it is likely that programs could have different impacts on various subgroups. A few studies examined the heterogeneity of program impacts by income levels (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, most studies do not provide theoretical analysis to explain their empirical evidence, and a lot of them use data collected from specific areas, so the conclusions may be lack generosity in some sense.====In this paper, we explore the heterogeneous impacts of NRCMS on individuals¡¯ out-of-pocket medical expenditures for subgroups that have different income levels in rural China, both theoretically and empirically. We begin with a theoretical model examining the impacts of health insurance on one¡¯s out-of-pocket medical spending. The model predicts that, under a plausible assumption that health care is a necessity relative to the composite consumption good, being enrolled in the health insurance program would reduce participants¡¯ out-of-pocket medical spending, but the reduction for the rich is greater than that for the poor. The reason for this is that the rich are less sensitive to the decline in costs of health care. As a result, the rise in the rich¡¯s quantity demanded for health care is proportionally smaller than that of the poor, leading to a higher proportion of reduction in the rich¡¯s out-of-pocket medical spending. The model also suggests that being enrolled in the health insurance plan would improve the welfare of enrollees, and the welfare gain for the poor is greater than that for the rich. The intuition is that health care is a necessary good and often accounts for a higher portion of total consumption among the poor, and thus a decrease in the price of a necessity would benefit the poor to a greater extent.==== model to analyze the heterogeneous impacts for individuals at different spending quantiles. The results show significant percentage reductions in out-of-pocket medical spending at the top quantiles. As the rich, in general, spend more on medical care than do the poor, the greater percentage reduction at the top quantiles may suggest the absolute spending reduction is greater for the rich.====This research relates to several existing studies. First, it builds upon a large body of literature evaluating the impacts of various health insurance programs in the developing world including China. Policymakers are interested in learning whether insurance programs reduced the financial burden of their population, or whether the insurance improved access to medical resources (==== and ==== on Vietnam; ==== on Taiwan; ==== on Mexico; ==== on Ghana; ==== on India; ==== on Nicaragua; ==== on China¡¯s Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance or URBMI program; ==== and ==== on China¡¯s Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance or UEBMI program). ==== and ==== both find that Vietnam¡¯s non-profit health insurance and Ghana¡¯s social health insurance program reduces out-of-pocket expenditures. ==== find that the URBMI has not reduced total out-of-pocket expenditure. Enrollees¡¯ medical spending might not decrease when consumer behaviors are affected by a variety of factors, such as improved access of health care, moral hazard, and physician-induced demand. The current study focuses on policy evaluation of NRCMS, the largest health insurance program ever in the world. Accordingly, other countries may draw relevant lessons from China¡¯s experience.====Second, our work also relates to a broad range of literature on income gradient. Income inequality exists in all countries, and it is widely known that behaviors of the rich and the poor could be greatly divergent (==== on Sweden; ==== on Germany; ==== on the United States; ==== on Canada). Most of the previous studies on policy evaluation studied the entire population, and thus estimated only the average impacts. Our work contributes to the literature by focusing specifically on income heterogeneity. We provide robust evidence for the assertion that, in spite of the fact that there were no significant reductions in out-of-pocket medical spending for the entire population, participants in different income groups indeed benefited from the program in different ways. The finding could help policymakers to better understand the program and to improve the designs of future policies.====Third, our paper builds upon a growing series of studies on the program evaluation of NRCMS. Previous research has examined its impacts on financial protection in the total population (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In addition, some focused on a specific sub-population (====, ==== on the elderly; ====) and the behaviors of health care providers (====) and healthcare cost (====). A few studies touched upon income heterogeneity (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), the most notable of which is ====, who found a similar result that the impacts on out-of-pocket medical spending were less pronounced in the poorest population. However, the limitation of these studies is that their data are mainly collected from specific areas. For example, ==== used data from two provinces, and ==== utilized data from 15 counties. Their conclusions are thus region-specific, and cannot be extended to other areas.

There has been a substantial quantity of literature concentrated on the intergenerational transmission of income, which focuses on the correlation between the incomes of parents and their children (====; ====; ====; ====The effect of education on inequality and intergenerational mobility of income has been analyzed in some literature. For example, some scholars found that parental education plays one of the most important roles in conferring economic status (====; ====). More recently, ==== argued that family investment in early education plays an important role in explaining income inequality and intergenerational income mobility. Furthermore, parents' educational attainment provides an important source of predictors, both short- and long-term, for the lives of their children (====).====Increasing numbers of papers have emerged during the last ten years which focus on the intergenerational transmission of education (====; ====; ====). However, compared to the abundant amount of studies on intergenerational transmission of income (====; ====), intergenerational transmission of education is a topic that has been less explored. This is especially true in the context of China. These heretofore neglected topics provide the impetus for our own research.====The overall goal of this paper is to examine the intergenerational transmission of education in the context of rural China. Under this goal, we have two specific objectives. First, we seek to investigate whether there exists any intergenerational transmission of education by using a unique dataset from rural China collected by the authors themselves. Second, we want to understand whether there exist any differences in intergenerational transmission of education across different birth cohorts.====The results based on ordinary least squares (OLS) show there exists significant transmission of education across generations. However, the intergenerational transmission effects estimated by family fixed effects (FFE) are comparatively minute. The results also show a significant transmission of education across generations for those cohorts born after 1980 but not for those cohorts born by 1980. This means the initial results were mainly driven by the cohorts born after 1980.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

I employ both self-reported trust and the presence of village temple prior to 1949 as proxies for social capital. I find that households in communities with higher levels of social capital are more likely to participate in ROLAs, using household data collected from the Gansu province in China.","Rotating labor associations (ROLAs) are ¡°economic institutions that define unconditional contracts for the solution of the lumpiness problem¡± (====) following a pattern of exchange of labor. Its institutional variant of the same principle is rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) (====; ====; ====). Unlike in a ROSCA where members exchange money, in a ROLA, usually a few households who reside in the same village, voluntarily gather together to work on sowing or harvesting in peak farming seasons, or in some cases villagers help each other in building or maintaining their houses. No material payment is incurred in the process. ROLAs can be widely found in rural areas throughout the world. They are particularly prevalent in development countries, such as Burkina Faso (====), China (====), Dominica (====), Indonesia (====, ====), Republic of Congo (====), Zimbabwe (====). Labor exchange is also found in developed countries, such as France (====) and Japan (====).====There are many potential advantages for members joining ROLAs when wage labor is not feasible. Firstly, all the members can finish their work earlier than by working alone. Agricultural tasks can be finished quickly since each villager only has around one third of an acre of farmland. Since finishing sowing and harvesting in time is important, all villagers are potentially better off by participating in ROLAs. Secondly, labor pooling enables specialization since there are a lot of different activities within the tasks of sowing or harvesting. Thirdly, labor pooling can allow some agricultural activities to be undertaken that could not be done alone. For example, transporting agricultural outputs from the land to home typically requires more than one person. This is especially important for the old and female labor. Fourthly, villagers sometimes have different skills that make cooperation more efficient than working alone. For example, some villagers have agricultural machine specific skills, while others do not. ==== does find evidence that participation in ROLAs is a source of productivity growth for capital constrained farmers in Indonesia.====In contemporary China, a large proportion of rural laborers are conducting nonfarm work in cities and towns, leaving labor shortages especially in rural peak farming seasons.==== It seems intuitive that such labor shortage may have triggered demand for ROLAs, and that this explains their recent growth. But demand is not sufficient to ensure their existence since the voluntarily-organized associations rely on strong internal enforcement mechanisms to sustain themselves. This has been formally demonstrated by ==== who show that members in similar rotating associations, ROSCAs, who receive the first money ¡°pot¡± always have incentive to deviate from the arrangement, even in an infinitely repeated game, without extra enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. The upshot is that these organizations cannot be sustained without relying on some sort of extra means of enforcement. An analogous enforcement problem applies directly to members of ROLAs,==== though in these cases the enforcement problem will even be worse because unlike the caste of ROSCAs where monetary contributions are provided to a pot, with ROLAs there is also the difficulty of ascertaining whether labor contributions, which are not perfectly observable due to potential shirking, have in fact been correctly provided.====It thus seems reasonable to hypothesize that social capital, which generally refers to ¡°trust, concern for one's associates, a willingness to live by the norms of one's community and to punish those who do not¡± (====) or ¡°connections among individuals ¨C social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them¡± (====), may be key in allowing the formation of ROLAs. The effects of social capital has been posited previously in many such cooperative settings: On voluntary cooperation in the management of irrigation systems (====, ====; ====; ====; ====), in communal forest management (====), in watershed management (====), Soil Conservation (====), and Solid Waste Management (====).====The case study on the determinants of labor exchange in a Dominican village shows that labor exchange is tied to the village social network (====). This paper aims to empirically test the importance of social capital for villagers' participation in ROLAs, using field data collected from rural China. I first use the self-reported trust as a proxy of social capital to test whether social capital matters for ROLAs participation. I then use the historical presence of village temples prior to 1949==== as an additional proxy of social capital, inspired by ==== and ====. These two papers use current existence of village temples as a proxy of social capital, while in this paper I exploit the presence of temples before 1949. The advantage of using this historical information is that the impacts of omitted variables reflecting contemporary economic or social conditions can be greatly isolated. The regression results show that social capital has a strong effect on villagers' participation in ROLAs. I also conduct robustness checks to substantiate the main results, by controlling for additional variables which could potentially link with both social capital and labor exchange. I find that none of these overturn the results, and the coefficients of social capital almost remain the same as in the baseline model.====This paper contributes to the research on the determinants of ROLAs. Though the presence of ROLAs has important implications for agricultural production and thus has important impacts on rural development, research into the determinants of labor exchange is rare, particularly in economics. ====, ==== is the pioneer who conducts a theoretical analysis on credit and labor market imperfections and the technological benefits of group work and then tests the predictions by data in Indonesia. There are also some case studies from other social sciences. For example, ==== observes that the invention and rapid spread of small-size agricultural machines contributes to the decline of labor exchange in rural Japan, since those machines enabled Japanese farmers to carry out rice farming by family labor alone.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses the measurement of social capital. ==== estimates the correlation between social capital and villagers' participation in ROLAs. ==== performs robustness checks. ==== draws conclusions.",Social capital and Rotating Labor Associations in rural China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301366,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,502

Although China has implemented market-based economic reforms and transitioned from a Soviet-style planned economy since 1978, the far-reaching national programs officially titled ==== still provide targets and programs for the country's next five years of development and are believed to continue to have a substantial impact on the national economic landscape.====Besides the national FYP (NFYP), each provincial government in China also issues its own five-year program for regional development. Generally, the provincial FYP (PFYP) imitates social and economic targets of the NFYP plus other development targets determined by local ====. Special treatment (e.g. tax credits, subsidies, and favorable loan rates) by government at all levels is then assigned to strategic sectors identified by the national and provincial FYPs. In short, the FYP is one of the most significant indicators of whether and how regional governments take part in resource reallocation in an attempt to influence the economic performance of industries in the short and long term. An analysis of the relationship between NFYPs and PFYPs is the first main concern of this paper.====A central part of IP in many economies including China is to pick particular industries for preferential treatment. This policy begs the question: do the selected industries benefit from the policy and, more broadly, does such policy benefit the economy as a whole? In general, many economists are skeptical of the efficacy of IP. They suspect governments are not very good at ¡°picking winners¡± and that the real aim of IP is to benefit friends, electors in marginal electorates, lobby groups and so on. Nevertheless, there are also some good arguments based on the presence of market failure to support the use of IP; these are comprehensively reviewed by ==== and ====.====One argument for IP is based on the presence of market imperfections. ====, for example, pointed out that firms in emerging markets are exposed to more severe constraints due to financial market frictions than those in the developed countries, and financial constraints tend to be one of the primary obstacles for firms to invest in developing countries. Policies such as subsidies for innovation are capable of providing low-cost capital to relax firms' financial constraints in developing countries.====A second rationale for IP is the infant industry argument, which was first formulated by ==== and ====. The justification for infant-industry protection is the presence of dynamic learning effects that are external to the firm. The Mill-Bastable Test has been formulated to justify this kind of protection policy (====; ====), the thrust of which is as follows: (i) Protection must be temporary and the infant industry should mature to the point where it becomes viable without protection. (ii) The cumulative net benefits provided by the protected industry should exceed the cumulative costs of protection. ====, using Turkish data for 1963¨C1976, is the first study to look for a correlation between infant-industry protection and productivity growth; they concluded that the empirical evidence did not provide support for the infant-industry argument. However, ====, using the same data set, showed that more protected sectors did in fact exhibit higher productivity growth. ====, ==== and ==== also studied the optimal way in which protection should be granted and ==== documented that much of China's export surge occurred simultaneously with the imposition of high tariffs during the period 1985¨C2004.====The third argument for IP is based on the idea that some industries exhibit Marshallian externalities, which are local externalities due to the existence of transportation costs. These externalities can arise through labor pooling and input-output linkages which, together with transportation costs, ensure that the pecuniary externalities remain local and increase with the size of the industry (====; ====; ====; ====Finally, several recent studies focus on the argument of industrial policy for industrial upgrading and competition. ==== argued that the varied economic performance of different countries is partly explained by the goods that they produce. ==== emphasized that there are ¡°special industries¡±, and that countries can increase welfare by reallocating resources to those industries. Other things being equal (including physical and human capital stocks), countries that specialize in ¡°strategic industries¡±, which provide more opportunities for learning by doing, will trigger technological and industrial upgrading. Within the framework of the new structural economics, ==== argued for a proactive role for the government in nurturing development by actively supporting industries that contribute to growth during industrial development and upgrading. ==== find that there exists complementarity between competition and IP. Using firm-level data for China, they show that IP targeted at competitive sectors increases productivity growth.====Our paper is related to the large body of empirical work about the effect of policy changes on industrial and regional development, including specific applications to China. Governments of many emerging-market countries, such as China, are more likely to play a proactive role in directing financial resources than those in developed countries. In the allocation of capital they tend to favor state-owned firms and firms that have strong ties to the state (====). Economic zones are an important vehicle of IP in China and have recently been the subject of several papers (====; ====; ====; ====) studying their impact on economic development. While these papers focus on the effectiveness and heterogeneity of IP across places, ours is more interested in the effectiveness and heterogeneity of IP across industries.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First we investigate the determinants of an industry's being selected in a PFYP, focusing particularly on the influence of the central government's selections in its NFYP but also analyzing the importance of industry- and province-specific characteristics. Second, we present an empirical analysis of the policy impact on industry output to assess the benefits of IP in China. More specifically, we estimate the predicted selection probability of an industry using ====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Previously, research has focused on language proficiency' effects on earnings, with little research having been done on how proficiency affects employment probabilities vis-¨¤-vis unemployment. Data will be taken from the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), which makes it possible to distinguish between employed and unemployed people. Using a linear probability model, it is estimated that a one-standard-deviation increase in Mandarin proficiency decreases unemployment probabilities by 5%. Significant heterogeneity is also found. The ¡®employment premium¡¯ for language proficiency is highest for younger people and people living in urban areas. The effects on employment is not significant for older people, and people living in rural areas.","Although virtually all Chinese people speak some form of ¡®Chinese¡¯, only a portion of them is proficient in the official dialect, Modern Standard Chinese, or ¡®Mandarin¡¯. Indeed, despite efforts at standardisation, official figures indicate that by 2014, 30% of the population was still unable to use Mandarin to communicate (====), which is slightly less than double the percentage of people able to hold a conversation in English amongst the EU-27 states in 2012 (====). The use of ¡®dialect¡¯ in this context is perhaps somewhat misleading. Indeed, ==== show that the mutual intelligibility of these dialects can be as low as 2% (measured on a sample of words and sentences), and on average does not surpass 50%. As pointed out in ====, dialects distancing only 100?km from each other may already be mutually unintelligible. Therefore, though being referred to as ¡®dialects¡¯, it is important to bear in mind that some of these ¡®dialects¡¯ differ more between themselves than, say, Dutch and German or even German and English.==== In this sense it is (in some contexts) useful to think of Mandarin not so much as the native language of all Chinese people, but rather as the ==== of China.====Hence, for most Chinese people, Mandarin is somewhere between being a native language, an intelligible dialect, and an almost ¡®foreign¡¯ language. This uniqueness also makes it an intrinsically interesting language to study in the emerging field of ¡®language economics¡¯, which investigates the relationship between language proficiency and labour market outcomes.====This paper asks the question of whether increased proficiency increases employment probabilities. The results suggest that a one standard-deviation increase in Mandarin proficiency increases employment probabilities by roughly 5%. As to the mechanisms through which proficiency in a country's official language affects labour market outcomes for non-immigrants positively, a two-fold explanation suggests itself (====; ====). First, improved labour market outcomes could be due to the higher productivity of people with a high level of proficiency in the official, standard language. Higher proficiency implies improved communication with other people in the production process, which in turn implies higher productivity. Second, the negative effect of low proficiency could also be due to narrow-minded employers who may discriminate against low-proficiency speakers by taking low proficiency to be a signal of low socio-cultural background. In empirical research, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between the two, and by which of these two mechanisms Mandarin proficiency affects employment probabilities in China cannot be conclusively determined here. However, though this evidence can only be suggestive at best, this paper also finds that social status is not related to Mandarin proficiency in China (see ====). This is likely due to the fact that (for now, at least) proficiency in Mandarin varies horizontally across regions more than it varies vertically across social groups. In other words, the ¡®employment premium¡¯ may in fact be due to the increased productivity a worker has who can seamlessly communicate in the official language of an economic area.====The rest of this paper is organised as follows. ==== surveys the relevant literature. ==== presents the data from the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) and specifies the methodology that will be used in this paper. ==== presents the results. ==== carries out robustness checks. ==== concludes this paper.",Does higher language proficiency decrease the probability of unemployment?

Based on establishment-level panel datasets in the textile and electronics ","This paper exploits a detailed establishment-level panel dataset to compare the dynamics of firm productivity across two Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) members (Indonesia and Vietnam) and China in the 2000s, aiming to investigate whether there is technological catch-up in the ASEAN plus China paradigm. The flying-geese (FG) model of Asia's economic development shaped the industrial dynamics in East Asia in the 1960s¨C1980s (====).====Recovering from the Asian Financial Crisis (hereafter, AFC), the members of ASEAN have experienced persistent and spectacular economic growth, achieving an average annual economic growth rate of 5.82% during the 2000¨C2013 period and becoming the center of world economic growth. Among these emerging economies, Indonesia and Vietnam are the two brightest stars, as they have abundant natural resources and cheap labor, which are attractive to FDI, particularly as China's labor costs have skyrocketed recently. In terms of development trajectory, Vietnam has been closely following China's path (====). After the introduction of market reforms in 1986, the adoption of an export-led growth strategy through attracting export-oriented FDI has contributed to its rapid economic growth (====; ====). On the other hand, Indonesia has traveled a different one. Its open policy was implemented earlier than China. A series of economic reforms in the mid-1980s further contributed to Indonesian rapid economic growth and industrialization experienced in the following decade, so it is expected to be destined shortly becoming a newly industrialized economy (====; ====). Thus, Indonesia experienced a higher GDP per capita and technological capability than those of China before the 1997 AFC which impacted the Indonesian economy dramatically.====Productivity is one of key factors differentiating firm competitiveness as well as per-capita income across countries, and it is also the critical driver of sustaining long-run economic growth. Benefiting from the availability of micro-data, an emerging line of literature has begun to assess firms' productivity dynamics in Asian developing countries. Micro-data analyses can provide new implications for the key aspects of manufacturing behaviors that are missing at the macro level (====), while studies for China (e.g., ====; ====) and Indonesia (e.g., ====; ====) are rare and there is almost no firm-level analysis on productivity dynamics for Vietnam, except for ====.==== Crucially, there is no study, to our best knowledge, comparing the productivity gap in the China-ASEAN paradigm.====The textile and electronics industries are two typical industries in the manufacturing sector. Both China and Vietnam have benefited from a boom in their textile and clothing exports following the cessation of quotas and the signing of the United States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (USBTA), respectively.==== For Vietnam, reducing the specialization in textiles and clothing and joining the Asian production network in electronics products remain major challenges (====), as its technological capability is insufficient to meet the needs of producing ICT products. Indonesia is also a major clothing exporting country with a similar clothing export value to that of Vietnam. For example, Indonesia's and Vietnam's clothing exports were respectively $5.106 billion and $4.805 million in 2005, and Indonesia has sprung into the top five in the U.S. clothing market since 2004 (====). The electronics industry serves another leading role in Indonesia's export sector due to its long-standing and well integrated into globalized production systems, given that FDI has contributed to moderate technological change in this industry since the late 1980s (====). From the viewpoint of technological diffusion and total factor productivity (TFP) convergence, the extent and evolution of TFP differences across China and ASEAN are of particular interest. This study provides some of the first evidence on examining the productivity gap across countries in ASEAN+1, filling the gap in this strand of the literature.====To conduct an international comparison of the productivity gap, one point worth noting is that firms face different production opportunities that force them to make choices from different sets of feasible input-output combinations in various countries. These differences are not only attributed to the available stocks of physical, human, and financial capital, economic infrastructure, and resource endowments, but also other characteristics of the physical, social, and political environments in which production takes place (====, ====, and ====, do not take the differences in technology frontiers into account, which may lead to a biased productivity gap. The stochastic metafrontier production approach developed by ==== and ==== provides a more appropriate methodology to assess firm productivity across countries.====This paper attempts to examine the technology gaps across China, Indonesia, and Vietnam in both the textile and electronics industries during the period 2000¨C2007, enabling us to evaluate the degree of catching-up. Two novelties contained in this study contribute to the literature. First, there is no study directly comparing the productivity of firms (or plants) in the same industry-year from the perspective of ASEAN+1. We use large and comprehensive micro-datasets from various countries to examine industry-specific productivity dynamics in China and ASEAN. Our study thus helps understand whether and how latecomers catch up with the leading dragon. Second, this study employs the stochastic metafrontier approach to calculate firms' TFP growth in various countries and construct catch-up indices, enabling us to obtain more accurate figures concerning the TFP gap and the degree of catching-up.

According to the ¡°National New Urbanization Plan (2012-2020)¡±, between 1978 and 2013 the proportion of the population living in cities increased from 17.9% to 53.7%, the number of cities rose from 193 to 658, and the number of people living in cities went up from 170 million to 730 million.==== In 2002, there were 92 cities in China with a total population of >100 million, and by 2010 the number had increased to 137; a growth rate of 48.9%.==== Along with such rapid urbanization, two apparently contradictory phenomena have taken place: on the one hand, the number of migrant workers rose to 245 million in 2013 compared to 147 million in 2008, meaning that the number of rural migrants entering the cities in search of employment has been steadily increasing over this time. On the other hand, growth in rural migrants' earnings was found to be much smaller than that for urban residents, which was on average Yuan 2609 per month in 2013 (59.7% of citizens).==== Given the extent of this stream of rural-urban migration and the fact that economic circumstances have become less favourable for rural migrants, there is considerable interest in exploring how these migrants fare in the labour market of expanding cities.====Observations of industrialized countries indicate that in line with urbanization, the incomes of inhabitants grow faster in bigger cities, and that differences in income can be explained by many factors like skill, education, gender, race and so on (====; ====; ====; ====, ====). Most studies explore the reason for higher income in bigger cities and estimate the wage gap in different skill groups (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). But the literature is typically quiet in this respect for developing countries. In the case of China, only a small number of research is available on city size and wage variation (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), and only a handful on city size, identity and wage (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). The potentially critical influence of the residential identity of the city dweller (citizens and rural migrants) on the labour market outcomes in China is rarely scientifically examined.====From studies on USA and European countries, it is well known that newly arrived international immigrants have lower earnings on average than native-born workers with similar educational levels and that they catch up with those of the natives over time spent in their destination countries (====; ====; ====).==== Unlike these Western examples, Chinese cities are made up of native citizens and migrants who are mostly from rural regions. Under the reform of urbanization in China, ==== rural residents go to the cities in search of jobs and live there. In terms of identity, these rural migrants are different from those who are registered in local cities (we will call them citizens).==== This study will provide a complete understanding of earning disparities in the city labour market from the perspective of the identity of rural migrants compared to the citizens.==== (matching their various other characteristics).====In a recent paper ==== use one year cross section data of CHIP, 2007 to demonstrate the city size skill premium of the labourers. Using CHIP, 2002 and 2013, we further show the changing trend of skill premium in this decade and explore the effect of city size on wages and measure the discrimination faced by the rural migrants compared to the urban citizens. In another research ====,==== uses Rural-Urban Migration in China and Indonesia (RUMiCI) of 2008 to study the rural migrants' city size premium and does not attempt to compare any variation due to heterogeneous labour like citizens versus rural migrants or high-skilled versus low-skilled. He uses the Heckman two-step methods to deal with the self-selection problem. Our PSM method while addresses the selection problem calculates the numerical CSWP that ==== was unable to determine.====Our study adds further value to existing papers (====; ==== and ====) that examine the relationship between city-size, identity and wage in China.

Thus, it contributes the literature in several ways. Firstly, besides the skill, identity is examined as another factor responsible for city size wage premium. Secondly, besides computing the city-size wage premium in the form of regression coefficients (which is the common methodology used in the literature), our paper corrects the possible self-selection bias that may originate from spatial sorting and for the first time in literature calculates the numerical city size wage premium.

Using China's ==== system reform as the background, we calibrated the model and simulated the effects of removing legal labor mobility constraints and lowering migration costs. We argue that human capital redistribution during rural-urban migration is the key to understanding the consequences of rural-urban migration. And, besides the positive effects on productivity and income growth, we found that rural-urban migration also caused brain drain in rural regions, decreased production and inflated price of agricultural products, and widened the rural-urban income gap.====This paper makes four main contributions to the literature. First, the theoretical model of self-selection in migration based on calibration and simulations used in this study complements existing empirical research on self-selection in migration (====). ==== modeled rural-urban migration as a self-selection process, and then used Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) data to estimate the effects of migration on income distributions. In this paper, we emphasize the effects of migration on human capital, labor, output and income. Second, we formalize ====¡¯s idea in the context of migration, and extend the model by utilizing multiple sectors to better describe the Chinese economy. The assumption of self-selection mechanism in a four-sector economy is much more realistic than the two-sector economy assumption in other theoretical studies on rural-urban migration in China. For example, ==== use numerical simulation methods to analyze the effect of removing migration restriction in China, based on static models of a two-sector economy. Third, since we analyze the effects of internal migration on domestic development, the work complements the literature on the microeconomic effects of migration.

The cluster of export processing business inside the EPZs provides an opportunity for neighboring Chinese firms to observe. Chinese firms quickly imitate foreign exporters in both export and import patterns. Exports of the exact products shipped from EPZs immediately increase throughout the province, with the largest gains in the city containing the EPZ, and the next largest in the cities adjacent to the EPZ. Chinese firms also import the same equipment imported by firms in EPZs, suggesting that they imitate foreign technology. Furthermore, we find that Chinese firms who imitate experience modest gains in profitability and productivity. We conclude that a key ingredient of China¡¯s success in trade has been its ability to attract foreign capital and subsequently imitate them.","After decades of rapid growth, China became the world¡¯s largest trading nation in 2013. While there is little doubt that reform and liberalization have propelled much of this growth, it remains difficult to assess the effectiveness of individual policies (====; ====; ====). Yet disentangling the contributors to China¡¯s incredible success is of fundamental importance to understanding China¡¯s rise as well as assessing whether it can be replicated in other countries.====In this paper, we document an important yet previously unaccounted-for contributing factor in China¡¯s export machine. China started to authorize EPZs at the end of 2000 to combat ====Using city-product level information aggregated from Chinese customs transaction data, we study the effect of the establishment of EPZs on the cities surrounding them. We assume that the concentration of successful foreign processing business provides a rare opportunity for Chinese firms to observe and learn, especially for firms closer to the EPZs. We find that Chinese firms quickly export more of the same products exported from EPZs, with the largest growth occurring in the city of the EPZ, and the next largest growth in adjacent cities.====We utilize three layers of variation to identify the effects of EPZs in our study. First, since the placement of EPZs is likely to be non-random, we study the spillovers from EPZs primarily in cities adjacent to the EPZ, reasoning that these spillovers would be facilitated by spatial proximity. Cities adjacent to the city of EPZ cannot choose where an EPZ is established or which products are shipped from it. While there are many unobserved factors that could influence the exports of an EPZ and other outcomes in the city of the EPZ, the number of factors that could jointly determine both the exports of an EPZ and outcomes in adjacent cities is far fewer. In addition, we take advantage of the staggered establishment of EPZs across the country. Second, we match products exported from EPZs using their Harmonized System (HS) product codes at the 8-digit level. Codes in the HS are very narrowly defined at the 8-digit level, and we observe increases precisely within these codes and not for similar products matching at the HS4 or HS6 level. Third, we examine the timing of export gains, and find that most of the increase occurs beginning in the year immediately following that of first export from the EPZ and that gains in exports by Chinese firms persist over the subsequent periods. The timing evidence suggests that we can attribute the export surge to the establishment of EPZs.====Exports by foreign firms inside EPZs are primarily ¡°processing¡± exports, in which processing parties follow the design and production instructions of foreign firms. The type of exports we study are ¡°ordinary¡± exports, where the Chinese firm manufactures its own product and sells it without any arrangement with a foreign firm. We find that the increases in foreign processing exports spill over to Chinese firms¡¯ ordinary exports, rather than processing exports. In our baseline specification, if a product is exported from an EPZ, ordinary trade exports of the same HS8 product by Chinese firms are 75% larger in cities bordering the EPZ. These gains in value are accompanied by larger numbers of exporters, suggesting that more Chinese firms enter these markets.====We proceed to provide an important mechanism that suggests that Chinese firms are imitating their foreign counterparts. We observe the HS codes and first import dates of equipment imported by EPZs. We find that imports of this equipment by Chinese firms experience a large, one-time surge immediately following the date of first import by the EPZ. Again, the biggest increases occur in the city of the EPZ, with the next biggest in cities adjacent to the EPZ. Imports are also limited to the exact equipment imports of EPZs, rather than similar types of products. Importing the same equipment suggests that Chinese firms are imitating the production technology of foreign counterparts.====While we cannot directly observe the technology or production processes of Chinese or foreign firms, we define ¡°imitation¡± for the purposes of this paper by suggesting that imitation has occurred when the export patterns and import patterns of foreign firms are duplicated by neighboring Chinese firms. An anecdotal example is illustrative of this definition of imitation.====In 2003, a foreign firm began exporting HS code 85445110, ¡°Connector cables between 80V and 1000V,¡± from the EPZ in the city of Hangzhou. In the same year, they also began importing one type of equipment: HS code 84629910, ¡°Other mechanical presses.¡±==== In the neighboring city of Jiaxing, exports of HS code 85445110 jumped from about $10,000 per year in 2002 and 2003 to more than $100,000 per year in 2004 and 2005. We also observe a surge in imports of HS code 84629910 in 2004, with orders more than quadrupling that year before settling back down to previous levels.====We entertain various alternative explanations that involve location-specific, product-specific, time-specific shocks that may also explain the above findings. First, we show that the regional agglomeration argument is not the primary driver of our findings. If regional agglomeration were to explain our results, we would expect that WOFEs, which account for almost all exports in EPZs, might have the greatest potential to benefit from ====. However, we find the opposite story: WOFEs in adjacent cities quickly move out of those cities and cut their exports of the products exported from EPZs; Joint ventures and partnerships are unaffected. Only firms with entirely Chinese ownership increase in exports after new product introductions by EPZs.====Second, we rule out the possibility that the results are caused by persistent ex ante differences such as area-specific comparative advantage between adjacent cities and non-adjacent cities; we show that the expansions in exports and imports by Chinese firms coincide with the exact timing of the introduction of those products by EPZs. Within each EPZ, we observe the date of first export for each product at the HS8 level. To address the possibility that region-specific comparative advantage explains our results, we include controls for the exports of products that are similar but not identical, reasoning that comparative advantage should extend to a broader set of products rather than a single HS8 code. Specifically, we control for product exports matching HS6 or HS4 codes but not matching HS8 codes and find very similar results.====Third, we augment our baseline specification with city-year and product-year fixed effects. City-specific or product-specific time-varying shocks would not survive these types of controls, but our results are largely unaffected.====Finally, we perform a placebo test to disentangle the effects of EPZs from other related zone-based policies. By design, almost all EPZs were located within economic and technological development zones (ETDZs), but not all ETDZs contain EPZs. We exploit this fact to separate the effects of EPZs from ETDZs, focusing on the set of products which are exported from ETDZs, but are not exported from the EPZ within the ETDZ. We find that these products show entirely different patterns of results, with little evidence of spillovers from ETDZs.====We examine the implications of our above results and find that Chinese firms who imitate EPZ exporters experience modest gains in operating performance relative to their peers. Participation in export markets is often viewed as a precursor for economic growth.==== We compare the growth of productivity between imitating Chinese firms and those firms that export similar but not identical products (those products share the same first 6 digits but differ in the last 2 digits), and find that imitating firms exhibit greater improvements in total factor productivity and in profitability.====This paper documents Chinese imitation of foreign firms on a large scale. As such, it relates to ====, who explain the relatively low foreign direct investment (FDI) between China and advanced economies using quid pro quo arrangements where firms must transfer technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Our results imply that Chinese indigenous firms imitate foreign technology without any formal arrangements or agreements. Recent papers attempt to link firm export and production to their imports. ==== show that exporters use higher quality imports to produce higher quality exports. As in their paper, we integrate export and import behavior into a narrative about the Chinese export machine. We complement their results by showing how certain types of imports, like those selected as equipment by foreign firms, can lead to increased exports and productivity gains among imitating Chinese firms. In some ways, our paper is similar to that of ====, who show that when firms begin shipping to a new foreign market, other firms in the same city learn to enter these new markets. Unlike their paper, we focus on Chinese firms learning from foreign ones; this is a different process and has different implications than Chinese firms learning from other Chinese ones. In our paper, Chinese firms imitate which products to ship, rather than which market to enter. Moreover, we provide a mechanism in the form of equipment imports, and we study firms in adjacent cities rather than firms in the same city.====Our paper contributes to two broad strands of literature. A large literature studies the spillover effects of FDI. Despite numerous theoretical models outlining various channels, empirical evidence has been inconclusive.==== In the context of China, ==== and ==== use a combination of industry-level data on FDI flows and firm survey data to find that FDI inflows into China are associated with the probability of new product introductions. Our work contributes to the FDI literature in two ways. First, the policy of EPZs provides a great setting to identify spillovers because we can observe foreign investments in EPZs start from nothing and grow to large levels. Moreover, EPZs are physically segregated from other parts of the city, limiting the extent of spillovers that could occur. Second, we provide additional insight into how FDI spillover effects take place as we utilize exports and imports to shed light on the imitation channel.====Another strand of related literature evaluates the benefits of place-targeted programs.==== In the context of China, several papers study the outcomes of special economic zones (SEZs).==== These papers, which focus on the benefit of SEZs to their own cities, may be subject to endogeneity concerns since zones are not placed randomly. We focus on cities adjacent to those EPZs to avoid these concerns. Since cities are unlikely to be able to influence the establishment of their neighbors¡¯ EPZs, and cannot pick which products are exported, we believe that our empirical design is close to a causal inference.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. ==== provides an overview of the institutional background of EPZs. ==== describes our data. ==== discusses the empirical strategy and presents the main results. ==== concludes.",Imitating to export,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301160,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,508

The heterogeneous ==== can be explained by the difference in industrial structure between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Our analysis empirically suggests that the Clean Air Action helped drive the structural change of the Chinese economy by substantially suppressing ¡°dirty¡± manufacturing sectors.","While China has made remarkable economic progress during past decades, the country has been plagued by heavy air pollution (====; ====; ====). It has caused immense adverse effects on the domestic well-being (====), such as significantly lowering life expectancy (====; ====), increasing mortality rates (====), and reducing labor productivity (====; ====). It has also led to transboundary environmental and health damages (====; ====).====During the first quarter of 2013, in particular, China was hit by several severe haze episodes (====). The maximum daily concentration of PM==== reached 766?¦Ìg/m====, which is >10 times the WHO's Interim Target-1 for the 24-h concentration of PM==== (====; ====).==== It was China's declaration of war on air pollution (====). The Clean Air Action strengthened air pollution regulation to an unprecedented level, and became one of the most recent, largest, and highest-stakes environmental programs in China (====; ====).====Recent studies have shown that the Clean Air Action has led to a significant improvement in air quality since 2013 (====; ====). According to assessment results from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE)====, the average concentration of PM==== in 2017 in 338 cities of prefecture-level and above dropped by 22.7% as compared to 2013 levels, and the average concentrations of PM==== fell by 39.6%, 34.3%, and 27.7% respectively in the three regions of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta (====). ==== revealed that even within the first two years of the action, the national PM====-attributable mortality was reduced by a magnitude of 120,000 people.====The critical question that remains unanswered, however, is the potential cost of the action. With industrial pollution as one of its foci, the Clean Air Action is likely to cause a profound impact on China's manufacturing and its entire economy.==== There has been intense public discussion about the size of the action's economic costs, with contrasting viewpoints and anecdotes being presented.====; ====). They are eager to understand the relationship between the two targets and the economic cost of air pollution regulation, in order to adjust their strategies and efforts (====).====There is a trade-off in China¡¯s tactics for its war on pollution. Unlike the situation in developed countries where more clearly-defined command-and-control and market-based policies have been adopted, the Clean Air Action in China still employed a lot of administrative measures (e.g. orders from governmental authorities to speedily shut down polluting plants), which could embrace more arbitrariness and ambiguity. On one hand, the strong regulatory style with unprecedented political determination considerably alleviates the serious issue of weak policy enforcement, helping achieve some quicker effects==== in mitigating pollution. On the other hand, it could also risk a larger economic downslide due to higher compliance costs. It is argued by ====The impact of the Clean Air Action on the economy echoes the intriguing debate over the economic costs of environmental regulation. Many economists hold as the conventional wisdom that more stringent environmental regulation increases polluting firms' production costs and reduces the optimal output, leading to weakened economic performances both at the micro and the macro levels. On the other hand, there are also supporters for the argument that environmental regulation enhances productivity and competitiveness by stimulating innovation, which is usually called the Porter Hypothesis (====; ====).====Even though there has been inspiring progress on the empirical examinations of this debate, the results are still sparse and divided, and cannot be oversimplified. ====), significant decline of total factor productivity (====), substantial losses of jobs (====; ====) and earnings (====), as well as the decrease of births of firms in polluting industries (====). On the contrary, ====, ==== found that strict air pollution regulation in the Los Angeles Air Basin around the 1980¡¯s brought a sharp increase in the total factor productivity of local oil refineries, but only reduced employment slightly. ==== also demonstrated that the environmental regulation around the 1980¡¯s only caused an insignificant effect on employment in four heavily polluting industries in the United States.====This debate could be further intensified in the context of developing countries. On one hand, firms in developing countries usually rely more on the extensive use of natural resources and the low cost of polluting behaviors to survive, and thus tighter environmental regulation may hurt their economic performance more. On the other hand, with substantial resource misallocation (====), strengthened environmental regulation may lift a developing economy out of an inferior equilibrium and bring about a win-win situation for the environment and the economy. Unfortunately, there is an extreme lack of empirical studies, which could provide reliable causal evidence. ==== used the difference-in-differences (DID) method and firm-level data to estimate the effects of China's ¡°Two Control Zones¡± (TCZ) regulation==== took advantage of the spatial discontinuity in regulation stringency, and found that the tighter regulation caused a 27% decrease of total factor productivity for firms upstream of a monitoring station. They also predicted that this cost would add up to 159 billion U.S. dollars from 2016 to 2020. It is unclear how reliably these estimates can be transferred to the context of the Clean Air Action.====Indubitably, it is of great academic importance and policy relevance to provide a sound empirical analysis on the direction and magnitude of the impact of the Clean Air Action on the economy in China. Nevertheless, there are some major empirical challenges.====The first big challenge comes from data. A sophisticated evaluation of the Clean Air Action requires the most recent firm-level data, or macro-level data with good frequency and geographical resolution. Unfortunately, such data are hardly accessible in China. The most widely used micro-level economic dataset, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing Firms, has not been made available after 2013. As for macro-level data, most is aggregated and released on an annual basis by statistical authorities, and only a limited set of ==== indicators are accessible at monthly or quarterly intervals, and at the provincial level.====Second, the characteristics of China's air pollution regulation make it very difficult to confidently identify the real regulatory status at the firm level or high spatial resolution. Environmental regulation in China sometimes relies on a lot of administrative measures, which embrace more arbitrariness and ambiguity. In response to the urgency of its environmental challenges, China had frequently carried out new regulations under the umbrella of the Clean Air Action. Some simultaneous regulations interacted, such as energy-saving and pollution-control policies; requirements of one piece of regulation, such as the emission standard of air pollutants for thermal power plants, had been updated several times within a short period of time; there is also a co-existence of nationwide and local regulations as well as general and special requirements. Therefore, it is challenging for researchers to observe which regulation(s) a plant or a region is subject to exactly, and to isolate the effect of a single policy instrument from the stack of interrelated, overlapping, and frequently updated regulations.====Third, the applicability of conventional program evaluation methods is challenged in this problem. The growth of manufacturing is influenced by time-varying unobservables, which may correlate with the treatment assignment. Such confounding factors may also be individual-specific. They can cause estimation biases, and are hard to address. For example, the DID method, a workhorse empirical design, builds on the ¡°parallel trends¡± assumption. It is more suitable for a situation with random treatment assignment, which is not satisfied in this problem. In addition, the data condition is hardly sufficient to support the best practice of DID. The method of ==== for estimating the counterfactuals with time-varying unobservables requires large time-series and cross-sectional dimensions, which is not satisfied in our problem either.====Given the empirical challenges inherent to the data, methodology, and regulatory characteristics, instead of trying to evaluate the influences of a particular policy instrument ¨C which is less likely to play a fundamental role in the Chinese context ¨C we study the aggregate effect of the Clean Air Action since September 2013 with macro-level data. We adopt the program evaluation method developed by ====, which is particularly suitable for evaluating macro, regional policies (====; ====). Under reasonable assumptions, the counterfactual with time-varying latent factors can be estimated by taking advantaging of the correlations between the treated unit and the control units. Although the APPCAP was nationwide in scope, this regionally-decomposed regulation exhibited great variation in stringency among different regions. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (hereafter, Jing-Jin-Ji for short) region,==== which includes Beijing city, Tianjin city, and Hebei province, has been one of the areas most severely afflicted by air pollution, and therefore implemented the most stringent Clean Air Action, with the highest reduction targets for PM==== among all provinces.==== In contrast, some provinces with good air quality were bound by much lower targets, e.g., keeping the status quo, and were essentially exempted from the Clean Air Action. Therefore, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and the Jing-Jin-Ji region as a whole are taken as treated units, and provinces which were not subject to comparable Clean Air Action but had a high correlations with a treated unit in terms of manufacturing output are selected into the control group. Thus we select the control groups for Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and the entire region individually. Employing the pre-treatment data of the monthly industrial value added from January 2000 to August 2013, we regress the treated unit on its control group, and then use the estimated parameters to extrapolate the post-treatment values of the treated unit, generating the estimates of the counterfactual and the treatment effect.====We find that during the first two years of the Clean Air Action, the regulation significantly reduced the manufacturing output in the Jing-Jin-Ji region by 6.7%. The losses add up to 408.7 billion yuan (2013 price level), equal to 6.5% of its GDP in 2013. The action slowed the growth of manufacturing in Hebei and Tianjin by 9.6% and 5.9%, respectively. The losses accumulate to 280.1 billion and 133.1 billion yuan, equal to 9.8% and 9.2% of their respective GDP in 2013. We find no evidence that the Clean Air Action caused significant reduction of manufacturing output in Beijing. Our placebo tests show that the results are robust. The heterogeneous treatment effects can be explained by the differences in industrial structure between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Heavily polluting sectors, which were the foci of the regulation, comprised a much bigger share of manufacturing industry in Hebei and Tianjin than they did in Beijing. This suggests that the Clean Air Action substantially suppressed ¡°dirty¡± sectors during its first two years, but had a much smaller effect on ¡°clean¡± sectors.====Our paper makes three potential contributions. First, it contributes to disentwining the controversy over the economic effects of environmental regulation, particularly in the context of developing countries. We provide robust causal evidence that China's Clean Air Action substantially slowed the growth of manufacturing. This empirically proves that there were sizable economic costs, at least in the short term, behind environmental regulation in China. Second, we provide a first estimation of the economic impact of the most recent, high-stakes Clean Air Action, which was one of the largest environmental programs in China. On one hand, with pollution reaching an alarming level, China probably most urgently needs well-crafted regulation based on reliable causal evidence. On the other hand, there is an extreme lack of such studies due to empirical challenges with data, methodology, and regulatory characteristics. Our study shows that even with these constraints, it is possible to complete a rigorous estimation to timely reveal the economic cost of the recent regulation and inform policy-makers. Third, we extend the application of the program evaluation method developed by ====, which has only been applied to a limited range of topics, to the environmental field. Our study demonstrates that with its merits for macro-level policy evaluation, the method can meet some empirical challenges of program evaluation, particularly in the context of developing countries, and facilitate good-quality, ==== assessments of environmental regulation experimentations.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: ==== describes the background of the Clean Air Action and the Jing-Jin-Ji region; ==== presents the program evaluation methodology and data; ==== details the selection of the control groups; ====, ==== demonstrate the estimation results and discuss explanations; and ==== concludes.",Has China's war on pollution slowed the growth of its manufacturing and by how much?

The increasing use of part-time faculty has raised concerns among some about declining teaching quality, because part-time instructors are less likely to have a doctoral degree and spend less time with their students (====; ====; ====; ====). Others argue that part-time instructors who specialize in teaching might be better instructors and allow full-time, tenure-track faculty to focus more on research, maximizing their productivity (====; ====).

Because higher education institutions vary greatly, the estimates of teacher effects in the US Air Force Academy may differ greatly from those in Canadian or French universities. Aside from the different contexts of these studies, there are two major challenges when estimating teacher effects in higher education settings. First, while test scores are standard outcomes for estimating teacher value-added at the primary and secondary levels, there is less agreement on the appropriate measure of teacher quality in higher education. Second, the value-added estimation is valid only when the assumption about random assignment of students to classes is met. Extant studies have not fully addressed the ¡°self-selection¡± issue that exists at the higher education level.====Since 1999, China has experienced dramatic expansion in higher education. The proportion of the age cohort enrolling in college has expanded from 4% in the early 1990s to about 40% in 2015 (====). To cope with the huge influx of undergraduate students, universities have increased their class sizes and the workload of regular faculty. Part-time instructors and graduate students are increasingly being employed to teach introductory level courses (====; ====). At the same time, as teacher evaluations become increasingly focused on outcomes related to research and publication, tenure-track faculty are encouraged to devote more time and effort to research instead of teaching. As a result, it is harder to ensure the quality of instruction in the classroom (====; ====; ====; ====).====This study represents a first step toward examining the short- and long-term effects of instructors on student performance in China using a comprehensive, longitudinal data set. The sample draws from administrative data on more than 5000 students who began studying at a four-year university between fall 2006 and fall 2010. We estimated a random effects model to explore the value-added of mandated course instructors on student academic performance. The findings suggest that mandatory course instructors have a significant influence on student achievement in both the contemporaneous course and follow-on courses. We found a short-term teacher value-added of 0.045, suggesting that a one-standard-deviation change in teacher quality resulted in a 0.21-standard-deviation change in student achievement. This magnitude is larger than teacher effects in reading classes found in primary and secondary schools, which ranges in extant studies from 0.08 to 0.12 standard deviation (====; ====; ====; ====). It is also larger than effects in higher education found by Carrell and West (====) and Hoffman and Oeropoulos (====), which were each about 0.05-standard-deviation, and similar to findings of around 0.14 to 0.25 standard deviation (====). Interestingly, our findings show that part-time instructors had the largest positive effects in both the short- and long-term, whereas assistant professors had the smallest effects. In general, students' subjective evaluations of teaching quality were consistent with the estimated teacher value-added from the model.====This study contributes to the literature on teacher quality and evaluation in several ways. First, it is among the first to examine teacher value-added with a focus on the differences between tenure-track and part-time faculty in a research university setting in China. Second, we paid attention to both short- and long-term teacher effects, and investigated whether the effects of those instructors who were more effective in improving student performance in the short-term persisted in the long run. Third, we estimated the effects of associate professors, assistant professors, part-time instructors, and graduate student instructors on student performance separately. In addition, we compared student evaluations of teaching with estimated teacher value-added to find out whether subjective measures of teacher quality were consistent with objective measures of teacher value-added.",Who are better teachers?

Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey==== we find that this reform increases the rate of ," In this paper we look at how China, one of the largest developing countries, expanded health care coverage to a significant proportion of its citizens working in urban areas and the effects that health care expansion had on self-reported health outcomes and the use of preventative care. The results outlined in this paper can provide insights for other large developing countries that are considering expanding health care coverage; the results show how health insurance, while being able to spread financial risks and prevent deprivation of care due to a patient¡¯s inability to pay (====), may lead to an increase in demand for services.====In the early 1990s China had not established a comprehensive health insurance system for all of its citizens. In the urban areas, only employees of government-run facilities and Sate-Owned Enterprises (SOE) were covered. In rural areas, the old cooperative medical scheme had collapsed when the commune was broken up. The poor coverage in urban areas coupled with the downfall of rural coverage meant that the vast majority of the population did not have health care insurance; in fact, in 1998, only 9.5% of the rural population were insured (====). Many people could not afford basic health care and families were suffering from high medical expenses (====). China sought to remedy the failures in the health care market by introducing reform aimed at expanding insurance coverage to all employees: both those working in SOEs and the private sector. In 1999 a new social insurance system for all urban works was established. In 2003, China re-established the cooperative medical system in rural areas and health insurance was expanded to cover the non-employed, children, the disabled, poor, and aged in urban areas. By the end of 2011, the coverage rate had reached 95% of the population. This paper will focus on the first major expansion, the Urban Employees¡¯ Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) Reform, that took place in 1999 and was the impetus for the rest of the health care reforms.====Despite the immense size of the health care expansion little work has been done to look at its effects in urban areas. ==== and ==== examine the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) that involved the expansion of health care in rural areas. Both studies found no change in out-of-pocket spending and that there was some increase in the demand for health services, including preventative care. ==== evaluated the impact of Rural Mutual Health Care (RMHC), a social experiment which was conducted in one of China¡¯s western provinces from 2003 to 2006, and found it had a positive effect on the health status of participants. ==== do look at the effect of insurance provision on ¡®high¡¯ spending on health care for both urban and rural areas using three surveys; two of which only sample rural households though. They find an increased risk of high and catastrophic spending with the introduction of health insurance. However, the closest study to ours is ==== We will examine whether, in urban China, which tends to be richer and more educated than its rural counterparts, the use of preventative care went up, health outcomes improved, and if, as it seems to be in the rural areas, out-of-pocket did not increase.====Research on the provision or expansion of health insurance in other countries can provide insights into what we might expect to find in China. ==== and ==== look at the expansion of Medicare in the US and found that take-up of medical services increased and led to lower child mortality and an improved efficiency of care for children who were eligible. ==== and ==== find that the provision of Medicare leads to more visits to the doctor, positive effects on self-reported health status, and, for some groups, an increase in expensive procedures. ==== found the School Health Insurance Programme in Egypt increased visit rates and reduced the financial burden of use. ==== and ==== examined health care provision in Vietnam and found that health insurance increased service utilization and reduced the risk of catastrophic spending but had not led to lower out-of-pocket expenditures. ==== provide some evidence that health insurance helped improve school enrolment of six-year-old children in rural China. Therefore, we expect to find that the expansion of health insurance in urban China likely led to an increase in utilization of services and had a positive effect on self-reported health status. However the potential effect on out-of-pocket expenses is ambiguous.====To examine the effect of the UEBMI we will use difference-in-difference (DD) approach. Using longitudinal data, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS)====While we show that the expansion of health insurance in urban China led to a decrease in self-reported sickness and an increase in the use of preventative health care utilisation, we do not examine the costs required to achieve those benefits. Work in other countries have shown that health insurance actually increases medical expenditure. ==== studies the RAND Health Insurance Experiment in 1974 and reports the role of insurance increases medical expenditure. ==== investigates the effects of the introduction of Medicare in 1965; they found that the introduction of Medicare may explain at least 40 percent of the increase in real per capita health spending. Therefore whether health insurance provision should be expanded further in China or in other large developing countries depends on how policy makers view the benefits we are able to identify against the costs that may increase.====The paper is organised as follows: in the next section, a background of health insurance reform in China is provided. ==== describes data and identification strategies. ==== presents the main results and ==== concludes.",The effect of health insurance reform: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301135,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,511

The exam ability explains more wage variation than years of schooling or the level of education degree. There is still a significant amount of unexplained wage variation. It is possible that there are more important labor market skills that are not captured by schooling and exam scores.,"China's education system widely uses exams to test and evaluate students' ability. Because these exams determine a student's future education opportunities, employment opportunities and social evaluation, both the government, parents and students invest heavily in activities that raise exam scores in the hope that these investments will pay off once the student enters the labor market. However, there are many unanswered questions. How does the labor market reward the ability measured by exams? Do the labor market returns to this ability justify the investment? Are there skills that are more important for generating labor earnings, but the present design and implementation of exams cannot measure and thus provide feedback to educators, students, parents, and the government? There are few previous studies on these questions in the literature. This paper strives to provide the first answers to these questions for China's ====.====This paper uses proxies to estimate the labor market returns to exam ability (i.e. the ability that raises exam scores) in China. The purpose of this paper is to answer the following three questions. First, what are the returns to the exam ability? Second, how much of the residual wage variance can this ability explain? Third, how do the returns to this ability change over time and what are the implications for the labor market?====This paper uses data from three waves of Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) surveys in 2002, 2007, and 2013. The proxies of exam ability are high school performance, high school quality, and the indicator that an individual's National College Entrance Exam (NCEE, or ====) score is missing in the data. The first two proxies correlate with exam ability through their correlation with some exam scores. The third proxy is presumably directly correlated with the exam ability. Both the school selection system and the school performance evaluation system in China are heavily based on exam scores. Thus, school performance and school quality can proxy the exam score and thus exam ability. The indicator of missing ==== score carries information on a person's ability. Presumably, people with higher ability are more likely to write the exam, more able to remember the score or more willing to share the score with surveyors than people with lower ability. Thus the likelihood that the score data is missing is lower for people with higher ability. Presumably, this ability can raise exam scores. The reason for using this indicator of missing score data instead of the score itself is that, first, the high percentage of missing data reduces sample size and puts an unnecessary restriction on sample selection, and second, using the score itself faces an attenuation problem (i.e. the coefficient of the score is biased towards zero like in the case of attenuation bias by measurement error because other random factors than ability can affect the score and be part of the score variation) and a scale problem (the scale of the exam score is unknown and not necessarily the same as the scale of ability, thus the variability of the exam score is in general uninformative of the variability of the latent ability). The pattern of correlation between this indicator and the other proxies and earnings in data is consistent with the assumption that there is a single common unobserved factor in all these outcome variables.====This paper uses a three-equation system to identify the contribution of one ==== of the exam ability to the growth of earnings. Our method can disentangle the parameter associated with the unobserved ability from the scale parameters that map the ability to the proxies. We estimate the system by the generalized method of moments (GMM).====The estimated labor market returns to one standard deviation increase in the exam ability are 8% in 2002, 12% in 2007, and 7% in 2013 in the population of urban workers with local ==== and high school and above education. In other words, e.g., a one standard deviation increase in the exam ability leads to an 8% growth in earnings in 2002, 12% growth in earnings in 2007, and 7% growth in earnings in 2013.====The estimated returns imply that the testable ability can explain 1.25% of wage variation in 2002, 2.70% in 2007, and 0.72% in 2013. The fraction of wage variation explained alone by years of schooling is 0.12% in 2002, 0.12% in 2007, and 0.84% in 2013; the fraction of wage variation explained alone by dummies of education degree attainment is 0.68% in 2002, 2.10% in 2007, and 0.18% in 2013. In comparison, the exam ability is a significant source of wage variation.====Nevertheless, there is still a significant amount of unexplained wage variation. It is possible that a significant fraction of the unexplained variation is attributable to skills that are not captured by schooling and exam scores but are more important in generating earnings (better rewarded by the market). Future research should strive to study and understand the skills that presently used exams cannot measure.====Furthermore, the shape of the time path of these estimates indicates changes in market supply and demand of this ability in this period that can have a technological explanation. We point out that these patterns could signal technological change analogous to the changes in the U.S. in the same period and it would be a fruitful enterprise to do more in-depth research on this in the future.====This paper makes the following contributions to the literature. First, this paper estimates the labor market returns to one standard deviation increase in the ability measured by standardized tests. Previous studies using standardized test scores to measure ability only estimates the coefficient of the test score, which is not on the same scale as the latent ability in general. For example, ==== use CHIP 2007 sample to estimate labor market returns to a one-point increase in ==== score. Because the function that maps ability to test score is unknown, it is impossible to infer if the labor market returns are large or small relative to the variance of ability. This paper can answer this question because our estimate of the labor market returns is normalized to the standard deviation of the unobserved ability.====Second, this paper shows that the ability measured by the existing exams cannot explain most of the residual wage variance. The implication is that skills not measured by the existing exams could be more important in generating earnings. Consequently, we should probably think about what the existing exams measure and not measure, rethink the socioeconomic values that the government and the public associate with these exams, and think about how we can improve the design and implementation of exams to measure more types of ability and measure each type of ability better.====Third, previous studies are constrained by the availability of the test score data and can mostly only study a single cross-section. This paper overcomes this constraint by using test score proxies instead of the scores themselves. The advantage is that there are different proxies available in multiple periods so that we can show the change in the labor market returns to the measured ability and shed light on the technological and institutional changes in the labor market.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. ==== introduces the methodology. ==== describes the data. ==== presents the results. ==== discusses the results. ==== concludes.",Estimating the earnings returns to exam-measured unobserved ability in China's urban labor market: Evidence for 2002¨C2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301123,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,512

The growth in e-commerce in China has been largely driven by ====, a website similar to ==== in the US. ====.==== They are essentially a new generation of low-cost manufacturing or factor endowment clusters that are common in a wide range of countries and sectors (====; ====) and the shoe industry in Sinos Valley, Brazil (====), the clusters appear and produce their goods in less-developed and low-cost countries or areas and then sell goods to more developed ones. In the case of Taobao villages here, clusters appear in the less developed rural areas of China and their markets are mainly the more prosperous urban areas of China. Unlike the old generation of clusters, businesses in Taobao villages rely on the internet and e-commerce platforms to market and sell their products.====Firms in clusters enjoy the economies of agglomeration (====). Marshall noted that the agglomeration of firms engaged in similar or related activities generated a range of localized external economies that lowered costs for clustered producers. Such advantages include a pool of specialized workers, easy access to suppliers of specialized inputs and services and the quick dissemination of new knowledge. As pointed out by ====Taobao villages also bring huge economic and social benefits to the local residents. First, the rural e-commerce helps narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas (====). In recent years, income for people in underdeveloped rural areas in China has become more and more difficult to increase. The main reason is farming is the main source of income for people in these areas and growth in agricultural productivity has become very slow. On the other hand, urban areas have enjoyed relatively fast growth for the past 30?years. Participating in e-commerce or related businesses provides a potential source of alternative income for people in rural areas. On average, holding other factors constant, engaging in e-commerce raises a rural household's annual income by 20.5 thousand RMB (====). Studies of clusters in other industries and countries have also shown that clusters benefit local residents by helping them earning more (====; ====; ====; ====).====Second, clusters like Taobao villages attract a lot of businesses and create a lot of job opportunities (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). This economic inequality has triggered massive migration from rural to urban areas and from western to eastern provinces since the late 1980s as people look for more job opportunities and better pay (====; ====), mental health (====) and academic performance (====; ====) of left- behind children. Also, some senior citizens have difficulty getting needed help as their adult children worked in cities that are far away from their villages (====; ====). This creates all sorts of social problems. Taobao villages provide local residents more job opportunities with decent income. More importantly, people from these areas do not have to leave their hometown for work so that they can take better care of their kids and old parents.====There are thousands of villages in rural areas of China, yet only several hundred have become Taobao villages. Given the enormous benefits brought by Taobao villages, it is of interest to researchers and policymakers to understand what factors contributed to the formation of existing Taobao villages. The latest statistics show that China's internet penetration rate was 49.3% in 2014, compared to 87.4% in the US, indicating a large room for future growth (====). In particular, the internet penetration rate in rural areas was only 28.8% in 2014 (====). Therefore, there are many opportunities for new Taobao villages to appear. Identifying the main factors that contributed to the formation of existing Taobao villages can help policymakers design corresponding policies to maximize the chance that new Taobao villages form and develop.====?====; ====; ====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

While methods based on endogenous proxies for fiscal federalism used by the existing literature are unstable and unreliable, our preferred approach using difference-in-difference estimation tells a consistent and compelling story: TSS reform increased economic growth, with highly significant estimates that are robust to alternative controls and inferential assumptions. In particular, we find that TSS reform resulted in per capita growth rates that were approximately 18% higher compared to the average per capita growth rates in the pre-reform (FRS) period (2.2 percentage points higher relative to a baseline per capita annual growth rate of 11.9 percentage points prior to fiscal reform).====Early theories of public finance (now commonly called ¡°first generation theories of fiscal federalism¡±) had emphasized potential welfare gains from the decentralized financing of local public goods and services in contrast to the centralized provision of a single, uniform public output in all jurisdictions.==== Such gains are viewed to flow from the relaxing of informational problems faced by central authorities who have only imperfect information with regard to local tastes and conditions. These gains, however, need to be contrasted with the efficiency cost of failure to internalize interjurisdictional externalities.====Under the FRS, the second generation theorists of fiscal federalism see the Chinese central government as delegating economic policy-making and significant fiscal authority with hard budget constraints to the SNGs.==== Given their new policy authority and facing fiscal incentives to promote reform, a number of SNGs adopted pro-market policies and raised their own tax revenue. Contracts negotiated with the central government allowed SNGs to share 50% of all revenue raised up to a pre-specified revenue level and to retain all revenue that exceeded this level. As ==== show, the average province faced a marginal tax retention rate of 89% while 68% of all provinces faced a marginal retention rate of 100%. Facing strong fiscal incentives to promote reform, many SNGs experienced high rates of economic growth. With the reforms proving successful, the central government devolved additional incentives and political power to the SNGs, which then acted as a counterbalance to the political power of the central government.====However, the FRS also resulted in significant fiscal decline for the central government, with the share of total tax revenue transferred to the central government falling from 39% in 1985 to 22% in 1993. Overall revenue collections declined from 31% of GDP in 1978 to 11.2% in 1994.==== The FRS thus led to an ``overshooting in decentralization¡± and a rethinking of the fiscal system.====The crucial question that emerged with the TSS reform package that replaced the FRS in 1994 was whether this meant a recentralization to the extent of a reversal to the old system or rather a move to further the process of rationalization of market institutions. Reversal would threaten the crucial political component that supported the success of economic reforms, whereas rationalization would constitute a shift towards a formal fiscal federalism that promised to resolve the coordination problems associated with an overly weak central government without endangering the benefits that accrue from decentralization.====The debate on whether the TSS reversed the decentralization course started by the FRS is still ongoing. The literature has taken two paths to answer this question. The first focuses on the elements of the new fiscal regime introduced by the TSS and compares these with either those of the FRS or of an ideal decentralized regime. The second tries to determine empirically whether the two regimes led to differences in economic outcomes. Thus, within the former literature, ====, for instance, views the 1994 reform as stemming budgetary decline, but leaving the actual pattern of revenue distribution and spending responsibilities between the central government and the SNGs fundamentally unchanged. ==== perceives TSS as continuing the market-preserving federalism initiated by the FRS. However, ==== associates the TSS with significant recentralization and emphasizes the fiscal problems (e.g. unclear expenditure assignments, unfunded mandates) that continue to plague fiscal relations between the center and the provinces.====The empirical literature that follows the second path includes ==== who, using a province-level panel data set for the 1978¨C1992 period, find that fiscal decentralization is inversely associated with provincial economic growth. ====, on the other hand, examine a similar province level panel data set for the longer 1970¨C1993 period and find evidence that fiscal decentralization is associated positively with economic growth. ==== use a panel data set of Chinese provinces covering the FRS and TSS periods of 1979¨C1993 and 1994¨C1999. They provide evidence that provincial economic growth is negatively associated with expenditure decentralization and positively associated with revenue decentralization in the 1979¨C1993 FRS phase. Further, they find that in the 1994¨C1999 TSS phase, there is no statistically significant relationship between provincial economic growth and expenditure decentralization, while there is a highly significantly association between provincial economic growth and revenue decentralization. Finally, ==== focuses on the TSS period of 1994¨C2002 and finds a positive association between province level economic growth and various measures of fiscal decentralization.====Existing empirical studies of the growth consequences of TSS reform have two primary challenges, measuring fiscal decentralization and causal identification. First, the appropriate measurement of fiscal decentralization is a difficult task given the complexity of intergovernmental relations.==== that such proxies have very limited use as they do not take into account the vertical structure of decision-making and thereby misrepresent the degree of fiscal decentralization.====As a result, empirical studies of both cross-country comparisons and descriptions of long-term trends may be seriously distorted. For instance, it is not clear whether an observed increase in the SNG share of total public expenditure (or revenue) implies fiscal decentralization in the sense of devolution of decision-making powers to the SNG. A fundamental question that arises here is the extent to which SNGs can keep local tax revenue instead of transferring it to the central government and the autonomy they may have in making spending decisions.====In what follows, we move beyond the existing literature in this respect by first showing that the two most commonly used measures of fiscal federalism, namely the SNGs' share of total public revenue and expenditure, move in opposite directions with the introduction of the TSS. This highlights the problem with using endogenous variables to proxy for the object of interest, fiscal federalism. Instead, to analyze the effects of the TSS, we exploit the quasi-natural experiment afforded by its staggered introduction, which resulted in certain regions in China starting the reform earlier than other regions. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, we identify the impact of TSS reform on economic outcomes. This approach also allows us to deal with the second question raised by the existing empirical literature, namely that of causality.====As the extant literature leaves unanswered potential omitted variable bias in its empirical strategy, it is commonly recognized that the results obtained so far can only be used to establish associations between the economic outcomes investigated and measures of fiscal policy employed, but not a causal relationship between the two. The difference-in-difference approach adopted here provides a more satisfactory method in establishing causality.====The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we provide a brief description of the institutional and policy background for the TSS. ==== presents our empirical analysis with the main results. ==== concludes the paper.","Fiscal decentralization, fiscal reform, and economic growth in china",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301056,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,514

The law stipulated that the maximum cumulative duration of successive fixed-term (temporary) labor contracts is 10 years, and employees working for the same employer for more than 10 consecutive years are able to secure an open-ended (permanent) labor contract under the new law, which is highly desirable to employees. However, in order to circumvent the new Labor Contract Law, some employers may have dismissed workers, after the passage of the new law, who had worked in the same firm for more than 10 years.

Additionally, using a ==== based on this exogenous change in unemployment status for this particular group of workers, we show that the dismissed workers suffered significant welfare loss in terms of happiness. Our results are robust to various specifications and placebo tests.","The labor market in China has gone through drastic changes since the economic reform initiated in 1978. One of the most notable changes is the evolution of the ====. Prior to the reform, the workers in China enjoyed life-time job security. In 1986, the socialist China introduced labor contracts for the first time, one of whose main objectives was to break the ¡°iron rice bowl¡± system where a person was employed in a single firm for his/her entire lifetime. After the state-owned enterprise retrenchment in the late 1990s, the ¡°iron rice bowl¡± system was broken for most workers in China. The job security in China had changed considerably from high to low, and most firms had not signed written labor contracts with their employees for a long period of time. As a result, a large number of workers were vulnerable to mistreatment by the firms.====In order to improve the labor contract coverage and to strengthen labor protection, the Chinese government passed a new Labor Contract Law on June 29, 2007, which went into effect on January 1, 2008. This new Labor Contract Law has been found to strengthen the labor protection in many aspects.

Although the increase in labor costs induced by the new law may have had a negative impact on employment, ==== provide a theoretical framework to demonstrate that the new law will have only small impacts on employment given the fast-growing Chinese economy. ==== empirically show that the new Labor Contract Law has not led to an overall increase in aggregate unemployment.====However, more rigid employment protection provided by the new law may result in unemployment. The new Labor Contract Law stipulated that the maximum cumulative duration of successive fixed-term contracts is 10 years. If a formal-contract employee has been working for the same employer for more than 10 consecutive years, a permanent (open-ended) labor contract shall be awarded to the employee unless the employee requests a temporary (fixed-term) labor contract instead. Employees with open-ended contracts must be terminated for cause. Given that many employers in China use the fixed-term contract system as a way to terminate employment without cause, this restriction of labor contract types is significant (====). In order to circumvent the new Labor Contract Law, employers may have tended to dismiss workers with formal fixed-term (temporary) labor contracts, once the new law was approved, who have worked in the firms for more than 10 years.====In this paper, using the 2008 wave of the China General Social Survey, we first empirically investigate whether formal-contract workers with more than 10 years of tenure at the same firm are more likely to be dismissed as a result of the new Labor Contract Law. We find strong evidence of a significant increase in dismissal rates for workers with formal labor contracts and a tenure of more than 10 consecutive years with the same firm in 2008.====Second, we examine the welfare consequences of the job dismissal, which is one of the first to attempt to identify the causal effect of unemployment on happiness. Using a ====, we exploit the exogenous change in unemployment status for formal-contract employees with more than 10 years of employment in the same firm to investigate how this dismissal affects the well-being of the workers. Our finding suggests that the dismissed workers suffered significant welfare loss in term of happiness. This is the second contribution of this study which we can establish the causal link between unemployment and happiness.====Quantifying the costs of unemployment on individuals and society has been an area of increasing interest by social scientists. Being unemployed is not just about the loss of income, yet it brings significant non-pecuniary impacts such as depression, anxiety, decreased self-esteem, uncertainty about the future, social isolation, stigmatization, health problems and mental disorder. A large number of studies have examined the relationship between unemployment and happiness. Using the British Household Panel data, ==== find a strong negative correlation between unemployment and happiness. ====In an attempt to identify the causal effect of unemployment on unhappiness, ==== examine six years of German Socio-Economic Panel Data. Their research focuses on individuals who switch employment status in this six-year time period. After controlling for various observed individual characteristics and individual specific fixed effects, they find that the job loss itself has larger happiness effects than the result of the actual income loss on happiness; household income would need to be increased by seven in order to compensate for lost satisfaction resulting from unemployment. Using the same dataset for the period 1991¨C2006, ==== identify the causal effect of unemployment by examining the exogenous entry into unemployment due to company closures. They also find enormous negative non-pecuniary psychological costs to unemployed women.

Could more effective ","; ====). Since 2003, a new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS) has been established in rural China. One concern with the program is that its budget is too small to make a significant dent in households' out-of-pocket spending. Medical expenditure burdens incurred by patients with severe medical conditions remain heavy (==== This situation therefore presents a quasi-experimental for studying the effect of a rising medical security level on the rural consumption. In this study, we use this policy change to test whether or not medical security to stimulate rural resident's consumption and improve their welfare. We mainly use a difference-in-difference(DID) strategy that compares outcomes in the treated group after 2013 to outcomes in the treated group before 2013 and to outcomes in the control group, the province, which have full implemented CII in 2013 as the treated group, the remaining provinces as the control group. Furthermore, Because CII coverage only including the NCMS and URMI, hence urban employees who attend Urban Employee Medical Insurance (UEMI) or public servant who insured socialized medicine(SM) do not be affected by CII. So the CII reform provides us with an opportunity for adoption Triple-Differences Estimator (DDD) to further test our conclusions.====In this study, we find the CII significantly promote the daily consumption of rural residents, and per capita daily consumption has increased by about 15%, accordingly, the average per capita expenditure of households has increased by 12%.==== We do not find the evidence that household healthcare consumption has been affected by the CII. As for personal medical expenditure, we adopt the DDD estimator results, i.e. personal medical expenditure is not affected by the CII.====Although our empirical studies have found that the CII has a significant role in promoting rural residents' consumption, this effect is heterogeneous across family characteristics. Compared to healthy families, CII mainly promotes the household consumption of unhealthy families. The middle aged families has a more significant consumption growth, while the elderly as relatively weak groups have not benefited significantly from the CII. Families with different living standards have different responses to CII:The CII has further promoted the consumption of high consumption families, however, it has little effect on low consumption families in rural areas. The above findings lend support to the claim that the CII overall aggravate the consumption ==== of the rural residents.====), Sommers, Musco, Finegold, et al. (====), Barbaresco, Courtemanche, and Qi (====), Terriquez and Joseph (====); Finkelstein (====); Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (====); Wagstaff, Lindelow, Jun, et al. (====); Kondo and Shigeoka (====)). Still, some other kinds of literatures research how expansions in health insurance coverage to change behaviors of individuals and other outcomes, for example, Hahn and Yang (====) identify the effect of the expansion of parental coverage on young adults' labor market choices, his results is identical with Akosa, Moriya, and Simon (====), i.e., no evidence shows that the mandate affected the probability of employment of young adults. Finkelstein et al. (====) study whether expansions of public insurance crowd out private insurance.====As an important branch of academic research on the impact of health insurance reform, the influence of health insurance on consumption has also received more attention. Theoretically, the impact of social security system on consumption can be mainly attributed to the fact that the social security system can reduce the uncertainty in the future, thus reducing the precautionary saving for residents (====). Many empirical studies examine the importance of precautionary savings and deliver mixed evidence (====; ====; ====; ====). Most of these studies relate savings or consumption to some income measures or health risks that households encounter. Recent studies take advantage of the variations in insurance coverage by reform, use quasi-experimental to study the relationship between medical insurance and consumption. Such research includes Kantor and Fishback (====), Engen and Gruber (====), Gruber and Yelowitz (====) for the US; Atella, Rosati, and Rossi (====) for Italy and so on. Most of these studies reveal the economically significant effects of health insurance programs on consumption or savings.====Related research in developing countries is still in its early stages. For instance, Wagstaff and Pradhan (====) study a case in Vietnam and find that health insurance program has a positive effect on household consumption. Chou, Liu, and Hammitt (====) examine the effect of health insurance specifically on food consumption among rural households, however, food consumption can be much less elastic than other kinds of consumptions. Brown, Brauw, and Du (====) find that the NCMS reduces food consumption but does not significantly affect non-healthcare and total consumption. Zang, Liu, Xu, and Xiong (====) investigate the effect of introducing the public health insurance program on the consumption of urban households (URMI); their results show that participating families would increase their annual non-medical consumption by about 13%. Nevertheless, rural residents respond differently to income uncertainty compared with urban residents. These studies, based on the establishment of NCMS or URMI, apply the Difference-in-Difference method to eliminate selection bias. But different from the finds in developed countries, these study seemed to have not found a strong positive connection between availability of health insurance and final consumption in China, except Bai and Wu (====), their results show that on average, the health insurance coverage increases nonmedical-related consumption by >5% in rural residents; but they also found the effect is not significant in villages where no any households have actually obtained reimbursement from the insurance program.====All of these Chinese empirical studies, which mainly seized the opportunity of the establishment of the NCMS in rural China to assess the impact of medical insurance on rural consumption. It is worthwhile pointing out that the NCMS was initially established at that time, the level of protection and compensation are very low. Wagstaff et al. (====) point out that the scheme has not reduced out-of-pocket spending or the risk of catastrophic health expenditures. Failed to reduce the medical burden of farmers, so rural residents could not actually get a really effective benefit from the NCMS, furthermore, the NCMS was established only a few years, farmer's cognition on NCMS is not adequate. Owning to aforementioned reasons, previous literatures, which studied the relationship between health insurance and rural consumption in china, differed from that of developed countries, have shown very vague conclusions.====We make three main contributions to previous studies. First, we are the first to use the CII to examine the relationship between medical insurance and rural residents' consumption in China. Different from previous studies, we find adequate evidence that the critical illness insurance has a significant impact on rural consumption. Second, our empirical study does not find evidence that the critical illness insurance has a significant effect on peasant medical expenditure. Namely, in the first year of the CII implementation area, peasants' medical expenditure, including the individual payment and reimbursement, did not increase significantly. This indirectly illustrates the fact that the poor, once fall ill, can be treated in time without delay because of the establishment of the NCMS. From this point of view, we can evaluate the effect of the NCMS: since the NCMS was put into effect in 2003, it has better solved the problem of health inequalities in urban and rural areas. The last, previous studies have also ignored the impact of health insurance on household consumption inequality. Our research finds that the role of the CII in promoting rural consumption is heterogeneous, and it does not have much incentive effect on the consumption of the poor. That is, medical insurance implemented in the rural areas of China, which has reduced the health inequalities in the urban and rural areas, but has enlarged the consumption and welfare inequality within the countryside.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ==== provides the historical background on rural medical insurance in China. ==== conducts robustness checks. ==== concludes.",Does health insurance promote people's consumption?

Despite ==== suggesting that the movements of exchange rates are largely unpredictable, since the pioneering work of ====).====Along with this transitional stage, the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets and the effect of RMB market reforms on this linkage have attracted broad attention from investors, policymakers, and scholars. However, there is a lack of solid studies on the linkage between the two RMB markets and on the effect of these ongoing market reforms. To fill this gap, this paper quantitatively investigates the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets, and studies the policy effect of the most important reforms in the two RMB markets since the establishment of the offshore CNH market, including the reform of the central parity formation mechanism, the launch of the cross-border interbank payment system, the release of the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS) RMB index, and the introduction of the countercyclical factor.==== Following this reform, China¡¯s central bank, that is PBoC, launched the cross-border interbank payment system and released the CFETS RMB index, to intensify the marketization of the onshore pricing mechanism and to eliminate the barriers between the RMB onshore and offshore markets. In May 2017, the PBoC further introduced the countercyclical factor as a determinant of the CNY central parity rate, aiming to stabilize market expectations and avoid one-way depreciation or appreciation. However, these RMB market reforms have led to substantial turmoil in the RMB markets, characterized by large fluctuations in the CNH and CNY exchange rates and by visible deviations between them, which have been rarely captured by the existing literature. Motivated by these newly emerged shocks and patterns, in this paper, we focus on the fluctuations of the CNH-CNY pricing differential, and its responses to a series of RMB market reforms in China.====Following ====, ====, and ====, our study employs the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to characterize the pricing differential between the RMB offshore and onshore exchange rates, that is the CNH-CNY pricing differential. In addition, we account for the asymmetric impact of news by using the threshold GARCH model. We document the volatility clustering phenomenon and the leverage effect for the CNH-CNY pricing differential. The former indicates that a large volatility of the pricing differential tends to be followed by another large volatility, and a small volatility tends to be followed by another small volatility; while the latter refers to the fact that when there is an unexpected widening in the pricing gap, the volatility of the CNH-CNY pricing differential is inclined to become larger, and vice versa.====We also examine the effect of recent RMB market reforms on the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets. Exploiting an ==== (ARMA)-Intervention model, we find that the reform of the central parity formation mechanism enlarges the pricing differential in the long run; yet, the introduction of the countercyclical factor narrows the pricing differential in the long run. In addition, by using the extended GARCH and threshold GARCH models, we show that recent RMB market reforms have led to greater volatility for the CNH-CNY pricing differential. One possible explanation is that, although these reforms might enhance the integration between the RMB onshore and offshore markets, they can cause stronger fluctuations in either the onshore or the offshore market, which eventually leads to greater volatility in the pricing gap.====Our paper is related to the literature that studies the linkage between the RMB onshore and offshore markets. For example, ==== explore the role of fundamentals, global factors and government policies in driving the CNH-CNY pricing differential before September 2013. However, recent RMB market reforms change the behavior of the onshore and offshore exchange rates, and therefore alter the dynamics of the CNH-CNY pricing differential. This paper contributes to this strand of literature from the following different perspectives: (i) testing the effect of recent RMB market reforms on the linkage between the onshore and offshore markets, when the onshore market is in a transition towards a more flexible regime; (ii) taking into account the asymmetric effect of news or surprises when there is an unexpected enlargement or reduction in the pricing gap. In addition, different from ==== which attribute the volatility of CNH-CNY pricing differential to the CNH market only, we argue that volatility could come from both the CNH and CNY markets especially after the reform of central parity formation mechanism in 2015.====Our paper is also related to another strand of literature that employs the GARCH-type models to study the trend, the volatility, and the determinants of foreign exchange rates. For example, ==== find the volatility in the daily spot rate is well represented by the GARCH(1,1) model with near unit roots. ==== find no evidence that the GARCH(1,1) model is outperformed by more sophisticated models in the analysis of exchange rate. ==== employ the threshold GARCH model to analyze the exchange rate volatility in Czech, Slovak, Polish and Hungarian during the period in which they move from a fixed regime towards a more flexible one. ==== and ====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== presents stylized facts on the RMB onshore and offshore markets. ==== characterizes the fluctuation patterns of the CNH-CNY pricing differential using various GARCH-type models.

(====) Provincial heterogeneity is explicitly taken into account. Housing markets are expected to be heterogenous, since economic imbalance across China is widespread. As demonstrated in ====, the provincial growth rates of housing prices in eastern China are generally faster than those in the other regions. Although a few papers, such as ====, ==== and ====, have noted the heterogeneity issue, they control the heterogeneity across regions by dividing China's provinces into several regions or several tiers, implicitly assuming homogeneity within each region/tier. In contrast, we directly model heterogeneity at the province level. (====) Nonstationarity of variables is properly tackled. It has been well understood that nonstationarity may create spurious statistical results (====, where all the nonstationary variables are transformed to be stationary but no cointegration analysis is performed.====In addition to these two advances, there is another important improvement: (====) The influences of cross-sectional dependence are controlled. It is well known that ignoring or inappropriately dealing with cross-sectional dependence may lead to inconsistent estimators and invalid inferences (====; ====; ====). This is particularly relevant in studying China's real estate market, since house prices, land prices, and construction are all heavily regulated (====)==== In other words, housing prices in different provinces may be synchronized since they may be subject to the same policies and regulations from the central government. We will explicitly take into account such spatial dependence from the perspectives of unobserved common factors (====; ====). In addition to global shocks (strong cross-sectional dependence), spatial interaction (weak cross-sectional dependence) is an important source of cross-sectional dependence. Our model allows for spatial interaction in detecting the existence of a housing price bubble.====Our study closely follows ==== based on U.S. data. Further, the real interest rate and the size of urban population play generally no significant role in explaining housing prices.

While improved productivity growth will enable domestic production to rise, imports are still likely to play an important role in reducing the ¡°quality¡± gap in future Chinese food demand.","The rapid economic growth in China has lifted the level of its real income per capita over the past four decades (====). This, combined with a steady expansion of its total population, has not only increased total food demand but also changed the structure of food consumption. In 2015, apparent consumption of major agricultural commodities including cereals (mainly rice, wheat and maize), meat, dairy products, vegetables and fruits in China were 455.2 million tons, 91.8 million tons, 51.1 million tons and 553.0 million tons respectively, which were 3.2 times, 8.3 times, 17.1 times and 10.5 times of those in 1978. In particular, per capita consumption of dairy products and vegetables and fruits both increased by more than ten times, which were much higher than that of meat (8.3 times) and cereals (3.2 times). Moreover, since total population and real income per capita in China are still increasing, it is expected that China's food demand will sustainably drive up world market prices in particular for specific commodities such as major cereal products and red meat (====).====). This rise in agricultural output occurred with only modest rises in arable land and labour usage (5% and 1.7% increase in arable land and efficient labour usage over the same period, respectively). Productivity growth, partly due to large scale of migration resulting from institutional reforms which lowered labour/land ratios, technological progress and infrastructure investment, has played an important role in contributing to the output increase. Over this period, the annual growth rate of agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and labour productivity in China were 2.8% and 4.3% respectively, which are much higher than the world average of 1.0% per annum for both total factor productivity and labour productivity in agriculture (====).====), the IFPRI International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodity and Trade (IMPACT) model (====, ====), Overseas Economic Cooperation Funds of Japan (OECF) model and the FAO World Food model (====) and the OECD-FAO AGLINK-COSIMO model (====); while the general equilibrium models include the global trade and agricultural project (GTAP), G-Cubed and global trade and environmental model (GTEM) models.====Results from previous studies, though differing in magnitude, generally demonstrated that China's consumption of cereals and grains will continue to rise in the long run. Furthermore, with resource constraints with respect to both land and labour, this increased food demand was expected to be met increasingly by imports of a large amount of wheat and rice if there is no further breakthrough in production technology (====). However, this finding is yet to be proved accurate as the past decade witnessed a rough balance between the supply and demand for cereals and grains in China. Surprisingly, China even started to export paddy rice to the international market since 2014. A possible explanation of the poor performance of most existing models in projecting China's food demand is that they did not properly account for the change in ¡®quality¡¯ of aggregate food consumption due to the changing demographic structure and income growth, and substantial structural changes in food consumption due to changing preference and income (====; ==== and ====).====This paper developed a multi-country and multi-commodity partial equilibrium model (====, ====) to examine Chinese food production, consumption and trade in 2050. Contributing to the literature, it endogenises the shift of aggregate-level consumption preference by considering the interaction of different consumption trends of households with different appetites (namely, urban high income, urban low income and rural groups). Although our projection also inform that significant structural changes in future China food consumption will take place as in ==== and ====, it attributes these aggregate demand changes to dramatic adjustments in population and economic structure due to economic transformation rather than gradually changed income and price elasticities. As such, it provides information regarding the distributional impact of macroeconomic shocks (i.e. changes in demographic structure and per capita income) between different income groups and across regions on aggregate food consumption between commodities.

The programme was introduced in urban areas in the 1990s and was considered to be very useful in reducing urban poverty. The Chinese government extended the Dibao programme to rural areas in the early 2000s in the hope of alleviating the poverty and improving the livelihoods of the poor in the countryside. Given that poverty in China concentrates in the rural areas, the extension of Dibao to rural areas could have a significant impact on poverty reduction and equality improvement. In 2013, rural Dibao provides cash benefits to 29.31 million households covering 53.88 million individual beneficiaries according to ====.====Rural and urban areas have separate Dibao programmes run by their respective local authorities; different regions have a distinct Dibao line, qualifying criteria and ways of distribution. It is imperative to know the impact and effectiveness of this programme. However, there is almost no evaluation of the programme in the existing literature. ==== provide good descriptive analysis of the programme and some preliminary evaluation using the data from 2007 to 2009 when the programme was in its early stage.====Given the scale and the popularity of the rural Dibao, rigorously evaluation can demonstrate the extent to which the programme meets its intended objective of reducing poverty, thus being able to reduce wasteful spending, increase target accuracy and improve policy effectiveness.====This paper examines the effectiveness of the Dibao programme in China, using the 2013 Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP2013). It finds low targeting accuracy, and large inclusion and exclusion errors, along with a negative social rate of return. Although this paper is China-focused, the findings would be of interest to development economists working in the area of social protection in other developing countries.====This paper proposes several methods for assessing the effectiveness of the government programme and applies these methods on China's Dibao. It provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the rural Dibao programme. It is part of a bigger study that the authors will undertake to enhance understanding of poverty and ==== reduction in theory and improve the targeting and targeting efficiency of the social programme in practice.====Targeting is a means to improve programme efficiency so that programme objectives of maximizing poverty reduction can be achieved with minimum cost. There are two distinct issues in designing targeted programmes; the first is identifying the deserving beneficiaries who are the neediest, and the second is deciding the amount of transfers they receive so that their minimum basic needs are met. Accordingly, targeting efficiency is judged by two kinds of targeting methods that we derive from (i) beneficiary incidence and (ii) benefit incidence. We evaluated the rural Dibao using both beneficiary and benefit incidence analyses.====Cost is necessary for any social programme. Programmes ought to be judged based on how much they contribute to a reduction in poverty in their respective operational costs. In the literature, many poverty measures have been developed having different welfare implications. Among them, the class of poverty measures proposed by ====We have organized the paper as follows: ==== provides a critical review of several targeting indicators. It also presents some new evaluation indicators. ==== provides a brief discussion of China's Dibao programme. ==== discusses the evaluation methodology explaining household welfare measures and poverty line used. Section5 presents our initial evaluation results analyzing the possible causes and consequences. ==== discusses the impact of Dibao on poverty reduction. ==== provides a new methodology for evaluating Dibao using the idea of the social rate of return (SRR). Finally, ==== concludes and discusses policy implications and recommendations.====Because part of Dibao funding is from local governments and because the Dibao line is determined by local governments, an affluent region would have a higher Dibao line and a poor region tends to have lower Dibao lines.====Judging from the ratio of the Dibao standard and household per capita income, most Dibao allowances in the surveyed provinces are less than one quarter of the per capita income of rural households.====Gansu, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces have a high rate of Dibao coverage, while Henan and Guangdong provinces have a lower rate of coverage. For Henan Province, the Dibao line is very low (1772 yuan/person/year), which is far lower than the per capita income of both Dibao households and whole population. Therefore, the lower rate of Dibao coverage in Henan Province is mainly due to a lower Dibao line as a result of shortage of funds. Guangdong's Dibao standard is high compared with other provinces, but are not high compared to their own income and income levels. Their ratio of Dibao allowances to per capita income is lower than that of Jiangsu province, which is at similar level of development.",Evaluating the effectiveness of the rural minimum living standard guarantee (Dibao) program in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X18301007,Feb-19,2019,Research Article,521

Not surprisingly, there has been widespread discussion of whether the slowdown is permanent or not and, in either case, what the sources of the slowdown are. However, much of this discussion has been based on informal analysis of the data rather than formal ==== results. We make a move in the direction of formal empirical analysis of this issue by estimating and simulating a vector autoregressive (VAR) model which distinguishes between demand, supply and foreign shocks as possible drivers of changes in economic growth. We analyse both two-variable (growth and inflation) and three-variable (foreign growth, domestic growth and inflation) VAR models and identify demand, supply and foreign shocks, using a modification of the Blanchard-Quah identification procedure.

Third, we relax the assumption underlying the application of BQ to Chinese data that the two shocks (supply and demand or permanent and temporary) are uncorrelated and show that the resulting decomposition is substantially unaffected.==== Fourth, we show that the decomposition is also substantially unaffected by the addition of a foreign shock to the model, thus adding to our confidence in our base results.====Our main finding is that the slowdown since the GFC has been mainly supply-driven, suggesting a permanent change in the growth rate. Demand has some negative influence during the GFC but little thereafter. Thus we can conclude that the characterisation of the slowdown as ¡°New Normal¡± is quite appropriate and that the Chinese government was correct in its view that it cannot afford to sit and wait for the economy to revert to its previous high growth rates of its own accord. This result is robust to a number of variations in the model. First, in the two-variable model it is robust to changes in the identification assumptions. Second, it is robust to the addition of a foreign shock; although we find that demand loses some of its early influence which is partly absorbed by the effects of the foreign shock, the slowdown is still substantially explained by supply or permanent influences after about 2011. The same robustness holds in relation to a number of other variations in the model identification and data definitions.

The heterogeneity and robustness checks further confirm that private firms indeed were unable to get the same amount of economic benefits from the government as before, which provides a reasonable explanation for the negative stock price reaction after mandatory resignations of politically connected independent directors."," we empirically find that, after losing politically connected independent directors, the stock prices of private firms drop 4.61% on average within ten trading days, compared with untreated firms. Then we employ OLS regression to control for the additional characteristics of private firms and get similar results. Furthermore, this price drop is particularly pronounced when the politically connected independent director had a higher administrative level, or was an incumbent in the government position, or when the private firm is located in the middle or western part of China, where the market economy is comparatively underdeveloped. As a comparison, the loss of an independent director from academia has a much smaller influence on the firm's stock price (?1.49%), which shows that independent directors with a political background are indeed important to private firms in China.====Then we explore the reasons why politically connected independent directors are so important to Chinese firms. Past literature has shown that independent directors on corporate boards serve important functions like supervisory function (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Their main responsibility is to resolve the fundamental agency problem by aligning manager and shareholder interests.

Why has PIPE market come to dominate SEO and, given the strict regulation by CSRC, how do Chinese listed firms choose one equity offering mechanism over the other?====PIPE's popularity in China is consistent with capital market phenomena in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but although the literature sheds light on the choice of equity selling mechanism in the secondary equity markets in these countries (e.g., ====; ====; ====), their institutional and regulatory backgrounds differ in a number of important ways from China's. The CSRC, for example, imposes a restrictive profitability threshold on PIPE issuance, while supporting flexible use of equity issuance and choice of offer price. Prior Chinese research on the secondary equity market has mostly investigated the SEO and PIPE markets independently, and inclusion of periods preceding non-tradable share reform confounded its findings. This paper explores how the institutional and regulatory differences in China influence listed firms' choice between PIPE and SEO. Given that the choice between these two equity-selling mechanisms affects the efficiency of asset allocation in China's capital market, our analysis is of both theoretical and practical significance.====We examine first the institutional background of PIPE and SEO, in particular, cases in which listed firms are constrained to choose PIPE. CSRC imposes requirements on profitability for SEO issuers, specifically, positive fiscal net income in three consecutive recent years and a 6% three-year average ROE, and differently restricts the use of proceeds from equity issuance or issuance motivation. An empirical analysis that neglects to consider these restrictive differences is subject to bias arising from the choice of PIPE being for some independent of other issuer characteristics. We consequently employ for our analysis the matched sample of equity issuers able to freely choose between, and with access to both, PIPE and SEO. Our analysis is in two parts. In the first, we use a logit model to reveal how firms choose between PIPE and SEO, and in the second examine the announcement effects and post-issuance, long-run stock performance of both.====Our empirical results show that PIPE issuers are characterized by a higher degree of ==== and weaker operating performance, which findings suggest, consistent with research results in the U.S. capital market, that PIPE plays the role of last resort for firms in China. Beyond confirming previous findings in the PIPE literature, our results show that issuers attempt to time the market differently and are affected by the institutional difference on pricing basis date in China. Specifically, we find PIPE to be more likely to be chosen if the stock market is performing poorly or firms' stock volatility is higher.====The following analysis of pre- and post-issuance ==== shows the market to react positively to PIPE and negatively to SEO announcements. The significant positive CARs found two days before SEO announcements and negative long-run returns suggest that issuers deliberately time equity issues and announce their choice.====The study reported here makes the following contributions to the literature. Our analysis of listed firms' choice between PIPE and SEO extends the existing empirical analysis of equity selling mechanisms in the U.S. capital market (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Our new empirical findings for the emerging market in China are consistent with earlier findings that PIPE tends to be regarded as the last resort for firms with high information asymmetry and weak operating performance. We find as well that its greater flexibility tends to make PIPE the equity selling mechanism of choice for firms with high stock volatility and in bearish markets.====Our sample, moreover, overcomes a number of limitations of studies of PIPE and SEO previously reported in the literature (e.g., ====; ====). Our sample being drawn entirely from the post-non-tradable share reform implementation period, any effects related to the transition are mitigated. Our sample excludes as well firms for which regulatory restrictions preclude a choice of equity selling mechanism. Accounting thus for China's institutional background mitigates the potential for bias arising from regulations that restrict some firms to a particular equity offering mechanism.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

While there are many studies on the factors behind reducing energy intensity globally, little attention has been paid on whether differences in energy intensity diminish over time, and if convergence can be achieved. However, such convergence studies are important in terms of mapping out whether there is a diffusion of energy-related technologies across regions, and what regions need to be prioritized in the improvement of efficiency (====).====China is a fascinating case study of energy economics issues due to its impressive economic performance in the past few decades (====) and its associated dramatic increase of energy demand. Despite of remarkable growth in electricity consumption, China's per capita electricity consumption in 2014 was around 3927?kWh, only slightly higher than the world average of 3128?kWh, 30% of that of the US, and 50% of the level of the Japan, the most energy efficiency country in the world (====). There is a huge diversity in electricity consumption per capita across province in China: ranging from 1250?kWh in Tibet to 13,149?kWh in Ningxia in 2015. Such divergence in energy intensity across subnational units challenges the national governments' credibility to reduce their reduction targets of energy or emissions (====).====Whether electricity consumption converges across provinces is an academic and policy question that matters to China and the world. Since China is the world's largest CO2 emitter, its future change in electricity demand will not only affect its international commitment of reaching the peak CO2 emission by 2030, but also affect the achievement of global target of CO2 emissions. Convergence studies on subnational levels are often focused on big countries such as China (====) and USA (====; ====).====The aim of this paper is thus to investigate the process of convergence of per capita electricity consumption in the Chinese provinces over the period 2000¨C2015 with the application of a distribution dynamics approach. Distribution dynamics, or transitional dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of each province within the distributions in different regional groupings. The convergence studies at the subnational level have important policy implications. The information on the distribution of electricity consumption among the provinces can help the government in prioritizing national energy and environmental policy across the country. The information can also reveal future development of electricity consumption; thereby enabling the government to allocate scarce resources in a more efficient way by providing incentives and support to the provinces most in need.

The IMF had predicted in October 2016 that China's growth rate would be 6.2% in 2017, 6.0% in 2018 and 2019, 5.9% in 2020 and 5.8% in 2021.==== One could perhaps seek comfort from the IMF's bleak projections by noting that the diagnoses of this growth slowdown diverge widely across China experts, running the gamut of extreme optimism to deep pessimism.====Lin (2016) typifies the optimistic faction of analysts when he identifies ¡°external and cyclical factors, not some natural limit¡± as the primary causes of the growth slowdown. He therefore urges boosting domestic demand (through ¡°improvements in infrastructure, urbanization efforts, environmental management, and high-tech industries¡±) to reach the official growth targets. The basis for Justin Lin's optimism comes from his observation that the China-USA ratio of GDP per capita (in PPP$) was 20% in 2008 which was what the Japan-US ratio and the Korea-US ratio were in 1951 and 1977 respectively. Since Japan and Korea went on to grow 9.2% and 7.6% annually, respectively, for the next 20?years, Justin ==== concludes that ¡°in the 20 years after 2008, China should have a potential growth rate of roughly 8%.¡±====Other notable members of the optimistic faction are ==== who feel that despite challenges like significant industrial over-capacity and excessive credit expansion, ¡°the reality is that China's transition to a more innovative, consumer-driven economy is well underway. This suggests that the economy is experiencing a bumpy deceleration, not a meltdown.¡± The term ¡°bumpy¡± refers to being temporarily away from the norm, and Spence and Hu advises the Chinese government to moderate future bumps by increasing the transparency of its decision-making and communicating its policy decisions more effectively.====The important point to note about the optimistic camp is that neither Justin Lin nor Michael Spence and Fred Hu mention any specific structural or institutional reform in their articles. The latter focused on moderating the bump rather than on raising the trend growth rate.====, on the other hand, is pessimistic about sustaining the high growth of the past because she sees the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector ¡°as choking the private sector¡± through the unfair competition resulting from the preferential treatment given to SOEs (like cheap land and cheap capital). Keyu Jin calls for root-and-branch reform of the entire social system:====Within the pessimistic camp, different experts have identified different causes for the slowdown, however. ==== had pointed out that China ¨C unlike Japan and Korea ¨C was aging before it was affluent, and warned that this demographic factor could cause China to fall into the middle-income trap.==== The abrupt drop in Japanese growth rates had occurred in the early 1990s when the Japanese dependency ratio (the proportion of population younger than 15 and older than 60) started going up sharply, after rising very slowly in 1970¨C1990. Similarly, Korean growth rates slowed down significantly after the Korean dependency ratio bottomed out in 2010 and started climbing up rapidly.====China's dependency ratio bottomed in 2010, and its subsequent rise is quite rapid but still a little slower than in Japan after 1995 and in Korea after 2010. Using demographically-adjusted growth accounting, ==== had projected that the annual potential growth rate in the 2016¨C2020 period was 6.1%. This is the basis of Cai Fang's call for the relaxation of the one-child policy and of the household registration (====) system to retard the rise of the dependency ratio via higher fertility and to increase the labor participation rate via faster urbanization.====One could plausibly argue that ==== prediction would also be falsified in 2017 because 2017 is a politically-sensitive year as the once-a-decade change in top political leadership would occur in late 2017 at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China.====A significant number of experts hold the middle position that the post-2010 downturn is the product of both cyclical (demand) factors and negative supply-side trends. For example, ==== states that ¡°China faces two separate challenges: the long-term issue of a declining potential growth rate and the immediate problem of below-potential actual growth¡±; and ==== therefore points out that ¡°another stimulus package that increases aggregate demand through infrastructure investment is needed.¡±====This middle position is a reasonable view, but it has significant drawbacks. First, it is useful to guiding policy only when one could specify the relative contribution of each set of causes to the decline in the growth rate. Second, this middle position would misinterpret the excess capacity in industrial firms as evidence of inadequate demand because it does not take structural mismatches into account. For example, in China's distorted economy, large excess supply could exist simultaneously with large excess demand for a prolonged period: ghost cities in inland cities, and soaring housing prices in the large coastal cities.====It appears that the Chinese government is more on the side of economic reform rather than on the side of macro-stimulus to stabilize (and also perhaps raise) China's growth rate. In a speech that President Xi Jinping delivered in January 2016, he stated:====This paper makes the case that supply-side structural reform is the most effective way to address the present economic problems of China; and that what needs to be done on the demand-side is not the implementation of macro-stimulus but the termination of the soft budget constraint.",China's soft budget constraint on the demand-side undermines its supply-side structural reforms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X1730144X,6-Oct-17,2017,Research Article,528

Perkins Dwight Heald,"Harvard University, United States","Available online 29 September 2017, Version of Record 11 October 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2017.09.013,Cited by (1),None,"To begin with it is important first to point out that China's GDP growth rate slowdown is not in and of itself an indication of a looming recession. Many economies have grown rapidly for a time but none had sustained rapid growth for more than two or three decades. As it turns out, those that have largely ¡°done everything right¡±, that is they have not made major economic policy mistakes, have gone on to high income status. But these economies have generally slowed down at roughly the same level of per capita income, a level that falls far short of the income of the highest income countries. That is the case for all five of the high growth East Asian economies (Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) but it is also true for many European countries among others although no European country ever achieved the near double digit growth rates of East Asia. The reasons for this slowdown include such things as the end of labor surplus in the countryside and a shift at high middle income levels from growth based on manufacturing to growth based more on the modern service sector. Most of all, however, growth slows because economies cannot continue growing beyond a certain point by following the path laid down by those ahead of them¡ªthey must innovate increasingly on their own. It is more difficult to grow rapidly when one must inevitably follow down paths that don't always work out as well.====To undergo a hard landing as defined above, China would have to experience a sharp drop in aggregate demand that would then spread its impact throughout the economy through multiplier and accelerator effects found in all major recessions around the world. That sharp drop in aggregate demand could be caused by a financial crisis, a drop in demand for China's exports, or some other shock or combination of shocks that would lead private and public investors to stop investing and begin to lay off employees such as a political crisis or upheaval.==== whose capacity now far outstrips domestic and foreign demand for their products.====If these financial scenarios were unfolding in a Western democracy there would be good reason for anticipating a recession as more and more investors began realizing what was happening and cut their investments. This would reduce demand setting off a downward spiral. But there is little evidence yet that this is happening in China and it is not difficult to find the reason why. The Chinese government is clearly ready to do what is necessary to avoid a recession and they have the tools they need to accomplish it. Moreover investors now expect the government to behave in this way so they have no need to alter their investment plans.====The Chinese government will not let any of the largest banks (mainly the large state owned banks) go bankrupt and face liquidation. China in the 1990s faced a situation where officially a quarter of bank assets were deemed to be non-performing and outside observers often estimated that the true figure was much higher, a level of non-performing assets that is far higher than what confronted the financial sector in 2016. The government removed the non-performing loans from the banks and placed them in new and separate asset management companies. The banks received compensation for these non-performing assets based on their original value and thus the banks were made solvent. More recently the banks (and some industrial enterprises) have been helped out by swapping debt for equity in a way that also has eliminated the potential danger of non-performing assets.====There is nothing very complicated about these various moves. They all basically involve the government printing money and giving it to the banks while taking the non-performing assets off their books. The banks are once again made solvent. Everything is the same as before the crisis except that the expectations of both borrowers and lenders have changed. The more often the government uses macro interventions of this sort, the more borrowers and lenders will believe the government will do much the same thing the next time there is a crisis. No one, at least initially, appears to have been hurt by the crisis and the excessively risky behavior of borrowers and lenders so the tendency of both borrowers and lenders will be not to worry about future risky behavior. The term that describes this situation is ¡°moral hazard¡±. The short term crisis has been dealt with, but the longer term impact could be to increase the frequency and magnitude of these kinds of financial crises.====Chinese government moves to avoid a recession, or even what is perceived as an unacceptable decline in the GDP growth rate and in the growth of employment, have also involved very large government investment programs. China's rate of gross capital formation as a share of GDP rose to over 40% in 2004 and kept on rising peaking at 47.3% in 2011 before falling back slightly to 44.1% in 2015. The average rate for the years prior to 2004 was 36.9% rising to 44.1% in the years since (46.2% in the years 2009¨C2015). The only time that this rate rose above 40% prior to 2004 was in 1993 and 1994 when this level of investment caused ====China did not choose to raise its investment rate to this high level. It resulted from the fact that the share of household income in GDP at the beginning of the reform period was at a fairly low level and fell further as GDP grew faster than household income (although household income grew rapidly in comparison with most other economies). In addition China had high national and household ====Given the low share of household income in GDP and the high savings rate of households and corporations, China has had a choice of raising the investment rate or letting substantial amounts of economic capacity lie idle. But then the questions became invest in what? Producing all of the goods and services consumed by households plus exports, together with the investment goods needed to produce those consumption goods and exports, probably took little if any more than 25% of GDP.====The relevance of this high level of investment to this part of the essay is two-fold. First, the government demonstrated that it had the capacity and the will to spend large sums to maintain a high rate of growth of GDP and employment. Much of the investment in housing was done by the private sector although not all of it. Most of the infrastructure investment, in contrast, was almost entirely done by one level or another of the government even if in some cases private firms actually carried out the governments' plans. Thus the central and local governments demonstrated a capacity to spend annually on investment perhaps between 10 and 15% of GDP. Some of this was labeled explicitly as stimulus spending but much of it was not so labeled. The stimulus package introduced by the US government in 2009, in comparison, amounted to 5.5% of GDP and was to be spent over several years.====While the Chinese government demonstrated a capacity and willingness to spend large sums on investment, the way in which these investments were financed starting in 2008¨C2009 accounted for some of the financial issues discussed above. Local governments, for example, were in effect ordered to finance parts of the infrastructure investment that took place within their jurisdictions. Since the revenue base of many local governments was inadequate for this task, they often borrowed the money with little hope of being able to pay it back. In some cases they created investment vehicles to get around restrictions on where banks could lend, vehicles that were often bound to fail. Local governments thus ended up with debts that were later in 2014 determined to be around RMB24 trillion. The government also encouraged state enterprises to expand their investments and it is likely that the private sector as well felt pressure to contribute since it also expanded its investment. Many of these state enterprises have in addition accumulated considerable debt some of which has contributed to the rise in non-performing assets in the banks.====Thus there were mistakes made in the way the government financed the large state and state enterprise investment and those mistakes account for some of the problems facing the Chinese economy today. The large excess capacity in many industries could have been avoided by not encouraging or even discouraging this expansion in capacity in the first place and relying on imports to meet the temporary excess demand. This would have lowered the stimulus impact but that impact would still have been large. The rise in local government debt could have been avoided by having the central government issue bonds at market clearing ==== rather than leaving the financing up to the localities (or the banks could have been ordered to buy the bonds whatever their interest rate).====Few of these mistakes, however, suggest that China's government investment or stimulus effort was too large. A large stimulus was needed in 2008¨C2009. The problem was in part the way the stimulus was implemented. The government directly ordered different government entities to increase their level of investment and they carried out the government's orders whether or not the resulting investments made much sense. Government directives, however, were not solely to blame. The private sector, notably with respect to housing, also expanded investment at an unsustainable rate and both the public and private suppliers of building materials also expanded their capacity far beyond what made any sense over the longer run.====With respect to avoiding a short term economic downturn, however, the point here is that China's government clearly has the capacity to manage a very large investment program on a sustained basis, it follows that many other shocks to aggregate demand could also be offset by a large government stimulus. One plausible scenario is a fall in exports large enough to greatly reduce investment in export industries that could then have a ripple effect through the economy. Exports in 2015 did in fact fall by 2.9% (in US dollars) and if this were to continue it could have a major impact on overall aggregate demand. Exports were 21% of GDP in 2015 although net of the imported inputs in these exports the percentage would be lower.====Is a steady decline in exports plausible? The markets for many of China's manufactured exports are probably saturated and those exports that depend on ==== are already leaving China as Chinese wages continue to rise rapidly. Chinese markets in Europe and Japan are mostly stagnant and may remain so and the U.S. market is growing slowly. Chinese exports from sectors with large over capacity such as steel have also stimulated anti-dumping and other trade restriction efforts in some of these markets. None of this will turn into long term stagnation or decline in Chinese exports unless China also fails to move up to higher technology exports that do not depend on low wages. China is in fact doing that but whether it will be rapid enough to offset the decline in other exports remains to be seen. Clearly, given the size of China's exports overall, the country will never again achieve the 10 and 20% annual export growth rates that it experienced for long periods in the past and that contributed to the double digit GDP growth rates.====If a decline in exports were to continue and possibly accelerate, the government would still have the capacity to offset this decline in aggregate demand but would it in fact use this capacity for that purpose. Most exporters are in the private sector and many are foreign owned. The Chinese government may well be reluctant to ==== failing export oriented enterprises directly so it would have to compensate with even more investment elsewhere. Either that or make major efforts to increase household income and consumption perhaps with direct subsidies. This might be politically more difficult to do and the government might for a number of reasons decide not to do it. The result could be a sharp recession.====Thus it is possible to come up with a scenario or scenarios that could lead to a shock to aggregate domestic demand and then to a hard landing despite the government's formidable capacity to deal with most financial crises and manage large scale stimulus packages. Are any of these scenarios really plausible at least for the next few years? This writer is skeptical.====. In essence this is what happened in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Korea during the financial crisis of 1997¨C1998.====China's rising debt today, however, is mostly domestic and is denominated in renminbi so this is clearly not a current problem. Gross foreign debt in the first quarter of 2016 was only US$1.36 trillion and nearly half of that was long term. China's foreign exchange reserves from February 2015 through February 2016 fell from US$3.8 trillion to US$3.2 trillion a rate of decline that gave some credibility to the belief that China's huge foreign exchange reserves could fall to levels that would make the scenario just described plausible. Some have suggested that large scale capital flight had something to do with the decline in reserves in 2015¨C2016 and a major panic leading to even larger flight might be a danger. As it turned out, however, that US$600 billion decline mainly resulted from enterprises and other large holders of renminbi realizing that the years of a steadily revaluing renminbi exchange rate were over and devaluation was more likely going forward. They therefore rebalanced their foreign exchange holdings away from renminbi. These reserves as of July 2016 have held steady since February and would cover 19?months of Chinese imports at the peak import rate of 2014, an enormous reserve by any reasonable standard. A scenario where exchange reserves fall to dangerously low levels and external debt is huge and mostly short term thus may occur sometime in the future, but it is implausible to believe that it could happen within the next several years.====Finally one must consider the possibility that the large amount of money being printed to deal with China's financial difficulties could at some point lead to inflation. If inflation were to rise to politically unacceptable levels in China, the government might feel compelled to introduce tight monetary and fiscal policies that would themselves create a recession or hard landing. Inflation, however, is clearly not a current problem. Consumer prices over the decade 2006¨C2015 averaged 2.9% a year and the annual rate over the most recent four years (2012¨C2015) was 2.2%. The huge increases in the money supply in the United States, Japan, and the European Union have also not produced inflation. The worry in those countries has been deflation. There is thus disconnect between the money supply and consumer goods and services prices at least in the most advanced economies.====There seems to be a comparable disconnect in China. In 2015 the monetary stimulus increased corporate debt but much of that debt was not invested in fixed assets but in financial investments.====One can get a rough estimate of the savings rate of the top one or 2% of Chinese households if one assumes that that the household surveys accurately cover the lower income 98 or 99% of the population while the difference between the household income and expenditure estimates there and in the flow of funds accounts represent the income of the top one to 2%. That calculation suggests that the top one or 2% of the population receive 31.6% or 30.9% of total household income respectively and their savings from that total are 62.3 or 61.5% respectively.==== If one assumes that the household surveys miss a larger share of the high income population, say 5%, these savings rates come down further but are still roughly at 60% of disposable income. As the flow of funds accounts also indicate, nearly a quarter of total household disposable income is going into financial investments although we do not have household survey estimates of financial investments so cannot do a hypothetical calculation of the investments of the one or 2%.====The bottom line conclusion from these calculations is that the increase in income caused in part by monetary stimulus is not likely to show up in the ====. It is most likely to show up in housing prices, the stock market, or in capital flows out of the country to investments abroad. China clearly has a steady flow of funds out of the country that offset a substantial part of the inflow of funds from the current account surplus and foreign direct investment. This situation would have to change significantly in order for the high rate of investment, stimulus or otherwise generated, to lead to consumer price inflation. Thus there is not likely to be a need for China to vigorously introduce a tight monetary policy that could itself lead to a recession, at least not in the next several years.====To sum up, China clearly has the ==== tools needed to avoid a major recession or hard landing, but the continued use of those tools has consequences for the long term performance of the economy. Recessions in high income countries, painful as they sometimes are, do weed out much of the dead wood that has accumulated during the boom that preceded the bust of recession. China, in addition to preventing a hard landing, has also made it possible for many poorly performing firms to survive and for large scale excess capacity to continue to exist in key sectors. In addition, the methods used have contributed to rising inequality through large scale asset appreciation.
