These challenges are exacerbated by underdeveloped financial markets, volatile exchange rates, and a greater susceptibility to external shocks (Frankel, 2010). Under such circumstances, the choice of an optimal nominal anchor for monetary policy is of great importance. While a nominal exchange rate peg has been very common, inflation targeting has become increasingly popular over the last two decades. By contrast, monetary aggregates have rarely been adopted as a nominal anchor. For instance, among transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), only Albania employed full-fledged monetary targeting for more than a decade, while Czechia and Serbia used it over very short periods (Josifidis et al., 2009). China has also made use of M2 as an intermediate target of its monetary policy since the late 1990s, but over the past decade shifted to targeting the interest rate.====This pattern can be explained in part by the dismal experience with monetary aggregates as a tool of monetary policy in advanced economies, where money growth targeting became widespread in the 1970s thanks to the growing influence of monetarist ideas and mounting inflation concerns. However, after this approach proved unsuccessful in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada (Mishkin, 2001), monetary targets were gradually abandoned over the 1980s and early 1990s in favor of interest rates and inflation targeting, although Germany’s Bundesbank, and later, to a lesser degree, the European Central Bank, continued to emphasize the prominent role of monetary aggregates in their monetary policy strategy (von Hagen, 1999, Jaeger, 2003).====The usefulness of money as an information variable or monetary policy instrument has been dismissed due to the weak and unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other key nominal variables in developed countries (Estrella and Mishkin, 1999, Woodford, 2008). Alternatively, monetary aggregates have been viewed as an important source of leading information on future price developments and as an instrument, rather than objective, of policy during a liquidity trap (Masuch et al., 2003). Moreover, monetary targeting has been identified as a major stepstone on the road to an inflation-targeting regime in emerging economies with a weak policy transmission mechanism, institutional deficiencies, shallow financial markets, and a high inflationary environment (Laurens et al., 2015). In fact, Mehrotra and Slacik (2009) and Horvath et al. (2011) show that inflation targeting regimes in CEE countries would benefit from incorporating money into their policy toolbox because it provides useful information about price developments in the medium and long run.====If monetary aggregates are to be employed to inform, guide, or anchor monetary policy in emerging economies, their accurate measurement becomes a crucial precondition for their effectiveness. This paper focuses on monetary aggregates in Russia over the period 1998–2019, arguing that the standard method of quantifying money is severely defective, undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy. At the heart of the problem is the fact that the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), like most other monetary authorities in the world, calculates monetary aggregates as the simple sum of their components, causing significant loss of information. For instance, broad money is the result of adding money in circulation, demand deposits and time deposits with various maturity horizons, which amounts to assuming that they are perfect substitutes. This is clearly erroneous because each of these monetary assets has a different function, with cash or demand deposits being more useful for transaction services, while time deposits are held primarily for the purpose of storing value.====In a series of seminal papers, Barnett, 1980, Barnett, 1981, Barnett, 1983 derived a new monetary quantity index, which, unlike its simple-sum counterpart, is based on the rigorous application of microeconomic principles and index number theory. The resulting Divisia monetary aggregate takes into account the level of liquidity of a given monetary asset by assigning weights, which depend on how useful that asset is for transaction services, and thus for economic activity in general. The sound theoretical foundations and appealing properties of the new measure attracted interest both from academia and central banks, especially after monetary aggregates returned to the spotlight as policy interest rates reached the zero lower bound following the 2008 global financial crisis. Barnett and Chauvet (2011) showed that the failure to use Divisia monetary aggregates may have misled the Federal Reserve to first fuel asset bubbles through excessive money growth and then to burst them with an excessively contractionary policy just before the crisis. Moreover, large-scale asset purchases by major central banks resulting in a ballooning of their balance sheets triggered calls for the Federal Reserve to start targeting Divisia money growth as a way to preserve systematic, rule-like monetary policy in a zero interest environment (Belongia and Ireland, 2018).====Generating Divisia monetary aggregates for Russia is relevant and important for a number of reasons. Russia is one of the largest emerging economies and its heavy reliance on exports of natural resources makes it prone to external shocks that generate inflationary pressures. In addition, the country experienced a protracted and difficult structural transformation in the 1990s, marked by episodes of hyperinflation, bank failures, and a major financial crisis that ended in debt default and ruble devaluation in 1998. With a few direct monetary instruments initially at its disposal, the CBR was not equipped to deal with the rapid structural changes of economic transition (Balino et al., 1997). The gradual introduction of indirect market-based policy instruments was delayed by the 1998 crisis, with open market operations resuming only in 2003. Similarly, the refinancing rate, which was CBR’s key policy rate until 2013, was largely meaningless for monetary policy as it exceeded money market rates and failed to serve as a reference rate for financial markets (Lainela and Ponomarenko, 2012).====As mentioned above, targeting monetary aggregates in an economy marked by underdeveloped financial markets, inadequate policy tools, ineffective policy transmission mechanisms, and high inflation is a sensible approach. Although the exchange rate was chosen as the primary nominal anchor, for years the CBR set an intermediate operational target for M2 growth in an attempt to lower inflation (CBR, 2001, CBR, 2002). Over the 2000s, the CBR signaled that money growth targets were becoming more flexible as the link between broad money and prices was weakening but monetary aggregates remained a “key reference point” (CBR, 2004) and a “major leading indicator of inflation” (CBR, 2005). Even after the transition to an inflation-targeting regime in the 2010s, the CBR continued using monetary aggregates as an information variable (CBR, 2011). Further evidence comes from studies showing that over the period 1993–2003 a McCallum rule targeting monetary aggregates provides a better description of the CBR’s policy-setting behavior than a Taylor rule (Esanov et al., 2005; Vdovichenko and Voronina, 2006).==== Similarly, monetary policy had an effect on bank lending in Russia in 1999–2010 only when monetary aggregates (rather than interest rates) were used as a policy instrument (Deryugina and Ponomarenko, 2011, Juurikkala et al., 2011). Given the crucial function of money in Russia’s monetary policy, replacing the simple-sum monetary aggregate with a superior measure is of key essence.====Another reason for the potential of Divisia monetary aggregates to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy in Russia is the central role of foreign currency deposits in the financial system of the country. As in other CEE economies, high inflation, bank failures and devaluations of the domestic currency have led to a partial dollarization of deposits in Russia. The share of these deposits fluctuates over time, generally increasing during times of uncertainty and crises, and declining during periods of stability and economic prosperity. Such transfers of funds between different assets would not be revealed by a simple-sum monetary aggregate as these assets are treated as perfect substitutes. By contrast, weighted averaging enables Divisia monetary aggregates to reflect the substitution effects between monetary assets, which is crucial in the Russian context.==== However, to the best of our knowledge, Russia is not among the emerging economies for which a Divisia monetary index has been developed (e.g., China (Barnett and Tang, 2016), India (Barnett et al., 2016), Indonesia (Sianturi et al., 2017), Turkey (Polat, 2018)).====Accordingly, our main contribution to the literature is the calculation of two Divisia monetary aggregates for Russia, including one for monetary assets in rubles and one that adds deposits in foreign currency. To illustrate their advantages over the standard measures, we further explore the performance of these Divisia monetary aggregates in three different settings. First, we estimate five money demand specifications and assess the stability of Divisia money demand relative to the simple-sum measure. Next, we nowcast year-on-year growth of nominal GDP for Russia using lagged growth of nominal GDP and contemporaneous growth of money supply, and then compare the forecasts for both Divisia monetary aggregates to their simple-sum counterparts. Lastly, we test whether Divisia monetary aggregates remove or at least mitigate the price puzzle that arises from the sustained increase in the inflation rate following an unexpected tightening of monetary policy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview of the Russian monetary aggregates and their components. Section 3 describes the Divisia monetary aggregates and their calculation in the case of Russia. Section 4 presents the application of these aggregates to three different settings. Section 5 draws some conclusions.","Divisia monetary aggregates for Russia: Money demand, GDP nowcasting and the price puzzle",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522001169,4 October 2022,2022,Research Article,0.0

Theories of individual rational choice do not gain support. Factors associated with personal norms and with social norms and customs are important predictors of tax compliance. Noticeably, theories of reciprocity that prescribe a positive relation between approval of the government and its tax policies and tax compliance do not receive support, possibly reflecting the limited role of the government and individualist attitudes in post-transition Estonia.","Evasion of taxes is a challenge for society in many countries. It reduces tax revenues and may lead to higher tax rates and greater distortionary losses. Tax evasion may also redistribute income and wealth in random and unwarranted ways (Alstadsæter et al., 2019). Widespread tax evasion can challenge the legitimacy of the tax system. At the same time, experience shows that widespread tax evasion exhibits considerable persistence, suggesting that the problem may be difficult to address (Alm and Yunus, 2009, Alm, 2012). Given the prevalence and persistence of tax evasion, it is important to pin down factors that help predict it. This information can be useful for assessing the dynamics of tax evasion, can uncover the distributional effects, and can permit policies to be designed that address the factors behind tax evasion (Hashimzade et al., 2013, Luttmer and Singhal, 2014).====Numerous theories shed light on the motives that individuals may have for choosing to evade various tax obligations or alternatively for choosing to comply with those obligations. It is common to distinguish between economic and psychological theories (Olsen et al., 2018; Siglé et al., 2018; Kirchler, 2021). The economic theories are derived from standard models of rational economic choice under uncertainty or from behavioural choice under uncertainty. The psychological theories consider non-economic motives and draw on insights from sociology and psychology; psychological theories include personal convictions and social norms and customs.====The empirical literature has investigated the importance of various theories for individual variables for tax evasion. Some theories appear to receive empirical support in most studies, while the results for other theories vary substantially across countries and samples (Hashimzade et al., 2013: Pickhardt and Prinz, 2014). A number of background variables such as the sector of employment, employment status and income are found to be reliable predictors of tax evasion in many studies. Economic motives have received mixed support in the empirical literature. Variables that represent psychological motives such as personal convictions and social norms and customs are often found to be important for predicting tax evasion, but the evidence is somewhat piecemeal as detailed data on these non-economic variables are often not available.====This paper investigates the factors that help predict the incidence of self-reported tax evasion by individuals in Estonia. The analysis uses a survey on the willingness to pay taxes commissioned by the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (abbreviated EMTA from ====) of the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. We construct a dataset from the 2018, 2019 and 2020 rounds of the survey with more than 3700 respondents. The survey comprises a large number of survey questions, which allows us to provide a comprehensive analysis of the factors that predict tax evasion by individuals, including numerous factors that reflect motivations outside of the narrow individualistic economic domain.====This study addresses a number of issues that may have received comparatively little attention in the empirical literature on the motives for tax evasion. First, the detailed survey data means that the main theories of tax evasion are covered by the questions in the survey. Second, the dimensionality problem that emerges from the large number of variables in the dataset is addressed using principal component regression, a methodology that is used infrequently in the empirical literature on tax evasion but can provide additional insights. Finally, the case of Estonia may be of interest in its own right given that the country has been through a comprehensive transition process which has limited the role and size of the government in society.====Estonia is an interesting case. As a post-transition EU country, Estonia has experienced rapid structural change and fast economic growth, but studies nevertheless reveal relatively high and steady levels of tax evasion (Williams and Horodnic, 2015, Meriküll and Staehr, 2010, Kukk et al., 2020). The country has a simple tax system with a flat income tax of 20 per cent and few deductibles, and a value added tax of 20 per cent with very few exceptions. Moreover, Estonia has from an early stage embraced internet-based government administration in order to improve accessibility of public services and reduce costs. This also applies to the tax administration, which relies on extensive third-party reporting. The transition reforms resulted in a liberal-market model that combines a small government and emphasis on individual initiative.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature considering the motives for tax evasion. Section 3 discusses the survey and the data used and runs a principal component analysis. Section 4 reports the results of the principal component regressions.

Due to oil supply shocks, the increase in oil price raises bank risk, whereas the similar increase in price due to economic expansion or oil-market specific demand reduces that risk.

Third, the two major recent crises (global financial crises and COVID-19 pandemic) magnified bank risk exposure to oil supply shocks and speculative oil demand shocks. Overall, the structural oil shocks explain a large fraction of the variation in financial stability in GCC countries.","""===="" Kilian and Park (2009, p. 1267). Not surprisingly, a limited number of studies were able to document a significant relationship between oil price shocks and financial stability without disaggregating the sources of oil price movements. Few studies have examined the association between the sources of oil price shocks and bank risk in the GCC countries, even though they are regarded as the largest regional exporter of crude oil.,====Several studies attempted to identify the underlying factors behind oil price dynamics to understand their effects on the economy.==== Central to this insight, the literature has heavily used the structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model, developed by Baumeister and Hamilton (2019), which jointly identifies four drivers of oil price shocks: (1) Oil Supply Shocks (OSS) which are driven by unexpected changes in world oil production (i.e., wars, revolution, and civil unrests in oil-producing countries) and/or by other disruptive supply-based factors, such as shifts in OPEC’s oil policy (Hamilton, 2003, Hamilton, 2009); (2) Economic Activity Shocks (EAS), which are driven by aggregate demand influenced by fluctuations in the global business cycle; (3) Oil Consumption Demand Shocks (OCDS) which are driven mainly by shifts in the precautionary demand for oil; (4) Oil Inventory Demand Shocks (OIDS) which are driven by speculative demand about the possible shortfall of future oil supply relative to future oil demand. Thus, although this model has been used by the existing literature, it is remaining a valid model for testing the derivers of oil price shocks.====This study investigates the impact of structural oil shocks on the systemic risk of banking in the GCC countries using quarterly bank-level data covering eighteen years. To gauge the systemic risk, we utilize two well-known market-based risk measures. The first measure is the Delta Conditional Value-at-Risk (∆CoVaR) approach, proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016), which signifies that the value of risk (VAR) in the banking sector conditional on an individual bank is in distress. The ∆CoVaR is the difference between VAR conditional on a bank being in distress and the VAR conditional on a bank working in a normal state. The second measure is the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES), developed by Acharya et al., (2017), which is defined by the bank stock returns when the banking sector's reaches worst performance level in a year. Thus, the measure captures the bank market performance on bad days. Overall, both measures capture systemic risk but in different ways. ∆CoVaR measures the contribution of risk from an individual bank to the whole financial system, whereas MES measures the impact of financial system downturn on an individual bank.====More deeply, this study investigates four issues. First, we examine the relationship between banks' systemic risk and disaggregated oil price shocks. Second, we compare this relationship between Islamic and conventional banks, since this region is an oil-producing region as well as heavily implementing a dual banking system. Third, we estimate the relationship on two sub-samples partitioned based on bank-level characteristics: size, profit, capital adequacy, and income diversification. Fourth, we examine how a bank's systemic risk responds to the four structural shocks (oil supply shocks (oil production), economic activity (oil aggregate demand), oil inventory demand shocks (oil speculative demand), and oil-market-specific (oil consumption demand) shocks) during normal periods versus periods of crisis (i.e., 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC) and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic).====We contribute to the literature in different ways. First, we study how oil price movements impact bank stability in a panel of oil-exporting countries. In these countries, bank risk are highly exposed to oil price shocks than oil-importing countries (Jin et al., 2022, Maghyereh and Abdoh, 2021). This area did not receive much scrutiny, specifically for the GCC region. Although a number of studies (e.g., Al-Khazali and Mirzaei, 2017; Miyajima, 2016; Khandelwal et al., 2016; Alodayni, 2016; Ibrahim, 2019; El Mahmah and Trabelsi, 2021) examined the role of oil price movements on banks, their analyses focused on the effect of oil price shocks on banks’ balance sheets and not on the market-based systemic risk. Second, to the best of our knowledge, no study has hitherto examined how different sources of oil price shocks drive the bank stability in oil-producing countries. Third, we differentiate the influence of oil price shocks and their disaggregated sources on bank stability according to bank-level attributes and times of crises. This should be of considerable interest to policymakers when they develop bank regulations. Finally, this study adds to the Islamic banking literature. By simultaneously examining the role of bank size, profitability, leverage, and income diversification, we show how the Islamic business model relates to bank stability amid oil price shocks. The current literature reveals differences between conventional banks and Islamic banks in terms of credit, insolvency, market, liquidity, and interest rate risks (e.g., (Maghyereh and Awartani, 2012) Abedifar et al., 2013; (Maghyereh and Awartani, 2014) Al-Shboul et al., 2020; Albaity et al., 2022; Safiullah and Shamsuddin, 2018; Zins and Weill, 2017; Fakhfekh et al., 2016; Pappas et al., 2017), but did not introduce the resilience of Islamic banks toward the risks of oil price shocks.====A number of rationales behind conducting the current study. Given that the GCC region is an oil-producing region, examining the impact of oil price shocks on bank systematic risk is an important issue of concern to government, investors and policy makers. Economies as well as the financial systems in the GCC region were barely hit by the negative consequences of the oil price shocks resulted from the global and pandemic crises, such as, the GFC, the COVID-19 pandemic and the political tension because of the Arab spring, the war in Iraq and the situation in Libya after 2011. These crises were accompanied by a sharp decline in oil prices, leading to a decline in the oil-revenues received by governments in the region. Given the dramatic plunge in oil-revenues, which led to a substantial pressure on the level of exports, GDP growth and fiscal balances, it is clearly noticed that the banking sector’s performance in the region was negatively impacted by these negative consequences, leading to a greater bank risk taking. These adverse impacts placed a substantial pressure on bank balance sheets, availability of liquidity and credit growth, particularly banks engaged into long term heavy real estate loans. Although governments in the region attempted to protect depositors by injecting more capital and credit and allowed for equity purchases (via government-owned projects, such as, Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), banks in the region took a delay of recovery from the negative shocks in oil price shocks.====The other main rationale of this study is the presence of the dual banking system (Islamic and conventional) in this region. Given the differences in the structure and the operating systems among conventional and Islamic banks, which ultimately affect the level of bank stability, the impact of oil price shocks where oil as a unique source of revenue for governments, might differently influence bank risk in both banking systems. Fundamentally, since Islamic banks often tend to use sukuk besides ==== deposits as well as applying the ==== policies as ways of self-funding, increase in oil prices might increase cash excess, and thus, Islamic bank deposits can be directed into more loan offerings, leading for a possible positive relationship oil prices between bank performance. However, this positive relationship might not be applicable on Islamic banks when oil prices decline. Although the decline in oil revenue may hit Islamic banks and their conventional peers, the difference in the impact of oil prices on conventional versus Islamic banks is likely to appear. As Islamic banks focus on a stable deposit strategy and rely on non-interest wholesale funding, they might be less risk tolerated than conventional banks, especially when liquidity becomes scarce after adverse oil price shocks.====Our paper offers a number of findings. First, not all shocks have the same effect on bank risk. Oil supply shocks leads the rise in oil prices to increase bank risk, whereas economic expansion or oil-market specific demand leads the rise in oil prices to reduce bank risk. This means that bank risk is positively associated with positive innovations in oil supply shocks (OSS) while negatively affected by economic activity shocks (EAS) and oil speculative demand shocks (OSDS). These opposite relationships are broadly consistent with Kilian’s (2009) assertion who argued that not all oil shocks have the same effect on the economy. Second, our paper finds that the business model (whether the bank is Islamic or conventional), size, income diversification, profitability, and financial leverage influence the bank risk exposure to oil shocks differently, in which the impact of bank-level variables on systemic risk is small relative to oil price shocks. Islamic banks are less risky in terms of systemic risk exposure to all sources of oil price shocks (particularly to OSS and EAS); Islamic banks are less adversely affected by systemic risk than conventional banks. In addition, systemic risk indicators are more exposed to oil price shocks for large banks, implying an uppermost concern for “too-big-to-fail” institutions. Third, the two major recent crises (global financial crises and COVID-19 pandemic) magnified bank risk exposure to oil supply shocks and speculative oil demand shocks. The impact of OSS (OSDS) on bank risk is significantly higher during the GFC than during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are aligned with the evidence that the structural oil shocks explain a large fraction of the variation in financial stability in GCC countries.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review and hypotheses development.

We expand the literature on this topic in several dimensions – posing alternative hypotheses regarding the effects of herding in asset, liability, and off-balance sheet portfolios; developing a novel set of bank-specific, time-varying measures of herding in these portfolios; and empirically testing the relations between bank herding for all three portfolios and bank systemic risk contributions. We find nuanced empirical results that differ by portfolio, bank size class, and periods before versus after TARP.","Banks may engage in herding behavior – creating similar portfolios to other banks – for at least two reasons given in the literature. The first, known as “too-many-to-fail (TMTF),” is that banks may lend to the same industry or otherwise mimic other banks‘ portfolios to increase their chances of being bailed out if and when there is a financial crisis (e.g., Acharya and Yorulmazer, 2007, Acharya and Yorulmazer, 2008; Brown and Dinc, 2011). The second reason is the reputational concern or “share-the-blame” motivation (e.g., Scharfstein and Stein,1990)(Wermers, 1999)(Arvind and Gupta, 2017)(David and Stein, 2017)(Kasa and Spiegel, 2008). Managers may emulate other managers’ investment decisions to avoid being identified as incompetent when the decisions yield bad results(Devenow and Welch, 1996). Herding for either of these reasons may result in a significant misallocation of financial resources and may have important effects on financial stability. We study the latter effects in this paper.====It is often argued that bank herding may increase systemic risk. Herding may occur in asset, liability, and/or off-balance sheet (OBS) portfolios, any one of which or combination of which may pose risks to the financial system. Holding similar assets or lending to the same industries may increase the correlation of banks’ asset returns and result in a greater likelihood that many banks become distressed simultaneously. Liability herding could increase the likelihood of contagious runs of other banks (Goldstein and Pauzner, 2004) and trigger a joint liquidation as a negative shock to a common funding source may force many banks to sell assets simultaneously (Wagner, 2008, Khan et al., 2017). Off-balance sheet (OBS) herding may increase systemic risk because of similar funding maturity or common exposure to counterparty risk (Angbazo, 1997, Greenwood et al., 2015, Biais et al., 2016,(Acharya et al., 2016, Allen et al., 2012)(Berger and Christa, 2009))(Bhattacharya et al., 2006). However, it may alternatively be the case that bank herding in any of these portfolios reduces systemic risk because the TMTF strategy is successful in terms of increasing the likelihood of government rescues when many banks have similar problems in their asset, liability, and/or OBS portfolios.====Despite the potential systemic risk implications of bank herding, there is no empirical research, to our knowledge, on whether herding results in higher or lower systemic risk. Nor are there any findings on the extent to which herding in asset, liability, and OBS portfolios may affect systemic risk contributions. Thus, the actual effects of different types of bank herding on systemic risk are unclear ==== from the theory and unknown ==== from the data.====We make several contributions to the literature. First, we develop a novel set of bank-level herding measures for the bank's asset, liability, and off-balance sheet portfolios. Second, we pose hypotheses of the opposing effects of the bank herding on systemic risk contributions and then test the hypotheses using the new herding measures and previously developed indicators of bank systemic risk contributions. We also investigate how the empirical results differ by portfolio, bank size class, and before versus after the great financial crisis, and discover some interesting differences.====Our new bank herding measures address two major limitations of those in the literature. First, most of the papers in the herding literature calculate industry-level measures, rather than bank-level measures, and so cannot be employed in studying contributions to systemic risk (e.g., Lakonishok et al., 1992; Liu, 2014; Heo, 2019). We are aware of only one paper that computes a bank-level measure (Chu et al., 2019), but it focuses only on geographics. More importantly, all these papers focus only on asset portfolio and leave liability and OBS herding completely out of their analyses.====In this paper, we distinguish bank herding not only in asset portfolios but also in the liability and OBS portfolios. Specifically, we compute a bank’s herding measures as the cosine similarities between the bank and the banking sector. Cosine similarity is a widely used measure to reflect the similarity between portfolios (Girardi, Giulio, Hanley, Nikolova, Pelizzon, and Sherman, 2017). The cosine similarity measure is bounded between zero and one, with the value of one being perfectly similar. We compute three cosine similarities to account for banks’ herding in asset, liability, and OBS portfolios.====The main measure of systemic risk in our analyses is systemic expected shortfall (====), which measures the bank’s “propensity to be undercapitalized when the system as a whole is undercapitalized” (Acharya et al., 2017). ==== captures the capital shortfall experienced by a financial institution conditional on market distress. As an alternative, we use ====, the expected capital shortfall (====) measure developed by Brownlees and Engle (2017) normalized by the bank’s capital. ==== is also a measure based on the equity market’s expectation of banks’ capital conditions at a crisis. We choose ==== and ==== because both measures are closely affected by the bank stock performance, which is a good indicator of systemic risk as systemic failure often manifests itself in the events of simultaneous crashes of the banking stocks (Gropp, Vesala and Vulpes, 2006; Finan and De Jonghe, 2010).====Our empirical results differ by bank size class, portfolio, and periods before versus after the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). First, the relations between herding and systemic risk contribution are only significant for large banks. This result is not a surprise because large banks have the most important systemic footprints and pose a greater systemic risk for any given level of idiosyncratic bank risks. Large banks are also more likely to be rescued in crises, while smaller banks contribute very little to systemic risk so that their chance of being bailed out during a crisis is small(Bayazitova and Shivdasani, 2011).====Second, for large banks, the relations between herding and systemic risk contribution differ in the asset, liability, and OBS portfolios. Asset herding is negatively related to systemic risk contribution. A one standard deviation increase in asset herding in the last quarter is associated with less ==== by 7% of its standard deviation. In contrast, a one standard deviation increase in liability herding in the last quarter is associated with more ==== by 9% of its standard deviation. We find no significant relations of OBS herding with systemic risk contribution. The results suggest that the equity market considers liability herding is a more severe threat than asset herding to the financial system, contrary to popular wisdom.====Third, the relations vary dramatically before and after TARP. We find that the herding in all three portfolios have a positive relation before 2008Q4 when TARP was announced, and the relations become insignificant after 2008Q4. The change of magnitude is statistically significant for asset herding. Though indirect, this result provides some evidence of the TMTF theory. In the quarters leading to 2008Q4, we may expect a positive relation between herding and systemic risk contribution because the market might have worried that the trouble in the housing sector would spread to the broader financial system through various mortgage-backed securities and interbank lending. After TARP is implemented, the perception of the positive association between herding and systemic risk should be eased at least to some degree as the market witnessed the massive government rescue. Our results suggest that the equity market expects the herding banks to have a greater chance of surviving crises and implies that herding may not always be positively related to systemic risk contribution due to the TMTF effect.====Our findings remain valid over several robustness tests, including using alternative systemic risk measures, using an alternative size threshold for large banks, and indicators rather than continuous values of herding measures, as well as the “too-big-to-fail” test just discussed.====The rest of the paper proceeds as the following.

In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this issue by investigating the factors that are associated with the multimillionaires' wealth level, mobility in the ranking of the rich, and the likelihood of dropping off the ranking of the richest individuals. We focus on Poland – a post-socialist emerging economy, which is widely perceived as the poster child of a successful transition to the market economy and “Europe’s growth champion” (World Bank 2017; Piątkowski 2018). We pay special attention to political connections as a factor explaining the size of multimillionaires’ fortunes, their mobility and chances of survival among the richest. By this, we study if the Polish economy has become a crony capitalist one in which plutocrats exploit political connections to secure financial success, stifle competition, and impede the process of being outcompeted by unconnected entrepreneurs. Several recent studies have found that political connections played an important role in amassing and defending oligarchic great fortunes in Russia and Ukraine (Braguinsky, 2009, Markus and Charnysh, 2017, Lamberova and Sonin, 2018). While the Polish super-wealthy are not oligarchs as they are not powerful enough to affect institutional changes in the fields of politics, regulation or judiciary (Guriev and Rachinsky 2008), it is still possible that their political connections help perpetuate or expand their fortunes.====The salience of super-rich cronies has recently been highlighted by Bagchi and Svejnar (2015), who have shown that politically-connected wealth inequality is detrimental to economic growth globally (while the effect of unconnected wealth inequality is insignificant, as they argue). Moreover, Fidrmuc and Gundacker (2017) demonstrated that the presence of oligarchs, who have often become rich through privatization rigged towards politically-connected individuals (Guriev and Rachinsky, 2005), significantly increases income inequality in Russian regions. Fidrmuc and Gundacker (2017) obtained that while social capital in terms of informal network strength and trust is significantly higher in Russian regions with stronger oligarchic presence, trust in the family and the quality of public governance (especially at the local government level) tends to be evaluated as significantly worse. These works suggest that economic growth and social progress may be threatened when the largest fortunes arise due to ties with the political sphere or when they are protected by the politicians from the shocks resulting from changing market conditions.====In this paper, we use the rich lists published yearly by the Polish magazine ====. The earliest available year is 2002, thus we focus on the period 2002–2018. We complement the ranks and wealth estimates by a set of manually collected variables, including personal characteristics, wealth characteristics and indicators related to political connections. We follow the literature (see, e.g., Bagchi and Svejnar, 2015, Bagchi et al. 2016; Freund 2016) in classifying a person as strictly politically connected if reliable news stories are connecting her wealth to past positions in government, close relatives or friends in government, or questionable licenses. Bearing in mind a specific context of a post-socialist country, we also treat as politically connected the multimillionaires who under socialism served as Security Service informants or were members of the communist party. In addition, all super-rich persons who had their fortunes originated in privatized firms are classified as politically connected as we were unable to identify rigorously which privatization decisions after 1989 were dictated by political favours to insiders and cronies. Admittedly, we do not investigate whether political connections have helped to become super-rich in Poland as our data do not cover the early post-socialist transition period of the 1990 s. However, we think that testing whether political connections are associated with improved chances of out-competing other multimillionaires provides valuable insights into the role of cronyism in Polish capitalism.====Contrary to our expectations, we find little evidence for the beneficial effect of political connectedness. None of the variables capturing political connections of Polish multimillionaires is consistently related neither to the size of the largest fortunes in Poland nor to the chances of upward mobility on the rich list. While we find that political connections are related to a lower probability of moving down on the rich list, we also obtain that they increase the risk of falling off the list. We compare our results with those for Russia and Ukraine and point to the possible explanations for our findings, seeking for them in the differing circumstances of transformation from centrally-planned to a market economy in Central and Eastern Europe and the Post-Soviet States.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature that seeks to explain the origins of the largest fortunes. It also provides a review of literature on the political connectedness in post-transition countries. Section 3 gives a detailed description of our data and presents the first insights from descriptive analysis. Section 4 introduces our methodology, while Section 4 presents and discusses the results.

While certain East Asian countries have made great leaps in industrial production filling the vacuum created by deindustrialization in the developed economies, the bulk of developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, and Latin America has undergone what might be called a premature deindustrialization (Dasgupta and Singh, 2006) as they saw their manufacturing industries contract at low-to-middle income level.====We approach the premature deindustrialization in the context of trade and financial globalization by exploring the effects of dismantling barriers against trade and capital flows on the share of manufacturing industry in the developing countries. With the liberalization of capital accounts, developing economies have become more vulnerable to flows of short-term financial capital resulting in huge volatility in real exchange rates as they get more integrated to the global financial structure. We will investigate whether local currency overvaluations commonly associated with huge capital inflows have pernicious effects on the size of their manufacturing industry similar to those of the Dutch Disease. Here, the Dutch disease should not be confined to its traditional meaning that real appreciations in the exchange rates follow natural resource discoveries (Palma, 2014). We find the link from overvaluations to deindustrialization to be extremely important regardless of the origin of these overvaluations, that is, whether it be the discovery of natural repositories of some valuable metal and fossil fuel or the strong capital inflows triggered by some exogenous shock such as the change in monetary policy in the leading economies. More specifically, the Dutch disease may assert itself after drastic changes in the economic policy as has been the case in Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. We generally argue that while trade liberalization led to a decline in the price of tradable goods, financial liberalization also gave rise to a surge in capital inflows overvaluing the real exchange rates, thereby doubly squeezing the competitiveness of manufacturing industry in developing countries.====Despite many important contributions, the literature on premature deindustrialization is rather fledgling. For one thing, most of the studies basically fall short of going further beyond detecting the deindustrialization trends at relatively low income levels while pointing finger at globalization as their probable cause in general terms. For another, the analytical framework for analyzing the premature deindustrialization through the lens of globalization is lopsided towards the trade-based explanations. With this narrative, the globalization’s effects seem to be confined to the trade and price trends originated in developed world. We, however, place the emphasis on the financial globalization by examining the detrimental effects of capital inflows on real exchange rates harming the manufacturing output share in the developing world. For this end, we construct an overvaluation index with nice theoretical properties. First, it is adjusted for the Balassa-Samuelson effect so the economic development level can be accounted for in determining the equilibrium real exchange rate (Egert, 2005). Second, we obtain the overvaluation index not from the cross-section regressions but from the panel regressions with fixed times effects so that it becomes comparable both across countries and over time. After obtaining overvaluation measurements for all the countries in the dataset, we empirically show that capital inflows as measured by net financial flows actually trigger local overvaluation in real terms. We develop an augmented econometric model to quantify the malign effects of local currency overvaluations on the share of manufacturing industry along with a set of robustness checks against sample bias, different measurements of real exchange rate misalignments, and endogeneity. Then we apply state of the art panel data methodologies such as the Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators to estimate our baseline regression model. The main advantage of the new methodology lies basically in taking care of the cross section dependency which cannot be ignored given the extent of globalization. We find that an overvaluation of 50% which corresponds approximately to one and half standard deviations is associated with a contraction of manufacturing output share as high as 1,25% over the five year period. Moreover, we provide the further evidence that the relationship between the real exchange misalignments and premature deindustrialization might be nonlinear so the manufacturing competencies which have been eroded by local currency overvaluations in real terms could not simply be brought back during the undervaluation periods. The last point implies that the return to industrial policy along with the use of capital controls becomes indispensable to revive the local manufacturing industry in developing countries rather than simply relying on the policies aimed to keep local currencies undervalued.====The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature and develops the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the empirical evidence along with the research methodology. Section 4 discusses the policy implications of the empirical findings.

Bank regional branches are categorised into contact points without loan decision-making authority and more independent delegated branches which can make loan decisions. We find that a large and dispersed network of contact points can help increase credit supply and mitigate risks through diversification. Further, banks benefit from the information advantage brought by the presence of delegated branches in local markets. However, the longer distance between headquarters and local delegated branches, the more amplified agency problems become, which outweighs the benefits. Our findings suggest that the optimal structure could be a centralised network of delegated branches combined with a diversified access point network.","Over the past few decades, a trend of bank consolidation has been seen around the world, which has drawn economists’ attention. As a result, there is a large literature investigating the consequences of bank consolidation, such as its impacts on market power, stability, or credit availability. However, the existing literature has not yet accounted for the fact that the effects of consolidation might vary according to the operational and geographical structures of branch networks. For instance, the closure of branches that only provide fee-based services might not necessarily affect a bank’s credit supply to local borrowers. Further, the impacts of the branch closure might be not the same across different geographical markets. It could be also the case that the consequences of the consolidation for centralised banks are different from those for their decentralised counterparts. These issues lead to the question of the banks’ optimal structure in the post-consolidation period.====In this study, we aim to answer that question by employing unique and confidential data about the consolidation of Ukrainian banks from 2008 to 2016. Our data are combined from three different datasets including (1) financial data at the bank level, (2) data on lending at the bank-region level, and (3) data on the consolidation of banks differentiated by branch types and regions. Using these data, we track the changes in the networks of (1) branches having authority to make loan decisions (hereafter delegated branches or decision-making branches) and (2) branches not having decision-making authority (hereafter contact points, access points, or information-collecting branches).====While delegated branches play the role of local decision makers (e.g., loan approvals), overall activities are supervised and managed by bank headquarters which are the central decision makers. Most Ukrainian banks’ headquarters are located in the city of Kyiv, which is also an approximately geographical centre relative to other regions of Ukraine (Fig. 1).==== Taking advantage of this unique setup, we examine the influence on credit supply and risk management of dispersion between the top decision makers (headquarters) and local ones (delegated branches). Data at bank-region level then allow us to assess the consequences for bank lending in local markets if delegated branches are removed. We also investigate the role of access points, branches without decision making power, in facilitating the decision-making process.====We find that banks with a more dispersed network of decision-making branches experience lower levels of bad loans, although the effect is weak. This result suggests that the local decision makers can make use of soft information, which is difficult to transmit to upper levels in overseeing local loan performance. Moreover, a more dispersed network of access points can increase the banks’ geographical reach, and thus, allow them to diversify their loan portfolios. Consequently, banks are able to increase loan origination and lower the levels of non-performing loans.====The analysis of the joint effects of the dispersion of two branch types shows that banks face higher risks if both access points and delegated branches are more dispersed from headquarters. This can be explained by the differences in the impacts of the delegated branch dispersion from the perspectives of headquarters and that of local managers. As mentioned above, the dispersion of delegated branches provides local managers with an information advantage, which is beneficial for risk management. In contrast, from headquarters’ viewpoint, the dispersion can create agency problems such as local managers’ tendency to build “mini-empires”. Further, headquarters’ supervision of local branches is also less effective when the distance between headquarters and local market branches is greater. These issues are then amplified by the dispersion of access points which are also a part of these “mini-empires”. Therefore, to minimise costs while maximising the benefits, banks should opt for a centralised structure of delegated branches, while maintaining a dispersed network of access points.====The examination at the bank-region level shows that the presence of delegated branches correlates positively with the levels of local loans granted. This could be because the authority given to local managers allows greater scope for relationship lending. The result could also reflect overlending due to competition pressure since delegated branches of a bank that are located in the same local market have to compete with each other for resources from head office. Furthermore, a large number of local access points can positively affect loan supply and risk management, which provides additional evidence for the important role of access points.====However, the large local branch networks, as indicated by the higher number of both branch types, provide banks with more market power in the local markets and allow them to cherry pick their clients. As a result, local loan officers can choose high-quality borrowers and reduce loan sizes, resulting in a decline in local loans but lower risks. This “cherry-picking” effect can be facilitated by the more (geographically) diversified information provided by the access points. The importance of access points is confirmed further when we examine the link between the access point network and bank lending (1) when decision making is fully centralised at headquarters and (2) in the presence of an exogenous shock to the Ukrainian banks’ branch networks.====Our study contributes to several strands of literature. The first strand assesses the impact of geographical diversification/dispersion on bank risk and provides mixed results. For example, Deng and Elyasiani (2008) find that geographical diversification can enhance bank value and reduce bank risks through diversifying loan portfolios. In contrast, some other studies find that geographical diversification can increase risks due to a lack of information about new markets and the more complex organisational structure (e.g., Demsetz and Strahan, 1997; Acharya et al., 2006). Despite the inconclusive results on the diversification-risk relationship, one common finding among these studies is that longer distances between headquarters and local branches can negatively affect bank stability via several channels. The first channel is weakened monitoring and amplified agency problems, as longer distances make it more difficult for managers at headquarters to supervise local branch managers (Brickley et al., 2003, Goetz et al., 2013). The second channel is diseconomies of scale. As suggested by Berger et al. (2005), a narrower branch network provides banks with the advantage of using soft information in making loan decisions. Following these studies, we also investigate the link between geographical diversification and bank lending by taking into account the distance between headquarters and local branches. However, our study is distinct in that we differentiate between the dispersion of delegated branches and the dispersion of access points. In addition, we also assess the interplay between the dispersion of two branch types.====The second strand of the literature focuses on delegation in decision-making. Aghion and Tirole (1997) suggest that decentralised structures allow subordinates to participate in institutions and incentivise them to produce better information. On the downside, head offices might lose control over subordinates. Further, centralised decision-making is only optimal if the principals receive relevant and valuable information from their subordinates, and they can verify the quality of information (Dessein, 2002). In a similar vein, Stein (2002) shows that the performance of firms with different decision-making structures depends on the type of information available. If information about a project is soft and not easily transmissible, firms with decentralised decision-making can make better investment decisions. In contrast, the hard and easily transmissible information confers advantages to centralised firms.====Building on the vast theoretical literature, several studies have empirically investigated the issues related to decision-making authority, such as the factors affecting the degree of delegation or the impact of delegation on capital allocation (e.g., Bloom et al., 2012; Graham et al., 2015). Studies on decision-making delegation in the banking context, however, are scarce, possibly due to a lack of data. Closest to our paper is the work by Dlugosz et al. (2018), who examine the effects of local branches’ ability to set their own deposit rates (rate setters) on deposit-taking and loan-making activities. The results show that following the natural disasters, rate setting right allows those branches to increase deposit rates more, hence experience higher level of deposits in the affected markets. Furthermore, banks with rate setters are more likely to expand lending in the affected counties. Our study is different in several ways. First, in the context of Dlugosz et al.’s study (2018), although some branches have ability to set interest rates and some do not, there is no difference in authority to make loan/deposit decisions. In our setting, we are able to differentiate branches with and without authority to decide on loan applications, which offers us insights into the effect of decision-making delegation within a bank. Second, our study does not only examine the impact of decision-making delegation but also examine its impact in relation with banks’ geographical structure.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of the operational and geographical structure of Ukrainian banks. In Section 3, we discuss our empirical specifications and describe the dataset. Section 4 is a discussion of our results. Section 5 gives conclusions.","Branch network structure, authority and lending behaviour",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522001029,8 September 2022,2022,Research Article,6.0

This study investigates the effect of institutional quality on multidimensional financial sector development, and its dimensions, such as, depth, access, and efficiency. We used a panel dataset of 85 emerging and developing economies from 1996 to 2018 for analysis. Our findings based on 2SLS estimation demonstrate that institutional quality has a significant positive effect on the progress of the financial sector, especially its depth, access, and efficiency. The breakdown analysis shows that most of the key components (control of ====, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability) of institutional quality enhance the financial sector development. Our empirical results are robust across alternative measures of institutional quality, split-sample analysis, alternative instrument, and estimator. This paper also offers useful policy implications to the stakeholders in emerging and developing economies.","A well-developed financial system is widely recognized in the economics literature as a precursor of economic growth and progress (Arestis et al., 2015; Beck and Levine, 2004; Levine et al., 2000). Quantifying the impacts of financial sector development (hereafter FSD) on the economy revealed that “world output would rise by 53% by moving all countries to the best financial practices” (Greenwood et al., 2013, p. 208). This reality has fueled academic research about the process and determinants of FSD. Among several other macroeconomic determinants of FSD (see (Voghouei et al., 2011) for various determinants of FSD), institutional quality (hereafter IQ) has resulted in great attention from scholars and policymakers as a key source for FSD.====However, since the seminal studies of La Porta et al., 1997, La Porta et al., 1998 and Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) up till now, our literature review asserts that existing IQ-FSD studies take a unidimensional approach to FSD despite the fact it is a multidimensional process (IMF (Svirydzenka, 2016a). FSD is defined as “====” (IMF (Svirydzenka, 2016a). Similarly, Cihak et al. (2012) articulated that the depth, access, and efficiency of financial institutions and markets are important benchmarks to measure and compare FSD from country to country==== FSD is a multidimensional construct comprising depth, access, and efficiency; each exerts unique effects on economic outcomes (Claessens and Perotti, 2007). Although the multidimensional approach to FSD is referred to in the literature (for example, Canh and Thanh, 2020; Nieminen, 2020) it is, however, lacking in specific IQ-FSD research.====A high developed financial sector provides limited benefits if it is not reachable/accessible by a large number of individuals, groups and businesses. Consequently, even if the financial sector is sufficiently large and has ample breadth or access, its contribution to actual economic growth would be less than meaningful if it is inefficient (IMF Svirydzenka, 2016a). Furthermore, and interestingly enough, the FSD statistics show==== that the performance of financial sectors worldwide in terms of depth, access, and efficiency is not identical. Some relatively less deep financial systems are more broad, accessible and efficient as compared to relatively deeper financial systems.====This gap across various dimensions of FSD is even greater in developing economies which mostly are lagging in FSD compared to more advanced nations (see Fig. 1).====Hence, it is unlikely to assume a homogeneous effect of IQ on depth, access and efficiency. This assumption makes it important to investigate the effects of IQ on holistic FSD and its three dimensions individually, in order to create a comprehensive picture of the IQ-FSD nexus. Doing so will have important policy implications for stakeholders. Particularly, it would be highly instructive for the policymakers in countries that still have underdeveloped financial sectors and seeking an effective source for FSD so that their economies can grow and in a sustainable way.====Given this background, the study adds value to IQ-FSD literature in the following ways. Firstly, unlike prior literature, this study employs a comprehensive index of FSD developed a few years ago by Svirydzenka (2016c)==== which encompasses holistic multidimensional FSD and investigates the effects of IQ on FSD in Emerging and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Although the prior literature has relied upon unidimensional measures of FSD, that offers valuable insights but may not represent the holistic FSD. For this reason, current study paints a relatively broader picture of the IQ-FSD nexus. Secondly, this study is the first which unbundles overall FSD and investigates the effects of IQ on its dimensions—depth, access, and efficiency—separately in a common framework.====In brief, this unique analysis offers comprehensive theoretical and empirical insights about the IQ-FSD nexus to stakeholders and policymakers striving to promote FSD.====This study specifically addresses the following research questions:====Q1- What is the effect of IQ on overall multidimensional FSD in EMDEs?====Q2- What is the effect of IQ on each dimension of FSD—depth, access, and efficiency— in EMDEs?====The rest of the study is structured as follows.

Since our theoretical results hinge on socio-political instability being a function of inflation, we test the prediction that inflation affects socio-political instability positively by using a panel of 156 countries for the 1980–2012 period, and allowing for country and time fixed effects. The results indicate that inflation relates positively with socio-political instability. Policy makers should be cognisant that it is crucial to maintain long-run price stability, as failure to do so may result in high inflation emanating from excessive money supply growth, leading to high (er) socio-political instability, and ultimately, the economy being on a divergent balanced growth path.","This paper develops an overlapping generations (OLG) monetary endogenous growth model characterized by socio-political instability (SPI) to analyse the growth dynamics in the presence of this augmentation. We endogenize growth by allowing for a Romer (1986)-type production function. In our model, money is introduced via a mandatory cash reserve requirement, set and controlled by the government and enforced on banks which operate in a perfectly competitive environment. This treatment of money is standard in literature (See Bittencourt et al. (2014) and Gupta and Stander (2018) and references cited therein).====We define SPI as the fraction of output that is lost due to crime, riots and other disruptive (labour-related) activities, with SPI being a positive function of inequality and negatively related to policing expenditures made by the government (as in Ghate et al. (2003)). In addition, unlike Ghate et al. (2003), we assume that SPI is also a positive function of inflation, as empirically suggested by Paldam (1987), Klomp and de Haan (2009), Blanco and Grier (2009), and indirectly by Aisen and Veiga, 2006, Aisen and Veiga, 2008 (as they control for endogeneity when testing the impact of such instabilities on inflation). The intuition for our ad-hoc representation of SPI is very simple: inflation, emanating from growth in money supply meant to fund government expenditure, depresses the real wage and subsequently leads to strikes/riots/demonstrations. This results in output being lost, not only through the destruction of production, but also in the loss of production since time is now allocated to SPI activities instead of productive activities. Collectively, this is our definition of SPI.====With SPI being a function of inflation, we show that convergent and divergent growth dynamics arise depending on the strength of SPI’s response to inflation, which is however not possible otherwise. In the process, our paper adds to the vast literature of OLG monetary endogenous growth models that analyse growth dynamics (see for example, Gupta and Vermeulen (2010), Gupta (2011) and Gupta and Stander (2018) for detailed discussions in this regard), by introducing an imperfection in the form of SPI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical model that introduces SPI to an OLG monetary endogenous growth model and analyses the growth dynamics that emerge if SPI is a function of inflation. For completeness and to motivate our specification of the SPI, we use a panel of 156 countries for the 1980–2012 period, and test the theoretical prediction that high(er) inflation is related to high(er) socio-political instability. This period captures enough variation in SPI – including the political-regime changes in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and the Arab Spring – inflation and economic activity, which allows us to generalise the results. By allowing for country and time fixed effects, the results indicate that inflation, as predicted by the theoretical model, relates positively to SPI.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines the model’s economic setting, presents our theoretical model with the optimisation solutions and details the growth dynamics.

Does it generate or reduce jobs? According to the current literature, trade openness affects unemployment in a variety of ways. However, the nexus between openness and unemployment is still controversial (Blanchard, 2006, Felbermayr et al., 2011). Trade openness, or free trade, implies both costs and benefits. The advantages include better resource utilization, enhanced commercial activities, technological advancement, and a more effective labor force (Onifade et al., 2020). It boosts domestic producer competitiveness, improves efficiency, and encourages resource allocation (Felbermayr et al., 2011). In addition to these benefits, trade openness has significant downsides, such as the closure of infant industries in the home country, as it cannot cope with low-budget imported products, resulting in higher unemployment (Pierce and Schott, 2016). Furthermore, in a capital-abundant country, trade openness raises the relative return on capital because of the low price of capital-intensive items, which boosts capital demand and thus unemployment (Dutt et al., 2009, Onifade et al., 2020). According to the traditional Heckscher-Ohlin model, trade openness in emerging economies should decrease unemployment. This is due to changes in the industrial structure as a result of trade openness, which raises demand for unskilled labor (which is abundant in underdeveloped economies) while decreasing demand for skilled labor (less abundant in underdeveloped economies).====Public expenditure has a strategic position in the economy, as it is an important tool in public sector policy. Economists believe in the simple impact of expansionary fiscal policy on unemployment in the general theory of employment by Keynes (Feng et al., 2019, Neyapti and Oluk, 2021). Public spending contributes to growth through increasing employment, investment, and profitability (Araga, 2016, Nurudeen and Usman, 2010). It accelerates financial growth, improves infrastructure, and promotes employment opportunities in addition to playing a useful role in reducing income inequality (Mudassar et al., 2013, Sangkuhl, 2015). However, if public expenditure declines, it reduces the production of goods and services, eventually raising unemployment (Saraireh, 2020). The impact of fiscal expansion is strongly dependent on an economy’s specific position, such as whether it is highly indebted. If a country is on the verge of default, greater government spending raises unemployment. Under these conditions, investors will be hesitant to increase production and hire workers (Feld, 2017). Foreign direct investment (FDI) is another indicator of unemployment that has effects similar to those of trade openness. It not only transfers funds but also has many other advantages, such as the transfer of technology, the use of new labor, and managerial capabilities (Balcerzak and Zurek, 2011, Wang et al., 2021). At the same time, FDI can also negatively affect the economy when foreign investors influence local producers, monopolize the market, and introduce more foreign workers, causing an increase in unemployment in the host country (Ali and Nazar, 2017).====Institutional performance also affects the unemployment rate in different ways. Institutions influence the factors of production and boost productivity by adjusting the allocation of skilled workers, thus lowering unemployment (Agovino et al., 2019, Samargandi et al., 2020). Another less clear mechanism by which institutions operate is the scale of the informal sector: weak institutions, including strict business laws, enforcement of rigidities<pls clarify> on businesses, enable them to work in informal (gray) sectors (Dietrich and Möller, 2016, Kutan et al., 2017). Countries with a strong informal sector have a high unemployment rate and slow growth (Agovino et al., 2019, Lim, 2019). The high degree of corruption and abuse of public funds is a critical problem in underdeveloped countries, which contribute to low-quality government investment and dampened private human and physical investments, and eventually leads to low economic growth and high unemployment (Lim, 2019, Saha et al., 2021). Institutional success is also connected with industrial growth, technological investment, and outstanding firm performance, all of which reduce unemployment by increasing demand for labor (Commander and Svejnar, 2011, Ilyas and Khan, 2019). Institutional quality in terms of property rights, the rule of law, and corruption control help generate higher per capita income (Acemoğlu et al., 2005).====The membership of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) consists of 57 economies with majority-Muslim populations, comprising one-fourth of the global population; their unemployment rate is higher than the world average and the rate in non-OIC underdeveloped economies, 6–8% in the past three decades (OIC Economic Outlook, 2019). In 2018, the unemployment rate in OIC countries among young people of working age is 13.10 %, which is higher than the overall unemployment rate (as shown in Table 2) and the rate in non-OIC developing economies (12.18 %) and the world average (11.36 %) (OIC Economic Outlook, 2019). Higher-income (oil-exporting) OIC countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman have higher unemployment than lower-income (oil-importing) OIC countries, due to their specific economic conditions. As of 2018, average labor productivity was US$2800 in OIC economies compared with US$9000 in non-OIC developed economies. This shows that in OIC economies, only 29.6 % of production is generated by workers, less than their counterparts in non-OIC developed economies (OIC Economic Outlook, 2019). Table 1 shows that from 1990 to 2018 the institutional performance index in OIC countries overall is below the world average. These conditions are among the most important concerns for policy makers and economists in the OIC economies.====Although the effect of trade openness, public expenditure, and institutional performance on unemployment in different countries have been analyzed in prior papers, only limited research is available on the OIC economies (Ebaidalla, 2016). Hence, our paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, this is the first study that demonstrates the association between the aforementioned variables by dividing OIC countries into different groups, that is: overall, lower-income, and higher-income countries. Second, unlike previous empirical research, we use the new method called DCCE, which can deal with the heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence (CD) in panel data. Third, in prior studies, the conventional proxy was used to represent trade openness, calculated as imports plus exports divided by the gross domestic product (GDP) (all in nominal values). However, in this study, the real value of trade openness is used to consider each country’s purchasing power, which is calculated by the volume of imports, exports, and GDP (all in constant 2010 US dollars). Various proxies for openness, that is, imports plus exports as a percentage of GDP, exports as a percentage of GDP, imports as a percentage of GDP, and tariff rates, are used to check the robustness of the findings. Fourth, rather than looking at overall unemployment, we analyze the impact of our explanatory variables on youth unemployment.====The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 defines the data and econometric technique. Section 4 contains the results and a discussion. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the study and makes some policy recommendations.","How do trade openness, public expenditure and institutional performance affect unemployment in OIC countries?

(2021). Bank Entry Barriers and Firms' Risk Taking. Fox School of Business Research Paper(17–024)., Jiang et al., 2020).==== The insights from these studies indicate a potential—negative or otherwise—share of the bank market structure in economic/financial fluctuations. However, empirical evidence of the potential effects of bank competition on macroeconomic stability is almost non-existent.====Macroeconomic stability is an important aspect of an economic system that distinguishes developed economies from underdeveloped ones and has important implications for output growth, employment, and future consumption (Ramey and Ramey, 1995, Loayza et al., 2007, Dabusinskas et al., 2013, Guresci, 2018). Moreover, at the micro level, economic stability affects private investment, cost of capital, asset prices, and firm growth (Aizenman and Marion, 1999, Chong and Gradstein, 2009, Bansal et al., 2014). Accordingly, from a macro or micro perspective, the implications of the bank competition for macroeconomic stability are important to understand. Although few studies separately evaluate the linkages between bank competition, financial deepening, economic/financial stability, and corporate risk (Basu, S., Kaviani, M., and Maleki, H. (2021). Bank Entry Barriers and Firms' Risk Taking. Fox School of Business Research Paper(17–024)., Fernández et al., 2016, Jiang et al., 2020, Sahay et al., 2015), we did not find any specific literature related to the impact of bank competition on macroeconomic stability.====Theoretically, bank competition can positively or negatively affect economic and financial stability. For instance, lower interest rates in the competitive banking sector help corporations overcome their financing constraints (Jayaratne and Strahan, 1996, Jayaratne and Strahan, 1998, Dick, 2006). Unavailability of low-cost financing would otherwise lead firms to lose profitable projects. Thus, the smooth functioning of the corporate sector translates into stable economic output. By contrast, banks may lose their net worth in a highly competitive banking sector. This situation incentivises moral hazard and induces banks to extend risky loans at higher interest rates. The borrowing firms follow uncertain projects to compensate for the higher cost of capital (Keeley, 1990, Hellmann et al., 2000, Stiroh, 2004). Consequently, risky loans (by banks) and investments (by firms) can translate into financial and economic instability. To summarise, the literature on competition-macroeconomic stability is non-existent, and theoretical predictions are indefinite. Thus, the potential effect of bank competition on macroeconomic stability remains an empirical paradox.====In this study, we analyse the impact of bank competition on macroeconomic stability, and the interaction of financial development. Macroeconomic stability is categorised into economic and financial stability. We calculate economic stability through the volatility of actual and unexpected output growth, and financial stability through the aggregate Z-score and volatility of the private credit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. The level of bank competition is measured using the CR3, HHI, Lerner index, and Boone indicator. The analysis is conducted using a two-step dynamic panel system GMM on country-level data from 48 developing nations from 1999 to 2018. This study contributes to the literature in several ways. It explores the much neglected yet extremely pertinent role of bank competition in macroeconomic stability, which is a prime policy concern because of its direct linkage with output growth, employment, and future consumption. The structure of the banking sector is also an important policy concern given its pivotal role in the real economy, such as stimulating economic growth, creating new enterprises, spurring technological innovations, facilitating financial stability, and managing corporate risk. This study provides policy inputs by analysing the role of bank competition in macroeconomic stability.====In this context, our study is related to those of Sahay et al. (2015), Fernández et al. (2016), and Jiang et al. (2020). For instance, Sahay et al. (2015) construct a comprehensive financial development index employing two financial sector aspects: financial institutions and financial markets. The development level is gauged using three dimensions—access, depth, and efficiency—for financial institutions and markets, separately.==== The study then relates the financial development indicators to economic growth, economic stability, and financial stability and finds a bell-shaped relationship between financial development and economic growth, economic stability, and financial stability. Further investigation reveals that financial deepening is responsible for the negative relationship at a higher level of financial development. Similarly, Fernández et al. (2016) analyse the impact of financial and economic stability using industry-level data for a sample of 110 countries and find that bank stability lowers industrial volatility. This effect is stronger in economies with more developed financial and less competitive banking systems. Although Sahay et al. (2015) and Fernández et al. (2016) do not analyse the impact of bank competition on stability, as we do in this study, their use of variables such as financial development and economic and financial stability is relevant to this paper. A recent study by Jiang et al. (2020) identifies the effect of bank competition on corporate risk for a sample of US firms and finds that bank competition significantly reduces corporate risk. This relationship is more pronounced for firms that depend more on bank finance. The study by Jiang et al. (2020) is relevant to our study because it relates bank competition to firms' earnings volatility, which can translate into economic fluctuations at the aggregate level.====Our study employs a broader measure of macroeconomic volatility that encompasses both financial and real aspects of the economy. A few other studies exploring the role of bank competition in financial stability ignore the real part—economic stability. A unique aspect of this study is the application of unexpected volatility in the competition-stability relationship. Our analysis also considers the financial development interplay, which has been found to affect economic and financial stability.====The results reveal a bell-shaped relationship between bank competition and macroeconomic stability measures. The findings suggest that a higher level of bank competition promotes macroeconomic stability by reducing output growth volatility, fluctuations in private credit, and the probability of bank default. Nonetheless, an optimal level of bank competition seems to exist, beyond which it may undermine economic and financial stability. Further, financial development contributes to the positive impact of bank competition on macroeconomic stability.====The rest of the paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 discusses the data, variable construction, and estimation method; Section 3 reports the estimation results and their discussion; and Section 4 concludes the study, highlighting the policy implications.","Bank competition, financial development and macroeconomic stability: Empirical evidence from emerging economies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093936252200084X,22 August 2022,2022,Research Article,10.0

To deeply explore the influence of ==== reductions on ,"In its new stage of economic development, China must implement reforms to upgrade the quality, efficiency and drivers of its economy to shift from an extensive to an intensive mode of development and pursue high-quality economic development. The State Council of China has repeatedly emphasized the need for policies to increase total factor productivity (TFP) since 2015. A report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China noted that ""quality must be put first, performance given priority, and total factor productivity must be increased"". TFP has become a key indicator to measure economic transformation and development quality. TFP has made a substantial contribution to Chinese economic growth (e.g., Li, 2009; Dai and Cheng, 2019). Given the current economic slowdown in China, improving TFP is the focus of economic development. TFP is an important lever to increase firm competitiveness and change the intensity of the production mode. Guidance from the central government to promote a shift from extensive to intensive factor use has defined the direction of China's current development mode. In recent years, the international trade environment has deteriorated, foreign markets have shrunk, and to support firms’ continued development and transformation of their production mode, calls have been made for new fiscal and taxation policies. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the global economy in 2020, causing a sharp increase in the burden on businesses. China has cut taxes and fees on a large scale since 2018 to ease the burden on firms and boost their quality and efficiency. Taxation policy has an important influence on firm growth. It is an important policy tool for government intervention in the market, the remediation of market failure, and the promotion of firm development. Therefore, to the extent that tax policies influence firms’ development mode, improving their TFP and thus promoting the shift to a high-quality development mode throughout the national economy is worth our scientific and detailed evaluation.====TFP measures input–output efficiency and describes the mode of economic development. Improving TFP is an important path for China to achieve higher quality and more efficient and sustainable economic development (e.g., Cai, 2013). Tax incentives are an important tool for the government to promote industrial transformation and firm technological upgrades (e.g., Wu, 2005). Fixed assets account for a large proportion of corporate assets, so a policy of reducing taxes on fixed assets is an important tax policy in China. Investment-driven accelerated fixed asset depreciation policy encourages firms to develop and use more advanced technology. Innovation in technology contributes to the improvement of enterprises' TFP (e.g., Comin and Hobijn, 2010). Despite this positive logical relationship between depreciation policy and enterprises' TFP (e.g., Li and Zhao, 2021), there is little literature on the impact of depreciation policy on output.====To fill this gap in the literature, this study systematically and comprehensively analyzes the six pilot industries that were impacted by the new accelerated depreciation policy in 2014 and the four key industries to which the policy was expanded in 2015 to identify its impact on corporate TFP. It also explores the mechanism driving its impact and analyzes the heterogeneity of its effects across firms with different characteristics. From the perspective of firms, this article examines how the macro tax reduction policy achieves the expected policy effect through microlevel responses. Thus, this study provides a critical policy reference on how to effectively use tax reduction incentives to promote an intensive development mode.====The remainder of this article proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the literature.

Our results argue for the independence of these two branches from the executive, especially the judiciary.","Separation of powers is a fundamental principle of democracy, and as an institutional factor, it is likely to affect the structural transformation of developing economies. Structural transformation means a reallocation of the economy's resources from low productivity sectors to high productivity sectors. McMillan et al., 2014, McMillan et al., 2017 suggest that it should be understood in terms of its two components: intra-industry or fundamentals and structural change. The intra-industry component shows the ability of each sector to generate internal productivity. This can come about through capital accumulation, technological change or the reduction of misallocation between firms. Structural change, on the other hand, expresses the diffusion of productivity to the whole economy through the reallocation of labor from one sector to another; specifically, from low productivity sectors to high productivity sectors. This increases overall labor productivity in the economy (McMillan et al., 2017). These two components of structural transformation are most often determined using the Fabricant (1942) decomposition. Structural transformation is therefore a necessity for developing countries and particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as it helps generate sufficient productive and decent jobs, reduce poverty and inequality, sustain economic growth and thus promote development (AfDB, 2020; UNECA, 2016).====Neoclassical economics has generally conceded the main role of the market in the accumulation of wealth and the development process, thus relegating to the background the place of institutions, i.e. the set of formal and informal norms or socio-political structures, as established by laws or customs. Coase (1937) was one of the first authors to take institutions into account in his analyses and to show that they affect the functioning of firms and their economic performance. Institutional and political factors are now seen as the main explanatory variables of productivity and economic development. Thus, a vast literature examining the effects of institutions on economic development has emerged. North (1990) focused on political regimes and showed that democracy is an important factor in development, while Easterly (2001) went further and pointed out that these institutional factors also help explain the backwardness of underdeveloped economies.====Since democracy is a complex and difficult-to-measure phenomenon, many authors construct composite indicators of democracy in order to take into account almost all its aspects (Gründler and Krieger, 2016, Gründler and Krieger, 2015b). However, this approach has not led to a consensus result in the economic community. The existing literature generally on the relationship between democracy and economic growth produces contrasting results. On the one hand, some authors find a positive effect of democracy (Kpegli and Bator, 2019, Acemoglu et al., 2018, Ben Doudou and Rahali, 2018, Gründler and Krieger, 2015a, Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008), while on the other hand, authors obtain a negative, ambiguous or no effect (Boll and Sidki, 2021, Gandjon Fankem, G. S, 2018, Alakbarov and Bayar, 2018). These results are mixed although the most common measures of democracy cover several dimensions of democracy such as clarity, participation and competition in the electoral process (Dahl, 2008, Dahl, 1998), human rights and social inequality (Rawls, 1999), political rights and civil liberty (Gandjon Fankem, G. S, 2018, Knutsen and Wig, 2015, Knutsen, 2012, Bollen, 1990).====However, a fringe of authors consider that it is better to take each aspect of democracy differently. The advantage of the latter option is that it allows for the identification of the most relevant aspects in relation to the context. Several aspects of democracy have been discussed; they generally relate to the mechanisms of power acquisition, power control and power exercise (Dahl, 1998, Dahl, 2008). The most recurrent ones, especially in developing countries, are the alternation of power and the separation of democratic powers in their exercise. Political alternation is usually expressed either in rotation of the head of the executive or in rotation of the composition of the parliamentary majority (Lodge, 2013). But Fosu (2008) recognizes that this aspect of democracy is problematic because developing countries, particularly those in SSA, are generally characterized by the permanence of the head of the executive and the party with the majority in parliament. In this case, it is appropriate to turn to the second equally important aspect of democracy, the separation of powers, as this is a pillar of democracy without which the democratic game cannot be played in a healthy way in order to bear fruit in terms of economic outcomes (van Aaken et al., 2010, Feld and Voigt, 2003).====The consideration of the separation of powers has been the subject of much work. Van Aaken et al. (2010) show that the independence of powers greatly reduces the corruption of public officials, which can constrain the functioning of private agents in the economy. However, it is possible that this independence of powers is very significantly and robustly correlated with a country's growth or level of per capita income (Voigt et al., 2015). Similarly, for Feld and Voigt (2003), rational politicians are interested in judicial independence (IJ) in order to make their promises credible. However, politicians whose preferences may be at odds with those of the judiciary have an incentive to challenge judicial independence. These authors test whether IJ affects economic growth for a sample of 57 countries and find that the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is positively affected by IJ. Indeed, the separation of powers is an instrument to fight corruption and reduces the costs of fighting collusion (Laffont and Meleu, 2001). Similarly, according to Voigt and Gutmann (2013), an independent judiciary is interpreted as a tool for governments to credibly commit to the law and secure contracts. They argue that the near-universal view that precisely defined and reliably enforced property rights are generally conducive to economic growth is more complex than previously recognized. Indeed, property rights reforms may not, for example, in themselves lead to increases in observed growth rates if they are based on mere promises that do not guarantee any measures to secure property rights. However, the establishment of a mechanism to secure contracts requires a cost; this is why the independence of powers varies with the level of development and the value of this conception of democracy is higher in developing countries, even if the reasons for this higher value also increase the cost of implementing this institution (Laffont and Meleu, 2001).====The empirical literature remains almost silent on the analysis of the effects of the separation of powers on structural transformation. This analysis of the effects of the separation of powers on structural transformation is based on the framework of neo-institutional economic theory. There are two main criticisms of this literature. Firstly, the vast majority of the literature generally emphasizes the effects of the separation of powers on economic growth. However, recent studies show that economic growth does not necessarily bring about structural transformation. This is particularly true of the growth experienced by SSA for more than two decades, which does not bring about structural transformation (AfDB, 2020, Cadot et al., 2016, Cadot and Melo, 2016). Secondly, taking into account the structure of economies rather than growth is necessary insofar as a large part of the growth of these countries comes from the sometimes abusive exploitation of natural resources (Fosu, 2010). Thus, taking into account the separation of powers in the explanation of structural transformation is necessary to assess the effects of the separation of powers on the long-term development of sub-Saharan economies.====The objective of this paper is thus to investigate the effects of the separation of powers on structural transformation in SSA. The contribution of this paper lies particularly in highlighting the effects of separation of powers on structural transformation in SSA, an aspect that remains poorly understood in the literature. The paper has a threefold interest; firstly, it positions the separation of powers at the heart of development policies and the democratic process. Indeed, the idea that the benevolent dictator is a facilitator of economic growth remains widespread in the economic literature (Easterly, 2011). Autocratic leaders are often credited with achieving good economic results. The recent success of Asian economies, it is argued, is partly explained by the presence of benevolent dictators, in contrast to African economies whose economic growth is held back by malevolent dictators. However, recent literature increasingly casts serious doubt on the benevolent autocrat hypothesis. The recent empirical literature arrives at least three important results. Firstly, the positive effect of the autocratic leader on growth occurs only in isolation; in general, economic growth is found to be lower under autocracy. Secondly, when autocratic leaders are compared to leaders of more democratic regimes, the positive effect of autocratic leaders on growth is rare and marginal. Thirdly, positive-growth autocrats are rare, and sometimes even rarer, while negative-growth autocrats abound (Acemoglu et al., 2014; Madsen et al., 2015; Easterly and Pennings, 2017; Rizioa and Skali, 2020). The fragility of the benevolent dictator hypothesis, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, justifies the push for democracy as an engine for economic growth. In this context, the separation of powers, an important modality of democracy, becomes an important lever for better economic performance. Secondly, this article fills the gap in the empirical literature on the role of the separation of powers as a determinant of structural transformation, an aspect still unexplored in the literature. Finally, it supports the idea that structural transformation, which is essential for the economic development of sub-Saharan economies, cannot be achieved without improving political institutions.====The remainder of this paper is presented as follows: Section 2 outlines the evolution of democratic separation of powers and structural transformation in sub-Saharan Africa, Section 3 specifies the methodology adopted, Section 4 presents and discusses the results obtained and Section 5 concludes.",The role of the separation of democratic powers on structural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000838,18 August 2022,2022,Research Article,12.0

We find that the threshold level of FDI inflows per person is approximately US$ 44.67 per annum. For FDI to have an appreciable impact on economic growth, countries must have minimum capacity to absorb the growth-enhancing benefits of FDI. For instance, the technology gap between the hosted foreign enterprises and domestic enterprises should be no less than 0.6904. Thus, achieving the FDI threshold level is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for economic growth. Some countries use tax incentives to improve FDI inflows. We argue that such incentives may be counterproductive at low levels of FDI inflows: FDI coefficient estimates below the lowest threshold level are negative, implying that the higher costs of such incentives exceed the potential benefits availed by FDI’s direct contribution to economic output and ====.",None,Foreign direct investment and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: A nonlinear analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000656,17 August 2022,2022,Research Article,13.0

Results suggest that institutional quality largely drives innovation performance across provinces, and to some extent it contributes to explain the great North-South Italian divide in terms of innovation. The findings are robust to the inclusion of spatial ==== and to the control of potential endogeneity. Moreover, we find uneven effects for different levels of institutional quality and for its distinct pillars. These results can be useful for the design of more specific innovation policies.","Innovation is a fundamental driver for regional development and, accordingly, it appears as an important element in the European Union regional agenda in the attempt to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (European Commission, 2012). More particularly, innovation can help societies to overcome some of the current challenges, including the creation of better jobs, the increase of regional competitiveness in the global markets, the fight against the climate change, or the improvement of quality of life. In that regard, innovation policy should be ultimately the responsible for creating an appropriate framework able to transfer ideas to the market (European Commission, 2012). The recent economic recession also shows that more innovative regions are more resistant and recover better from negative shocks, as they take advantage of the positive spillover effects from neighboring regions (Martini, 2020).====Nonetheless, despite the increased efforts in the promotion of regional innovation, the success has been uneven across regions. Some likely explanations are the heterogeneity in terms of technology (Greunz, 2003), human capital endowment (Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi, 2008, Sterlacchini, 2008) and geographical conditions (Moreno et al., 2005). Apart from these factors, more recent research points to institutional quality as a key element behind regional disparities in innovative performance (Rodríguez-Pose and Di Cataldo, 2015). Institutions encompass different aspects of economic, legal, political, and social activity, and institutional change matters for the economic trajectories of countries and regions (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012, Ketterer and Rodríguez-Pose, 2019).====Several initiatives have dealt with the institutions-innovation link at the country level (Canh et al., 2019, d’Agostino and Scarlato, 2019, John, 2017, Tebaldi and Elmslie, 2013, van Waarden, 2001, Varsakelis, 2006, Wang, 2013). However, due to the increased recognition of the regional dimension in national innovation strategies (see, for instance, European Commission, 2012; OECD, 2011), the attention of researchers to the sub-national level and to the way local institutions may affect innovation performance has increased. Indeed, evidence shows that the facilitation in the transmission of knowledge between businesses, universities and other innovation actors and the responsibility for promoting innovation-enhancing measures to create linkages among these actors is increasingly borne by sub-national administrations (Rodríguez-Pose and Di Cataldo, 2015). Accordingly, and considering the European context, several studies have focused on regions, dealing with innovation and its links with both formal (Rodríguez-Pose and Di Cataldo, 2015) and some types of informal institutions such as social capital (Peiró-Palomino, 2019a).====In contrast to the above-mentioned papers mostly based on transnational samples, this study analyzes in detail the Italian case, a country characterized by huge differences in the quality of institutions at the subnational level, particularly between the Northern-Center and Southern territories.==== Charron and Lapuente (2013) conclude that these patterns can be explained by historical factors. More specifically, a major determinant is the consolidation of clientelistic networks in regions where rulers have historically less constraints to make their decisions. These patterns were much more intense in the Southern European bureaucracies and have persisted for centuries (Sotiropoulos, 2006). In addition, such disparities can be also explained by other factors with long-lasting effects such as social trust and economic inequalities (Charron and Lapuente, 2013). For the Italian case, Di Liberto and Sideri (2015) argue that before the Italian unification process, the pre-existent independent states were organized in a very different way. The unification process did not eliminate the previous administrative practices; public sector employees were kept and became the new bureaucrats who were reluctant to changes. Moreover, the subsequent selection and training of new bureaucrats were based on seniority rather than merit, favoring perpetuity, and then territorial differences in institutional quality have persisted until nowadays.====The implications of these long-lasting disparities are noticeable. For instance, the quality of public services and the policies formulated and implemented by governments in the Southern provinces is 50% lower compared to the quality of the governments in the rest of the country, and 46% lower when measuring the quality of exchanges between local agents (Nifo and Vecchione, 2014). The quality of Italian institutions markedly differs even within NUTS-2 regions, i.e., across NUTS-3 provinces within the same region.====For the Italian subnational context, institutional quality differences have been linked to economic growth (Di Liberto and Sideri, 2015, Di Vita, 2018), firm and TFP productivity (Byrne et al., 2009, Lasagni et al., 2015), foreign direct investment (Daniele and Marani, 2011), skilled migration (Nifo and Vecchione, 2014), labor market participation (Agovino et al., 2019), well-being inequalities (Ferrara and Nisticò, 2019), or the effectiveness of spending for public works (Albanese et al., 2019). However, our knowledge on how institutional quality affects innovation performance at the Italian NUTS-3 provincial level is still limited.====As already commented, disparities in institutional quality take place beyond the regional NUTS-2 level. However, the analysis of the lower geographical layers (NUTS-3 provinces) is particularly challenging. While the database REGPAT, part of the European Patent Office (EPO), provides information for patenting activity for this highly disaggregated level, which is our variable used to measure innovation at the province level, information on quality of government for NUTS-3 regions is restricted to very few countries and elaborated by national initiatives.==== This latter information is available for Italy. Nifo and Vecchione (2014) developed an index of government quality for the NUTS-3 units and for the period 2004–2012, which is our sample.====Despite provinces have a limited importance in the Italian administrative structure, the analysis at this territorial level is still interesting because provinces are responsible for implementing decentralized policies in relevant sectors such as health, education, transport, culture, energy policy and environmental protection (Calcagnini and Perugini, 2019, Di Liberto and Sideri, 2015, Veneri and Murtin, 2016). These sectors are functional in promoting and sustaining the economic environment and in creating the necessary conditions for firms, universities and business actors to implement innovation activities (Fiore et al., 2011).====Moreover, over the last two decades the regional dimension of innovation policy has become increasingly relevant in Italy. Indeed, with the constitutional reform of 2001 regions were conferred several competencies related to enterprise and innovation policy, based on the idea that peripheral governments might respond to local needs better than the central government. Some analyses, including Caloffi and Bellandi (2017) and Caloffi and Mariani (2018), reveal that governments with higher institutional quality have more proactive policy mixes in favor of innovation. Other studies also show that the institutions–innovation link can be explained by the capability of regional authorities or their need to spend public funds on innovation (Arbolino and Boffardi, 2017, Milio, 2007, Trigilia, 2011). High quality governments adopted a proactive role in implementing policies to support R&D and innovation projects, while regions with a low quality of government, mostly Southern regions, were more conservative (Caloffi and Bellandi, 2017). ‬‬‬‬‬‬Institutional quality can well condition the capacity of local territories to obtain these funds and their appropriate use. In particular, the Southern Italian regions had a greater need to spend on innovation but they were less capable to absorb and spend public funds devoted to innovation support than the more innovative Central and Northern regions (Milio, 2007, Rodríguez-Pose and Di Cataldo, 2015, Trigilia, 2011). There is also evidence that the amount of EU structural funds devoted to R&D are geographically concentrated within the same region (D’Adda et al., 2021), and that in some regions, previous experiences in innovation policy or the quality of accumulated know-how in the administrative structures have influenced the way funds were allocated (Bellini et al., 2021), thus leading to high within region variation also in terms of innovation performance.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬====While these studies focused on the regional level, the capacity and ability to implement efficient innovation policy extend to the province level. The quality of provincial institutions may indeed impact on the type of innovation policies and instruments that contribute to create an environment where innovation knowledge flows among economic agents. Also, local institutions may also promote policies to favor the constitutions of those entities such as technology districts, innovative start-ups and academic spin-offs, where innovation ideas start and develop, but also policies to promote collaboration activities with local universities and research centers (Bolzani et al., 2014). For instance, previous studies show that Southern provinces have comparatively more technology districts, but they are smaller, poorly sectoral diversified and far from the economic structure of the area (Bertamino et al., 2017).====Moreover, the quality of local institutions may impact on their capacity to coordinate across the different levels of government (national, regional, local) and to promote the conditions for fostering innovation activities. For instance, policies on land-use, environment protection, transportation and housing may be designed and implemented in different ways within the same province (Veneri and Murtin, 2016).====After this introduction, the next section reviews the links between institutional quality and innovation.

This paper exploits the latest rounds of the EBRD-World Bank Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) and the Mongolian National Statistics Office Household Socio-Economic Survey (HSES) to examine the correlation between the presence of children of different age categories in a family and female employment in Mongolia in 2016. We examine the availability of childcare, social norms and attitudes towards women, as well as household decision-making as potential explanations. We find that small children decrease the probability of female employment relative to women with no small children. In particular, women with two children aged one to six years are 21.5 percentage points less likely to be employed. Our results also suggest that cultural biases against women may be at least partially responsible for the low female employment levels we uncovered. These results are unlikely to be driven by omitted variable bias.","A large body of literature has confirmed that gender inequality in employment has strong negative effects on GDP growth. Multiple studies show that gender-related barriers to employment impose a significant tax on female labor, and that closing this gender gap could increase GDP by an average of 35% (Klasen and Lamanna, 2009, Elborgh-Woytek et al., 2013Elborgh-Woytek, Katrin , Monique Newiak , Kalpana Kochnar , Stefania Fabrizio , Kangni Kpodar , Philippe Wingender , Benedict Clements and Gerd Schwartz . Women, work and the economy: macroeconomic gains from gender equity. IMF Staff Discussion Note, 2013., Ostry et al., 2018Ostry, Jonathan David, Jorge Alvarez, Raphael A. Espinoza , and Chris Papageorgiou . Economic Gains From Gender Inclusion: New Mechanisms, New Evidence. International Monetary Fund working paper, 2018.). A widely accepted hypothesis relates gender-based discrimination in the labor market to the presence of children in the household (Hersch, 2006, Neumark and McLennan, 1995). But how does motherhood affect female wages and employment? One strand of the scholarship argues that the relationship is negative. For instance, research from industrialized countries shows that following childbirth, the (long-run) gender gap in income and wages increases significantly and is driven by hours worked, participation and wage rates (Angelov et al., 2016, Kleven et al., 2019, Bertrand et al., 2010). However, another strand of the literature concludes that fertility does not affect female employment. Various studies (using a broad sample of developing and (a few) transition countries) find no relationship between having children and female labor force participation (Aguero and Marks, 2008; Aaronson et al., 2017; Heath, 2017).====It is unclear, however, if the conclusions from this literature can be directly applicable to countries in the post-communist region.==== The shock of socialism rapidly increased female labor force participation in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, an effect that persists – to varying degrees in different countries – until today. Communist countries promoted an ideology of gender equality, also reflected in legal changes, universal schooling, and policies to promote the compatibility of employment with having small children. Increased labor demand due to wide-spread inefficiencies also encouraged more women to join the labor force (Klasen, 2019). Nevertheless, given the lower quality of legal institutions in many transition countries, the negative effect of motherhood on female employment and earnings may be even stronger compared to that in rich countries.====The case of Mongolia not only poses a major gap in the literature, but is also particularly interesting and relevant for the following five reasons. First, Mongolia has been undergoing rapid economic growth driven by a dramatic expansion of mining activities and the exploitation of natural resources supported by public spending (Locatelli, 2019). Second, Mongolia has relatively low labor force participation rates as well as historically strong informal and animal husbandry sectors, and few high-productivity jobs compared to other transition economies. Unemployment rates are also relatively low (Shatz et al., 2015). Third, despite the well-documented progress with regards to gender-related issues, such as in the spheres of health and education, significant gender inequality persists in the labor market. In fact, women ought to be experiencing a favorable gender gap if returns to education were equal for men and women, given that on average women are better educated (Pastore, 2010, World Bank). Moreover, compared to similar economies in the region, there is a larger share of women in Mongolia carrying out unpaid work and very few women are self-employed (World Bank, 2013). Fourth, the mechanisms behind the persisting disparities and gender asymmetries in Mongolia have not been sufficiently studied. As a result, little empirical evidence exists on the nexus between the labor market and cultural norms that affect gender roles, household decision-making and attitudes towards women. Fifth, in the absence of data and quantitative analyses, the design of effective policies addressing the aforementioned issues is challenging. Considering that the only existing studies on this topic draw from survey data collected in 2002–2009, the analysis of more recent data presents a unique opportunity to inform academics and policymakers alike (Dandarchuluun and Choi, 2019, Pastore, 2010, World Bank).====Using the latest round of the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS), a nationally representative household, attitudes and values survey jointly administered by the EBRD and the World Bank, we investigate the relationship between female employment, the number of children in a household, household decision-making and attitudes towards women in Mongolia in 2016. We also replicate the analyses using the first round of the LiTS, conducted in 2006. For further robustness, we replicate our employment analysis using the 2016 wave of the Household Socio-Economic Survey (HSES) collected by the Mongolian National Statistics Office. The HSES covers significantly more households (16,500 compared to 1500 in the LiTS) and is representative on a lower administrative level, but does not include any data on social norms.====The analyses based on the 2016 LiTS and HSES data show that while the presence of older children (aged 6–17) has no effect on female employment, having young children (aged 0–1 and 1–6) decreases female employment significantly. The presence of household members who are elderly or have disabilities is not correlated with women’s employment, which suggests it is caring for small children that is depressing female employment.====Of course, an important question is whether women’s income and wage levels also followed a similar trend. Unfortunately, this is a question that we cannot fully answer, since information on employment income in the LiTS is only available for 802 out of 3000 respondents (of which 1303 respondents indicated that they worked for income in the past 12 months), which limits the relevant sample considerably. In addition, respondents are asked to report net income (per pay period), which likely introduces significant measurement errors in the responses.====We then delve into some of the reasons behind why women with small children may work less. Recent data show that only 33.8% of children under age 7 attend daycare (either public or private), suggesting that the availability, take-up and/or quality of daycare in Mongolia may be an issue. Likewise, women with small children (1−6) have less bargaining power regarding their social life compared to women without small children. At the same time, attitudes towards women are not always welcoming. For example, men hold less liberal views when it comes to the role of women as business executives.====An important caveat is that the LiTS is ==== an individual panel. As a result, we are unable to account for fixed unobservable characteristics at the individual level (such as ability, ambition or charisma), or time-varying characteristics (such as attitudes towards work) that may drive both the decision to have children and to enter and stay in the labor market (Clarke, 2018). The literature has developed a variety of instruments to deal with these issues, but unfortunately we are unable to adopt them due to the lack of data in the LiTS.==== This means that all effects identified in this paper should be interpreted as correlations only.====Another caveat of the LiTS data is that it does not allow the direct identification of the household head, since the primary and secondary respondents were randomly selected adults of the opposite gender. Therefore, the LiTS regressions provide information on the relationship between the presence of children in a household and the employment probabilities of female household members, including non-mothers. To approximate the likelihood of the respondents being the parents of the children in the survey, we run the regressions on a limited sample in which we exclude any underage household members who are not children of the household head.====To minimize the confounding effects of unobservables and reverse causality, we adopt two strategies. To account for the fact that employment patterns (for both women and men) may be driven by regional factors, such as industrial concentration or geographic suitability for agriculture, we include dummies at the level of sub-national regions. In addition, we control for a battery of individual-level characteristics that are likely correlated with unobserved characteristics, such as the respondent’s education, their father’s education, health, household income, household size, age, urban residence and marital status (the latter variable is only available in 2016). However, some of the control variables are endogenous, and there is the possibility of selection due to missing observations. What is more, it is unlikely that controlling for observables will completely eliminate the problem of omitted variable bias.====Therefore, we adopt a second strategy. We apply the insight of Oster (2019) to understand what the impact of unobservables has to be in order to explain away the results in the LiTS data. We find that unobservables would have to be between 1.3 and 16.4 times more important than observables (and their impact on the dependent variable would have to be in the opposite direction) to explain away the negative coefficient of presence of small children on female employment in 2016. This is unlikely, suggesting that even in the light of remaining omitted variable bias, the results still stand.====The paper contributes to a growing and important literature linking motherhood and female labor outcomes around the world (in developed countries, in addition to the references above, see also Addabbo et al., 2015; Kuziemko et al., 2018; Gallen, 2018, and Correll et al., 2007; in transition countries, see Ganguli et al., 2014, and Nizalova et al., 2016). It also complements research showing that excluding women from the labor force affects economic performance negatively (see, for instance, Lagarde and Jonathan, 2018, for an overview). We discuss the implications of this paper in more detail for the broader debate on gender equality and economic growth in the conclusion, where we also elaborate on how the research findings may be applicable beyond the Mongolian context.",Children and female employment in Mongolia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000814,9 August 2022,2022,Research Article,15.0

The findings of our study highlight the importance of considering the differential welfare impacts of different forms of capital inflows while implementing capital account liberalization.,"Since the 1990s, foreign capital inflows have become a significant source of investment for developing countries. Efforts by the developing countries to liberalize capital accounts and promote capital inflows have been predicated on the assumption that such investments will have significant development paybacks. However, to what extent growing capital inflows into developing countries in recent decades have been effective in poverty reduction, the most urgent Sustainable Development Goal, is far from well understood. The understanding of this nexus assumes greater importance in the context of post-Covid 19 pandemic macro-management when developing countries are witnessing rising poverty on account of the sudden disappearance of jobs in the informal sector along with volatile foreign capital movements.====From the theoretical perspective, foreign capital inflows may help or hamper a country’s poverty alleviation efforts. The advocates of capital account liberalization (CAL) argue that by reducing the transaction and information cost, the opening of the economy to foreign capital results in an inefficient allocation of capital. To the extent that the performance of the financial system improves owing to CAL, financial services become available to a larger chunk of the population including the poor (Arestis and Caner, 2010). Lack of credit limits the potential of poor households to exercise their entrepreneurial capabilities to escape poverty. CAL facilitating financial intermediation hence plays an instrumental role in poverty reduction (see, e.g., Beck et al., 2007; Honohan, 2004; Jalilian and Kirkpatrick, 2002). An important influence of capital inflows on poverty also comes through economic growth. Capital inflows stimulate economic growth by enabling firms to undertake investment in high-yielding projects. Some forms of capital flows, in particular Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), stimulate technology spillovers, promote human capital formation, contribute to exports, and create a competitive business environment contributing to higher economic growth – one of the most potent tools of poverty alleviation.====The anti-CAL view, on the other hand, opines that the above arguments consider only efficiency gains and ignore the distributional consequences. For instance, CAL and the resulting improvements in the financial system may primarily benefit the rich and the politically well-connected, bypassing the poor (Arestis and Caner, 2010). Stiglitz (2000) argues that CAL imposes a costly constraint on the government in pursuing its legitimate objectives, including anti-poverty policies. For instance, the usage of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies in the wake of an open capital account may go against the poverty reduction objective.====Gozgor and Ranjan (2017) assert that economic globalization (including trade and capital flows) accentuates inequality and thereby increases the redistributive role of the government. This positive relationship between globalization and redistributive efforts is, however, stronger for richer nations. An important implication of this is that in the absence of redistributive measures, particularly in the welfare states, economic globalization may result in greater inequality. Furthermore, capital flows are often associated with macroeconomic consequences that adversely affect the poor. For instance, sudden and large inflows of capital mount inflationary pressures and affect real wages. The reversal of capital flows results in an economic crisis having a disproportionate adverse impact on the poor owing to their low levels of skills and education, limited assets, and poor safety nets to tide them over periods of recession. The sudden reversal of capital flows may result in a sharp depreciation of currency, increasing prices of essential commodities.====Against the aforementioned theoretical backdrop, the capital inflows and poverty nexus has received surprisingly little attention in the empirical literature. The empirical literature has put more emphasis on the linkages between CAL/capital inflows and economic growth, probably on the assumption that higher growth trickles down to alleviate poverty. A small number of studies explicitly investigating the links between capital account openness and poverty suffer from the following omissions. First, studies based on ==== measures of capital account openness only capture the impact of a regulatory aspect of capital mobility and not of the actual capital mobility on poverty (see, e.g., Gunter et al., 2005; Jayadev, 2007; Arestis and Caner, 2010). The studies that use ==== measures or the actual capital inflows focus only on one form of inflows, i.e. FDI (see, e.g., Gohou and Soumaré, 2012; Uttama, 2015; Dhahri and Omri, 2020), ignoring the impact of non-FDI inflows on poverty. Many scholars opine that different forms of international capital inflows are associated with different macroeconomic outcomes, and some types of inflows may do more harm than good, particularly in the context of developing economies (Baharumshah et al., 2017). While a country may benefit substantially from equity inflows, debt inflows (particularly of short-term character) entail a greater risk of crisis (Henry, 2007, Rodrik and Velasco, 1999) and are thus detrimental to poverty reduction. A few empirical studies also point to the heterogeneous impact of different types of capital flows on economic growth (Choong et al., 2010, Aizenman et al., 2013, Igan et al., 2020), which may be another transmission mechanism linking the composition of capital inflows and poverty reduction.====Second, the empirical studies attempting to establish the causal relationship between capital inflows and poverty employ a bivariate framework and thereby conceal the role of mediating variables like economic growth, trade openness, exchange rate, etc., linking capital inflows and poverty.====This paper contributes to the literature by probing along these lines of argument. In particular, this research seeks to investigate the impact of different forms of capital inflows on poverty in the context of major South Asian countries in a multivariate setting. This study attempts to answer the following questions: In financial globalization, do different forms of foreign capital have a differential impact on poverty in South Asia? If so, which type of capital flows exacerbates or reduces poverty levels? As discussed above, previous studies on this issue have mostly employed a composite measure of financial openness or only FDI flows. These studies typically suggest mixed findings on the link between capital flows and poverty reduction. If different forms of foreign capital have a contrasting impact on poverty, then the failure to distinguish between them may result in incomplete or even misleading inferences on the welfare implications of cross-border capital movement.====Among developing countries, the case of South Asia is of particular interest. Similar to many other developing economies, South Asian economies initiated the process of CAL in 1990. Over the last four decades, South Asia has been lifting capital controls as part of its broader liberalization program. The process of CAL involved gradual steps towards floating exchange rates, liberalizing capital outflows and inflows. Generally speaking, the CAL in the region has distinguished between types and directions of foreign capital flows. For instance, in the case of Sri Lanka, equity inflows are largely free, while deposits in foreign currency are allowed only under specific schemes (Patabendige and Senarath, 2014). Similarly, the thrust of Indian policymakers, in the wake of the balance of payment crisis of the early nineties, was to promote non-debt-creating inflows and discourage debt-creating short-term flows (Agarwal et al., 2017).====South Asian economies have also made significant efforts to encourage FDI. Barring a few sectors given sectoral requirements, security and strategic concerns, FDI in most of the sectors is under an ‘Automatic Approval Route’. Other measures to stimulate FDI activities included facilitation of the repatriation of investment capital and profit, tax incentives, etc.====On the whole, the CAL paths in South Asian countries have largely been the same. No country in the region has adopted full convertibility of capital accounts so far, although there are some deliberations in this regard. The East Asian currency crisis as well as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) seem to have made the countries cautious about external accounts (Bhanumurthy and Kumawat, 2020).====Fig. 1 reveals that the region’s efforts towards CAL reflect the growing magnitude of capital inflows over time. India, the largest economy in the region, accounts for approximately 80 % of the total inflows. As a result, the trends in capital inflows in the region mirror those in India (see Fig. 2). It may be inferred that the capital inflows in India (as well as in South Asia) increased monotonically till 2007. Post GFC the region witnessed instability regarding the inflows. In terms of composition, FDI dominates the total inflows. However, the share of portfolio flows has been gradually increasing. Fig. 2 indicates that portfolio inflows have increased significantly since the early 2000s, and have even matched or exceeded FDI inflows in several years. In consonance with the theoretical predictions, portfolio inflows exhibit greater volatility compared to FDI inflows.====The post-reform period in the region also witnessed sustained economic growth along with a drop in the number of poor people by 248.8 million during 1990–2013. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 reveal that the post-reform period showed a decline in headcount ratio and a concomitant improvement in the Human Development Index (HDI) in the region.====However, it should be noted that the share of global poor residing in South Asia has increased during the same period.====Prima facie, the concurrence of capital account liberalization and a fall in the number of poor people hints at a possible relation between capital inflows and poverty reduction.====Given this, the present study aims to investigate the impact of capital inflows on poverty reduction for the period 1990–2017 for five major South Asian countries, namely, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.====The study contributes to the existing literature in the following ways. First, while the available literature on the capital flows-poverty nexus focuses only on direct investments, the present study hypothesizes that different types of capital flows may have different effects on poverty. Capital flows skewed toward non-FDI types may make the country susceptible to economic shocks that could be particularly harsh on the poor. The study therefore unveils the impact of direct, portfolio equity and portfolio debt flows on poverty in the context of South Asia. Second, the study augments the existing literature by investigating the impact of capital flows on poverty in a multivariate causality framework. A multivariate framework allows us to gauge the indirect impacts of capital flows on poverty through the channels of economic growth, trade openness, exchange rate, etc.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Using a panel of 141 countries (93 developing and 48 developed), we attempt to explore and compare the impact of human capital on economic growth at different development stages. For our estimation, we employ the System Generalized Methods of Moments (SGMM) for the period 1980–2008. Our findings reveal that all aspects of human capital positively influence growth in developing countries, especially life expectancy gain, which may be explained by the demographic transition these countries are going through. However, the scenario is different for developed countries, where increased life expectancy posits a drag on economic growth, probably because of the increasingly aging population and dependency ratio. Only when life expectancy is omitted does health expenditure, along with other educational measures of human capital, help sustain growth in developed countries.","Policymakers across the globe are concerned with either ensuring or maintaining growth and the factors that affect growth. Myriad researchers of development economics have emphasized the significance of human capital for growth, along with the contribution of physical capital. The neoclassical growth theory introduced by Solow (1956) and Swan (1956) states that the contribution of technological advancement to economic growth is extensive, apart from the share of capital and labor. Later, Nelson and Phelps (1966) were the first to emphasize the importance of education in developing human capital so as to implement and adopt new technologies.====In the endogenous growth theory, Romer, 1986, Romer, 1990 stressed the priority of human capital development as a crucial input for the generation of new ideas. Lucas (1988) regarded human capital as one of the factors of production where the role of education is taken into account for human capital accumulation. Later, Mankiw et al. (1992) expanded Solow’s (1956) model by including human capital along with physical capital as economic growth determinants. Therefore, human capital is considered crucial for economic growth through the collection of technological knowledge (Romer, 1986, Mankiw et al., 1992, Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2004, Gyimah-Brempong and Wilson, 2004, Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008, Hartwig, 2010, Qadri and Waheed, 2014, Ogundari and Awokuse, 2018).====According to Schultz (1961) and Becker (2009), human capital can be explained as knowledge, skills, competencies and abilities of individuals as well as the understanding they gained over the years through their education, training, work experience, medical care and even migration. In this respect, health, education and experience or training are the essential components of human capital, and this capital stock can be augmented through better education, good health and knowledge accrual. Since straightforward measures of individuals’ learning and training are not available, the typical exercise in previous empirical studies is to take health status and educational attainment as human capital measures.====Generally, the contribution of the health status to growth is less emphasized in the extant literature. Among the existing studies focusing on the human capital and growth nexus, those by Thomas and Frankenberg (2002), Bloom et al. (2004), and Ogundari and Abdulai (2014) highlighted health issues. They state that a healthier and productive workforce is more likely to create, adopt and even implement new technologies to stimulate economic growth. On the contrary, a vast number of studies examining the human capital and growth nexus only focused on education. For instance, a meta-analysis of 57 macro-level studies by Benos and Zotou (2014) examined only the impact of educational human capital on economic growth for a cross-section of countries. Therefore, the number of studies investigating the combined growth effects of both education and health dynamics of human capital is very scanty.====Bloom et al. (2004) asserted that examining the relationship between human capital and growth becomes less comprehensive when ignoring health. According to Glewwe et al. (2014), and Aka and Dumont (2008), the inclusion of both education and health measures as human capital would allow for more accurate estimates and also address the omitted variable bias in earlier studies. As such, Li and Liang (2010) found a positive impact of schooling on economic growth for East Asian countries, but this effect is less pronounced when the health variable is included. Moreover, few studies have been performed specifically for a panel of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries attempting to investigate the contribution of human capital to economic growth using both health and educational forms of human capital (Gyimah-Brempong and Wilson, 2004, Ogundari and Awokuse, 2018).====Therefore, endeavoring to scrutinize the contribution of human capital to economic growth, the present study adds to the existing literature in several ways. First, we attempt to estimate the impact of both education and health measures of human capital simultaneously in a quantitative and qualitative manner. Second, we try to analyze how these measures of human capital affect the economic growth of developing and developed countries. Finally, a large panel of 141 countries is taken to explore the human capital and growth linkage for developing and developed countries together.====The principal aim of our study is to analyze the joint impact of education and health measures of human capital on economic growth, both in its qualitative and quantitative forms, for a comprehensive panel of developing and developed countries. We also aspire to suggest some policy recommendations for countries, depending on their development stage, as to which components of human capital they should focus on given limited resources. The preliminary findings indicate statistically significant effects of both forms of human capital (i.e., health and education) on economic growth.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

"Osei-Tutu Francis,Weill Laurent","EM Strasbourg Business School, University of Strasbourg, France,Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), Russia","Available online 4 August 2022, Version of Record 29 September 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101016,Cited by (2),"This paper examines the impact of bank efficiency on access to credit. We test the hypothesis that higher bank efficiency, meaning a better ability of banks to operate at lower costs, favors access to credit for firms. To this end, we perform a cross-country analysis with firm-level data on access to credit and bank-level data to compute bank efficiency, using a sample of about 54,000 firms from 76 countries. We find that greater bank efficiency improves access to credit for firms. The beneficial impact of bank efficiency to alleviate ==== takes place through the demand channel by reducing borrower discouragement to apply for a loan. Whereas the positive impact of bank efficiency on credit access is observed for firms of all sizes, the effect tends to be more pronounced in countries with a better economic and institutional framework. Our results therefore support policies favouring bank efficiency to enhance access to credit.","Access to credit is a key engine of economic growth. Credit constraints mean firms are unable to pursue attractive investment opportunities (Campello et al., 2010), as well as limiting their flexibility in resource allocation (Fafchamps, 1997) and hampering their productivity (Gatti and Love, 2008, Butler and Cornaggia, 2011). They consequently reduce firm growth, in particular for small and medium-sized firms (Beck and Demirgüc-Kunt, 2006; Nkurunziza, 2010).====A large strand of literature has therefore identified the determinants of financing constraints, including firm-level factors like size and foreign ownership (Beck et al., 2006) and country-level factors such as the institutional framework (Qi and Ongena, 2019) and banking market characteristics. Among the latter, the influence of bank financial conditions (Popov and Udell, 2012) and bank competition (Léon, 2015) on access to credit has been put into evidence. The underlying hypothesis is that these banking market characteristics affect bank behavior in granting loans and through this mechanism exert an impact on access to credit.====It therefore appears surprising that the influence of bank efficiency on access to credit has never been investigated. Cost efficiency of banks measures the ability of a bank to operate at minimal cost by comparing its cost structure to that of a best-practice bank. It thus informs about the bank’s performance in producing at lowest costs and has been widely studied in the banking literature over the last two decades (e.g., Bonin et al., 2005; Berger et al., 2009). This omission from the literature is surprising since economic theory predicts that a greater ability of a bank to produce at lowest costs should lead to lower banking prices, including lower loan rates. It should then reduce the financing obstacle generated by high loan rates and thus facilitate access to credit. Therefore, we can expect higher bank efficiency to favor access to credit.====From a theoretical perspective, the rationale for our hypothesis is based on two mechanisms. First, bank efficiency should reduce the cost of credit, which has been empirically confirmed by Shamshur and Weill (2019). Using a cross-country sample of firms from European countries, they provide evidence that greater bank efficiency diminishes cost of credit at the firm level. Second, firms should be constrained by high loan rates, which reduce their ability to access credit. This has been confirmed by a set of works supporting the view that high interest rates are one of the major financing obstacles for firms (e.g., Beck et al., 2006; Coluzzi et al., 2015).====This paper aims to fill this loophole in the literature by examining how bank efficiency affects access to credit. To this end, we perform a cross-country analysis with firm-level data on access to credit and bank-level data to compute bank efficiency. We use firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES), which provides unique information on access to credit for a large cross-country sample of countries and has been used similarly by Léon (2015). We utilize bank-level data from the Bank Focus database to estimate bank efficiency with the stochastic frontier approach commonly adopted in the literature (Hasan et al., 2009, Shamshur and Weill, 2019). We thus consider a large sample of about 54,000 firms from 76 mostly emerging and former transition countries.====Our research question is of utmost importance for emerging countries, since access to credit for firms is a major concern in these countries for at least two reasons. First, these countries have less developed stock and bond markets, reducing the ability for firms to access alternative sources of financing. Second, information asymmetries leading to credit constraints are particularly high in these countries due to the lower quality of the institutional framework and accounting information.====In our first estimations, we examine the impact of bank efficiency on access to credit. We are then able to answer the question whether greater bank efficiency can contribute to facilitating access to credit. We further identify the channels through which bank efficiency affects access to credit. Higher bank efficiency can favor access to credit through two different mechanisms: the demand channel and the supply channel. On the one hand, more efficient banks can charge lower loan rates because of their lower costs, which would then lead to higher loan demand. This mechanism is in line with the economic theory according to which lower costs should favor lower prices and thus greater access to products. On the other hand, more efficient banks can grant more loans for two reasons. First, their lower costs can reduce the cost of granting loans and thus increase credit supply. Second, more efficient banks could be able to overcome the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection associated with loan activity. As such, they could have lower loan application denial rates, resulting in higher loan supply.====We finally analyze whether the relationship between bank efficiency and access to credit is conditional on firm size and the macroeconomic environment. Since access to credit is predominantly a concern for smaller firms, it is of importance to know whether smaller firms benefit most from gains in bank efficiency. In addition, the macroeconomic environment can contribute to the magnitude of the impact of bank efficiency.====We face several challenges in our investigation. First, we must identify credit-constrained firms. This step can be challenging due to data limitations. Perception-based measures of credit access are problematic and may be subject to perception bias, whereas indirect indicators like the usage of credit do not take into account whether firms simply do not use credit because they have no need for it. To address this issue, we follow Popov and Udell (2012) and Léon (2015) and measure credit-constrained firms as firms that applied for credit and were denied or did not apply for credit because they were discouraged. In this way, we are able to account for firms that select themselves out of the loan application process.====Second, a credit-constrained firm can only be observed when it needs bank credit. This, however, raises potential sample selection issues that can affect the consistency of the estimates. To correct this potential bias, we employ a probit model with sample selection proposed by Van de Ven and Van Praag (1981), which uses two variables to control for the need of funds as selection variables. This approach aims to insulate our analysis from any potential bias and inconsistency.====Third, we must link the measures of bank efficiency and access to credit. Access to credit is computed at the firm level. Bank efficiency could be computed at the firm level if we are able to identify the name of the bank for each firm in the dataset. While such identification can be done with country datasets or for European countries thanks to the Amadeus database (Shamshur and Weill, 2019), we cannot identify the partner bank for each firm in the WBES database, which is a unique worldwide database to investigate financing constraints for a large sample of firms from developed and developing countries.====We thus choose to consider the mean bank efficiency score for each country as the indicator of bank efficiency for each firm. Léon (2015) adopts a similar approach in his analysis of the impact of bank competition on access to credit by utilizing the country-level degree of bank competition. However, we make an improvement in the sense that we do not rely on a database of aggregate country measures but estimate bank efficiency scores for all banks from the countries included in the study. Using these computed bank efficiency scores we obtain the mean bank efficiency score and use it in our estimations to explain access to credit.====We find that bank efficiency exerts a beneficial impact on access to credit by alleviating firms’ credit constraints. This effect takes place through the demand channel: when bank efficiency is higher, borrower discouragement is reduced, with more firms applying for a loan. We do not observe any support for the supply channel according to which more efficient banks would increase their credit supply. We finally point out that the beneficial effect of bank efficiency on access to credit is observed for all firms whatever their size and tends to be more pronounced in countries with a better institutional and economic framework.====Our work contributes to three different strands of literature. First, we contribute to the substantial body of work on the finance-growth nexus, which has examined how financial markets can affect economic development (Levine, 2005, Popov, 2018). Our study investigates a new channel through which banks can affect economic growth by alleviating credit constraints for firms. Second, we add to the literature on the determinants of access to credit. Our work emphasizes the role of bank efficiency in facilitating access to credit, which has been ignored in the literature. Third, we augment the literature on the consequences of bank efficiency. While the determinants of bank efficiency have been thoroughly investigated, its effects have received much less attention. A handful of papers has examined the consequences of bank efficiency, notably on financial stability (Assaf et al., 2019), economic growth (Hasan et al., 2009), and cost of credit (Shamshur and Weill, 2019). In a related vein, the ongoing digital transformation stresses the importance of cost efficiency of banks: higher cost efficiency of banks will enhance their chance to preserve their market shares despite the competition from new actors. We complement this literature by providing evidence on how bank efficiency affects access to credit.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology. Section 3 reports the main estimations, with additional estimations in Section 4.

To that end, the baseline horizontal R&D growth model is extended to include corruption, which is generated in ==== production. Taxation on corruption depresses profits in production but also wages, leading to labor being reallocated from production to R&D, and, therefore, to a higher economic growth rate. Moreover, it also reduces corruption and increases welfare if preferences towards a corruption-free environment are strong enough. The results are in line with the data observed for 15 EU countries.","Corruption has been analyzed by a large number of authors (e.g., Huang, 2016; Li, 2016; Gutmann and Lucas, 2017; Lisciandra and Millemaci, 2017), and most of them show that it is counter-productive for countries’ economic performance due to a variety of channels (Mauro, 1995, Rose-Akerman, 1997, Jain, 2001, Li, 2016, Lisciandra and Millemaci, 2017). Considering that countries’ laws and regulations promote the efficient allocation of scarce inputs, corruption penalizes economic activity.====Altogether, the level of investment that is crucial for economic growth and consumer’s welfare is decreased (Mauro, 1995, Borensztein et al., 1998, Mo, 2001, Jain, 2001, Cuervo-Cazurra, 2008, Sumanjeet, 2015, Stevens and Newenham-Kahindi, 2018, Blanc et al., 2019). However, when countries’ laws and regulations hamper the smooth running of the economy, corruption can be positive (Bardhan, 1997, Williams and Perez, 2016). Thus, within the existing literature, there are also some studies that find no link between corruption and economic activity (e.g., Huang, 2016) and even some showing that corruption benefits economic activity by ‘greasing the wheels’ (Paul, 2010, for Bangladesh; and Huang, 2016, for South Korea).====In general, there are two main types of corruption – ==== and ==== – that occur when firms (====) or public officials (====) use and abuse their power, thus acting outside of the law and regulations with the aim of gaining benefits. Countries that have higher levels of ==== are not necessarily those that have higher levels of ==== and vice versa (Amir et al., 2019). ==== means fraud and other illegal activities are performed in firms, which is more often perceived by the population in developed countries (Sumanjeet, 2015, Zyglidopoulos et al., 2019). In turn, ==== is performed by government officials and is more often observed in less developed countries (Amir et al., 2019). Since our focus is on developed countries, such as those of the European Union (EU), we only consider ==== (hereinafter, corruption) here.====Firms often choose locations already knowing that they will have to offer a bribe to install themselves there, regarding it as a tax they have to pay in order to operate in that market (Sumanjeet, 2015). It is believed that firms do this because they think they will not be discovered (Zyglidopoulos et al., 2019). In developed countries, firms also practice corruption to save their business in a powerful competitive market (Amir et al., 2019), as a way to accelerate bureaucratic and often slow processes, and to avoid multifaceted and expensive protocols (Aidt, 2003, Stevens and Newenham-Kahindi, 2018). However, those performing and cooperating with corruption ask for bribes higher than the most efficient ones as a result of wanting to maximize their profitability and prolong the time of bureaucracy (Jain, 2001).====Countries around the world have different levels of economic growth and consumer welfare (hereinafter welfare). There are two main reasons for these differences. The “proximate causes” are those that involve human and physical capital as well as technology, and the “institutional causes” are those related to attributes and codes of behavior and thus the level of corruption (Nugroho et al., 2019). Institutions dictate the rules, such as norms and property rights, of each society and decide how economic individuals behave (Mahmood, 2019), imposing restraints defining how political, social and economic aspects interact with each other (White et al., 2019). The level of corruption is thus associated with the quality of institutions, so that different institutions generate different levels of corruption. ====, institutions may increase or decrease economic growth and welfare (Nugroho et al., 2019); for example, in a country where institutions protect technology rights and eliminate corruption, firms will be stimulated to invest more in R&D, which will improve economic growth and welfare (Sumanjeet, 2015).====Considering this, although controlling the practice of corruption is harder in countries where it is very high (Aidt, 2003), the literature recommends several measures to combat corruption in general, especially at the institutional level. First, it is important to increase the degree of disclosure of corruption (Blanc et al., 2019). Second, related to this, it is crucial to increase transparency at the institutional level, so that firms have clear activities and procedures that are open to everyone who wants to consult them, as well as to make sure that those who practice corruption are held accountable for it (Sumanjeet, 2015). When institutions have high levels of transparency, there is less corruption and markets function in a more efficient manner. Typically, there are lower levels of transparency in countries where a higher level of the population is at risk of poverty and where there is less respect for human rights (Sumanjeet, 2015). Third, it is necessary to create stronger legal penalties for firms embroiled in corrupt activities (Aidt, 2003). Fourth, wages should be sufficiently high so that officials are not tempted to practice corruption (Aidt, 2003).====To sum up, most existing studies focus on corruption in general and, ceteris paribus, conclude that it penalizes economic activity; i.e., without distinguishing between the types of corruption and the types of countries in which they occur, the literature focuses on the relationship between the level of corruption and the economic growth rate or welfare. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that focus on ====, mostly observed in developed countries, and on the effects of increasing the penalty for corruption on the level of corruption, the economic growth rate and welfare. This is the purpose of this paper.====According to data for the 15 EU countries in d’Agostino and Scarlato, 2016, d’Agostino and Scarlato, 2019, detailed in the Appendix,==== there are indeed positive relationships between the penalty for corruption and the economic growth rate (Fig. 1a) and the welfare level (Fig. 1c), and a negative relationship between the penalty for corruption and the corruption level (Fig. 1b). Although outside the direct scope of the paper, Fig. 2 in the Appendix depicts the relationship between corruption and economic growth (Fig. 2a) and the relationship between corruption and welfare (Fig. 2b). In this group of countries and in the period considered, these relationships are clearly negative.====We perform an analysis bearing in mind the endogenous R&D growth literature and, in particular, the baseline horizontal R&D growth model (e.g., Romer, 1990; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2004, Ch. 6). We extend this model by proposing a modification where we consider an index of aggregate corruption that depends on the volume of production of intermediate goods used by the aggregate final good as a source of business corruption. The intuition behind this setup is that firms with a higher volume of production are more profitable in general, and the connection between profits and corruption has been emphasized extensively in the literature (Johnson et al., 2002, Shleifer and Vishny, 2003). In addition, we consider that corruption affects the household’s utility negatively and propose a more general utility function than the one in the baseline horizontal R&D growth model (e.g., Romer, 1990; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 2004, Ch. 6), which permits us to analyze the effect of corruption on marginal utility.====We show that a greater punishing tax reduces final goods production and intermediate goods demand; therefore, it penalizes the profits of producers of intermediate goods (====), but as a result of this, it also reduces wages (====). Since this effect is stronger than the former, an increase in the corruption tax reallocates labor to the R&D sector (====). In turn, this leads to an increased rate of innovative activity, i.e., the generation of new varieties of intermediate goods. This is reflected in a higher economic growth rate, matching the data in Fig. 1a and the dominating literature on the subject (e.g., Li, 2016; Chang and Hao, 2017; Neanidis et al., 2017; Khyareh, 2019), considering that a higher corruption punishment rate leads to less corruption. In this regard, we indeed find that a greater punishing tax reduces the level of corruption, in line with the data in Fig. 1b and the literature on the relationship between punishment and the level of corruption (e.g., Becker and Stigler, 1974; Olken, 2007). Moreover, if the preference of households for a corruption-free environment is strong enough, this also increases welfare, as seen in Fig. 1c. This latter result is also in line with the literature as it suggests that fighting corruption improves welfare (e.g., Welsch, 2008; Yan and Wen, 2020).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the setup of the R&D growth model. Section 3 analyses the dynamic general equilibrium of the model and the implications of a higher punishing tax. Finally, Section 4 concludes.",Growth and welfare effects of corruption penalties,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000668,28 July 2022,2022,Research Article,19.0

Using a robust ordinary least squares regression with fixed effects, we find that settler mortality exerts a negative impact on the evolution of financial markets in former African colonies, while the opposite effect is obtained for the settler sedentarisation rate. These results remain robust to the several tests performed. Our study provides new evidence and perspectives to the long-standing debate regarding the relationship between history and ====. As a key recommendation, we propose that policymakers should draw more inspiration from the past to make better policy decisions in terms of economic, institutional, sociocultural, and legal governance to enhance the development of their financial markets.","Numerous studies have shown the importance of financial system development for economic growth and the reduction of financing constraints of firms (Levine, 1997, Levine and Zervos, 1998, Yartey, 2010, Yartey and Adjasi, 2007). Subsequently, a substantial body of research based on the determinants of financial system development has identified historical institutional factors as causes, mainly stemming from colonial effects. These act as exogenous determinants of financial system development, as they are neither the result of current policies nor the outcome of current events, much less affected by countries’ current policy decisions (Emenalo et al., 2018). However, few studies have theoretically, empirically, or rigorously explored the links between historical institutional factors and financial system development in the African context. Therefore, it is important to determine the extent to which these factors explain the current level of performance of the continent’s financial markets.====Colonialism may be considered one of the starting points, which is considered as an economic issue in the new institutionalist tradition (Zouache, 2018, Maseland, 2018). Indeed, according to the proponents of this approach, during their expeditions, Europeans set up political institutions that resembled those existing in their countries of origin. For example, Spain experimented in Latin America with feudal institutions marked by a centralised government and institutions protecting the aristocracy, whereas England would have implanted decentralised political institutions and property rights in their colonies, considered as political and economic institutions favourable to growth (Chan, 2021, Zouache, 2018). To this end, we point out that the high degree of political instability and ethnic conflicts that characterise most African countries can also considered a legacy of colonisation (Van Bavel et al., 2021). The end of colonial rule resulted in a significant transformation of the borders of African countries, which totally differed from those that existed in the pre-colonial period (Van Bavel et al., 2021; Rönnbäck and Broberg, 2019; Austin, 2015; Emélano et al., 2018).====Based on these views, new theories based on history emerged, including the theories of law and finance, natural endowments, and ethnic fragmentation. The first approach (La Porta et al., 1999; Beck et al., 2003) argues that the legal system explains the level of financial market development. According to this theory, the legal protection of shareholders and creditors increases investment flows and improves the availability of external financing for companies. This protection varies depending on whether a country has French, German, Scandinavian, or British common law system. The proponents of the endowment theory explain the role of institutions by the natural conditions that have prevailed at the time of colonisation (Acemoglu et al., 2001). Here, it is neither the identity of the coloniser nor the style of the legal system developed that matters, but rather whether they can safely settle in a particular place. Conversely, where they could not, colonisers developed fewer hierarchical institutions with weak property rights and facilitated resource extraction (Gupta and Pathak, 2020). Finally, the theory of ethnic fractioning emphasises that ethnic conflict increases the social polarisation of a country, with negative consequences for private transactions and, thus, financial performance (Easterly et al., 2006).====Furthermore, the literature on the impact of colonial legacies on development shows that the rate of economic growth in African countries is highly dependent on their colonisers (Bertocchi and Canova, 2002). On average, British and French colonies seem to have performed better in terms of economic growth than Italian and Portuguese colonies. If the colonial legacy influences the economic development of the continent, we also expect it to have an impact on the current level of performance of the continent’s financial markets.====Thus, Africa provides an interesting context for studying the theories developed to explain the relationship between history and finance. Similarly, it should be noted that the continent’s financial markets are relatively young and less developed than those of other regions. Indeed, the emergence and proliferation of financial markets in Africa began in the 1990 s. However, long before that, Africa had only eight financial markets, five of which were in sub-Saharan Africa==== and three in Northern Africa==== (Yartey and Adjasi, 2007); but by 2015, it had 28 financial markets, including 5 in North Africa, 5 in West Africa, 2 in Central Africa, 8 in Southern Africa and 8 in East Africa (Chikalipah and Makina, 2019). The oldest financial markets are those of Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, and Zimbabwe (Yartey and Adjasi, 2007), while the two youngest are in Angola and Lesotho, officially launched in 2016 (Bonga and Sithole, 2019).====This study analyses the effect of settlement on the growth of African financial markets. To do so, we use a panel of 30 countries for the settler mortality rate and 35 countries for the sendentarisation rate over the 1996–2017 period. The choice of the latter is due to two main reasons: the first is related to the fact that most African financial markets were created around the 1990 s; thus, it is impossible for us to obtain sufficient data on upstream financial indicators at that date to be able to extend our study; the second reason is related to some variables (notably institutional variables) for which data availability starts in 1995. Thereafter, we apply a robust ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with fixed effects. The choice of this method is related to the fact that most of the variables adopted in this study vary a little (or not at all) over time.====Our study is in line with the literature on the determinants that influence the growth of financial markets, and it thereby enriches the academic and financial literature. This study builds on the works of Fowowe (2014) and Emélano et al. (2017) but differs in several respects. Fowowe (2014) conducted an empirical study on the impact of law and finance theory in Africa. Emenalo et al. (2018) investigated the extent to which historical institutional determinants identified by legal origins, disease endowment, religion-based, and ethnic fractionalisation theories explained current differences in the development of financial systems in Africa, particularly for depth and access to the financial system.====In contrast to these studies, we primarily focus on the effect of settler mortality rates==== and sedentarisation (i.e. the total European population in 1900) on one dimension of financial development, namely, financial markets, using original data from the pioneering work of Acemoglu . et al. (2001)==== Each of these variables plays a key role in our study. Indeed, it is generally accepted in the literature that high settler mortality rates have influenced the development process of some regions through several factors (e.g., low level of economic growth, weak institutions, etc.). However, it has never been demonstrated whether settlements achieve better results in terms of growth than extractive settlements: such evidence will be provided by the rate of sedentarisation. To our knowledge, no study has specifically examined the role of settler mortality and sedentarisation rates in the development of financial markets in Africa, which is the first novelty of this study. Furthermore, this study advances the literature in that it directly links colonisation and financial markets by showing how differences in colonisation patterns also differentially affect the development of the continent's financial markets.====The second novelty of this study is that we use a new financial market indicator—the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s financial market index (FMI). Previous studies have ignored this aspect. The financial market index measures the depth, accessibility, and efficiency of financial markets, allowing individuals to diversify their savings and firms to increase their liquidity (Svirydzenka, 2016, Sahay et al., 2015). According to Ongo Nkoa (2018), its main advantage lies in the integration of multiple indicators. Moreover, it helps to distinguish countries with less developed financial markets from those with highly developed financial markets, while also filling in the unavailability of data from the World Bank database on traditional indicators (market capitalisation, value of shares traded, turnover of financial markets, and the number of listed firms). Finally, the novelty is that we perform several robustness tests, the main one involving the decomposition of the FMI into its sub-indices, to verify our main results.====The results reveal that the mortality and sedentarisation rates of settlers have each exerted opposite effects on the growth of African financial markets. While the former has a negative effect on the financial market index, the latter has a positive one. In addition, the results further reveal that the growth of financial markets in Africa is influenced by legal, geographical, sociocultural, institutional, and economic factors. These results are robust to several tests.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on the link between history and finance. Section 3 presents the data and methodology used.

We find that aggregation bias, misspecification bias, endogeneity bias (including simultaneity bias and omitted-variable bias), and publication bias, as well as firm attributes, contribute to the heterogeneity in forward spillover estimates; and that the preferred forward spillover effects are positive but nonsignificant. Interestingly, the preferred forward spillover effect is likely to be much larger in Eastern European transition economies than in China.","Foreign direct investment (FDI) technology spillovers are considered the most important and extensively examined channel of knowledge spillovers in the literature. Policy makers in many developing and transition economies (where there is a change from a centrally planned to a market economy) treat FDI as critical for host countries. They believe that FDI can bring much-needed capital, management skills, modern technologies, and, more importantly, contribute to increased productivity and competitiveness in domestic firms through FDI technology spillovers, including horizontal spillover (within the same industry), backward spillover (from FDI to local suppliers), and forward spillover (from FDI to local buyers), through the product chain. In the literature, researchers typically emphasize FDI horizontal and backward spillovers, ignoring FDI forward spillover. However, FDI forward spillover is also important because its effect can occur in two ways: First, local firms can improve their productivity by purchasing high-quality intermediate products from FDI firms and establishing production facilities with the help of FDI. Second, local firms must make a series of improvements to meet the high standards required if they become distributors of FDI firms’ products, while FDI firms can also offer technical assistance and provide training in management and organization (e.g., Blake et al., 2009; Blomstrom and Kokko, 1998; Dries and Swinnen, 2004; Key and Runsten, 1999; UNCTAD, 2001). However, empirical evidence on FDI forward spillovers is mixed: positive, neutral, and negative. No strong consensus has been reached on the direction and magnitude of FDI forward spillovers.====Fig. 1 presents box plots of FDI forward spillover estimates in individual studies in our two meta-samples. The range of forward spillover estimates in China is [− 4.36, 6.452], whereas that in countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (CEEFSU) is [− 13.280, 11.598].==== The simple means are 0.357 and − 0.353, respectively. Their corresponding standard deviations also have a wide spectrum. Fig. 1 does not offer a clear picture of authentic forward spillover effects based on any individual estimate or study. Consensus on FDI forward spillovers in the literature is difficult for three reasons. The first reason is heterogeneity. FDI spillover estimates are commonly estimated in empirical research based on specific datasets, econometric techniques, or study design, which may result in variations across studies. The second reason is publication bias. Reviewers, editors, and even researchers prefer empirical forward spillover estimates that are consistent with conventional theories or “statistically significant”—this is “publication bias,” which may distort authentic empirical findings. The third reason is misspecification bias. Ioannidis et al. (2017) find that misspecification bias is a major source of excess variation among empirical estimates in dozens of previous meta-analyses.====Inspired by the mixed results, many researchers attempt to reveal the truth by analyzing the FDI spillover literature. A narrative literature review and a meta-analysis are two commonly used and complementary methodologies to summarize previous findings. Rojec and Knell (2018) present a comprehensive narrative analysis of FDI knowledge spillovers and find that the absence of consensus is mainly due to the results of firm-level panel data analyses. Compared to a narrative literature review, a meta-analysis provides a quantitative and objective method for conducting a literature survey, which has been applied to FDI spillovers. Hanousek et al. (2011) pioneered the meta-study of FDI spillovers in transition countries.==== They revealed the sources of heterogeneity in spillover estimates and found negative and significant forward spillover effects but positive and significant backward spillover effects in transition economies. Havranek and Irsova (2011) find that forward spillover is positive and significant without publication bias, on average. However, Iwasaki and Tokunaga (2016) show no empirical evidence of non-zero forward spillover effects in CEEFSU.====In addition to examining the variation in FDI forward spillover estimates in terms of the association between their heterogeneity and the characteristics of the corresponding studies, we attempt to extend the meta-analyses conducted by Hanousek et al. (2011), Havranek and Irsova, 2011, Havranek and Irsova, 2012, and Iwasaki and Tokunaga (2016) by revealing the authentic FDI forward spillover effects in transition economies, including China and CEEFSU, using a comparative meta-analysis framework. Generally, researchers encounter great difficulties (e.g., mainly due to data constraints) in conducting a standard empirical analysis to compare the impacts of FDI in China and CEEFSU. It should be highlighted that a meta-analysis can overcome such a hurdle, which is its outstanding advantage. To our best knowledge, only Fleisher et al. (2005) and Iwasaki et al., 2020, Iwasaki et al., 2022 compare China and other transition economies (e.g., Eastern Europe) using a meta-analysis in the literature. Following the two previous studies, ours also aims to perform a comparative meta-analysis beyond the usual difficulties in orthodox empirical analyses. The current study contributes to the literature in the following three ways.====First, we focus solely on FDI forward spillover effects in transition countries. Previous empirical studies offer an ambiguous picture of FDI spillover effects, while most researchers focus on horizontal and backward spillovers. However, forward spillovers have received less attention than backward and horizontal spillovers in the literature. Despite the importance of forward technology diffusion, few studies focus on FDI forward spillovers; we aim to bridge the gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first meta-analysis study to focus on FDI forward spillovers.====Second, it is important as well as interesting to conduct a comparative meta-analysis of FDI forward spillovers in China and other transition countries. China is the main transition economy outside CEEFSU. Meanwhile, China is the largest FDI recipient in the developing world. Therefore, the country is considered to be of significance in studies on FDI forward spillovers in transition economies. Moreover, because of the different initial conditions in the transition from a planned to a market economy, most CEEFSU countries adopted an aggressive and rapid model of transition, whereas China adopted a gradual one.==== By conducting a comparative meta-analysis of FDI forward spillovers, we can gain a better understanding of the role of FDI technology forward spillovers in the two different types of transition economies.====Third, after accounting for the striking heterogeneity of the empirical estimates reported in the literature, we engage in a series of synthetic practices that are conditional on various hypothetical combinations of study characteristics—average practice, best practice, and worst practice—to synthesize forward spillover effects based on numerous existing estimates. The new forward estimates account for various biases (e.g., publication bias and misspecification bias). Consequently, we obtain preferred forward spillover effects for China and CEEFSU. In addition, we highlight not only the influences of publication bias and misspecification bias but also the importance of different firm attributes in assessing FDI forward spillover effects.====In this study, we compile two meta-datasets of forward estimates: 530 forward estimates from 19 Chinese studies and 942 forward estimates from 28 CEEFSU studies and 17 countries. Compared with Iwasaki and Tokunaga’s (2016) 64 forward estimates from 10 studies in 11 countries, we utilize many estimates in the meta-analysis. In the search for the determinants of the reported forward spillover, we collect an extensive set of study characteristics: 46 in the Chinese and 40 in the CEEFSU meta-samples. These study characteristics may explain the variation in reported findings, and are classified into seven categories (e.g., data used in primary studies and foreign firm characteristics). To obtain more reliable estimates, we synthesize estimates of forward spillovers beyond various biases by conducting synthetic practices. We derive two main findings: first, the preferred forward spillover effects are positive but nonsignificant in both China and the CEEFSU transition economies; however, their 95% confidence intervals imply a high probability of the presence of large forward technology spillovers from foreign to domestic firms. Interestingly, the preferred forward spillover effect is much larger in CEEFSU than in China. Second, we also find strong evidence of methodological and structural heterogeneity in forward spillover estimates for both meta-samples. Specifically, aggregation bias, misspecification bias, endogeneity bias (including simultaneity bias and omitted-variable bias), and publication bias, as well as firm attributes, contribute to the heterogeneity in the estimates.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes our meta-analysis methodology. Section 3 presents the meta-sample and meta-statistics as well as the study characteristics used to explain the variability in the FDI forward estimates across the studies.

Specifically, we examine two specific aspects of gender diversity- how the implementation of gender diversity across various workforce levels affects firm performance and the role of gender norms and culture in the external environment where the firm operates in influencing the relation. Using the World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2014, we use ","The role of gender diversity in explaining firm performance has been discussed widely in academic research and policy debates (Smith et al., 2006, Zhang, 2020 Duppati et al., 2019). As international organizations, governments and civil societies have been striving hard to improve women's representation by gender quota legislation, gender-based tax waivers and women's rights movements; women workforce participation has improved across countries.==== However, female labour force participation in India exhibits a puzzling trend for different categories (Abraham, 2013). According to the 68th round of the National Sample Survey, the trend is continuously declining for rural areas. According to the World Bank (2019), the labor force participation rate (defined as the percentage of working-age employed or seeking work; henceforth, LFPR) for women in 2019 indicates India is a laggard. With a female LFPR of 23 %, India is even lower than Sub-Saharan countries such as Libya (26 %), Lebanon (24 %) or even Pakistan (24 %). In contrast, advanced economies like Germany, the US and China record a high female LFPR of above 55 %.====Urban female LFPR, on the other hand, has increased marginally from 14.6 % to 15.5 % at the global level in the last decade (ILO, 2019). This rising trend of female representation is also prevalent in Indian industry. However, within the Indian manufacturing sector, female employment has not risen across all sub-sectors. According to Mehrotra and Sinha (2019), women primarily engage in tobacco, textile and apparel industry groups. Simultaneously, female employment share in services has risen from 40 % in 1999–00–60 % in 2011–12. However, within services also women are mainly engaged in education and retail trade. These non-uniform patterns of women's representation seem to pose a contrasting picture against the growing emphasis on gender diversity as propagated by international organizations, governments and civil societies. This puzzle can be resolved by focusing on the basic question of how women's representation affects firm performance.====Several past studies support the positive effect of gender diversity on firm outcomes. Roberson and Hyeon (2007) focus on how gender diversity may act as a firm's strategic signal for increasing firm value. In a parallel strand of literature, Herring (2009) and Zhang (2020) find that gender diversity improves the financial performance of firms. Thus, there are external market gains and internal channels that contribute to improved performance due to better gender diversity. In contrast, Ibarra (1993) points out how gender diversity may distort the smooth flow of information within the organization and consequently impairs performance. Hence, it is plausible that the effect of gender diversity on firm performance is driven by the study's period, country, and context.====In the Indian context, Duppati et al. (2019) investigate if gender diversity on boards is an effective driver for firm performance. Contrasting Singapore and India as countries with different legislative requirements, they find that gender diversity positively affects performance in both contexts. Similarly, Sanan (2016), Sarkar and Selarka (2021), Kagzi and Guha (2018) also find a positive association between women's representation on board and firm performance. In contrast, Joshi (2017) analyses the impact of gender diversity on total output and productivity for Indian firms and finds no effect of a female board member on the outcome variables.====Against this background, this paper also examines the effect of gender diversity on firm performance. We attempt to incorporate two essential features related to gender while investigating this question. First, the employment hierarchy inside a firm may be segmented into four levels- owners, managers, permanent workers and temporary workers. Diversity of any type is beneficial to firm performance only if implemented at all levels to facilitate inclusion of different groups at each level, wider information and idea pool, and a smooth work environment. Further, diversity at the higher ownership and management levels is more critical since it enables a vast set of options and information available in the decision-making level of the firm. We attempt to take explicit account of gender diversity across various levels of the workforce.====A second important feature that we explore is societal norms and culture in conditioning the effect of gender diversity on firm performance. This will ensure that we contextualize firms in the larger society that it operates in. Societal culture affects individual approaches and attitudes to diversity that may influence how gender diversity impacts the performance of firms. For instance, better women empowerment norms in the external environment where the firm operates may accelerate the effect of gender diversity on firm performance.====This study relies on a widely used dataset, the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) dataset. The WBES spans 131,000 firms across 139 countries and contains information related to financial performance, business environment, and business-government relations. The survey captures the ground realities of representation of females at the ownership, management, worker and temporary workforce level. Several studies (Bardasi et al., 2007, Asiedu et al., 2013) have used the WBES to study different aspects of gender-related issues within enterprises. In this paper, we focus on India and the 2013–14 round of WBES. We use propensity score matching and instrumental variable regression techniques to capture the effects. We take account of gender diversity at the ownership level by focusing on firms that have multiple owners. We also re-estimate the model for firms operating in better women empowerment environments and their counterparts using state-level variables.====The results indicate that gender diversity at the ownership and managerial levels is positively associated with the profitability and productivity of firms in India. Contrastingly, gender diversity at the worker level is insignificant. A deeper examination of the results suggests that this effect is conditioned by the role of external institutions and societal norms. Firms operating in states with better women empowerment have a high positive association between performance and gender diversity. This confirms that in societies where women feel more empowered, firms also benefit from better women representation at all levels. Thus, smooth information flow, better management and functioning have positive effects on firm performance only if the societal norms are more conducive to women. These results contrast sharply for firms operating in states with poor women empowerment levels where performance is not associated with gender diversity. Overall, the results signal the vital role of societal norms and broader acceptance of women empowerment for firms to reap better benefits related to better gender diversity.","Gender diversity, gender norms and firm performance: Evidence from India",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000681,16 June 2022,2022,Research Article,22.0

Our key hypothesis is that the potential of income redistribution to reduce rising ,"The economic literature has documented sharp rises in income inequality during macroeconomic recessions (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009, Jenkins et al., 2013, Meyer and Sullivan, 2013). In such a context, redistribution of income could be considered an important objective of economic policy (Heathcote et al., 2010). Public support for redistributive welfare state fiscal policies has grown, especially in advanced economies where the ==== hit hardest (International Monetary Fund, 2014).====Scholars have claimed that counter-cyclical fiscal policies are important to stabilize macro-economic business cycles (Lane, 2003). Counter-cyclical policies involve spending less in good times in a way that cools off the economy and allows the government to increase its savings, and spending more in bad times to mitigate recession and speed up recovery. This can be contrasted with pro-cyclical spending policies, which increase spending in good times and cut it in bad times.====Pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies tend to amplify output fluctuations and create large social costs, notably affecting the most vulnerable segments of the population. Specifically, economic crises bring about a contraction in the public financial resources available. This is because of a decrease in revenues due to a decline in gross domestic product, and/or an increase in public debt, constraining the ability of states to spend. The reduction in public resources might harm equality because of a fall in welfare provisions. A reduction in public resources often affects primary public services. Consequently, the poorest segments of the population, which rely most heavily on these policies, are most adversely affected by the crisis and by this governmental response (Abbott and Jones, 2012, Vegh and Vuletin, 2014).====In this paper, we investigate under which government quality conditions the cushioning effect of the tax-benefit system of countries protects households at different income levels against income losses caused by economic downturns, such as the global business crisis. Some researchers have suggested,==== but not pursued empirically, the idea that the level of government quality plays a key role in countries’ ability and willingness to implement counter-cyclical redistributive macroeconomic policies. Countries with strong public governments adopt countercyclical macroeconomic policies aimed at alleviating the adverse effects in distributive terms of economic recessions. Specifically, we examine the mediating role of the quality of government for the implementation of policies that could have redistributive results during macroeconomic recessions. We place special emphasis on the counter-cyclical nature of income redistribution which aims to protect the most vulnerable groups or individuals of society in the face of the emergence of major economic recessions.====By using a panel of 46 countries over the period 1996–2016, we ﬁnd that economic recessions will tend to increase the redistribution of income in countries with high government quality, while they reduce it in countries with low quality of government, thus exposing the most vulnerable groups of the population to even more severe economic conditions. This is mainly the case for the vast majority of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries considered in this study (Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Perú, and Uruguay), which exhibit poor indicators of government quality and redistribution. However, we also observe non-counter-cyclical redistribution behavior in South Africa, many Asian countries (Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Israel, and Turkey), some eastern European countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic), in a few countries of northern Europe (Latvia and Lithuania), and certain southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain).====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we review the contribution of scholars which have explored how macroeconomic recessions may affect income inequality and the role of government quality as a way of enhancing redistribution of income during adverse macroeconomic conditions. In this section, we also present a review of the empirical literature related to the cyclical behavior of main public policies. In Section 3 we extensively describe how we measure the key variables employed in the empirical analysis. In Section 4 we explain the empirical methodology, including a discussion of our choice of control variables and the estimators used.

Based on the logic of this model, an increasing number of papers applies it to emerging economies but modifies the original model without being explicit about the nature and implications of this modification. We argue in this paper that, in its original form, CDM does not capture stylized facts of the determinants of productivity in emerging economies and that we need alternative models. Accordingly, we are critical of papers that try to maintain the validity of the model but actually change it. For that purpose, we test the original CDM model and its two alternatives: investment and production capability–driven models. Our research is based on a large sample of firms in Central and Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics and Turkey, and we show that the alternative models are much closer to the stylized facts of innovation activities and technology upgrading in these and other emerging economies. Our conclusions have important policy implications, which we discuss.","The CDM (Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse) model is considered a workhorse model in the economics of innovation. Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse (1998) initially proposed their model to explain that productivity is driven by innovation output and innovation output is driven by investment in research. The main contribution of the model is methodological. It is regarded as a seminal attempt to explore the black box of the innovation process at the firm level (Lööf et al., 2017) and is based on the concept of a “knowledge production function” (Griliches, 1989, Griliches, 1990), in which R&D capital stock determines the level of productivity indirectly via its impact on innovation output.====The CDM model is designed as a four-stage sequential model, which includes, first, the decision to innovate (invest in R&D); second, the decision about how much to invest in innovation (R&D) activities; third, the relation between innovation expenditure and innovation output (patents, innovative sales); and, fourth, the relation between innovation output and performance (productivity). Each of the four stages embeds different determinants of innovation, such as firm characteristics, industry-specific factors, and institutional background.====The CDM model has been used widely to explore the R&====-innovation-productivity link in the context of high-income economies (Benavente, 2006, Criscuolo and Haskel, 2003, Griffith et al., 2006, Janz et al., 2004, Jefferson et al., 2006, Loof and Heshmati, 2002, 2006; Mohnen et al., 2006; Parisi et al., 2006; Van Leeuwen and Klomp, 2006). These studies confirm the relevance of the model in developed economies and show that the marginal effects of innovation intensity are statistically and economically significant.====However, in the context of emerging economies, the evidence is less conclusive. Few studies focus on emerging economies, and their results are less robust and sometimes mixed. However, investigations based on innovation survey data confirm that innovative firms achieve higher labor productivity than other firms. Most studies report a positive relationship between innovation and firm performance; see, for example, Crespi and Pluvia (2010) on Latin America, De Fuentes et al. (2015) on Mexico, Lee and Kang (2007) on South Korea, Hegde and Shapira (2007) on Malaysia, Aw et al. (2008) on Taiwan, and Jefferson et al. (2006) on China. However, the results on the relationship between R&D and innovation are mixed. For example, positive results on this relationship are found by Chudnovsky et al. (2006) and Arza and López (2010) in Argentina, Correa et al. (2005) and Raffo et al. (2008) in Brazil, and Stoevsky (2005) in Bulgaria. However, Benavente (2006) and Benavente and Bravo (2009), discussing Chile, and Pérez et al. (2005), looking at Mexico, suggest that the relationship is negative or insignificant. The findings on the innovation-productivity link are similarly inconclusive. Raffo et al. (2008) provide positive results on Brazil and Mexico, but negative results on Argentina, while Pérez et al. (2005), looking at Argentina, and Chudnovsky et al. (2006) and Benavente (2006), examining Mexico, suggest that the effect is not significant.====Using data on Central and East European countries (CEECs), former Soviet republics (now in the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]), and Turkey, we apply the CDM model approach based on three papers. Tevdovski et al. (2017) use the CDM model with data on Romania, Bulgaria, and Germany, finding that the marginal effects of R&D intensity are statistically and economically highly significant for product innovation in all three countries, with the highest impact in Germany, followed by Bulgaria and then Romania. However, in terms of process innovation, R&D intensity is very significant for companies operating in Germany but negative for companies in Bulgaria and Romania (higher R&D expenses per employee lead to less process innovation). Tevdovski and colleagues also show that investment in equipment is a fundamental driver of process innovation in all three countries.====Hashi and Stojcic (2013) study the “old” and “new” members states in the European Union ( EU), employing a modified CDM model based on a broad notion of innovation that includes all innovation expenditures. They obtain three main findings. First, they show that the processes driving firms’ innovation activities in the two groups of countries are broadly comparable. Second, they show that investment in innovation activity has a positive influence on innovation output, measured as the proportion of sales attributable to new products. Third, firm productivity increases significantly with innovation output. In both regressions, the coefficients are statistically significant and positive. However, in the CEECs, we observe a negative feedback effect from productivity to innovation output.====Masso and Vahter (2012) explore the link between innovation and productivity in Estonia’s services sector and find that the effects of innovation on productivity also work through the impact of innovation on exports as the determinant of a firm's productivity. Masso and Vahter (2008) find that the importance of the type of innovation on productivity levels varies but the impact on productivity growth does not.====Most studies on emerging economies employ what we consider a modified CDM model, which is based not on R&D but on a broad notion of innovation that includes R&D and expenditures on machinery and equipment (M&E). These papers show that a modified CDM model, but not an R&====-based CDM model, works in emerging economies. However, from our perspective, it is essential to recognize that a broad notion of innovation combines expenditures on intangibles (R&D) with expenditure on tangibles (M&E). Combining the exploration component (R&D) with exploitation (investment in physical plant and equipment) confounds the true nature of innovation in emerging economies, which is about the acquisition of M&E and their effective absorption (Radosevic, 2017). The effective absorption of M&E requires a developed production capability, which is a qualitatively different category of intangibles that has no direct proxy (Bell and Pavitt, 1993). By trying to accommodate the CDM to the context of emerging economies, the modified CDM model literature hides the essential distinction between production and innovation capability. Our results show that innovation intensity does not explain productivity in emerging economies. In addition, including investment and production capability as determinants of productivity better reflects the stylized facts of innovation activities in emerging economies. Compared to the literature on a modified CDM model, our results have significantly different policy implications, which we discuss in the conclusions.====In Section 2, we discuss the stylized facts related to technological change and innovation in emerging economies and the CDM model. Section 3 presents the data and our econometric approach. Section 4 tests the original CDM model, 5 Alternative investment-driven model of the relationship between innovation and productivity, 6 Alternative production capability–driven model of the relationship between innovation and productivity suggest two alternative specifications rooted in the stylized facts on innovation activities in emerging economies. Section 7 provides a discussion, presents some robustness checks, and compares the results of all three models. Section 8 concludes by summarizing the results and discussing some policy-relevant issues in our analysis.","The relationship between R&D, innovation and productivity in emerging economies: CDM model and alternatives",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000607,14 June 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

Different levels of income are considered in order to check for the stability of the relationship. We also test for the existence of a threshold effect driving the credit bureau-banking stability nexus. Estimation outcomes suggest that more credit bureaus are correlated with less banking instability. Moreover, estimation outcomes show that curbing corruption improves the quality of information on delinquent borrowers shared among these institutions and can thus enhance the soundness of the banking system. Our findings also report the existence of a nonlinear relationship in the private and public credit bureaus and banking stability nexus.","The banking system is a key driver of economic activity in every country. Its importance lies mainly in the contribution to economic growth it makes through mobilizing savings and channeling them into investment (Demirgüç-Kunt and Levine, 2001). Banking stability is therefore a prerequisite for the success of sustainable growth strategies (Fernández et al., 2016).====As far as the soundness of the banking system is concerned, the quality of information that banks hold determines to a certain extent their interaction with borrowers and response to their requests. Credit bureaus or credit registries, which are present in many countries, are credit reporting institutions that deliver information on borrowers and can alert banks to those with a record of delinquency. The term can in fact refer to two types of institution, private credit bureaus and public credit registries. Credit registries tend to be public entities managed by central banks or bank supervision agencies. They are usually obliged by law to share information on delinquent borrowers in order to overcome the problem of default. In contrast, credit bureaus are privately operated entities. Information collected and shared by these institutions is crucial when dealing with moral hazard issues, particularly when borrowers are able to patronize several banks at the same time (Bennardo et al., 2007). Reliable reporting can therefore reduce the problem of adverse selection (Pagano and Jappelli, 1993). The information that banks are able to collect from creditors who have dealt previously with potential borrowers can help to assess the creditworthiness of these latter. This information can also be shared and exchanged among lenders through these credit registries/bureaus. Sharing information can induce more discipline on the part of borrowers, which in turn can decrease the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard (Padilla and Pagano, 1997). Bank distress can develop from the presence of a large volume of non-performing loans. Numerous studies have found that information sharing has two main benefits: a screening effect and a motivation effect (Brown et al., 2009, Djankov et al., 2007). On the one hand, sharing information can help banks to obtain reliable information on borrowers’ histories that will in turn increase the predictive power of their screening procedures. By doing this, banks reduce their exposure to the risks of non-performing loans and delinquent borrowers, making them less vulnerable. On the other hand, the sharing of information among lenders and banks through credit bureaus and credit registries creates a greater incentive for borrowers to repay their loans in due time, in order to avoid being blacklisted by the registries. Information sharing thus produces a motivation effect that goes hand in hand with less bank distress.====Against the backdrop of many financial and banking crises, many countries have devoted effort to improving their credit registries so that they can rely on them as part of their prudential macroeconomic framework, financial regulation and oversight. Although private credit bureaus are reputed to serve the information needs of commercial lenders better, credit bureaus both private and public can provide valuable credit scoring and debt collection services.====As evidenced in the recent literature, the performance of the banking system does not depend only on its inherent characteristics. The quality of the institutions governing it can heavily influence its performance (Barth et al., 2007). The institutional framework within which banks evolve can either help or hinder the intermediation process, as corruption may derail credit bureaus from the track set out in their original mandates. A corrupt institutional context can therefore obstruct their activity and create more banking instability. This issue of corruption in the institutional framework within which banks evolve in any given country can be considered in the light of two main strands of the literature. The first, commonly known as the “greasing the wheels” literature, argues that corruption in general can be beneficial to economic activity because it can “grease the wheels” of the economy by reducing the bureaucratic barriers to productivity (Dreher and Gassebner, 2013). Conversely, the second strand argues that corruption can have negative consequences for numerous economic outcomes because it “sands the wheels” of the economy, that is, it prevents business activity running smoothly (Apergis and Ben Ali, 2020, Swaleheen et al., 2019, Ben Ali and Mdhillat, 2015, Park, 2012).====In a recent paper by Parsons et al. (2018), the authors studied the average rate of financial misconduct in the 20 largest U.S. cities. They reported large cross-sectional differences and showed that firms located in more corrupt regions are more likely to engage in financial misreporting (Parsons et al., 2018). The question now is whether more or less corruption could be related to more or less effective credit bureaus and therefore more or less banking stability/instability. That is, credit bureaus located in countries displaying high levels of corruption may be more likely to produce falsified and nontransparent information and thus to create more banking distress. Officials of credit bureaus in more corrupt countries may interfere inappropriately in their operation, making credit bureaus less effective in producing good and reliable information.====This study addresses this interference impact of corruption in the credit bureau-banking stability nexus and investigates to what extent corruption could be derailing credit bureaus’ decisions when it comes to providing reliable information about the quality of customers. This study contributes to the literature in two specific ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, no recent study has considered the impact that credit bureaus, both private and public, can have on the occurrence of banking crises. This study analyzes a sample of 32 countries over a recent period, contributing new insights for policy makers and academics. Second, our empirical study considers the potential existence of a threshold, nonlinear relationship driving the credit bureau-banking crisis nexus.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical framework of the study, the methodology, the variables and the dataset. Section 3 presents and discusses the outcomes of our estimations. The last section concludes and delivers some policy recommendations.","Credit bureaus, corruption and banking stability",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000516,28 May 2022,2022,Research Article,25.0

The reductions are mainly because of the private, non-export, labour- and capital-intensive firms. The EAS policy may encourage firms to reduce coal usage, design more products, decrease capacity investment and even withdraw from the market, thus reducing pollutant emission. Finally, we tested firms’ response in various polluting sectors and found that the EAS policy may cause local governments to fail in distinguishing low pollution sectors from high pollution sectors.","In recent decades, the rapid development of China’s economy has caused significant environmental pollution. To deal with the increasingly serious environmental pollution, China’s central government planned several policies to protect the environment and achieve the goal of sustainable development. However, China’s local governments at provincial and prefecture levels, responsible for executing the environmental policies, made no effort to reduce pollution in their jurisdictions. Local governments are assessed based on local gross domestic product (GDP) and stimulated by fiscal revenue. They tend to ignore environment protection to pursue economic growth. Over the past decades, the attitudes of local and central governments have been inconsistent in protecting the environment.====To solve this problem, the central government promulgated a new policy named the environmental accountability system (EAS) in 2006. The EAS requires superior governments to investigate subordinate local environmental pollution incidents exposed by the media or reported by the public. If local governments do not effectively reduce pollution, the superior governments will hold local government officials accountable and impose administrative or even criminal penalties, which will negatively impact officials’ political performance and promotion. The EAS exerts pressure from top-to-bottom authorities stimulating local governments to exert greater efforts in implementing environmental policies.====Many studies have shown that the EAS has a positive effect on regional environmental quality improvement (Chen and Yang, 2018, Song, 2020). Some qualitative research suggests that the EAS can protect the environment effectively by motivating local governments to implement the environmental policy (Fan, 2009, Li, 2015, Chen, 2017, Xiang and Zhang, 2018, Shi et al., 2020). Compared to qualitative research, quantitative studies provide more convincing evidence. Wu et al. (2016) constructed the provincial panel data from 2004 to 2011 and found that the EAS reduced sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions at the provincial level. Song (2020) built a fixed effect regression model that covered 22 provinces from 2003 to 2017 and found that the EAS encouraged local governments to control pollution emissions and improve environment regulation efficiency. Existing studies have mainly discussed the pollution control effect of the EAS at the regional level, but not at the enterprise level. As enterprises are the specific polluters, we believe that study at the enterprise level will evaluate the environmental governance effect of the EAS policy more accurately and may help to reveal possible mechanisms.====In this study, we construct a difference-in-difference (DID) strategy to estimate the environmental effect of the EAS policy at the firm level. We regard the EAS as an exogenous policy shock and measure its environmental governance effect by constructing a quasi-natural experiment to compare the changes in enterprise pollution emissions before and after implementing the EAS. However, as the EAS is a nationwide policy, it is difficult to find the perfect experimental and control group. Therefore, in this study, we use the continuous DID strategy, rather than the general DID method. Continuous DID allows the difference variable to change continuously if it accurately reflects the significant differences brought about by the EAS policy. This is unlike general DID wherein the requirement of the dummy variable is 0 or 1. We take the change in environmental governance intensity of local governments under the shock of the EAS policy as the difference variable to construct the continuous DID strategy.====To measure the change of environmental governance intensity of each prefecture city government, we collect the environmental word counts in the ecological section of the annual government work report. The relevant word counts in the government work report can be used to measure the intensity of local government environmental governance. Many studies have used this method for analysis (Jiang and Luo (2019)).====This study uses the continuous DID strategy to estimate the policy effect of the EAS and explore the mechanisms at the firm level. We found that the EAS policy can effectively reduce firms’ SO==== emissions and be beneficial for the local environment; this is supported by some existing research (Yu, 2011, Song, 2020). We also found that the reductions are mainly from private firms, non-export firms and labour- and capital-intensive sectors, rather than state-owned enterprises, exporting firms or technology-intensive industries. We reveal the mechanisms that are not covered by existing research. By exerting environmental regulation pressure on local governments, the EAS may encourage firms to reduce coal usage, design more products, decrease investment scale and even withdraw from the market; thus, reducing pollutant emission. In addition, we also explored the responses of enterprises in high and low pollution industries to local government’s strict environment regulations after implementing the EAS policy. We found that high and low pollution enterprises have reduced coal usage, decreased investment and withdrawn from the market. Thus, local governments do not accurately distinguish low pollution enterprises from high pollution enterprises when they exert environmental regulations on firms.====Compared with the existing literature, this study may have three main contributions. First, this study investigates the impact of the EAS on the environment at the firm level, rather than at the regional level. We construct a continuous DID strategy based on local governments’ environmental governance intensity, measured by the environmental words count in the annual government work report, to estimate the effect of EAS on firms’ SO==== emissions, which may lead to more accurate estimation results than regional level. Second, this study reveals the mechanisms of how the EAS promotes industrial firms to reduce pollution emissions. Existing literature does not explore the responses of enterprises to the EAS. We found that the EAS policy strengthens local governments’ environmental regulation intensity, which may urge enterprises to reduce coal usage, increase product innovation, decrease investment scale and even withdraw from the market, thus reducing pollution emissions. Third, this study found that the EAS from the central government may lead local governments to plan ‘not good enough’ regulating strategies. They do not differentiate between low and high pollution firms when regulating, which could lead to the innocent involvement of low pollution firms and negative impacts on their producing. Our findings may provide some references for policy improvement.====The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of the EAS policy. Section 3 explains the change of local government’s governance intensity before and after the EAS. Section 4 presents the method. Section 5 reports the empirical results. Section 6 explores the possible mechanisms.

This result is sensitive to the type of inflation targeting adopted. Soft (unofficial) inflation targeting has no significant effect on the corruption level, giving support to the claim that strong institutional commitment, accompanied by transparency and constant communication with regards to inflation targets by the central bank, provides an adequate price signaling mechanism. In addition, the analysis provides evidence that an efficient rule of law reduces corruption levels significantly, although its effects are rather modest to support the claims that it can solely lessen corruptive behavior in the sample of developing countries.","Corruption is a malaise, especially in the developing world, where corruption levels have remained high for extended periods of time. The complex nature of corruption requires a multidimensional approach in addressing it. It usually has detrimental welfare effects, targeting the most vulnerable groups of the population in terms of their income levels. The empirical literature related to the effects of corruption is pretty straightforward in pointing out the adverse impact corruption has on the macroeconomic and firm-level performance. Shleifer and Vishny (1993) provide two reasons as to why corruption may be costly to economic development – through the weakness of the central government, which allows government agencies to impose independent bribes on government officials, and the secrecy of corruption (in line with Becker’s (1968) misallocation of resources argument). Mauro (1995), Blackburn et al. (2006) and d’Agostino et al. (2016) provide evidence of the negative effect of corruption on economic growth. Pak Hung (2001) finds that a unit increase in the corruption perceptions (CP) index reduces the growth rate of real output by 0.5% points. Using firm-level data, Fisman and Svensson (2007) show the adverse effects of corruption on firm growth and development, and identify this as the main channel for the negative effects of corruption on economic performance at the aggregate level. Alesina and Weder (2002) find that corrupted governments receive less foreign aid. Additionally, corrupt societies genuinely find it difficult to make strides of improvement in reducing corruption, even over the long term, pointing to corruption being a highly persistent process.====Shleifer and Vishny (1993) define corruption as the sale of government property by government officials for private gain. As such it seems that information about prices could play a viable role in this process, and information asymmetry could potentially stimulate corruptive behavior. Indeed, manipulative use of price information for personal gain is addressed in some detail in the literature related to corruption and is of central interest to this paper. According to Rose-Ackerman (1988), one type of such information asymmetry occurs in the process of comparing the market with the contract prices by which the government official sells the public good. In cases when there is high uncertainty about the rate of expected future inflation, the potential adverse effects stemming from the lack of equivalent price information for all economic agents are higher as well. Such price information asymmetry increases the benefits of government agents to circumvent regulations and act for personal gain, as the financial benefits of such actions are very high compared to the eventual costs. In particular, this seems to be the case in developing countries, where the regulative framework fails to provide an efficient mechanism for catching and punishing illegal activities. As a result, corruptive behavior increases. On the other hand, inflation targeting as a monetary policy strategy was proposed due to its ability to directly target the inflation rate, thus anchoring inflation expectations and increasing the confidence of economic agents in the predicted behavior of future price levels by the respective central bank (Gürkaynak et al., 2006).====This study provides an attempt to address this link, focusing on the viability of the inflation targeting regime as a price signaling mechanism that should ease information accessibility for all economic agents, reduce information asymmetry and thus potentially reduce incentives for corruptive actions. The strength of the inflation targeting regime is the lack of an anchor for controlling inflation dynamics. Therefore, the monetary policy is expected to provide an efficient transmission of price information in the economy. In addition to an independent central bank, adopting inflation targeting requires a broader institutional commitment to keep the inflation rate in the pre-set targets, usually over a 2-to-3-year horizon. In fact, Minea et al. (2020) find that adopting inflation targeting significantly improves the institutional quality in developing countries. On the other hand, corruption is closely related to institutional quality and the efficiency of the services that institutions provide. Aidt (2003), Huang and Wei (2006) and Bohn (2010) use corruption as a proxy variable for institutional quality. We attempt to build on the existing empirical literature, which shows that inflation and corruption are positively correlated,==== and address the role of the adoption of inflation targeting as the policy regime, which could potentially alleviate corruption levels through its direct effect and control on the inflation rate.====The paper adopts an empirical approach and provides evidence that adopting inflation targeting lowers corruption in a sample of 61 developing countries for the period between 1990 and 2018. In addition to the modeling strategy based on static models used in some of the prior empirical literature and introduced here primarily for comparative purposes, a dynamic panel data modeling approach is adopted to account for the persistence of corruption and the relevance of the information offered by the history of all explanatory variables, including past economic disturbances. We find that countries that have adopted inflation targeting experience have lower corruption levels, as measured by the corruption perceptions index, controlling for other relevant determinants of corruption identified in the empirical literature: inflation, level of income, income distribution, trade openness and the rule of law. This result is sensitive to the type of inflation targeting adopted, whereas soft (unofficial) inflation targeting has no significant effect on the corruption level, thereby providing support to the claim that strong institutional commitment, accompanied with transparency and constant communication concerning the inflation targets by the central bank, provide an adequate price signaling mechanism. In addition, the analysis provides evidence that a strong rule of law reduces corruption levels significantly, although its effects are rather modest to support the claims that it can single-handedly improve conditions in our sample of developing countries. These results are robust with respect to modifying the specification by using different proxy variables and controls, different treatment of the inflation variable, using alternative measures for the corruption variable, as well as introducing different cross-section and time aggregation subsampling procedures.====The following section provides a brief overview of the economic literature related to corruption, as well as presenting the link between corruption and inflation targeting. Section 3 provides detailed information concerning the nature of the data and the methodology, including a description of the variables, a priori expectations, and the identification strategy used in this paper.

On the other hand, dynamic panel estimates partially corroborate the ","Over the last decades, high and persistent budget and external deficits have occurred in several developed countries. For example, in countries such as the United States, Germany and Sweden, the growth of budget deficits in the 1980s and 1990s was accompanied by a real appreciation of the domestic currency, and, subsequently, a deterioration in the current account (Piersanti, 2000).====There is a substantial body of empirical work on the relationship between budget deficits and external deficits, albeit with different results. Indeed, the diversity of the results in terms of empirical evidence stems from the differences in the econometric techniques, as well as the specifications of the models, the measurement of the data, and the samples used (Algieri, 2013). Accordingly, researchers have been unable to solve this issue and the impact of budget deficits on current account deficits remains inconclusive.====Some studies suggest that the deterioration of external accounts is significantly explained by the occurrence of high budget deficits. This relationship is known as “twin deficits” and was initially studied for the United States when the country experienced significant budget deficits and external deficits in the 1980s, and then for many other countries. It has been proven that the budget deficit and the external deficit are related in some way – which gave rise to the concept of twin deficits (Rosenweig and Tallman, 1993).====Although extensively studied over the last decades, the possible link between both external account deficits and budget deficits, from the perspective of twin deficits, is a subject of controversy among researchers, especially bearing in mind that there is no consensus regarding whether the budget deficit translates into an external deficit, or the opposite. Another view, which is called the Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis (Barro, 1974, Barro, 1989), suggests that the two deficits are not linked. In turn, Summers (1988) supports the Current Account Targeting Hypothesis, whereby the relationship between the budget deficit and the external deficit goes from the latter to the former – that is to say, in the opposite direction. Feldstein and Horioka (1980) find a high correlation between savings and investment, which translates into a bi-directional relationship between the budget balance and the current account balance, with both variables moving together. More recently, Kim and Roubini (2008) advance that “twin divergence” is more likely than “twin deficits” when they are considered endogenous movements of the budget deficit and the current account deficit.====This study considers a set of explanatory and control variables that are commonly listed in the literature as being determinants of the current account balance (macroeconomic, demographics, financial, macroeconomic stability, institutional, and the role of fiscal rules) and adds dummy variables designed to capture the effect of crises on the current account balance. Empirical works such as those of Chinn and Prasad (2003), Cheung et al. (2013), Das (2016), Badinger et al. (2017) and Altayligil and Çetrez (2020) also follow this line.====Additionally, we include political dummy variables to find out whether the political ideology of the government in office (right-wing, centre and left-wing) and the occurrence of legislative elections plays a role in the impact of the budget balance (or general government balance) on the current account balance. The literature surveys of Haan and Klomp (2013) and Potrafke (2017) are related to political budget cycle research on these topics. Haan and Klomp (2013) examine the factors that allow manipulation of the fiscal policy for electoral purposes, at the aggregate level as well as at the level of particular public expenditure items. Potrafke (2017), in turn, carries out a review of the empirical literature about the impact of the political ideology of governments in office on economic policies in OECD countries, concluding that the governments of the right and left adopt different policies with different purposes and results.====We analyse the existence of a relationship between the general government balance and the current external balance for 28 European Union countries between 1996 and 2019. Our empirical analysis uses two complementary econometric methodologies: i) a static panel framework, based on a fixed effects estimator; and ii) a dynamic panel framework, employing a system GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) model. The use of both methodologies is justified by two reasons. On the one hand, the fixed effects estimator enables us to capture relevant time-invariant unobservable country-specific characteristics of the current account balance, and on the other hand, the system GMM model enables the measurement of the persistence and endogeneity of the variables under study.====This paper is organised as follows.

Indeed, during the last 2007/08 global financial crisis, several institutions and economists argued that in that context the fiscal stimuli were important and in the discussion in the aftermath of that crisis made the case for fiscal retrenchment, which, via expectations, drives more private demand and growth. Now, history seems to be repeating and governments increased their spending in 2020 to mitigate the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with advanced economies spending substantially more than developing counties. Because revenue is falling, doing so has led to significant expansion in fiscal deficits globally. These deficits are not sustainable, therefore, fiscal adjustment in the post-COVID-19 period is inevitable. In this paper, we revisit the debate over the non-Keynesian effects of fiscal policy and assess the existence of expansionary fiscal consolidation, private consumption, and private investment in advanced and developing economies since 1970. The main contribution of our article, other than using different approaches to assess fiscal episodes, is in examining whether these effects hold among economies at different stages of development.====We contribute to the literature by applying two filtering techniques to determine so-called fiscal episodes: the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter (which suffers from the identification of spurious cycles, inter alia) and the Hamilton (2018) alternative filtering method. We employ this strategy to circumvent potential issues linked to the common use of the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB), which is readily available from publicly available sources. In this context, a change in the CAPB of a considerable magnitude usually indicates the existence of a fiscal episode. In addition, we also employ the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) World Economic Outlook (WEO) CAPB measure for comparison and completeness, though use of it constrains the country-time coverage.====Using a panel of 37 advanced economies and 137 developing economies over the period 1970–2018, we empirically test whether the negative response of private consumption (and investment) to fiscal consolidation usually expected is reversed. Such an event can arise if, for instance, consumers and investors anticipate future benefits stemming from current fiscal consolidations with an increase in permanent income, then allowing private consumption (and investment) to increase. Moreover, we perform robustness checks to evaluate whether our results are robust among our heterogenous sample of economies.====We find that: (1) an increase in general government spending on final consumption has a positive (Keynesian) effect on real per capita private consumption; (2) a rise in social transfer payments positively affects consumption; (3) when a fiscal consolidation takes place, increases in tax revenue have a positive effect on per capita consumption; (4) evidence emerges of a crowding-in effect for private investment that stems from fiscal retrenchment; (5) the effects are mostly significant for advanced economies, rather than for developing ones; (6) expansionary fiscal consolidation occurs in highly indebted advanced economies, in particular after a tax increase; (7) taxation has negative effects on private consumption in developing economies when they experience a financial crisis and do not consolidate.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature. Section 3 elaborates on the analytical framework to identify fiscal episodes and presents key stylized facts. Section 4 empirically assesses the effects of fiscal adjustments on private consumption and private investment and conducts several robustness checks.

However, traditional ==== focuses on certain key reasons, while ignoring the impact of other factors. Since 1978, China has achieved unprecedented economic growth, but also faces low per capita GDP. To clarify the driving forces behind this situation, we used per capita GDP to represent China’s economic growth and performed total factor analysis based on 13 variables in 7 socioeconomic dimensions using panel data from 30 Chinese provinces over the 40 years since China opened to the west in 1978. We found similar determinants in different regressions. Internal trade, privatization and investment were the primary factors driving Chinese economic development. Surprisingly, we found that the contribution of foreign trade to economic growth (per capita GDP) was weak. Education had a much smaller contribution than science and technology. Using per capita income as the dependent variable to provide a robustness test, we found that China’s income distribution has not paralleled its economic development and the distribution of the benefits of GDP growth to citizens must be improved. China’s experience demonstrates that promoting economic growth requires coordinated development of many factors, and that different policy preferences should be adopted to meet different economic development conditions.","Economic growth is the basis of social progress and political stability (Ip and Law, 2011, Cao and Ren, 2019). In recent decades, economic growth has been the focus of the public, of enterprises, and of politicians around the world. However, while some countries and regions have experienced rapid economic growth, others have not. Economists have proposed a variety of explanations, such as factor endowment (Henri, 2019), human capital management (Schultz, 1961), competitive advantage (Porter, 1991), endowment of natural resources (Hilmawan and Clark, 2019), and institutional change (Acemoglu et al., 2005). These theories explain the driving factors responsible for economic growth, but only examine growth from a single perspective, thereby ignoring the simultaneous impact of other factors on economic growth. Also, it has not been documented whether these theories can explain economic growth in developing countries.====Since China opened to the West in 1978, it has been gradually transitioning from a government-controlled economy to a socialist market economy (i.e., it has been undergoing marketization). During this period, China’s GDP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 10% and increased to 33.5 times its 1978 level, which is the fastest and greatest growth in human history (McMillan and Naughton, 1992, Zheng et al., 2009, Zhu, 2012). Another important measure of economic development, per capita GDP, has grown even faster (from 382 RMB in 1978 to 70774 RMB in 2019), but this growth is far less impressive because China still ranks only 65th in the world based on this metric. According to the World Bank (2021), China has become an upper- to middle-income country. While this is reassuring, it also raises concerns about whether China will fall into a “middle-income trap”, in which per capita income no longer grows, as has been the case for Latin America (Paus, 2012). Obviously, it is not reasonable to judge a country’s development trend solely based on per capita GDP. Only by understanding the causes of China’s rapid economic growth and revealing the advantages and disadvantages of the country’s current development can we compare China to other countries and provide an objective judgment of its future development.====Economists around the world have closely examined the factors underlying China’s massive and sustained growth (Chow, 1993, Chen and Feng, 2000, Wu, 2000, Fleisher et al., 2010). However, they have mostly examined factors in isolation without comparing the relative importance of multiple factors. This may be because economists often focus narrowly on their specific field of study, and the failure to consider insights from other fields prevents their interpretations from being comprehensive. Moreover, the time span of most studies has been short, so it has not been possible to comprehensively evaluate China’s economic growth since the 1978 reform and opening up policy dramatically changed socioeconomic conditions in the country. In the present study, we improved on previous research by adopting a multi-factor approach that provides a more comprehensive understanding of the driving forces behind China’s economic growth, that is, we performed a total factor contributions analysis of China’s economic growth. In addition, the socioeconomic factors were based on provincial statistical data from 1978 to 2017, thereby providing a longer-term study compared to most previous research. Finally, we defined two classes of dependent variables (per capita GDP and three types of per capita income) to determine whether China’s overall economic growth (per capita GDP) produced comparable benefits for its citizens (per capita income). For the independent factors driving these two variables, we chose 13 variables from 7 socioeconomic dimensions as potential influencing factors to support a total factor analysis. In addition, we chose China’s membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the point that separated two periods with very different economic conditions to observe how the factor contributions changed. We ranked per capita GDP from high to low, and used a panel quantile regression to detect differences in the factor contributions under different per capita GDP levels.====Our research provides the following innovations: We examined more variables than in previous research, over a longer term; repeated our analysis for per capita income to provide a test of the robustness of an approach based only on GDP by identifying different driving factors for the two approaches; and examined changes in the driving factors between the periods before and after China’s membership in the WTO. Our research will provide insights to guide future policy development initiatives in China as well as in other developing countries around the world.",What has caused China’s economic growth?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000449,19 April 2022,2022,Research Article,31.0

Compared to machine learning methods (which encompass artificial neural networks, gradient boost, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests methods), a multinomial logistic approach outperforms during pre-crisis periods and when crisis severity is modeled, whereas gradient boost has the highest predictive accuracy across numerous versions of the multinomial model. As investors and policy makers continue to confront banking crises, leading to high economic and social costs, enhanced multinomial modeling methods make a valuable contribution to improved forecasting performance.","The global financial crisis highlights the rapid pace and disruptive force in which an unexpected catastrophe can severely affect the world economy. Because of obliviousness to the mounting vulnerabilities permeating across continents, widespread economic and financial losses lingered for many years. Adverse economic conditions drove many countries into recession, with numerous economies still trapped in stagnation after a decade. Since its inception, rooted in its guardrails to protect depositors’ savings (Andreau, 1999), the centuries-old financial institution of banking inherently has a fiduciary obligation to its depositors. The absence of trust in the maturity transformation practices of financial services leads to several financial risks including Pareto-inefficient capital allocation and stagnating economic growth.====Yet financial crises are neither low-frequency events nor a recent phenomenon. In their long-term studies on financial crises, Kindleberger (1978) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) both find that crises have a long history that affect most countries and are universal in nature as well as a transitory phase in developing countries. The distinctive characteristics of banking crises continue to result in debilitating experiences for both developed and emerging economies. Indeed, the inherent instability of economic markets over the past two centuries are studied by the philosophers John Stuart Mill (1848) and Trotsky (1973), neo-Keynesians including Hyman Minsky (1992), historical economists such as Nikolai Kondratieff (Thompson, 1994), and the behavioral economists Akerlof and Shiller (2009) and feature in several academic studies including Bordo and Schwartz (1996), Mishkin (2000), Ferguson (2002), Chant (2003), Illing and Liu (2003) and Schularick and Taylor (2012).====The disruption to global markets is very expensive and damaging. Not only does an economic catastrophe rupture interaction between the financial sector and the real economy, but it leads to a crisis of confidence, which disintegrates financial intermediation and causes stark balance sheet constraints and significant variations in credit flows and asset prices. In a study on 37 countries aimed at quantifying the impact of economic crises on the national economy, Laeven and Valencia (2008) find that the average loss totals 20 percent of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, the cost of fiscal support could be between 9 percent and 21 percent of GDP, for developed and emerging markets, respectively, and has reached as much as 55 percent of GDP (BIS, 1996; Caprio and Klingebiel, 1996; Dziobek and Pazarbasioglu, 1997; IMF, 1998; Jonung and Hagberg, 2005; Rojas-Suarez and Weisbrod, 1996). In the aftermath of a catastrophe, many countries also face high social costs, such as severe unemployment, increased poverty, subdued exports, and weak income growth. Pro-cyclical spending by central banks and governments to stimulate economic growth or prevent financial institutions from insolvency further leads to large reductions in fiscal budgets and sudden reversals in current account balances. In terms of the types of financial crises, recovering from a banking crisis takes the longest, just over three years, and slightly worse when it coincides with a currency crisis (IMF, 1998).====It is therefore imperative to study financial crises in order to identify their causes, formation, and leading indicators to assist policy makers to detect the condition in which a disaster is probable and to produce reliable early warning signals that allow an adequate response with preemptive resolutions. In the context of the recent global financial crisis, an ostensibly local banking calamity in the United States evolved into a multifaceted financial catastrophe around the world, causing balance of payments shocks, sharp currency depreciation, and a lingering debt crisis in Europe. As such, the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the econometric literature on the cyclical formation of banking sector crises, specifically as it relates to an assessment of the existence of multiple observable phases, with a focus on evaluation of the leading, coincidental, and lagging indicators in order to inform preventive measures and support recovery. As part of its secondary objective, scrutiny of the degree of heterogeneity of precursors, the paper offers an investigation into the region, development, and period effects in addition to distinguishing the levels of severity of financial distress.====The study spans four decades of banking crises and involves a sample totaling 49 countries, of which 28 suffered 41 crises. The explanatory variables consist of real sector, banking sector, and external sector predictors. The main econometric approach is a multinomial logistic regression with four outcomes, specifying the probability of a no-crisis, pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis phase. Probit and machine learning models serve as benchmarks.====Corroborating findings in the literature on precursors to banking crises, the study shows that GDP is highly significant in all phases, with a concomitant deterioration in consumption spending and fixed capital formation affected by a preceding credit boom. A currency depreciation exemplifies ensuing financial distress, reinforced by developmental constructs and regional integration. Lower real interest rates, increasing imports, and rising deposits are frequently harbingers of a recovery. Our results highlight the evolution of precursors to banking distress over time and suggest that the scale of development can be a vital indicator of contagion and resolution. Adding fixed effects to the model to account for severity gives it greater predictive power. Numerous derivatives of multinomial logistic models outperform a selection of modern machine learning models across predictions based on the pre-crisis phase and severity. Several multinomial logistic models also attain higher predictive accuracy than traditional binomial models. Gradient boost has the highest accuracy rates across most model derivates.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the empirical literature, and Section 3 describes the econometric methodology, with Section 4 dedicated to variable selection.

Institutional similarity does not reduce the hazard of exits, and MNCs from high-risk countries exit less when home-country risk increases. Subsidiaries from countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia are less likely to exit, though sanctions interact with host-country risks, making them more severe. Being large and being part of a greenfield project help subsidiaries to build resistance against host-country political risks. These findings provide empirical evidence that support our conclusions regarding foreign direct investment volatility in countries with high risk.","Since the global financial crisis in 2008, the cumulative stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Russia has decreased, and FDI inflows have been fragile. According to the World Investment Reports (UNCTAD, 2015-2020), new FDI flows to Russia nearly dried up in 2015, and, hampered by trade restrictions imposed on by trading partners and Russia since 2014, were slow to recover afterward. Many high-profile and large-scale divestment have been reported. For example, ConocoPhillips sold its oil and gas assets and left Russia (Financial Times, 2015). General Motors closed its St. Petersburg assembly plant and took a $600 million write-off soon after US sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014. (Fortune, 2015). The Russian government forced Shell to concede 35 percent of its stake in the Sakhalin-2 project to Gazprom, a local energy group (Guardian, 2006). At the end of 2019, work was halted on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, even though 94 percent of the pipeline was complete, because European companies involved in the project were threatened with penalties by the US (BBC News, January 21, 2021).====At the same time, after the partial privatization of Alrosa and Rosneft, in diamond mining and oil companies, respectively, several landmark FDI entries took place. Multinational corporations (MNCs) that increased their operations in Russia, included BP, ExxonMobil, Glencore, Daimler, and Schlumberger. Schlumberger purchased 51 percent of the Eurasia Drilling Company (EDC), but the Russian government declared that Schlumberger’s operational and ownership control of EDC could be reversed if the US intensifies sanctions (Kommersant, 2018).====Our study analyzes the influence of political risk on exit decisions by MNCs. The literature tends to focus on the influence of political risk on choice of entry location, rather than on exit decisions. We expand the research on politically troubled markets by analyzing the factors that increase or decrease the length of stay by an MNC. Our exit analysis not only highlights the effects of risks on exit during various periods and distinguishes between the exit strategies of genuine and round-tripping==== MNCs, we also incorporate relations between the home and host countries, including the effects of political distance, the imposition of sanctions, the existence of a bilateral investment treaty, and the impact of political risk in the home country.====All MNCs face political risk, especially when firms from countries with weak institutions interact with counties that have strong institutions (we refer to these country groups as “South” and “North,” respectively). Although the decision to divest has its own risks and costs, MNCs that are more sensitive to political tension might choose this path. If policy makers want to maintain FDI, it is important for them to gain a better understanding of behavior by MNCs in order to design measures to prevent exits and to protect the jobs, business activity, and technology learning that are associated with FDI. From the perspective of businesses, it is important to spot the drivers of divestment that sometimes make exit unavoidable.====The main outcome that we seek to explain in this paper is exits, which is a company’s decision to liquidate or sell a subsidiary in a host-country market. Thus, unlike Dunne et al., 2003, we are not studying the mortality of plants but, rather, decisions to stop producing in Russia. Our chief explanatory factor is political risk. We assess the political risks and constraints that arise from changing political and governance environments and might affect a company’s operations and profit in the host and home countries.====Five main research questions are studied: (1) How does political risk in host and home countries affect the decision to exit, and does it vary over time and across industries? (2) Which types of political risk are most likely to explain exits? (3) Does the effect of political risk on exit depend on political differences between the home and host locations? (4) Have sanctions catalyzed the effect of political risks? (5) What mechanisms protect MNCs from a host country’s political environment and make them less likely to exit?====In line with the industrial organization and institutional literature, and the real options concept, we hypothesize that MNCs that operate in Russia are, to some degree, tolerant of political risk, therefore, the exit decision is influenced by a perceived increase in risk. MNCs originating in home countries with a strong institutional framework experience lower political risk and may be more risk averse than companies familiar with a weak institutional environment. At the same time, some MNCs may have better resource capabilities that enable greater resilience to the higher costs associated with higher risk. Because of these possible variations, we have no firm expectations regarding similarities or differences in the respective political environments. We do, however, expect that larger subsidiaries, local partnerships, or bilateral investment treaties increase the bargaining power of an MNC and protect it from a host government’s political challenges, as well as pressures from the home country.====Because Russia has high levels of instability but is also endowed with natural resources and a large domestic market, it is an appropriate empirical setting for studying the effects of political risks on multinational exit behavior. Certain financial difficulties and limited freedom caused by sanctions place constraints on Russian authorities in their relations with MNCs. Divestments of various kinds have taken place in practically all industries, and some instances of direct expropriation of foreign firms have occurred. For example, immediately after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, more than two hundred Ukrainian firms were expropriated on the pretext of “unfair prior privatization” (RIA (News, 2015)).====Our empirical analysis shows that foreign MNCs are highly vulnerable to an increase in political risk, which motivates market withdrawal. This effect is relevant mostly for investors in mining, construction, and services. MNCs are particularly sensitive to problems associated with law and order in Russia and military involvement in politics and conflict in the home country. Political similarity does not tend to make MNCs from developing countries “weather the storm” better. When political distance increases, Southern MNCs exit slightly less, though this pattern is driven mostly by political troubles in the home location. Subsidiaries from a state imposing sanctions are less likely to exit, and the impact of host-country political risk is stronger for MNCs headquartered in states that imposed sanctions. Various structural factors might shield foreign subsidiaries from political problems and create greater resistance to exits: the size of the subsidiary, greenfield projects, and joint ventures with local partners. Interestingly, the market selection mechanism seems to become less efficient when the institutional environment deteriorates.====In Section 2, we outline the literature that inspired our study. 3 Dataset, 4 Variables and econometric strategy describe the data and our empirical strategy, including the construction of dependent and explanatory variables.

Employing a weighted least squares (WLS) methodology, we provide empirical evidence on the role of institutional quality in shaping the working capital policies of European listed firms. The results indicate that firms located in countries with a stronger institutional framework maintain lower levels of working capital on average. The results are robust to different subsamples of firms. The study complements the extant literature by analyzing the effects of institutional quality on working capital management, across a large number of different institutional systems specific to developed and transition economies alike. The results are useful for practitioners and policy makers in understanding the relationship between institutional quality and short-term firm-level decisions.","The effects of institutional factors on business activity have been recognized by many researchers (Alam et al., 2019; Marks-Bielska et al., 2020; Stankevice and Jucevicius, 2013). The national institutional systems provide a stable environment for business, with the potential for evolution from short-term competency to long-term visions (Klarin and Ray, 2019). The national institutional systems have been shown to influence cash holdings (Dittmar and Mahrt-Smith, 2007, Kusnadi, 2019, Orlova and Sun, 2018, Pinkowitz et al., 2006) and, respectively, firm performance (Faruq and Weidner, 2018, Fidrmuc et al., 2017, Ghoul et al., 2017, Gölgeci et al., 2019).====The importance of working capital management is recognized in the extant literature. Working capital is the cheapest source of cash (PWC Annual Report, 2019), and thus trade credit has become the largest source of financing for the majority of businesses in Western countries (Matto and Niskanen, 2021). The empirical evidence suggests that working capital management is important for creating value, and thus firms need to find and maintain the optimal level. For example, global listed companies would benefit from a cash release of €1.3 trillion (1.456 trillion USD) if they improved the efficiency of working capital (PWC Annual Report, 2019). In other words, by optimizing working capital, global listed companies can free up resources for investment, without requiring additional funding. Despite the important role that working capital management plays for corporations, little is known about whether and how institutional factors explain observed differences in working capital levels (Matto and Niskanen, 2021).====The purpose of the paper is to analyze the impact of institutional factors on working capital management for a large sample of European listed firms in the period after the global financial crisis. our analysis is conducted for a large sample of 5431 listed firms from the European Union (EU), over the period 2010–2018, meaning that the research has to address different peculiarities in the business environment specific to both developed economies and emerging markets alike. Moreover, our analysis is conducted for a couple of under-researched European emerging markets, which face issues related to the varying level of institutions (Baumöhl et al., 2019), as emerging markets are characterized by weak institutions (Yang, 2018). The nexus between institutions and working capital in emerging European countries is analyzed for several reasons. The impact of the institutional environment on working capital management is more important because emerging markets have lower institutional quality than developed economies. Political connections have a negative influence on the value of cash holdings for firms in emerging markets, as demonstrated by Kusnadi (2019). Moreover, in the 1990s, the Central and Eastern European countries went through a complex economic process through the privatization and reform of institutions (Baumöhl et al., 2019). Also, the topic is highly important for firms from the new member states of the EU, because of the challenges regarding the EU accession and, immediately afterward, the negative consequences of the global financial crisis on corporate performance. This is why we test the robustness of the results on two different subsamples of EU countries: old member states (OMS) and new member states (NMS).==== The results highlight an inverse relationship between variables for institutional quality and the excess working capital ratio (WKR), except for fiscal freedom, meaning that firms headquartered in countries with a strong institutional environment tend to accumulate less working capital. All the institutional variables are found to be statistically significant predictors of the working capital ratio, except business freedom. In the subsamples, in the case of the OMS, the variables for institutional quality, except for fiscal freedom, are negatively related to the working capital ratio. Except for monetary freedom and business freedom, all the institutional variables are found to be statistically significant. Also, in the case of the NMS, the signs of the coefficients remain unchanged. Therefore, the robustness tests on subsamples show that the research findings are stable.====This paper makes several important contributions to the literature, as follows. First, the paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of working capital management. The paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of the association between the institutional environment and working capital management for European listed firms while controlling for firm-specific characteristics and firm- and time-fixed effects. A few studies have been conducted on the relationship between a couple of stand-alone institutional quality variables (Baños-Caballero et al., 2019, Troilo et al., 2019) and working capital policies, but no comprehensive study tests the impact of all the institutional variables on working capital management. In order to advance knowledge in the field, we consider eight relevant variables grouped into four broad categories (rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets), along with firm-specific control variables, and identify how these institutional quality variables shape working capital management policies for a large sample of European public listed companies. Second, by employing a sample of both old and new EU member states, the research adds new insights to the institutional quality literature, by showing how the transition process (and thus the improved institutional framework) influences working capital management policies, using the example of old and new EU member states. To our knowledge, no research exists that focuses explicitly on the effects of fiscal freedom in shaping working capital management policies. The corporate finance literature typically considers only the effects of the regulatory environment on working capital (Baños-Caballero et al., 2019, Matto and Niskanen, 2021, Troilo et al., 2019).====The remainder of this study is organized as follows.

Likewise, a significant number of risk-averse economic agents avoid investing their aggregate wealth in risky financial assets,==== preferring to invest most of it in the labor market and receive rent as return on human wealth. In this conjecture, the return on financial and human wealth has equal importance in approximating the return on aggregate wealth (Lustig et al., 2013). The value, riskiness and expected returns of human wealth (human capital, HC) play a vital role in understanding the pricing of assets and real investment made by both economic agents and firms. Concurrently, the human and financial wealth nexus plays an essential part in asset pricing, as proposed by Bansal et al. (2014) and Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008), because the joint dynamics of human and financial wealth constituents have implications for the dynamics of aggregate wealth, which in turn has greater significance for the asset pricing framework. Lustig et al. (2013) study the return on the constituents of aggregate wealth and uncover that financial wealth (stock market wealth) is only 1% of aggregate wealth, whereas non-human wealth (all non-human wealth) is a mere 8%. Furthermore, they claim that human wealth is 92% of the aggregate household wealth of the United States (US). Similarly, Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989) find that human wealth constitutes 90% of aggregate wealth, and Palacios (2015) shows that the share of HC in aggregate wealth is approximately 93%.====The conventional approach to proxy the return on aggregate wealth is to use return on equity market portfolio. Moreover, the underlying assumptions of the conventional approach proxying aggregate wealth have been criticized by Merton (1973), who concludes that the risk associated with an asset is measured by its covariance with the marginal utility of investors. He further documents the importance of wage income (rent as return on human wealth), with its relative price changing over time in an intertemporal capital asset pricing (ICAPM) framework. The wage income (labor income) proxying the return on human wealth is an indispensable constituent of aggregate wealth.====Jagannathan and Wang (1996) introduced the labor income proxy measuring the return on human wealth and the value-weighted market portfolio in an ICAPM framework. The model specification performs better than static CAPM in explaining the cross-section of average returns, as confirmed by Prono (2015). Similarly, Hansson (2004) uses a direct measure of labor income growth at the firm level, which proxies the return on human wealth and the market portfolio, and the results suggest that the dispersion in the wage growth rate explains the variation in stock returns. Concurrently, Campbell (1996) employs a multifactor equilibrium model in an ICAPM framework to explain the variation in US stock and bond returns. Campbell advocates that human wealth is an integral part of aggregate wealth and an important component in asset return predictability. The priced factors in Cambell’s ICAPM framework include the market portfolio, innovation in future stock returns and innovation in labor income growth. The results confirm that the market portfolio is the primary component explaining excess returns. However, in the presence of human wealth and innovation in the market portfolio, the sensitivity of relative risk aversion is relatively higher than that of the market portfolio. Campbell (1996) used labor income to proxy innovation in human wealth. Explicitly, these studies suggest that labor income (labor income growth) is a good measure of the human wealth component.====Deaton (1992) advocates that economic agents maximize the current utility by saving for a rainy day to smooth future consumption with the expectation of a fall in future labor income. Saving captures essential information about innovations in future labor income and is therefore an excellent measure to proxy innovation in future labor income. Briefly, labor income growth is the measure of return on current human wealth, whereas saving is the measure of return on future human wealth. We use twin measures of the human wealth component, the Hansson index (HI) following Hansson (2004) and labor income growth following Campbell (1996), both proxying return on current human wealth. HI is the firm-specific measure, whereas labor income growth (LBR) is an aggregate measure of return on human wealth. To the best of our knowledge, the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus across developed and emerging economies and the aggregate level has not previously been examined. Hence, this motivates our present research.====Our primary objective is to examine the dynamics of the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus. To attain this objective, we introduce an equilibrium two-factor asset pricing model in an ICAPM framework as the base model. Consequently, we employ this model in two different frameworks to disentangle the dynamics of current and future human wealth along with financial wealth (measured through the market portfolio) in return predictability. The first two-factor asset pricing framework exclusively examines the dynamics of current human wealth and financial wealth in return predictability. In contrast, the other two-factor asset pricing framework tests the dynamics of future human wealth and financial wealth in return predictability. Labor income growth is the measure of return on current human wealth, whereas saving is the measure of return on future human wealth. The first set of the two-factor asset pricing frameworks employs human wealth and the market portfolio as discounting factors, whereas the second set uses saving and the market portfolio.====An evolutionary work by Fama and French (1993, FF), who proposed a three-factor asset pricing model that includes the market portfolio, size and value factors, shows immense success in the cross-sectional return predictability across economies. The literature on asset pricing advocates that size (Asness et al., 2018, Fama and French, 2012) and value (Estrada and Serra, 2005) factors are present worldwide. Hence, these factors are strong contenders in our two-factor asset pricing frameworks, which form a four-factor asset pricing framework. Carhart (1997) proposed a four-factor model and concluded that the sensitivity of the momentum effect is priced separately from the three factors of FF’s model. Furthermore, after adding size and value factors into our basic two-factor asset pricing framework, we introduced momentum as a priced factor and proposed a five-factor asset pricing model. Including and controlling for size, value and momentum effects in the existing two-factor frameworks will further assure the predictive power of their underlying discounting factors. Accordingly, two broad sets of frameworks consisting of two-factor, four-factor and five-factor asset pricing models examine the average return on FF size-B/M (book-to-market) portfolios across developed and emerging economies.====Primarily, panel regression with fixed and random effects is employed to estimate the parameters of two-factor, four-factor and five-factor asset pricing models of both frameworks for developed and emerging economies and the aggregate level. Further, Hausman’s specification test is used to identify the approach (among fixed and random effects) that yields a better estimate of the parameters. Second, we employ the generalized method of moments (GMM) and instrumental variable (IV-GMM) specifications to overcome measurement errors. Third, we employ the Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (GRS) test as a robustness check to evaluate the economic performance of both asset pricing frameworks. We used the monthly panel datasets of developed economies, emerging economies and the aggregate level to estimate the parameters of two sets of asset pricing frameworks.====Our approach to studying the dynamics of the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus leads to the following conclusions. First, we find that the share of financial wealth in aggregate wealth for developed economies, emerging economies and at the aggregate level is 2.9%, 3.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The empirical results show that market portfolio and labor income growth in the first set of the framework and saving and market portfolio in the second set emerged as the prime components in explaining the variation in average returns on FF portfolios for developed economies and the aggregate level. Second, both asset pricing frameworks pass the GRS test for developed economies and the aggregate level, while it convincingly rejects both frameworks for emerging economies. Third, the empirical results show that the GRS test rejects the first set of the asset pricing framework that includes HI as a firm-specific measure of human wealth along with the market portfolio for both developed and emerging economies. Notably, saving is more difficult to measure in developing than in developed economies, whether at the household level or as a macroeconomic aggregate.====Our analysis and empirical results bring together and extend two large bodies of empirical work. First, we contribute to the literature on the dynamics of financial and human wealth components of aggregate wealth in measuring the risk of an asset. Previous studies estimated the risk and return relationship explicitly considering the financial wealth component. In contrast, few tried to estimate the risk and return relationship considering the human wealth component besides the financial wealth in aggregate wealth. Moreover, our measure of financial and human wealth components of aggregate wealth enables us to examine the dynamics of the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus in asset return predictability besides controlling for the predictability of common factors. Second, the empirical results of our study indicate that the nexus of the market portfolio, human wealth and saving, and its dynamic linkages, substantially drive the variation in average return on different asset classes across the dynamic economies. Further, the empirical results confirm that the predictability of the priced factors in approximating the average return on FF size-B/M portfolios varies across the dynamic economies. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind that investigates the dynamics of the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus across developed and emerging economies.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief literature review on the saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus. Section 3 describes the data and variable definitions. After a brief discussion of the econometric models in Section 4, Section 5 presents the summary of explanatory and explained variables. Section 6 presents the parameter estimation results of both asset pricing frameworks. The results of the robustness tests are discussed in Section 7. Section 8 offers an economic interpretation of the results. Section 9 provides a summary and discussion, and Section 10 concludes.","The saving, human wealth and asset pricing nexus: Evidence from around the world",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000395,29 March 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

North Cyprus, Turkey","Received 5 June 2021, Revised 25 January 2022, Accepted 15 February 2022, Available online 23 March 2022, Version of Record 1 June 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.100974,Cited by (2),"This paper examines the impact of policy, political, and economic uncertainty on firm-level capital investment in Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Turkey. Our results indicate an insignificant relationship between uncertainty and investment in these countries. This finding is robust to six different uncertainty measures, including time-series uncertainty indices that track either local or global uncertainty and country-level electoral activities. The results are also robust to two different proxies for measuring corporate investment. Overall, the real-option mechanism in which firms delay ==== in uncertain times does not hold in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Turkey.","This paper examines the impact of policy-induced economic uncertainty on firm-level investment decisions in five emerging markets: Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Turkey.==== A growing literature examines the impact of policy-related uncertainty on firm-level investment decisions (e.g., Binding and Dibiasi, 2017; Gulen and Ion, 2016; Jens, 2017; Julio and Yook, 2012; Wang et al., 2014) and economic outcomes (e.g., Aizenman and Marion, 1993; Alesina and Rodrik, 1994; Baker and Bloom, 2013; Julio and Yook, 2014). These papers find that uncertainty related to future policies has a negative impact on firm-level investment and economic outcomes. Motivated by that notion, this paper tests a basic hypothesis: Events that increase the likelihood of economic policy change reduce firm-level capital investment.====The real-option theory predicts that when uncertainty about future economic outcomes increases, capital investment decreases, because the option of waiting for uncertainty to decline is more profitable (Bernanke, 1983, MacDonald and Siegel, 1986, Pindyck, 1988, Titman, 1985). The real-option argument assumes that capital investment is costly and irreversible.==== This argument is supported empirically by Gulen and Ion (2016) for firms operating in the US and by Wang et al. (2014) for firms in China. Binding and Dibiasi (2017) document a similar effect for irreversible investment amid exchange rate risk in Switzerland, whereas Guiso and Parigi (1999) reported the negative impact of uncertainty about firm-level profitability on irreversible investment in Italy. In addition, several studies show that policy uncertainty influences financial markets via the channel of capital costs (see, e.g., Belo et al., 2013; Boutchkova et al., 2012; Brogaard and Detzel, 2015; Cooper et al., 2010; Durnev, 2012; Kelly et al., 2016a, Kelly et al., 2016b; Pastor and Veranosi, 2012, Pastor and Vernossi, 2013; Santa-Clara and Valkanov, 2003; Xiaolei et al., 2017). The findings of these papers support the idea of waiting for uncertainty to diminish before investing, because policy uncertainty increases the cost of capital and thus decreases the current value of investment.====Despite its sound theoretical predictions, measuring policy-induced uncertainty is rather difficult. For instance, Jens (2017) and Julio and Yook (2012) report the negative impact of elections on firm-level investment in the US. However, elections do not fully capture the overall uncertainty faced by firms. Countless examples exist of significant shocks to the economic environment that occurred independently of elections (e.g., crises, wars, trade wars, pandemics, stock/debt market crashes, terrorist attacks, and large bankruptcies). An economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index constructed by Baker et al. (2016) peaks around such events, and thus it can serve as an overall uncertainty measure. Using the EPU index, Gulen and Ion (2016) document a negative relationship between the EPU and firm-level capital investment in the US. Wang et al. (2014) reported similar findings for China. Yet the impact of policy-related uncertainty on firm-level decisions has been mostly overlooked regarding less developed economies, mainly due to the absence of a related index. Ahir et al. (2018) construct a new uncertainty index that tracks policy, political, and economic uncertainty (PPEU) in 143 countries, including the emerging Eastern European Markets (EEMs) and Turkey. The PPEU index enables the testing of the uncertainty-investment relationshiop hypothesis in economies with various development levels and political structures.====This paper uses the PPEU index of Ahir et al. (2018) to examine the impact of policy-induced uncertainty on corporate investment decisions in emerging markets in Eastern Europe and Turkey. The new PPEU index could have several advantages over the EPU index used by prior researchers. First, it is constructed based on the counts of ==== and related indications presented in the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) country reports. These reports, unlike newspaper articles, which are the basis for the EPU index, investigate important events related to politics and economics alongside analyst forecasts on future economic conditions. Its reliance on a single source that has specific coverage (i.e., EIU reports) increases the consistency of the PPEU index. According to Ahir et al. (2018), the EIU reports have a standardized structure, and they are free of ideological bias. Additionally, the index can forecast declines in economic output, and, like the EPU, it peaks around important events (e.g., the 9/11 attacks, pandemics, the UK Brexit vote, the Gulf War, and the European debt crisis). Second, the PPEU is negatively related to economic growth and positively related to stock market volatility and the EPU index of Baker et al. (2016). Basically, the index can forecast future economic outcomes based on the empirical findings of Ahir et al. (2018). Finally, it is available on a country basis, covering emerging markets as well, while the index of Baker et al. (2016) is mostly suitable for advanced economies.====As indicated earlier, our analysis is not the first to test the implications of policy uncertainty on firm-level investment decisions. But it complements this line of the literature by providing new evidence from the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Turkey. Accordingly, this paper makes at least two important contributions to the existing literature. First, it combines the literature on politics, economics, and finance by controlling for the probable effect of political and economic policy change on the capital investment behavior of firms in emerging markets. The new index, constructed by Ahir et al. (2018), which is expected to capture the characteristics of political and economic uncertainty, is used. This index is not based on mainstream media as is the conventional EPU index of Baker et al. (2016), but it counts uncertainty and related indications published in the EIU country reports. Accordingly, it stands out as a more consistent measure of economic and political uncertainty faced by countries. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study to test this new index to explain corporate-level investment decisions.====Second, unlike developed economies with predictable economic outcomes and low inflation rates, firms in emerging markets suffer from high inflation and unpredictable economic outcomes. The currency depreciation problem in emerging economies puts additional pressure on managers trying to make optimal investment decisions. To account for this effect, the inflation rates in the sample countries are also included in the models. Accordingly, our findings might shed light on the uncertainty-investment relation in less developed economies under the corporate investment behavior hypothesis via the lens of the real-option theory. Therefore, we make a contribution to the understanding of theory in emerging markets, considering economies at different development levels.====The results of this paper indicate that uncertainty related to political policy and economic policy do not significantly influence corporate investment decisions in emerging markets in Eastern Europe. This finding is robust to different policy-induced uncertainty measures, including country-level indices, global-level indices, and national electoral activities. The results are also robust to the use of different proxies for corporate investment. More important, in contrast to the findings of Binding and Dibiasi (2017) and Dibiasi et al. (2018) on Switzerland, Gulen and Ion (2016) on the US, and Wang et al. (2014) on China, firm-specific differences, such as managerial flexibility, financial constraints, and investment irreversibility, do not influence investment decisions amid country-specific uncertainty (i.e., PPEU). However, according to the findings, managerial flexibility affects investment decisions in face of a broader uncertainty measure, the world uncertainty index. Yet the impact of global uncertainty on investment decisions is not significant in the aggregate. Consequently, the real-option argument fails to explain the investment behavior of firms operating in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and Turkey.====One possible theoretical explanation for the failure to document significant wait-and-see behavior in the emerging market setting is that the two opposite mechanisms of uncertainty-investment relation, the real-option versus growth-option, are canceled out in the aggregate. Contrary to the real-option mechanism, the growth-option mechanism speculates that companies that have investment projects with longer time spans (see, e.g., Bar-Ilan and Strange, 1996) or relatively reversible investment (see, e.g., Abel and Elberly, 1994) might increase their investment amid uncertainty. This is because potential losses from investment during uncertainty is bounded by the initial cost, but potential revenues are unbounded. For instance, the results by Binding and Dibiasi (2017) show that the two mechanisms (i.e., real option and growth option) were used simultaneously in Switzerland amid a policy change in the Swiss franc exchange rate; firms cut investment in equipment and machinery but increased investment in research and development. Accordingly, their results indicate that uncertainty influences equipment and machinery investment through the real-option effect and research and development through the growth-option effect. Similarly, Dibiasi et al. (2018) show that firms with irreversible investment reduced their investment expenditure, but others with reversible investment increased, following an unexpected vote in a referendum about the Swiss immigrant policy (see also Guiso and Parigi, 1999). Accordingly, in our analysis, the aggregate effect of uncertainty through different channels could lead to an insignificant investment-uncertainty relationship. The results by Bachman and Bayar (2013) support this argument, saying that uncertainty can account for only a small amount of variation in aggregate investment of the German sample. Finally, using firm-level uncertainty data, Lautenbacher (2020) show that, although some firms followed with a wait-and-see strategy amid higher uncertainty, the real-option mechanism is not significant in the aggregate in Germany. According to Lautenbacher, this finding is due to the subjective nature of uncertainty at the managerial level. Following these papers, we offer a possible theoretical explanation of the results obtained in the current paper, the two opposite mechanisms cancel each other out in the aggregate. Future studies should investigate this theoretical question in more detail in the emerging markets setting.====The rest of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 develops testable hypotheses; Section 3 describes the sample selection, data, variables, descriptive statistics, and model specifications; Section 4 reports the results from uncertainty-investment models; Section 5 conducts robustness tests; and Section 6 concludes the paper.","The impact of policy, political and economic uncertainty on corporate capital investment in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and Turkey",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093936252200036X,23 March 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

Our results reveal that systemic risk measures are associated with cultural values. In particular, our results show that individualism and masculinity are the main drivers of banks' contribution to systemic risk. In addition, the impact of cultural variables on the systemic risk measures is nonlinear. This variation may be driven by both information in the national cultural measures and the skewness of the systemic risk measures. The findings have implications for prudential policies: designing uniform prudential and regulatory policies in ==== to avoid financial distress for countries with heterogeneous cultures might not have the desire impact; rather, they might be more effective if the type of culture in each individual country is considered.","Financial institutions have been plagued by major professional misconduct, ethical shortcomings, and compliance problems, resulting in a long list of big fines and penalties. Poor cultural foundation and failures did not cease with the financial crisis but, rather, persisted despite the significant public sector intervention required to stabilize the financial system. “Culture” refers to the implicit norms that guide behavior in the absence of regulations or compliance rules and is now widely recognized as an essential factor in long-term financial stability and maintaining public confidence in the financial system.====Understanding how national culture affects the decisions that are made and the level of acceptance of risk-taking at the corporate level is an important task for policy makers. Numerous studies have shown that national cultural systems and individual cultures have a significant impact on corporate culture (Lindholm, 2000, Tayeb, 1995). Although the idea of culture has been explored in many research areas at the micro and macro levels, the effect of cultural aspects on financial stability has been neglected in the literature. Thus the focus of this paper is to analyze the potential cultural effects on systemic risk measures across developed and developing countries, filling an important gap in the literature. Additionally, answering this question is important for enabling policy makers to improve government policies designed to promote a better business environment and enhance financial stability.====Bandt and Hartmann (2001) define systemic risk as a systemic event that affects a large number of institutions or financial markets by distorting the financial system as a whole. Researchers and regulatory bodies developed different systemic risk measures that were used to quantify the contribution and exposure of the banking system to systemic risk and further improve the regulatory framework. Bisias et al. (2012) provide an extensive survey of 31 measures of systemic risk. In our analysis, we use conditional value at risk (ΔCoVaR) developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) as the main measure of systemic risk (it accounts for the contribution of the banking system to systemic risk). As an alternative (for robustness checks), we use the marginal expected shortfall (MES), proposed by Acharya et al. (2017), to account for the exposure of the banking system to systemic risk.====To assess the role of national culture in systemic risk, we focus on four dimensions of national culture identified by Hofstede (2001), namely, power distance (PDI), individualism (IDV), masculinity (MAS), and uncertainty avoidance (UAI).====Using previous empirical results, we test several hypotheses that link national culture to systemic risk. First, based on Merton (1977), we hypothesize that banks' high contribution to systemic risk is more likely in societies characterized by individualism and masculinity. This hypothesis is linked to the idea that bankers lend more aggressively in these societies by taking excessive risk and ignoring prudent risk management. Second, we hypothesize that banks in countries with high uncertainty avoidance are more risk averse, reducing the impact on systemic risk, as their investors have higher sensitivity to risk and lower tolerance for uncertainty (see Mihet, 2013). Kwok and Tadesse (2006) assess the role of national culture in the structure of the financial system. Their results show that countries with a national culture with strong uncertainty avoidance tend to have a bank-based system, as investors in these countries have higher sensitivity to risk and lower tolerance of uncertainty. Moreover, high uncertainty avoidance in countries with a bank-based financial system is also linked to a low level of competition (Moon and Choi, 2001), which leads to high lending rates and moral hazard, making bank loans riskier and increasing banks' contribution to systemic risk (Boyd and De Nicolo, 2005). Thus, we expect to see a nonlinear effect of uncertainty avoidance on systemic risk.====Third, following the results by Mihet (2013), which also suggest that societies with low power distance are characterized by egalitarian values, promoting independence and innovation by taking additional risk, we hypothesize that societies characterized by egalitarian values have higher systemic risk than hierarchical societies.====To test our hypotheses about how dimensions of national culture affect systemic risk, we use bank-level data for 58 countries over the period 2003–2016.====The results of this paper emphasize the importance of these cultural measures in explaining systemic risk by showing that: (1) individualism and masculinity are the main drivers of banks’ contribution to systemic risk, and the effect is positive and statistically significant across all specifications and robustness checks; (2) the contribution of banks to systemic risk is higher in egalitarian societies than in hierarchical societies; (3) the effect of national culture is not fully eliminated during a financial crisis; (4) individualism is the main driver of banks’ exposure to financial distress (MES), whereas PDI, MAS, and UAI reduce banks’ exposure to systemic risk. In addition to these linear effects that link national culture measures to systemic risk, we also found that power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a nonlinear effect on support for banks` contribution to systemic risk, meaning that banks’ contribution to systemic risk is higher in societies with a moderate power distance (between 0.4 and 0.6) and lower in strongly egalitarian or hierarchical societies, but the reverse is true of uncertainty avoidance. Systemic risk is lower in societies with moderate uncertainty avoidance and higher in environments with very high and very low uncertainty avoidance.====The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the related literature review. Section 3 describes the data and methodology employed. Section 4 reports the empirical findings, while Section 5 presents the concluding remarks.",The impact of national culture on systemic risk,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000346,18 March 2022,2022,Research Article,37.0

We employ a dynamic panel model for the period 2000–2019 and find that these fiscal watchdogs have a positive and significant influence not only on government budget balance for the EU member states, resulting in smaller government budget deficits, but also on countries’ compliance with fiscal rules, results that hold across alternative fiscal balances. IFIs appear to have a beneficial impact on fiscal performance and compliance with numerical targets in countries with poorly designed fiscal responsibility norms but weaker influence when fiscal rules are less binding (well-designed fiscal rules). The findings remain significant regardless the year of accession to the EU (old vs. new members) or euro-area status (euro-area vs. non-euro-area members). However, we document that IFIs play a larger role in countries that established these monitoring bodies before 2013, indicating that experience matters in IFI performance. Also, our findings show that the influence of IFIs remains if we take into account institutional reforms in which their mandates were extended with different powers and tasks, which has a positive and significant effect on fiscal balances. Moreover, we find that, under the circumstance of systemic and ==== crises, these institutions are associated with improved fiscal outcomes, reflecting their increased concern about the path of public finances and their role in reducing budgetary forecasting biases. Our results are robust to a variety of specifications and models, including alternative measures of the government budget balance and after controlling for a set of institutional characteristics and for potential endogeneity in the estimations.","In this study, we assess the budgetary implications of independent fiscal institutions (IFIs) in the European Union (EU) countries aiming at evaluating whether they have an impact on fiscal balances and how significant it is.==== In general, IFIs are defined as independent monitoring bodies aimed at strengthening the budgetary framework and promoting sound fiscal policies and sustainable public finances. They share four characteristics that seem to be essential to this end: (1) IFIs should be strictly independent from political interference and (2) have a comprehensive mandate, (3) sufficient resources, and (4) a public voice (ECB, 2014). The approach in our analysis relies on the principles of fiscal responsibility, which should guide all executive politics and governance of public finance in the long run, avoiding excessive fiscal deficits and unsustainable debt levels.====In our interconnected world and even more so in the EU, where economic governance is based largely on policy coordination in many areas, unsound fiscal policies or debt slippage in one country could trigger cross-border chain reactions (Alloza et al., 2019, Corsetti et al., 2018, Davione and Molnar, 2017, Hoeller et al., 1996, Leiner-Killinger and Nerlich, 2019, Primo Braga and Vincelette, 2011). Lessons from the global financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis show that too much was spent on reforms in fiscal frameworks and less was spent on strengthening democratic control of political decisions that contributed to triggering them, ignoring the intertemporal budgetary constraints and the interests of future generations (Arévalo et al., 2019; Baldwin and Wyplosz, 2012; Bellucci et al., 2012; Blundell-Wignall, 2012; Frieden and Walters, 2017; Carstensen and Schmidt, 2018; Lane, 2012; Van Riet, 2010).====When it comes to the euro-area sovereign debt crisis of 2010–2013, countries such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus headed toward default driven through the fiscal channel and debt accumulation. In Greece, a surge in public pensions and wages in 2009 pushed the overall fiscal deficit to more than 15% and the primary deficit to 10%, and the public debt as percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) exceeded the Maastricht threshold more than twice. The main lesson of the crisis was the strengthening of the EU’s common surveillance fiscal framework, including a fiscal compact that entered into force in January 2013, which contained a set of principles and budgetary rules whose breach triggered correction mechanisms.==== The transposition of these principles and fiscal rules into national laws by EU member states included, in many cases, the establishment of IFIs with a mission to oversee the proper functioning of public finances and to monitor the fiscal rules (Blundell-Wignall, 2012, Bordo et al., 2013, Cottarelli and Guerguil, 2014, Frieden and Walter, 2017, Ioannou and Stracca, 2014; Junker et al., 2015; Leiner-Killinger and Nerlich, 2019; Thomsen, 2019).====The issue of mitigating the political budget cycle, discussed first by Nordhaus (1975) and further developed by Rogoff and Sibert (1988), among others, was reviewed by Wyplosz et al., 2019, who advocates that, because election periods encourage deficits, often not corrected later on, fiscal discipline is not a choice but a general rule in terms of time inconsistency and end-of-legislature conundrum, in order to hold politicians and governments accountable for their budgetary actions and performances.====At the level of the EU, the policies in the main areas are aligned and coordinated by the EU Directives that are transposed into national laws, except in fiscal and budgetary policy, which is left to the discretion of each member state, therefore, any proposal for EU action regarding taxes must consider the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.==== In the debates carried out under the rubric of creating a “fiscal union” that should work together with the monetary union, the impact of the 2008–2009 financial crisis revealed a major vulnerability in the EU’s construction due to the lack of coordination of fiscal policies.====Although the history of some IFIs is older (see the review by Georgescu and Căpraru, 2020), the new coordinates for their establishment in the EU and the euro area are based on the post-crisis fiscal surveillance framework, consistent with the introduction of numerical fiscal rules and related mechanisms for correcting deviation from them, in which IFIs are a strong pillar. Their raison d′être is to complement the fiscal rules imposed in response to the deficit bias (Calmfors and Wren-Lewis, 2011, Wren-Lewis, 2018), in many cases with the explicit mandate to ensure compliance with these rules (Asatryan and Heinemann, 2018==== and provide an objective assessment of compliance with the rules, both ==== and ====.==== Fiscal rules, such as limits on public debt and government budget deficit, which were enforced to restrain the discretionary fiscal policymaking and to promote sustainable fiscal policies, suffer from several limitations, one of which was the time inconsistency problem because they can never be fully contingent given the intertemporal nature of fiscal policy and the occasional need for discretion (Wyplosz, 2012, Wyplosz, 2018).==== Their effectiveness in promoting fiscal discipline is documented in several papers (e.g., Bergman et al., 2016; Debrun and Kumar, 2007; Maltritz and Wüste, 2015).==== However, after the endogeneity issues are explicitly taken into account, the positive and statistically significant relationship between the presence of a fiscal rule and fiscal discipline is reduced, and only well-designed fiscal rules are associated with improved fiscal performance (Caselli and Reynaud, 2020). Moreover, the capacity of fiscal rules to contribute to better fiscal outcomes depends on how governments perceive the costs of breaching them (Debrun et al., 2009): if the costs are perceived to be high, fiscal rules are beneficial, leading to enhanced performance (Schaechter et al., 2015); otherwise, governments can easily modify or break the existing rules (Beetsma et al., 2019).====Under these circumstances, IFIs received increasing interest from academics, practitioners, and decision makers. The reason for this is the political nature of fiscal policy as playing allocative, distributive, and stabilization functions, which are not always easy to reconcile and have a direct impact on economic growth, financial balances, and fiscal discipline (European Fiscal Board, 2019). Unlike central banks, which have executive power in the area of monetary policy, IFIs do not have an explicit mandate or a specific toolkit for directly influencing fiscal policy. Rather, their effectiveness and impact on fiscal outcomes come from their ability to provide reliable information to governments, parliaments, and the general public on the budgetary framework, its prospects, and the potential impact of certain policy paths (Asatryan and Heinemann, 2018), or, as Duarte Lledó (2018) puts it, “how loud and fast the fiscal watchdog barks.” In addition, IFIs can mitigate the problem of asymmetric information between other agents in the economy and politicians by boosting fiscal transparency and dampening opportunistic shifts in fiscal policy (Asatryan and Heinemann, 2018, Duarte Lledó, 2018). Also, the ""signal enhancement"" role of IFIs theorized by Beetsma et al. (2017) is an important factor: better informed voters and veto players in the budgetary process can provide stronger incentives for policy makers to deliver sound policies. In terms of monitoring and assessment objectivity, in relation to the government outcomes of the fiscal policy, the clear advantage of IFIs is based on the competence and nonpartisanship of their members. However, as Wyplosz (2012) argues, neither fiscal rules nor independent fiscal institutions are a panacea, and the solution is an appropriate mix of rules and IFIs (Mulas-Granados, 2018).====The IFIs’ role in addressing excessive deficits is approached by various authors and international organizations from different perspectives. Those perspectives include delegating some aspects of fiscal policy and its monitoring to independent authorities (Alesina et al., 2008; Calmfors and Wren-Lewis, 2011; Debrun et al., 2009) and IFIs’ capacity for improving public understanding of the quality of fiscal policy (Beetsma and Debrun, 2016, Darvas and Kostyleva, 2011) and fiscal performance (Beetsma et al., 2019, Coletta et al., 2015, Debrun and Kinda, 2017). The subject of incorporating similar principles, standards, or minimum criteria on national IFIs’ design for ensuring their independence and increase in operational capacity also stands out (Kopits, 2011, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2014; Wyplosz et al., 2019). Because of some dysfunction in the European fiscal frameworks, proposals arguing the need for reforming them under the monitoring of national IFIs or at the EU level have been put forward (Claeys et al., 2016, Dullien et al., 2020, Kamps and Leiner-Killinger, 2019).====However, it should be stressed that most research attention has been captured by analysis and assessments of IFIs’ impact on government fiscal performance, which is discussed in the next section and is also to subject of our research. Here, we stress only the difficulty of employing these approaches at the level of EU IFIs’ network because of their heterogeneity and particular characteristics, which complicates attempts to identify trends, generally valid conclusions, and common good practices. Furthermore, isolating the impact of fiscal rules from that of IFIs is not straightforward because, in some cases, the independent bodies have been established contemporaneously with the objective to achieve similar fiscal outcomes (Duarte Lledó, 2018).====In this paper, we contribute to the extant literature in several ways. First, we construct a time-varying dataset of fiscal frameworks covering the period 2000–2019 for all 27 EU countries that have established IFIs and investigate their influence not only on fiscal policy outcomes but also on countries’ compliance with fiscal rules. Second, we disentangle the interplay between independent monitoring bodies and fiscal rules by interacting them based on the low and high ability of numerical norms to be binding. Third, we assess the impact of these monitoring bodies by controlling for euro-area membership or the time a particular country joined the EU. Fourth, as a proxy for IFIs, we use a dummy variable that expresses not only the year of establishment but also the year in which the respective IFI underwent institutional reform. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have assessed IFIs’ institutional reform. Fifth, we evaluate the impact of IFIs on fiscal performance depending on the years of IFI operations. Only one paper deals with this subject but in a different way. Beetsma et al. (2019) differentiate between “veteran” and new institutions and between councils that grew out of a domestic process, as opposed to those introduced under external pressure. Sixth, we evaluate the EU IFIs’ impact on fiscal performance, taking into account different types of systemic and banking crises.====In addition, we attempt to address the endogeneity bias of independent fiscal institutions by instrumenting the IFI variable in a way that is similar to that of Caselli and Reynaud (2020) in a system generalized method of moments framework.====We document a positive and significant influence of IFIs not only on government balance for the EU member states but also on countries’ compliance with fiscal rules—results that hold across alternative measures of government balance (i.e., general fiscal balance, primary balance, cyclically adjusted fiscal balance, and cyclically adjusted primary balance). These fiscal watchdogs appear to have a beneficial impact on fiscal performance and compliance with numerical targets in countries with poorly designed norms and weaker influence when the ability of fiscal rules to be binding is high (well-designed fiscal rules). The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) does not influence fiscal aggregates per se but, rather, in interaction with IFIs when they advocate compliance with the EDP recommendations. The findings remain their significant regardless of the year of accession to the EU (old vs. new members) or euro-area status (euro-area vs. non-euro-area members). However, we find that independent fiscal institutions play a much important role in countries that established their independent fiscal institutions before 2013, indicating that experience matters for the performance of IFIs, which is explained by the institutional credibility gained over time through the relevance of the opinions expressed, the quality of the analyses, the accuracy of the assessments, and the validation of the recommendations, as well as the consolidated relationships with fiscal authorities, in addition to which is the public recognition of their role in enhancing fiscal issues and greater transparency of public finance management. Moreover, we show that during systemic and banking crises these monitoring bodies are associated with better fiscal outcomes, reflecting their increased concern about the path of public finances and their role in reducing budgetary forecasting biases. We also find that the positive influence of IFIs is preserved if we take into account IFIs’ institutional reform, when their mandates were extended with new roles and responsibilities, which has a beneficial effect on fiscal balance. Lastly, our findings remain constant after employing a different proxy for IFIs and after controlling for the potential endogeneity issues of IFIs.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review the current discussion on IFIs, in Section 3 we present the sample, data, and methodology; in Section 4 we discuss the empirical results and perform further analyses and robustness checks; and in Section 5 we conclude.",Do independent fiscal institutions cause better fiscal outcomes in the European Union?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362522000358,16 March 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

Whereas typical studies make strictly limited assumptions regarding ,"This study modifies the method adopted in previous research (e.g., Engsted et al., 2016; Pavlidis et al., 2016) using the price–rent ratio to determine the status of housing bubbles and employs the integration relationship between the price–rent ratio and the reciprocal of interest rate to determine the existence of housing bubbles. To verify our postulation, we consider data from the United Kingdom and six Eurozone countries (i.e., Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Spain) over the period 1980Q1 to 2018Q4 to estimate two housing bubble indicators and thereby examine whether the housing markets in these countries experienced bubbles during the observed time. Through comprehensive analysis, our results can demonstrate the correcting behavior of these countries’ housing markets and explain why previous studies obtained inconsistent results on this topic.====Housing bubbles constitute one of the most important topics among housing market studies. Since the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007, numerous studies have investigated the United States housing bubble and housing collapse (e.g., Goodman and Thibodeau, 2008; Clark and Coggin, 2011; Kivedal, 2013; Brauers et al., 2014). Although the performance of housing markets in the Eurozone has also been a critical research topic, in comparison with the numerous studies analyzing US housing bubbles, only few detect the housing bubble-like behavior in the Eurozone. Some studies have discussed the factors that influence housing prices in the Eurozone (e.g., Risse and Kern, 2016; Rahal; 2016; Maas et al., 2018; Solé-Ollé and Viladecans-Marsal, 2019), and others have examined housing price correlation or contagion in the Eurozone (e.g., Vansteenkiste and Hiebert, 2011; Tsai, 2018, Tsai, 2019).====Only a few studies identify housing bubbles in some European regions. For example, Ott (2014) estimates the long-term equilibrium and short-term dynamics of housing markets in the Eurozone and finds an unprecedented long-lasting boom from 1997 to 2007. The housing market was corrected from 2007 and returned to equilibrium in 2014. Zhu et al. (2017) examine how the monetary policy and mortgage market structure in 11 Eurozone countries influenced the non-fundamental house price trend. They verified that a one-time monetary-easing shock can induce a significant surge of house price rises in the Eurozone countries, and the non-fundamental house prices in Ireland and Spain were most substantially influenced. Moons and Hellinckx (2019) explain the effect of the European Central Bank’s interest rate policy on the Irish financial-economic crisis and find that the ECB’s monetary policy required by the member states can prevent substantial house price increases, and that the average house price displayed a 25–30% correction after the Irish housing bubble.====Some studies have used the price–rent ratio to examine housing bubbles and presented evidence to argue that the housing market is irrational. Engsted et al. (2016) use the price–rent ratio and data for 18 countries from 1970 to 2013 to analyze whether the house prices in these countries were influenced by speculative bubbles. They find that aside from Germany and Italy, the other 16 countries experienced housing bubbles at almost the same time. Specifically, the housing bubbles in other countries occurred in the beginning of the 2000 s, except for Japan, Switzerland and Finland, where they occurred in the 1990 s. Employing data from Finland, Switzerland and the United States, Bourassa et al. (2019) divide the actual price–rent ratio by the equilibrium price–rent ratio, standardize the ratio, and define it as the imbalance price to determine whether a housing bubble occurred. The result indicates that Finland (Helsinki) experienced a housing bubble in the 1970 s and 1980 s====However, some studies confirm that a correction of house prices toward rents does exist. Hiebert and Sydow (2011) investigated the housing returns in eight Euro area countries by using data from 1978Q1 to 2009Q4 to analyze how variations in rent and expected return affect house price return. Their result shows that rent is the primary factor influencing housing returns, explaining 63% of the variation. Goeyvaerts and Buyst (2019) pointed out that empirical evidence in support of the rent-user cost equivalence theorem is scarce. Hence they examined the relationship between market rents and the user cost of rental properties based on a dataset of the earnings and costs of Flemish landlords, and found that rental earnings and user costs are significantly correlated at the micro-level.====Because previous studies using European samples have not achieved consistent conclusions regarding the relationship between house prices and rent, this study uses data from six Eurozone countries and the United Kingdom for a comprehensive discussion. If one integrates the theoretical frameworks of the relationship between house price and rent, it becomes apparent that the influence of the interest rate has been neglected in these frameworks. Thus, the existence of housing bubbles should be determined by examining the integration relationship between the price–rent ratio and the reciprocal of interest rate, instead of by directly using the convergence of the price–rent ratio. Empirically, this study adopts two indicators that are commonly used in the relevant literature to dynamically evaluate the existence of housing bubbles. The first indicator can be tested using single-country series by performing the unit root test proposed by Phillips et al., 2011, Phillips et al., 2015, and the second indicator, proposed by Mikhed and Zemčík (2009), can be tested using panel data.====This paper employs both a conventional method (using the price–rent ratio) and a modified method (using the integration relationship between the price–rent ratio and the reciprocal of interest rate) to estimate the two indicators. The test result obtained using the conventional method can be compared with those in previous studies to observe the state of the housing market in the Eurozone countries and the United Kingdom on the basis of the same theoretical framework and empirical method. Using the modified method to examine the state of the housing market in these countries reveals new evidence to clarify the relationship between house prices and rent and the role played by the interest rate within this relationship.====Section 2 describes previous theoretical frameworks for the relationship between house prices and rent and shows that these frameworks all neglect the effect of interest rate dynamics. Section 3 introduces two indicators for housing bubbles. Section 4 explains the samples and the estimation results of the two bubble indicators.

Theoretically, economists claim that increasing the protection of IPRs has a significant impact on exports (Campi and Dueñas, 2019; Maskus and Penubarti, 1995; Saito, 2018; Smith, 1999). However, economic theories fail to ascertain the direction of the impact because the increase in IPR protection can create two critical effects that work in opposite directions at the same time (Maskus and Penubarti, 1995; Yang and Woo, 2006).====On the one hand, strengthening the protection of IPRs in the importing country inadvertently grants monopoly power to the inventing country because of the strict control over the imitation of the IPR-protected products in the importing country (Vishwasrao, 1999).==== Therefore, the exporting country can make use of a monopoly advantage by reducing exports,==== called market power effects (Awokuse and Yin, 2010; Fukui et al., 2013; Smith, 2002; Yew et al., 2011). On the other hand, the increased protection of IPRs in the importing country restricts activities that imitate the production of IPR-protected products from the inventing country. This restriction decreases the supply of goods in the importing country. In meeting its domestic demand, the importing country must increase imports of IPR-protected goods from the inventing country, up to the point that is sufficient to compensate for the decline in domestic production, called market expansion effects (Chen, 2017; Fukui et al., 2013; Maskus and Yang, 2018).====Because these two effects offset each other, the direction of the impact of IPR protection on exports depends entirely on which effect dominates. If the market power effects prevail over the market expansion effects, stronger protection of IPRs in the importing countries reduces the inventing country’s exports, and vice versa. This theoretical ambiguity leads to an important question: In which case do the market power effects dominate, and in which case do market expansion effects dominate? Many studies have been conducted in search of an answer to this question (Campi and Dueñas, 2016, 2019; Hirimuthugodage, 2011).====Despite using different approaches, the previous studies fall into the following strands. The first strand focuses on the characteristics of the importing country to explain the impacts of IPR protection on exports (Ivus, 2011; Salim et al., 2014; Smith, 2002; Wisniewski, 2005). According to the argument in this strand, following the increase in IPR protection in the importing country, the inventing country’s export behavior depends on the importing country’s imitation ability (Smith, 1999, 2002). If the importing country’s imitation is low, the inventing country can take advantage of the monopoly by reducing exports to increase prices (Falvey et al., 2009; Helpman, 1993). The reason is that this importing country has no option but to depend on the IPR-protected goods of the inventing countries to satisfy domestic consumption. However, if the importing country’s imitation ability is high, the inventing country will increase its exports to the importing country (Smith, 1999).====The second strand==== focuses on the importing country’s level of economic development to explain the impact of IPR protection on exports (Campi and Dueñas, 2019; Rafiquzzaman, 2002; Weng et al., 2009; Wisniewski, 2005). According to the argument in this strand, following an increase in IPR protection in the importing country, the inventing country’s export behavior depends on the importing country’s level of economic development (Chen, 2017; Maskus and Penubarti, 1995; Sweet and Maggio, 2015). If the importing country is a low-income country, the inventing country will take advantage of the monopoly by reducing exports to the importing country to increase prices (Liu and La Croix, 2015; Shin et al., 2016). The reason is that the cost of imitation in these importing countries is remarkably high. Therefore, these importing countries have no option but to depend on the goods of the inventing country. Conversely, if the importing country is a middle- or high-income country, the inventing country will increase its exports to the importing country. The reason is that the cost of imitation in this importing country is usually low (Falvey et al., 2009; Smith, 1999). It can produce similar goods to satisfy domestic demand if the inventing country exploits its monopoly advantage (Campi, 2017; Campi and Dueñas, 2019).====The third strand focuses on the characteristics of the inventing countries to explain the impacts of IPR protection on exports (Awokuse and Yin, 2010; Doanh and Heo, 2016; Fink and Carlos, 2005; Palangkaraya et al., 2017). According to the argument in this strand, following the increase in IPR protection in the importing country, the inventing country’s export behavior depends on its ability to produce sophisticated goods (Fukui et al., 2013; Galushko, 2012; Maskus and Yang, 2018). If export commodities are difficult to imitate, such as knowledge-intensive and high-tech items, the inventing country has opportunities to exploit monopoly power by reducing exports (Rafiquzzaman, 2002).==== Conversely, if export commodities are easy to imitate, the inventing country increases its exports to the importing country.====Based on an extensive review of the literature, we divide the analytical models into two broad categories: two-country and three-country models. The “two-country model” assumes that only two players interact with each other: (1) the inventing country and (2) the importing country. In this model, consumer demand in the importing country can be satisfied by the following two sources: (1) imported goods from the inventing country and (2) imitating IPR-protected products of the inventing country. However, the biggest drawback of this two-country model is that it does not reflect the current reality in international trade. Apart from the inventing country, there is always a third country that competes with the inventing country in exporting similar goods to the importing country.==== In this case, consumer demand in the importing country is not satisfied only by two sources, as in the case of the two-country model, but by the following three sources: (1) importing IPR-protected products from the inventing country; (2) imitating the production of IPR-protected products of the inventing country; and (3) importing similar products from third countries. This model is called the three-country model.==== Thus, the appearance of a third country can substantially change the direction of the impact of IPRs on exports.====In this study, we develop an alternative empirical approach for analyzing the impact of IPR protection on trade. Our approach consists of three players: the inventing country, the importing country, and the third country. Therefore, the general objective of this study is to analyze the impact of IPR protection on exports in the presence of a third country. It has the following specific objectives:====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews relevant literature on the impact of IPR protection on trade. In Section 3, we explain the econometric model, method of estimation, and data sources. The empirical results are presented in Section 4.

This paper proposes a novel and robust methodology to identify latent social distancing at the country level. We extend the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased (SEIRD) model with a time-varying, country-specific distancing term, and derive the ====odel-====nferred ","The COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest epidemic shock since the Spanish Flu, has enveloped the planet in its entirety and triggered a wide range of containment or distancing measures in all parts of the world. These measures have resulted in a serious economic downturn with the potential to dwarf the Great Depression. As of November 17, 2021, the disease claimed over 5 million lives, and the case numbers reached over 250 million worldwide.====Until vaccination rates reach a certain threshold, the only available instrument to slow down the rate of infection was and continues to be social distancing, which can be loosely defined as a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce person-to-person contact. These interventions can be taken by governments or individuals and serve the objective of “flattening the epidemiological curve,” a plot of the number of new cases per day. Theoretical reasoning suggests that the social return to distancing exceeds its private return, thereby necessitating policy interventions (e.g., ====; ====).====Social distancing to “flatten the curve” unequivocally creates a plethora of economic shocks. But which countries have experienced the highest rates of increase in social distancing, and what is the extent of social distancing? These questions are imperative to understanding what triggers the economic tremors felt all over the world, and yet we know remarkably little about social distancing that has the power of creating major economic downturns. Why? It belongs to a set of intrinsically latent variables that are typically well understood but rarely rigorously defined (====). Unlike a proxy variable, an intrinsically latent variable is unobserved and never characterized by just one measurable factor. Hence, it can only be inferred from other observable variables using formal (mathematical) theory that provides identification restrictions.====This paper sheds light on these issues by developing a way of identifying unobserved social distancing and aims to contribute to the vivid debate on “flattening the curve,” cross-country heterogeneity in the effectiveness of governmental and behavioral responses, and economic costs of the pandemic.====In the first part of the paper, we derive a ====odel-====nferred ====tancing (MIDIS) measure using an extended version of the workhorse ====usceptible-====xposed-====nfectious-====ecovered-====eceased (SEIRD) framework.==== In the typical SEIRD model, there is a nonlinear dynamical system that explains the spread and eventual containment of an infection over time. In this paper, we extend the simple SEIRD model with a time-varying and country-dependent social distancing term. The core idea of our paper is to identify this distancing term for each country and each day by exploiting the fact that the average incubation period is constant and common across countries. The resulting solution expresses the distancing term as a function of observable epidemiological data and thus provides a model-inferred measure of a latent variable that can be tracked over time. An important advantage of our identification strategy is that it is easy to put into practice by other researchers because it employs a relatively simple epidemiological model and readily available data.====To the best of our knowledge, Fernández-Villaverde and Jones’s (2020) paper is the closest to ours with respect to identification. The authors also use a compartmental model (the SIRD version) and daily epidemiological data, and their identification strategy of recovering the time-varying transmission rate using observables is similar to our identification of distancing. However, there are three substantial differences. First and foremost, our model has the exposed compartment between the susceptible and infectious compartments, whereas ==== implicitly assume that exposed individuals are in the susceptible compartment. Second, while both papers use daily epidemiological data on the numbers of deceased and recovered individuals, we use observed data of country-dependent and time-varying recovery and fatality rates in the identification. In contrast, ==== assign fixed and country-independent values to several model parameters (but of course do so rigorously). Finally, our paper focuses on the identification, causes, and economic consequences of distancing, but ==== use their model and the recovered sequences of time-varying transmission rates to understand the evolution of death rates and the progression of the pandemic in the near future. We believe that it is necessary to explicitly account for the exposed compartment since COVID-19 has a strictly positive average incubation period. Besides, our approach of utilizing observed changes in recovery and fatality rates allows us to understand the evolution of distancing during the pandemic.====One advantage of our identification strategy is that MIDIS captures a wide range of social distancing components. These include not only policy interventions (school/work closures, bans on traveling and mass gatherings or stay-at-home orders) but also behavioral responses such as fear, trust, or reciprocity, which cannot be measured in a straightforward way. As underlined by ====, modeling how people behave during a pandemic (under the presence of distancing interventions) by exogenously given diffusion parameters is not sufficient for the analysis of disease control. There exists an endogenous response of human behavior to a highly contagious disease—embodied in every day social interactions—that needs to be accounted for in epidemiological models.====While it would be best to collect direct data on different components of social distancing, this is hardly possible in practice due to severe data limitations. Data on policy measures taken to curb the spread of the disease may not always be readily available for a number of countries on a daily basis, let alone daily data for behavioral responses. The MIDIS measure derived in this paper eschews this problem by providing researchers with a measure that is easy to construct. It can be useful not only for studying economic cost but also for other applications that require a time-varying measure of social distancing for a wide range of countries.====Naturally, our analysis encompasses some of the caveats of SEIRD models as well as measurement errors in the observed data. For the latter problem, it is known that countries are not equally successful at testing and tracking, and data manipulation by official bodies in some countries could cause quantitative results to be misleading to some extent. However, we demonstrate that measurement errors in epidemiological data do not significantly alter our construction of latent social distancing.====For the former issue, one of the most serious problems of SEIRD models is the weak identification of parameters (====). As ==== have also underlined, different constellations of model parameters that have similar fits in the short run—days to weeks—may imply significantly diverse outcomes in the longer run—months to years. Our imperfect remedy for this problem is to check the sensitivity of our results. We show that the evolution of MIDIS is considerably robust under alternative values of the average incubation period. Another issue is parameter stability under the presence of policy changes, as shown by ====In the second part of the paper, we take MIDIS to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University (====) and compute it for 120 countries. These are the countries for which we have mobility data available for an “initial” reference day. As in ==== and ====, this initial date is taken to be the day after the 500th case is confirmed for each country. For the immediate 30 days after this “initial” day, our results show that countries exhibit considerable variation with respect to distancing. More specifically, we are able to identify at least three distinct patterns for three groups of countries—a persistent increase, a trendless fluctuation, and an inverted U shape. Hong Kong, New Zealand, Luxembourg, South Korea, and Australia are the countries that sustain the highest average levels of distancing.====We then compare MIDIS values to the mobility data supplied by Apple and Google that have been used in the burgeoning COVID-19 literature—sometimes as a proxy for social distancing.==== Our results indicate a highly significant negative correlation between MIDIS values and different components of mobility. The advantage of MIDIS over the mobility data is its wide coverage at country-day detail as long as the epidemiological data are available.====In the third part of the paper, we try to identify the cross-country heterogeneity in MIDIS that might be a result of differences in governmental response, behavioral response, and a plethora of country-specific factors. We argue that behavioral response to a pandemic is at least as important—if not more—as governmental response in explaining the variation in MIDIS across countries and time. As expected, our results show that our social distancing measure varies positively with containment measures taken by governments and people’s reaction to the pandemic in a robust manner. Indeed, the impact of the behavioral response measured by the numbers of the deceased on the previous day is stronger than the impact of containment measures.====In the final part of the paper, we use our model-inferred social distancing measure to study the economic costs of social distancing during a pandemic. While doing so, we stay oblivious to supply- or demand-side dynamics of these economic costs and focus on their outcome in terms of output loss only. Our daily measure of output loss is derived from the peak-hour electricity consumption data, generously provided by ====. Our results indicate a significant negative output response to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, in countries with higher levels of MIDIS, there is a higher level of output loss in the 30 days following the 500th case. Indeed, a 10 point increase in social distancing causes up to a 2.3 percent increase in output loss.====The paper is structured as follows: Section ==== reviews the related literature. Section ==== introduces the model and our identification strategy. Section ==== summarizes the main patterns of distancing for selected countries and validates our MIDIS measure through mobility data from Apple and Google. Section ==== studies the robustness of MIDIS under the presence of measurement errors. Section ==== investigates the cross-country differences in MIDIS using various explanatory variables. Section ==== then investigates whether and to what extent distancing during the pandemic is related with output loss. Section ==== concludes the paper with some final remarks. We present the results of further sensitivity analyses in Appendix A, and variable definitions, data sources, and statistical summaries in Appendix B. Computer codes and MIDIS data can be accessed on the MIDIS website.====In this appendix, we investigate the robustness of MIDIS with respect to three aspects of our research design. First, we change the fixed and common parameter ====, i.e., the inverse of the average incubation period. Second, we implement the analysis by looking at the period after the confirmation of the 100th COVID-19 case in a country (benchmark: the 500th case). Finally, we extend the sample for each country to 60 days after the confirmation of the 500th case (benchmark: 30 days). For all three experiments, we present new results for South Korea and the United States for space considerations.

The results show strong evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between democracy and public debt. This means that ==== is associated with lower debt only when a certain level of democracy is reached. In an attempt to explain these findings, we assume that the effect of democracy on public debt operates mainly through its impact on government spending and government revenue. Our results show that the inverted U-shaped relationship between democracy and public debt stems from the inverted U-shaped democracy-government spending path and the U-shaped democracy-government revenue pattern. This implies that, at the earlier stages of democratization, democracy is associated with an increase in government spending and a decrease in government revenue, which stimulates public debt. However, beyond a certain level of democracy, further democratization reduces government spending and enhances government revenue, leading to lower levels of public debt. Hence, achieving some level of democracy is a key prerequisite to improve the effectiveness of public spending, enhance tax compliance, and thereby control public debt.","The wave of democratization that has swept the Arab world has been economically costly, especially for countries that have experienced democratic changes, and more specifically, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. In fact, the Arab Spring events were associated with larger budget deficits and increased public debt (Arayssi et al., 2019a). This might be because these new regimes face many challenges related to the rise of redistribution demands and the expansion of public sector employment and wages. In reality, in response to the uprisings and in order to ease social tensions, Arab governments have implemented policies aimed at raising public salaries and employment and increasing pensions and subsidies, especially those related to untargeted food and energy (Khandelwal and Roitman, 2013).====There is no doubt that public revolts and demonstrations have been motivated by an intense desire for democracy. However, it is important to note that the desperate socio-economic conditions generated by the global financial crisis==== were the basic triggers of the Arab revolutions (Cobham and Zouache, 2015). More broadly, Arab citizens were dissatisfied with the ruling elites who were engaged in corrupt behavior and failed to battle unemployment and create economic opportunities (Malik and Awadallah, 2013; Makdisi, 2017).====High debt levels recorded in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings were not only driven by excessive deficits but also by a persistent decline in growth (IMF, 2019). More particularly, the political turmoil of the Arab Spring has created a fragile and instable economic environment, leading to a drop in people’s trust and confidence levels and thus penalizing economic growth (Kasmaoui et al., 2018).====In view of the foregoing, studying the relationship between democracy and public debt in the Arab World is of paramount importance.====The political economy literature underlines two opposing views regarding the relationship between democracy and public debt. On the one hand, a large body of evidence suggests that democratic transitions are costly, as they are often associated with excessive debt accumulation. In fact, public debt could be the result of politicians’ behavior. More precisely, politicians may behave opportunistically and use public debt before elections to remain in power (Nordhaus, 1975). Ideologically oriented politicians, notably those belonging to the left wing. focus strongly on employment and produce more debt than those with a right-wing ideology (Hibbs, 1977). Conflicts of interest between political parties may, in turn, lead to higher debt levels. On the other hand, several studies indicate that democracy may improve the accountability and transparency of decision-makers, which may limit rent-seeking behavior and hence ensure a better fiscal performance (Alt and Lassen, 2006; Benito and Bastida, 2009).====Surprisingly, most prior empirical studies have focused on government fragmentation (Roubini and Sachs, 1989), government ideology (Neck and Getzner, 2001), constraints on the executive (Bittencourt, 2015), political instability (Edwards and Tabellini, 1991), and election years (Chaudhuri and Dasgupta, 2005), while analyzing public debt from a political economy perspective. Nevertheless, these studies do not take into consideration the role of democracy, as measured by the degree of civil and political freedom conferred on citizens, in explaining public debt, or the potential nonlinearity in the democracy-debt relationship.====In this paper, we attempt to contribute to the literature in several ways. First, this study tries to reconcile the two aforementioned views. In this regard, we hypothesize that the impact of further democratization on public debt varies across different stages of democracy, implying that democratization is perceived as an incremental process. That is to say, a democratic transition does not necessarily lead to a full-fledged democracy, but may merely refer to an improvement in the state of democracy. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to identify the existence of an inverted-U relationship between democracy and public debt. This curve predicts that higher debt levels are reached only at the early stages of democratic transition. However, up to a certain level of democracy, democratization is associated with lower public debt levels.====Second, we try to identify the underlying theoretical mechanisms through which democracy may affect public debt. In this regard, we assume that democracy may affect public debt indirectly through its impact on government spending and government revenue. From a theoretical point of view, the extension of the franchise to poor citizens is associated with a greater demand for redistribution, and thereby an increase in public spending and taxation (Boix, 2003; Aidt and Jensen; 2009). However, as a political system takes firm steps towards democracy, in other words, as it gains legitimacy and citizens’ trust and ensures transparency and accountability, public spending would be more efficient (Montes et al., 2019) and citizens would accept to pay higher taxes voluntarily (Garcia and Haldenwang, 2016).====This study suggests that the inverted U-shaped relationship between democracy and public debt comes from the fact that democracy follows an inverted U-shaped path with government spending and a U-shaped pattern with government revenue. This implies that, at the earlier stages of democratization, democracy is associated with an increase in government spending and a decrease in government revenue, which may stimulate public debt. However, when democracy is sufficiently evolved, democracy appears to reduce government spending and boost government revenue, leading to lower levels of public debt.====Third, to check for the existence of nonlinear effects of democracy on public debt, we rely not only on the estimation of quadratic specifications, but also perform the recent test proposed by Lind and Mehlum (2010) in order to verify if the exact necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of an inverse U-shaped (or U-shaped) relationship are satisfied. In addition to that, we move from a single-equation approach to a system of equations to verify the consistency of our results.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Using longitudinal data for India, the results indicate that banks reduce provisions around elections. This effect is seen primarily at state-owned and old private banks. In addition, the evolution of these provisions shows a cyclical pattern. No discernable impact of elections on provisioning is evident one year ahead of elections. The net effect of these practices is reflected in bank financials, in terms of higher funding cost and an increase in lending rates.","The procyclicality of bank lending during elections has been widely discussed in the literature (Carvalho, 2014; Dinc, 2005; Englmeier and Stowasser, 2017; Ghosh, 2020; Khwaja and Mian, 2005; Kumar, 2020; Liu and Ngo, 2014; Micco et al., 2007; Sapienza, 2004). As an election approaches, banks tend to overextend loans, often at the behest of politicians. Since these loans are often extended without adequate risk assessment, their probability of repayment after the elections seems uncertain. As a result, banks need to set aside higher provisions on the expectation that these loans will not be repaid. And even if banks are conservative in their lending strategy, they might seek to set aside higher provisions because of the prevailing general uncertainty surrounding elections. As a result, loan-loss provisions are likely to be procyclical with elections.====Under the current conditions, loan-loss provisioning by banks is influenced by the twin forces of prudential regulation—which necessitate well-defined provisioning practices—as well as accounting standards, which emphasize forward-looking provisioning (Cohen and Edwards, 2017; Harris et al., 2018). In particular, the recently instituted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS-9) practices compel banks to set aside provisions based on expected losses, compared with the practice of incurred losses, mentioned earlier.====Despite the relevance of this issue, not much research has been undertaken on whether elections influence bank provisioning behavior. On the positive side, because of growing financial stability concerns, policy makers have gradually tightened the provisioning requirements for banks to help them in building a buffer in anticipation of future losses and safeguard banking stability (Bikker and Metzemakers, 2005; Laeven and Majnoni, 2003). At the same time, these practices also have pitfalls: higher provisioning has led to a cutback in banks’ lendable resources, thereby leading to a contraction in the credit supply. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has once again highlighted provisioning practices. In fact, the timely loss recognition under the expected loss model enabled regulators to contain excessive risk taking by banks (Mahieux et al., 2020). Yet provisioning by the top 1000 global banks totaled US$1.7 trillion in 2020 compared with US$1.3 trillion in 2019 (Banker, 2021). The additional complications that elections introduce into this process have bypassed the attention of researchers.====To investigate this issue, we employ a sample of Indian commercial banks across ownership categories in 1996–2018 to examine the interplay of elections and bank provisioning. Because the election schedule is predetermined, omitted variables are less likely to drive election cycles. This enables us to clearly discern the possible impact. Five general elections took place during this period and as a result, we have an extended time period in which to analyze the issue. In addition to balance-sheet statements and income details, the information includes data on loan-loss provisioning as reported in banks’ annual audit statements. Relatedly, we also extract information on general provisions and write-offs, which is available for a shorter period. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on an emerging economy to comprehensively examine the role of elections on bank provisioning behavior.====A study on an emerging economy such as India is relevant for several important reasons. First and from a global standpoint, India has a vibrant financial sector with myriad financial entities across various categories. Although the non–banking entities have gained prominence over time, the banking sector remains the mainstay of financial intermediation, with assets averaging roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) during this period. At the same time, the country is the world’s largest democracy, holding general elections every five years. The importance of banking coupled with the elections offers a compelling laboratory in which to explore the interaction in a careful manner.====Second, unlike developed economies, in which the private ownership of banks is quite common, the Indian financial sector comprises banks across different ownership categories. In spite of a gradual decline, state-owned banks still dominate the financial space, accounting for over three-fifths of commercial banking assets, compared with a median share of 37 percent in the ten largest emerging economies (Anginer et al., 2019; La Porta et al., 2002).==== It therefore becomes important to examine the linkage between provisioning and the behavior of banks across ownership categories.====Finally, India has a comprehensive database on the banking sector in which entities report their annual audited accounting details in a structured format. The well-defined reporting, coupled with the significant variation in the data over time and across banks, permits careful empirical analysis.====We begin by documenting the loan-loss provisions by bank group. The findings suggest that, on average, these provisions vary widely, and in most cases they are statistically significant. Subsequently, we employ multivariate regressions, which include several controls and features of the banking industry during this period, and find that elections have a dampening impact on bank provisioning, although this impact differs across ownership.====Next, we analyze how this behavior varies over the election cycle, by replacing the election dummy with a set of indicator variables, depending on the number of years until the next election. The findings suggest that as the election approaches, provisioning initially rises and subsequently declines. In this case as well, the magnitude of the impact is uneven across bank groups, with substantial differences. We correlate provisioning with cycles in bank lending and find that the amplitude is much lower in the latter.====Thereafter, we look at the impact of provisioning on bank financials. Relatedly, we also look at their growth opportunities. In this case as well, we find that the impact differs across bank groups. The findings indicate that costs and returns are impacted in case of new private banks whereas for old private banks growth opportunities are less affected.====The elections demonstrate various categories of government formation, classified broadly as single or coalition. For several of these election outcomes, the government in power was a coalition. Given the pulls and pressures inherent in coalition governments, serious economic decisions can be compromised (Roubini and Sachs, 1989). Back et al. (2017) also emphasize the fact that the efficacy of governments in addressing spending challenges is much lower when the extent of government fragmentation is high. We examine how far these results are influenced by the nature of governments.====The analysis makes three useful contributions to the literature. First, this paper is one of the first on a leading emerging economy to analyze the impact of elections on bank provisioning. Prior studies have examined the impact of bank provisions on their capital management practices (Bouvatier and Lepetit, 2008), earnings management (Ahmed et al., 1999; Bikker and Metzemakers, 2005; Kanagaretnam et al., 2015) and signaling (Anandarajan et al., 2007; Leventis et al., 2012). Others have analyzed the impact of policy uncertainties on loan-loss provisions (Ng et al., 2020) or even predicting loan losses over a multiyear horizon (Lu and Nikolaev, 2021). In a cross-country exercise comprising banks in developed countries, Ozili (2020) focuses on the impact of elections on loan-loss provisions. Their results show that banks increase their provisioning during election years. However, as is well known, cross-country studies have several weaknesses, including differences in the institutional structure, data comparability issues, and compilation methodologies (Rodrik, 2012). By focusing on a single country, we can circumvent these challenges and obtain much more compelling results.====Second, the paper contributes to the literature on the relevance of bank ownership and its interface with provisioning. Several studies have contended that state ownership of banks could be beneficial, although in the process, governance could be adversely affected (Barth et al., 2004; Grittersova and Mahutga, 2020; La Porta et al., 2002). The relevance of state ownership in banking has also been analyzed in other contexts, such as their susceptibility to political pressure (Cole, 2009; Dinc, 2005; Kumar, 2020; Micco et al., 2007), cyclicality of lending behavior (Bertay et al., 2015; Brei and Schularek, 2013), as safe havens for deposits during periods of crisis (Eichengreen and Gupta, 2013), as conduits for monetary transmission (Morck et al., 2019), or even their efficacy in transmitting the impact of macroprudential policies (Mirzaei et al., 2021). By minimizing the agency problems, greater ownership concentration acts as a disciplinary device at privately owned banks (Iannotta et al., 2013). Our analysis supplements this literature by focusing on whether provisioning differs across ownership.====Finally, our analysis speaks to the nascent literature as to whether the nature of governments matter for bank provisioning. Several studies focus on the impact of coalition agreements. For example, Moury and Timmermans (2013) study coalition agreements in European economies and show that comprehensive coalition agreements can help mitigate potential conflict among the members. In contrast, Moury (2011) shows that coalition agreements are no panacea for making important policy decisions. In the Indian context, the impact of coalitions has been analyzed primarily in the context of state legislatures (Chaudhuri and Dasgupta, 2006; Khemani, 2004; Saez, 2016). We augment this literature by examining whether bank provisioning differs across the nature of government and its differential impact across ownership.====The rest of the paper continues as follows. We briefly highlight the relevant literature and highlight testable hypotheses in what follows (Section 2). This is followed by a brief discussion of Indian banks and, more importantly, the evolution of prudential norms during this period (Section 3). Next, we describe the database (Section 4) and the empirical strategy (Section 5), followed by the results and robustness checks (Section 6).

However, little evidence exists in the literature about the performance of the banking systems in SSA compared with developed economies. This paper investigates the effects of economic development on banking performance across 23 SSA countries and 14 developed countries between 1981 and 2018. Using estimation models such as feasible general least squares, fixed-effects estimation with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, and system and difference generalized method of moments, our findings show that in SSA as a whole, economic development has a positive impact on commercial bank lending, raises lending rates, increases the amount of domestic credit to the private sector (DCPS), and reduces the number of nonperforming loans (NPLs). In developed countries, economic development has a positive impact on lending rates, DCPS, and the number of NPLs. However, although economic development in developed economies has mostly positive effects on banking performance, SSA countries have more performance issues in banking as a whole and in regional pockets. A careful reassessment of SSA’s interregional banking system is therefore highly recommended. An increase in the number of NPLs in East and Southern Africa, a decline in deposit rates offered in Southern, West, and Central Africa, and increasing real interest rates in SSA despite economic growth are some of the concerns that require careful reassessment and policy adjustments.","The development of the banking system as a part of the financial sector plays a vital role in the quality of life of Africans and in economic development (Loaba, 2021; Taddese Bekele and Degu, 2021). However, the banking system performance (BSP) across Africa, compared to other regions, is still lacking in several ways. For instance, the amount of credit offered to the private sector is relatively low, and even its performance in financial intermediation is poor (Lee et al., 2021). In particular, the sub-Saharan African banking sector has experienced issues such as corruption, an overall lack of sophistication, and lower banking sector depth indicators than in other regions of the world (David et al., 2015). However, in developed economies, economic expansion has often benefited from favorable banking sector conditions, such as a reduction in the amount of nonperforming loans (NPLs), stable lending rates, and higher domestic credit offerings to the private sector (DCPS) (Popov, 2018). Recently, because the Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on the performance of the global financial sector (Elnahass et al., 2021), performance by the African banking sector is affected more negatively by the pandemic (Jurd de Girancourt et al., 2020). This is especially true of the increased number of NPLs (Tyson, 2020).====Therefore we have three motivations for this comparative study. First, compared to banking systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), banking systems in developed economies are characterized by favorable lending rates, higher overall credit offered to the private sectors, higher bank lending, and fewer NPLs. This is especially the case for member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development due to financial system reforms between 1960 and 1970 (OECD, 1995). Therefore, to truly ascertain banking performance in SSA and the policies that can be implemented, it is necessary to use the world’s most developed economies as a yardstick by which to measure the effect of economic development on banking performance in SSA. Second, sub-Saharan Africa represents an interesting setting for analyzing the banking performance and economic development nexus, as it often has unfavorable interest rates and credit offerings compared to the rest of the world. In addition, the evidence of banking sector dysfunction is visible in the form of higher corruption levels, low institutional quality, low levels of sophistication, and overall low banking sector depth compared to other world regions (CEIC, 2019; Sobrinho and Thakoor, 2019). The final motivation is therefore to examine the aspects of the banking system in each SSA region that consistently underperforms despite favorable economic conditions, as well as to identify areas in which the SSA banking system is advancing. As each SSA region differs, an interregional study of performance is necessary. Unlike a large body of literature that seeks to analyze the impact of banking systems on economic growth, this paper instead emphasizes banking performance across SSA countries by comparing the effect on it of economic growth in 23 SSA countries divided into regions—West, East, Central, and Southern Africa—and 14 developed countries between 1981 and 2018.====This paper makes four contributions to the literature. First, the existing research mostly covers the nexus between economic development and other macroeconomic factors on individual aspects of the banking and financial systems, such as the lending rate, the real interest rates, domestic credit, and NPLs in specific countries or regions (Abuka et al., 2019; Gozgor et al., 2019; Karadima and Louri, 2020; Jaax, 2020). However, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to empirically examine the impact of economic growth on six key aspects of the banking system in SSA: commercial bank lending (CBL), the lending rate (LR), the real interest rate (RR), the deposit rate (DR), domestic credit to the private sector (DCPS), and NPLs. Second, this paper fills a gap in the literature on African banking performance. Moreover, unlike other studies (Aluko and Ajayi, 2018; Balcilar et al., 2018; Dwumfour, 2017) that consider Africa and SSA as a single bloc, this study is one of the first to attempt a detailed interregional analysis taking into consideration the differences between Africa’s trade and economic regions. This enables us to offer unique insights into each of SSA’s economic regions. Third, this study covers a longer period (1981–2018) than existing investigations, which is valuable for providing insights for policymakers, borrowers, savers, and businesses to make better-informed decisions to improve and stimulate the development of banking and finance across SSA. The fourth contribution is in terms of our empirical methods. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we use different estimation models, namely a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimation model in natural logarithmic form, fixed-effects estimation according to the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test and with Driscoll-Kraay standard error correction, and then system and difference generalized method of moments. These methods not only take into account basic factors that vary between countries though not over time but also account for cross-country dependence, which is essential for macro panels of countries with a longer time series.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review on the effect of economic development on banking performance and develops our hypothesis. Section 3 introduces the data and empirical methodologies. Section 4 gives the empirical findings on SSA by region and compared with developed economies as well as the robustness checks.

However, our estimates also suggest that the restoration of its prewar economic status quo is unlikely. In addition to serving as a direct input for Yemen’s reconstruction planning, our paper also demonstrates the usefulness of overarching models for conflict and postconflict economic assessments.","Assessing the economic and social consequences of armed conflicts requires rigorous research methods that usually involve using or collecting extensive economic and social data.==== Although these studies are essential for understanding and managing the consequences of local wars and conflicts (Blattman and Miguel, 2010), policy makers in countries that are either in the midst of conflict or have just ended a conflict often do not have access to sufficient data and analytical instruments. Depending on the intensity of the conflict, consistent data are usually available only for periods before the outbreak of conflict, and, in some countries, the maintenance of otherwise regular statistics also suffers significantly during a conflict. However, as countries move from an emergency or conflict mode to a recovery and development mode, evidence-based planning is essential for national governments and their international partners. Key questions often include: What is the status quo of the economy and household income? Which conflict shocks contributed the most to economic and social deterioration? What should the priorities be for the government and its international partners to bring a country onto a recovery path? What is the country’s reconstruction potential, and is the economy’s recovery to a preconflict level feasible in the foreseeable future? This paper tries to answer these questions with regard to Yemen using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model approach.====The current crisis in Yemen erupted in 2011, after the events collectively referred to as the Arab spring led to the resignation in 2012 of President Ali Abdullah Saleh al-Ahmar (who had been in office since 1990; he was assassinated in December 2017). After three years of political turbulence, full-fledged armed conflict began in March 2015, when Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi (who had served as Saleh’s vice president and then took office in 2012 as interim president after Saleh’s departure but was forced to resign in January 2015) sought the military intervention of Gulf Cooperation Council==== to restore his government (BBC, 2015). Since then, the conflict has caused massive physical damage, devastated the economy, and led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis (World Bank, 2019a). Various third parties have tried to broker ceasefire and peace agreements, and the first positive signs emerged at the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, when political talks led by the United Nations (UN) enabled positive developments due to the implementation of the Riyadh agreement==== signed in November 2019 (OSESGY, 2020; U.S. Department of State, 2021). In parallel with the political process, the Yemeni government and its international partners have tried to estimate the damage from the conflict in their dynamic needs assessment (DNA) reports. This process has been very challenging, and the estimates in many instances rely on strong assumptions (World Bank, 2019a). Moreover, formerly regular official statistics, such as national accounts and budgets and household income and expenditure surveys, have not been updated since 2014. As a result, international organizations often have to rely on anecdotal evidence in order to estimate the current state of the economy, at least at an aggregate level (World Bank, 2019b).====In this context, our paper complements existing studies and offers essential details on the country’s economic damage and opportunities for potential reconstruction based on an innovative approach. We use available fragmentary DNA estimates by the various organizations and integrate them into our CGE model for Yemen calibrated to 2014, the year before the war began. We use the model to simulate the degradation in economic activity and household income throughout the conflict period 2015–2020 and assume that the country’s reconstruction process starts in 2021. Then we use the model to project the possible economic state of the country by 2025 with the standard five-year reconstruction planning period (World Bank, 2017b).====In an environment of data scarcity, reference to simulation models is relatively standard practice, and several studies use simulation methods (including CGE models) to estimate the impacts of otherwise unmeasurable shocks such as sanctions, disasters, population displacement, and terrorism.==== We used a CGE modeling approach to analyze the effects of a flood in 2008 on the economy and food security in Yemen (Breisinger et al., 2015), to measure the impact of the 2008–2009 global crisis on growth and poverty (Breisinger et al., 2011), and to assess the country’s social and economic situation after the unrest in 2011–2012 as part of the Arab spring (World Bank et al., 2012). At the same time, the economic consequences of the civil war that erupted in 2015 remain largely unknown. Although various DNA reports conducted several sector-focused assessments, these fragmentary studies do not provide a complete picture of the status quo in the war-torn economy, making reconstruction planning in Yemen incredibly difficult. Our paper fills this gap by using available fragmentary reports to simulate the economy-wide impact of the conflict shocks, understand the economy’s current status quo, and analyze the country’s prospects for recovery.====We find that Yemen’s most severe economic losses are associated with disruptions in the mining and agricultural sectors, accounting for 20.9 and 9.4 percentage points (p.p.), respectively, of the estimated contraction totaling 36 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) between 2014 and 2020. The combined direct and indirect consequences of the conflict have had catastrophic outcomes for the population. According to our estimates, the preconflict poverty rate of 48.6 % (Government of Yemen, 2014) rose 31.3 p.p. because of the conflict, to a total of 79.9 % of the population, with a particularly devastating conditions in rural areas, where nine out of ten residents now live below the national poverty line.====Our simulations of the postconflict reconstruction phase suggest that recovery of mining and agriculture are the most effective channels for economic revival. However, even with the complete mitigation of all conflict-related shocks, restoration of even the low prewar status quo seems unlikely. Our results suggest that under the most optimistic scenarios the country could reach the prewar income level by 2025, but, among other factors, these scenarios assume the best-case qualitative improvements in the economy (economy-wide productivity growth, increased technological flexibility, and increased effectiveness of capital investment). However, as the country had a poor record of creating the conditions for such improvements for decades before the conflict (World Bank, 2015), these scenarios might be infeasible. Moreover, in the context of the human capital depreciation not accounted for in our study,==== the country’s capacity for qualitative improvements might be quite low. In this context, our postconflict simulations serve as the first step in understanding Yemen’s reconstruction potential and the feasibility of its economic stabilization to preconflict levels.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, methodology, and model used. Section 3 discusses the simulation results for both the conflict and recovery phases.

We fill this gap by assessing the symmetric and asymmetric impact of the real bilateral exchange rate volatility between the U.S. dollar and each African partner’s currency on the U.S. trade flows with each of the 20 partners from Africa. We found asymmetric short-run effects of exchange rate volatility on almost all U.S. exports to and imports from each of the 20 countries. In addition, significant long-run asymmetric effects were discovered in the case of U.S. exports to 15 countries and U.S. imports from 12 countries. Our findings are partner-specific.","It is now a well-established fact that trade flows can respond negatively or positively to a measure of exchange rate uncertainty or volatility, depending on the degree of risk that traders can tolerate. Those who can tolerate more risk choose to trade more today in order to cover the loss of any future revenue due to uncertain prices. Those who cannot tolerate risk choose to trade less.==== Empirical studies reviewed by Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2007) support both views.====The review article, and those published since, reveal that our region of concern, Africa, has received little attention, perhaps due to a lack of data. Indeed, due to data unavailability, only few studies have estimated panel models. One of these is by Sauer and Bohara (2001), who included 25 African countries in their panel model to show that exchange rate volatility has negative effects on the exports of these countries. However, the results were reversed when Olayungbo et al. (2011) extended the list of countries to 40 and used a longer study period. Significant positive effects of volatility on imports, but not on exports, of 11 African countries in a panel model were also discovered by Senadza and Diaba (2017).====Suspecting that the above panel models suffer from aggregation bias, a number of studies have estimated time-series models. Medhora (1990) considered the response of the import volume of Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Senegal, Togo and Burkina Faso to exchange rate volatility and found no significant effects. However, when the response of the aggregate exports of Malawi, Morocco and South Africa to a measure of exchange rate volatility was assessed by Serenis and Tsounis (2014), they found significantly negative effects in all three cases.====A common feature of the above studies is that they assumed that, if increased volatility hurts trade flows, reduced volatility should boost them, a symmetry assumption. However, recently, Bahmani-Oskooee and Aftab (2017) demonstrated the possibility of an asymmetric response of trade flows to changes in exchange rate volatility. As they argued, due to changes in traders’ expectations, their reaction to decreased volatility could be different from their reaction to increased volatility, hence an asymmetric response.==== They demonstrated their conjecture by employing the Shin et al. (2014) asymmetric error-correction modeling and asymmetric cointegration methods and commodity trade flows between the U.S. and Malaysia. Additional support was provided by Bahmani-Oskooee and Aftab (2018) when they considered the commodity trade flows between the European Union and Malaysia. This new path is in its early stage of expansion, and any addition to this literature is welcome.====We add to this new literature by considering the symmetric and asymmetric effects of exchange rate volatility on the bilateral trade flows of the United States with each of its 20 trading partners from Africa. Although none of the African countries are a major U.S. trading partner, the U.S. is the major partner for most of the African nations in our sample.==== Therefore, our findings could have major implications for each country in the sample. Furthermore, since no study has considered U.S. bilateral trade flows with any African country so far, we fill this gap by engaging in symmetry and asymmetry analysis. To this end, we outline the models and methods in Section 2, and report our empirical results in Section 3.

We compare four highly developed markets (US, EU, Japanese and global) and the Polish market as an alternative investment opportunity and a CEE emerging market. The performance of the applied procedures for estimating the cost of capital for company projects is examined and cost of capital is assessed with and without ==== adjustment. We adjust the portfolios’ returns using the firms’ book-to-market ratios and idiosyncratic volatility as option proxies. The variability of cost of capital is evaluated using bootstrap methods. Our study shows a clear difference between bootstrapped distributions of cost of capital for the tested developed market and the Polish market portfolios. Wider confidence intervals of the estimated cost of capital of the studied Polish portfolios may result from political motivations in managing state-controlled companies. Our findings also indicate a clear difference between the cost of capital for tested portfolios with and without option adjustment. The widths of the estimated confidence intervals increase after option adjustment. The highest/lowest values of the cost of capital both with and without option adjustment are found for the US/Japanese market portfolios.","Existing studies show that average realized returns are inconsistent with the returns that are modeled with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The reason for this incompatibility is due to pricing anomalies that have been documented, among others, by Banz (1981), Basu (1983), Rosenberg et al. (1985), De Bondt and Thaler (1985), Bhandari (1988), Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Lakonishok et al. (1994), and Fama and French (1992). Despite this, the possibility of using the CAPM to assess the cost of capital has been widely documented in studies. It can be assumed that the CAPM correctly estimates the cost of capital of a company’s projects, even if the entire company’s pricing is incompatible with the CAPM. Examples include the work of Welch (2008) and Gracham and Harvey (2001). The reason for the incorrect pricing of companies is the fact that practical CAPM applications use market returns perceived by an external investor. In turn, the estimated cost of capital based on market returns can be interpreted as follows: “The cost of capital is market driven and that is a function of the investment, not the investor. … Cost of capital is the expected rate of return that the market requires to induce investment in a subject security.” (see Pratt, 2002, p.185). The cost of capital interpreted and estimated in this way is applicable to investors and stock portfolio managers.====However, returns directly simulated by the classic one-factor model generally cannot be used for the evaluation of a company’s investment projects. The reason is that the company is perceived by investors as a portfolio of the implemented and planned projects and the real options related to these projects. Therefore, the risk premium and the company’s systematic risk may be complex, nonlinear functions of the firm’s project beta and real option boundary conditions. Research in this field is presented in the works of Berk et al. (1999), Gomes et al. (2003), Carlson et al. (2004), Cooper (2006), Bernardo et al. (2007) and Zhi et al. (2012).====If, on the other hand, we assume that the company’s projects are not insured with real options, then it may be correct to state that the cost of the company’s capital can be estimated with the CAPM (ICAPM). Despite the well-known impact of real options, the cost of capital is most often estimated using classic factor models. The works of Barnes and Lopez (2006) and King (2009) are examples of using the one-factor model to estimate the cost of capital of banks in selected countries. However, most research is aimed at understanding the factors generating the cost of capital. Schuermann and Stiroh (2006) analyze the factors influencing the returns of American bank holdings over the period 1997–2005. The authors use a range of models from the one factor model to the nine factor model. The Fama-French factors and additional factors considered particularly important for banks are adopted as independent variables. The market factor and Fama-French factors turn out to be the most important. Bank-specific factors are not informative, especially for the largest banks. It can be assumed that large banks use hedging derivatives most often.====Asal (2015) studies the impact of selected factors on the estimated cost of capital in 78 banks from the EMU zone, 33 banks from the US, 6 banks from the UK, 4 banks from Sweden and 19 banks from Switzerland, examining the effects of the market, Fama-French, and bank- and country-specific factors. The results show that for the entire tested sample, the market factor and the bank- and country-specific factors have a significant impact on the cost of capital (see Asal, 2015, p. 89, Table 4). On the other hand, the factors that significantly generate the cost of capital are different in the US and EMU countries and include financial leverage, the loan-to-deposit impact and the impact of the ==== factor (ibid., p. 90, Table 5).====Barinow et al. (2020) estimate the cost of equity of insurance companies with classic CAPM, the Fama and French (2015) five factor model, conditional CAPM with four macroeconomic variables as conditioning variables, and intertemporal CAPM with the VIX index from the Chicago Board Options Exchange to proxy for shocks to market volatility. The research focuses on 348 months over the period 1986−2014. The research results indicate that macroeconomic factors have a significant impact on the returns of the surveyed companies, but also that industry-specific factors should not be used in factor models as these factors do not affect the expected return and thus the cost of capital.====Ferson and Locke (1998) show that the proper estimation of the risk premium is more important than the inadequate estimation of betas. Usually, the dependence of a company’s returns is a complex function of economic state variables. A determination of risk factors for securing future states of the economy is a main condition for the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) proposed by Merton (1973).==== Additional risk factors should be applied to explain the stock returns using selected ICAPM applications. A precise estimation of the risk premium and pricing, which can be used when the ICAPM is appropriate, requires pricing that leads to the generation of multifactor-efficient portfolios. The correctness of the CAPM or ICAPM applications is mainly tested for portfolios. Therefore, we attempt to estimate the cost of capital for the characteristic portfolios of a given market.==== However, it is necessary to correct the formation of portfolios. We use Cochrane’s (2001, p. 453) injunction: “If your portfolios have no spread in average returns – if you just choose 25 random portfolios – then there will be nothing for the asset pricing model to test.”====The main aim of our study is to estimate the cost of capital of characteristic portfolios. The portfolios are formed from stocks listed on the US, EU, Japanese (JPN) and global (GL) markets – which hereinafter are denoted as developed markets – and on the Polish (PL) market. The Polish capital market is the largest and most developed among the CEE emerging markets. Therefore, it may constitute an alternative investment opportunity to the most developed world markets, as confirmed by the data in Section 3 (see Table 1). Previous studies on the Polish market address the testing of the classic CAPM and selected ICAPM applications. Examples are the works of Zarzecki et al. (2004-2005); Zarzecki et al., 2004, and Czapkiewicz and Wójtowicz (2014) estimating the risk premium. Additionally, Urbanski et al. (2014) and Urbanski (2015) show that the elimination of speculation and penny stocks allows for the simulation of multifactor-efficient portfolios.====In our work, we follow Zhi et al. (2012), who show that the CAPM and Fama-French (1993) three-factor model work better on the option-adjusted risk premium and beta. However, their research is limited only to a comparison of pricing (taking into account both applications) with and without real option adjustment. Our approach is broader and its purpose is to estimate the cost of capital by two ICAPM applications with and without real option adjustment. We formulate our research question as follows:====What is the impact of real option adjustment====We regress the stock excess returns (over the risk-free asset) and the stock beta on real option proxies. We use the firm’s book-to-market ratio (====) and idiosyncratic volatility (====) as the real option proxies. ==== is recommended by Smith and Watts (1992) and Zhi et al. (2012), while ==== is recommended by Cao et al. (2008), Bekaert et al. (2010), and Zhi et al. (2012).====Due to the complex dependency of the risk premium and the firm’s project’s beta, we apply a method that builds the confidence interval for the cost of capital. The cost of capital is the product of the risk premium and the systematic risk components. Therefore, it cannot be assumed to be normal. To overcome this difficulty, we use the bootstrap method.====In Section 2, we present theoretical approaches for the cost of capital assessment. We use the three-factor Fama and French (1993) model and the modified Fama-French model originally presented by Urbanski (2012), which is an improved version that is briefly described in Subsection 2.1. Subsection 2.2 describes the procedures of the cost of capital assessment using the real option adjustment, while Subsection 2.3 presents the algorithm of the bootstrap method to investigate the variability of the cost of capital estimation. Section 3 presents the data and procedures of the portfolio construction. In Section 4 we evaluate the properties of the formed portfolios, the correlations between the model factors and real option variables, the distribution of returns, the risk premium and the pricing errors for the tested markets. Additionally, we present the assessed cost of capital for the tested portfolios with and without real option adjustment.

With this in mind, this paper investigates the linkage between these banks and long-run growth in 10 countries. We find discouraging evidence on the role of these institutions in the growth process as public banks contributed to long-run economic growth in only two countries. More precisely, the public bank raised the gross domestic product in the Dominican Republic and investment in Singapore. In the remaining eight countries, long-run growth was harmed, or we did not find a long-run nexus running from the public bank. This is particularly surprising because some public banks in our sample have a long history of proper management and were given an important role in their country's development. We find long-run reverse causality in five countries, and, in all of them but in one, a larger gross domestic product per capita expanded public banks’ assets. Therefore, public banks were following the economic cycle. Considering all this, governments that aim to accelerate economic growth should be more cautious about the creation or ==== of these entities.","The most recent survey of national development banks shows that a quarter of them were created after 2000 (World Bank, 2018). In addition, several public banks with a longer history have increased their lending. Consequently, state-owned entities have gained relevance in the banking system of several countries.====This happens even in some developed countries, which, to some extent, is surprising, because among the main arguments of supporters of public banking are the financing of industrialization (Armendariz, 1999, Gerschenkron, 1962), the supply of resources or elements needed for development (Kane, 1975), and the mitigation of externalities that determine low investment in projects with significant social profitability (Gutierrez et al., 2011).====None of these issues are particularly relevant for wealthy countries, which generally have deep and developed financial markets; therefore, the private financial institutions can provide the funds for these purposes. However, advanced economies may have motivations for creating public banks. At present, the financing of research and development projects might be one of the needs because, even in developed countries, some of these projects face credit constraints (Hall and Lerner, 2010). Indeed, some empirical works find that public banks can play a countercyclical role during economic crises (Brei and Schclarek, 2013, Micco and Panizza, 2006). This is a critical issue because in recent decades severe crises have affected rich and poor countries.====This last idea suggests that banks can differ in behavior depending on their ownership. The possibility of different roles or lending behavior of public and private banks has been considered in works such as Micco and Panizza (2006), Bhaumik and Piesse (2008), Önder and Özyildirim (2019) and Atahau and Cronje (2020). Therefore, it is important for the finance-growth literature to take the issue of ownership into account.====However, all these benefits of public banking should not come at the cost of economic growth. For example, works such as McKinnon (1973) showed how several public interventions in the financial markets failed (as a result of corruption, inefficiency in the allocation of resources, and the negative effects on savings, among other reasons) to ease the problems they were intended to address/solve. Some of these problems have even been acknowledged by supporters of public banking (Gerschenkron, 1962). In addition, some believe that these banks could be mismanaged to satisfy political interests (Kane, 1977, Shleifer and Vishny, 1994).====It is important to mention that the empirical literature has shown this lack of consensus on the pertinence of public banking. What is worse, despite the significant attention the issue of ownership attracts in the finance-economic growth debates, only a few applied studies have been conducted on the nexus between public banking and economic growth. One of the main reasons for this dearth is the lack of data availability on public banks. Generally, these statistics are not readily available in national or global databases.====Not surprisingly, numerous previous articles have focused on the experience of BNDES (the main development bank in Brazil) and China (Carvalho, 2014, Lazzarini et al., 2015, Liang and Teng, 2006, Rousseau and Xiao, 2007). The BNDES is one of the few state-owned financial institutions that offers downloadable data and reports going back to its creation. In the case of China, its banking system is almost fully state owned. Therefore, the statistics about this banking system are basically statistics about its stated-owned banks as well.====Lazzarini et al. (2015) and Carvalho (2014) used firm-level data which can reveal how public bank financing affects the behavior or performance of firms. However, these studies generally analyze short periods. As several public banks focus on strategic tasks or policies, the benefit for enterprises and economic sectors might be realized in the long-run. Indeed, even if the policy is successful at boosting the productivity of financed firms or projects, this can have disastrous outcomes at the aggregate levels. For example, McKinnon (1973) indicates that premature mechanization can have negative implications for the overall economy. Therefore, firm-level studies might not fully answer our main research question: Do public banks boost the economic development of countries in the long-run?====Studies at the country level might be more appropriate for answering this question as they hint at the impact of public banking on a country's overall economy. In addition, they can investigate long-run causality as data at the country level tend to be available for longer periods than firm-level data. To our knowledge, only Odedokun (1996) employs panel data methodology at the country level to analyze the nexus between development loans and economic growth. A few studies, such as La Porta et al. (2002) and Andrianova et al. (2012), employ cross-sectional analysis.====Time series analyses that can be placed in the public banking and economic growth literature are relatively common in the case of China (e.g., Rousseau and Xiao, 2007, Liang and Teng, 2006), but very scarce for any other country. We should note that several time-series studies in the finance-growth literature have found reverse or bidirectional causality (Demetriades and Hussein, 1996, Luintel and Khan, 1999, Peia and Roszbach, 2015).==== Undoubtedly, reverse causality may also be common in the case of public banks. This is true because, for example, several public banks have historically received foreign currency and/or government subsidies, and the availability of these resources depends on the economic cycle. This is relevant because if public banks are ineffective for boosting economic growth and they receive public funds, governments would be better off granting those resources through other channels. In consequence, it is pertinent to determine the existence of possible bidirectional or reverse causality.====Considering all this, the purpose of the present research is to investigate the long-run linkage between public banks and economic growth in 10 countries from the 1950s until 2017. Furthermore, we investigate not only a direct nexus with the gross domestic product but also an indirect one through capital formation. The sample comprises a mix of development and commercial public banks in wealthy and developing countries.====Although our sample of countries is not large, it includes several states that attract significant attention from researchers and public in general. For example, it includes several globally important economies (Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Korea, Norway, and Singapore). Indeed, several countries in our sample have achieved “economic miracles” during the analyzed period. More important, in some countries in our sample, it is believed that public banks have played an important role in domestic development.====Time-series analysis is our methodological choice, because we are interested in determining long-run causality. In addition, the sample of countries is relatively small, and the period is relatively long. In consequence, we use the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology proposed in Pesaran et al. (2001), which performs well in finite samples. Also, it can capture the long-run dynamics and deal with a relatively large number of regressors. This last argument is important because several variables, such as investment and trade openness, are identified as important sources of economic growth that we should not ignore.====In addition, the 10 countries in our sample differ significantly in their development level, macroeconomic stability, quality of the institutions, history, and so forth. For example, Dombi and Grigoriadis (2020) highlights the role of state history in the finance-growth nexus, for example. Another issue is the heterogeneity in the income levels of our sample. For instance, de Gregorio and Guidotti (1995) and Seven and Yetkiner (2016) find that middle-income countries benefit more from financial development. Finally, inflation can affect the finance-growth nexus. In fact, our sample includes countries with a diverse economic history, and some have suffered from hyperinflation. Regarding this, Rousseau and Yilmazkuday (2009) indicates that low inflation can enhance the benefits of financial development for economic growth. All this indicates that the public banking-economic growth linkage in our sample can be heterogeneous, and as it contains only 10 countries, the sensitivity to outlier cross sections (countries) can be significant if we employ panel data, for example.====Among its main contributions, our article adds more evidence to an otherwise limited body of literature on the linkage between public banking and economic growth. In addition, it uses a sample of 10 countries, whereas previous empirical studies have disproportionately focused on Brazil (BNDES) and China. Finally, our research is one of the few studies in the field that conducts a time-series analysis over a very long period. This is important because significant policy changes have been implemented in many countries where public banking is significant (e.g., Brazil and China), and any results pertaining to a given period may be valid only for that period.====The paper is organized as follows.

The measurement of individuals’ tax morale is subjective, and various proxies have been employed in qualitative and quantitative research. The framing of these measures has been considered in some research with respect to equivalency or goal framing, but the underlying implication of emphasis framing in commonly used proxies has yet to be considered. Further, although fairness and financial literacy have been considered determinants of tax morale, no one has yet considered whether financial and tax literacy (FTL) has a moderating effect on fairness and tax morale.====This research addresses these gaps in the literature. The findings suggest that questions and scenarios posed by academics and policy makers should consider positive, negative, and emphasis framing, as well as the moderating effect of the respondents’ FTL to measure individuals’ tax morale effectively. The findings also suggest that raising levels of FTL could have a double dividend: not only will improved FTL have a positive impact on tax morale, but it might be magnified through the impact of fairness. These findings hold only when morale is determined by negatively framed scenarios. In particular, the perceived fairness of the tax system enhances tax morale when FTL is high, whereas the perception of fairness has no effect on tax morale for respondents with lower levels of FTL.","Tax morale is an area of considerable interest among policy makers, as research consistently points to a significant correlation between tax morale and tax compliance (see, e.g., Cummings et al., 2009; Daude et al., 2013; Song and Yarbrough, 1978; Torgler and Schneider, 2007). Governments worldwide have made a concerted effort to address perceived low levels of tax morale as nation-states address their respective tax gaps (OECD, 2015).====Social value orientation (SVO)==== and the motivation to act prosocially (e.g., being compliant in tax reporting and payment) is recognized as a complex question. To add to the complexity, SVO can be manipulated by subtle interventions such as framing. The literature shows that tax compliance may be “framed as a public good dilemma, and that prosocial value orientation promotes cooperation in such dilemmas” (Brizi et al., 2015, 24). This research contributes to the tax morale literature by showing the significance of the framing of tax morale questions. Specifically, we consider the impact of emphasis framing of the proxies used to determine tax morale, which is discussed in Section 2.2. This is of particular importance in policy design to ensure the greatest impact on target audiences.====The perception of fairness in a tax system is found to be an important factor in tax morale (McKerchar et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 1994; Torgler, 2007). Despite the extensive studies that establish a relationship between fairness and tax morale, some authors suggest that such a relationship is likely to be moderated; however, this has yet to be well investigated in the literature (Hofmann et al., 2008). Our research examines the relationship between the perception of tax fairness and tax morale conditional on the level of financial and tax literacy (FTL).====FTL is measured in this research through five questions (three general and two specific to taxes). We define FTL as knowledge of rules and the ability to apply the rules in a given financial or tax scenario. Niemirowski et al. (2002) argue that low levels of tax knowledge are associated with negative attitudes toward tax, and the tendency is the opposite when respondents have better knowledge. Further consideration of the literature on FTL is in Section 2.4. This research draws a distinction between knowledge and literacy, in which the latter is demonstrated through application. A deeper understanding of the relationship between FTL and tax morale is important in the ability to develop the right interventions so as to raise the tax morale of taxpayers.====This research focuses on the United States and the United Kingdom because of similarities and differences in their tax systems and outreach initiatives. First, both countries operate self-assessment income tax systems, but with fundamental differences in the levels of personal tax awareness in the US and the UK. Both administer self-assessment tax systems, however, a significant majority of UK taxpayers need not complete and submit individual tax returns. The pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system in the UK is known to be the “most sophisticated withholding system in the world” (Gauke, 2011). In 2016, 45 million people were covered by the PAYE system, of whom only 7 million were required to complete a tax return (HMRC, 2017, 36). Second, the governments of both countries have introduced programs in the past decade with the goal of raising tax literacy but targeted different audiences. The US targeted the general population with the Taxpayers’ “Bill of Rights” adopted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS, 2014) in 2014, which followed Olson’s (2009) ten-step approach to reducing the tax gap in the US. Step 7 proclaims that taxpayers’ rights matter and that procedural justice and fairness are essential components of tax morale and affect taxpayer compliance. Raising taxpayers’ awareness of the importance of tax revenue for the public good is essential, according to Olson (2009). In 2009, Kornhauser (2009) began to develop the Tax Literacy Project in the US, a nonpartisan effort to informally educate US citizens on tax matters. Since these initiatives, the IRS (2010) has offered taxpayer education over the years in various locations and adopted the seemingly friendly label “UncleFed’s Tax Board.” The UK targeted children with an initiative by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC, 2015) to develop and disseminate its Tax Facts education program for teenagers. This was followed by Junior Tax Facts in 2016 for the benefit of primary schoolchildren (HMRC, 2016). Targeting young people is intended to inspire a cultural change in attitudes toward personal taxation in the UK. However, the degree to which these tax education tools are included in the national curricula and their impact are still relatively unknown.====The US and the UK are not unusual in rolling out tax education programs and initiatives. ==== (OECD, 2015) offers initiatives for taxpayer education to 28 developing countries. There is a worldwide appetite for regulation (e.g., penalties and audits) to be accompanied by awareness campaigns as well as leveraging psychological and social factors to promote tax compliance effectively. This research will be useful in this vein.====An extensive literature considers various determinants of tax morale, from sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, marital status, income, education, tenure) to social variables (e.g., government trust, fairness, political orientation). Despite the extensive research on the impact of individual perceptions of the fairness of tax systems on tax morale (see, e.g., Gilligan and Richardson, 2005; Song and Yarbrough, 1978; Torgler, 2003, 2006, 2007; Torgler and Werner, 2005; Wenzel, 2005), relatively little research has been done on the influence of FTL (the exceptions are Azwadi and Norsiah, 2014; Palil et al., 2013; Wong and Lo, 2015), and no one has yet considered FTL as a moderator to fairness on tax morale. This research addresses that gap.====The influence of equivalency framing in tax academic and policy literature gathered momentum in the 1990s in terms of risk disposition (e.g., Kühberger, 1998; Levin et al., 2002) or goal orientation (e.g., Hasseldine and Hite, 2003). Emphasis framing is recognized in politics, psychology, and health research, but rarely considered in tax research (other than Cullis et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 1994). Yet the questions and statements commonly posed to measure tax morale are so varied that the impact of emphasis framing should be considered.====The research is based on survey data of 627 US and UK public and private sector employees and was conducted by a research team (including the authors) in 2015 as a part of larger data collection. The researchers explored the tax compliance ethics of the respondents with three statements that portray their respective tax systems in a positive frame (in which there would not be a reason to cheat), and four statements that portray the tax systems in a negative frame (in which there might be some perceived justification for cheating). This is consistent with the approach taken by Wong and Lo (2015) in their factor analysis of the same questions. The researchers also explored the levels of FTL of the respondents with three questions on basic financial literacy and two specifically focused on tax literacy. The results show a systematic variation of the effect of perceived tax fairness conditional on the FTL. Further, the way in which questions are framed is found to be important.====This research makes two significant contributions to the existing tax literature by examining the moderating effect of FTL on fairness and tax morale, while simultaneously considering the impact of emphasis framing on the respondents. The findings suggest a double dividend could be achieved by raising FTL because improved FTL has a positive impact on tax morale and can be magnified by the impact of fairness. The findings also suggest that, to measure individuals’ tax morale effectively, questions and scenarios posed by academics and policy makers should consider positive, negative, and emphasis framing, as well as the moderating effect of the respondents’ FTL.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant academic literature on tax morale, the framing phenomenon, fairness and tax morale, and other determinants of tax morale. Section 3 gives details on the research data and methodologies; Section 4 discusses the findings; and Section 5 offers our conclusions.",Tax morale: Framing and fairness,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000844,13 December 2021,2021,Research Article,49.0

The study employs a dynamic model based on a two-step system generalized method of moments. The results show that improving institutional quality promotes access to primary, secondary, and tertiary education overall and for females. In particular, government effectiveness, control of ==== and political stability, and the absence of violence, including terrorism, are the most important dimensions that foster human capital development. The results suggest that fostering these particular institutional quality dimensions is critical to improving human capital development in Africa.","Human capital development is vital for African countries. The World Bank (2018) argues that the ability of African countries to reduce poverty and inequality is essentially based on having an educated, well-trained, and resilient population. In other words, a skilled and empowered workforce is a valuable asset that can help African economies to accelerate their structural transformation and economic development and take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution and globalization. However, this is possible only if Africans have the opportunity to acquire and attain the level of education that they desire.====Also, comparative analyses of developing regions with World Bank (2020a) data indicate that Africa has the deepest “human capital deficit” in the world. Africa remains underenrolled in relation to its population size. One-third of the countries in Africa have a net primary enrollment rate below 50 percent; 81.39 percent have a net secondary enrollment rate of less than 50 percent, and 80 percent of the countries have a gross tertiary enrollment rate of less than 10 percent. Women are particularly affected by school exclusion. Although Africa has succeeded in reducing the gender gap at the primary level, reducing it at the secondary and tertiary levels remains a great challenge. From 1996–2018, the gender parity index in primary, secondary, and tertiary school enrollment is on average 0.965, 0.795, and 0.717, respectively (World Bank, 2020a).====The crucial importance of human capital formation in the development process led the United Nations (UN) and the African Union (AU) to fully integrate it into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2063, respectively. Goal 4 of the SDGs aims to ensure equitable, inclusive, and quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all (United Nations, 2015). In Africa, the AU’s Agenda 2063 mentions education as a priority goal, while emphasizing the need for the continent to have “well-trained and adequately skilled citizens supported by science, technology and innovation for a knowledge society” (African Union Commission, 2015). The crucial role of human capital development in a country’s development process also drove social scientists and policy makers to study its determinants.====At least five working groups seek to explain human capital development in developing countries. The first group focuses on the role of public policies in overcoming market failure, such as credit constraints in financing human capital development (Galor and Moav, 2006; Lindert, 2005; Rajan, 2009). The second group focuses on inequality and ethnolinguistic fragmentation as barriers to human capital accumulation when they are very pronounced (Easterly, 2007; Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997; Galor et al., 2009; Perotti, 1996). The third group highlights demographic, historical, religious, and cultural factors as determinants of human capital formation (Becker and Woessmann, 2009; Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997; Meyer et al., 1992). The fourth group examines the effects of different education systems on educational outcomes and shows that schools with more managerial autonomy produce positive effects on educational outcomes, and the centralized allocation of financial resources has a positive impact on the quality of education (Fuchs and Woessman, 2007). The fifth group insists that human capital accumulation depends on the quality of institutions. For example, Gallego (2010) argues that public spending on education is explained by political participation. Similarly, less centralized governments tend to provide their populations with better quality education (Engerman and Sokoloff, 1997; Inman and Rubinfeld, 1997; Oates, 1972). However, decentralization can create inefficient provision of education in the absence of checks and balances at the local level because it allows local elites to concentrate power in their hands and block the provision of public goods, including education, or channel them to their members or supporters (Bardhan, 2002; Kremer et al., 2002).====This study follows the fifth group’s work, which focuses on the role of institutional quality on human capital development. Indeed, since the seminal work of North (1990), interest has continuouly increased in the quality of institutions to explain the economic performance of various countries. However, very few studies have analyzed the role of institutional quality on human capital development in Africa. In most cases, existing works focus on developing countries in general. Those who study the role of institutional quality have often limited themselves to a single dimension of these institutions. For example, Seka (2013) examines the relationship between corruption and tertiary education in Africa. Brown (2000) and Harding and Stasavage (2014) study the role of democracy on primary school enrollment and basic services, such as school fees and school inputs. Poirier (2012) analyzes the effect of armed conflict on schooling in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the role of institutional quality in human capital development using several dimensions of institutional quality. In this regard, the study employs a dynamic empirical model based on two-step system–generalized method of moments (GMM) and a panel of 49 African countries over the period 1996–2018. The research is based in part on Acemoglu et al. (2014); Adams-Kane and Lim (2016), and Dias and Tebaldi (2012). It assumes that improving institutional quality increases the rate of return on investment in education and motivates individuals to invest more in their education.====Despite its importance in economic development, institutional quality is also poor in the region, with an average of -0.582 over the period 1996–2018. Indeed, control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, voice and accountability, rule of law and political stability, and the absence of violence, including terrorism, are all negative, with averages of, respectively, -0.551, -0.655, -0.619, -0.576, -0.615, and -0.476 (World Bank, 2020b).====This study contributes to the existing literature in four ways. First, it uses an aggregate institutional quality measure calculated by a simple average of the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators. This allows us to investigate the effect of overall institutional quality on human capital development in Africa. Second, because one particular institutional quality measure might dominate the composite indicator that we have constructed, we also use six institutional quality measures. This enables us to examine individual institutional measures so as to better disentangle and identify the most relevant dimensions of institutional quality that foster human capital development in the region (see, e.g., Ebeke et al., 2015; Nkoa and Song, 2020; Ogunniyi et al., 2020). Third, we employ a dynamic modeling approach that is more suitable for an analysis of policy reforms that have long-term effects and account for dynamic effects. In particular, we use two-step system-GMM estimators to account for potential endogeneity bias associated with the key explanatory variables. Our fourth contribution is that we investigate the effect of institutional quality not only on the education males and females together but also for females separately==== (see, e.g., Feldmann, 2017). The reason is that having more educated women means more educated children in the future. Mothers play a very important role in children’s education. So, understating how Africa is doing on women’s education is quite important.====The rest of this research is divided into four sections. Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature. Section 3 presents the data and the methodology. Section 4 discusses the results.

Using different approaches to estimate FI, we ﬁnd that banking regulation has a positive impact on FI. In particular, our ﬁndings suggest that regulations for monitoring entry into the financial sector, external reporting and audits, and deposit insurance contribute sustainably to an increase in FI. In addition, banking regulations help the region to attract foreign direct investment and boost economic growth. An important policy implication of this paper is that CEMAC regulators should enhance synergy with mobile telephone network providers to promote digital FI, as it offers a low-cost option for promoting FI, especially for people living in areas underserved by mainstream financial institutions.","To achieve their full potential for economic growth, countries need legislation that not only fosters easy and affordable access to finance but also protects providers of finance (households), distributors of finance (financial institutions), and users of finance (borrowers) (Busch, 2017; Chiwira et al., 2013). Following the global financial crisis in 2008, countries around the world embarked on many amendments to rebuild the public’s trust in the financial system. One way of building trust is enacting and implementing regulations that protect the interest of all stakeholders for an inclusive economy (World Bank, 2018).====Financial inclusion is an essential element in poverty reduction and economic growth as well as bank stability (Ahamed and Mallick, 2019). For developing countries, the use of branchless banking based on information and communication technology (ICT) has proven effective in driving financial inclusion (Neaime and Gaysset, 2018). Also, researchers have reported that inasmuch as financial inclusion drives development in poor countries, it should be accompanied by education and training (Diniz et al., 2012). Despite the overwhelming advantages of financial inclusion, it has been reported that when countries do not organize their financial systems so as to accommodate both the rich and the poor, devastating effects will result, ranging from a rural exodus, increase in the crime rate, a probable decline in investment, and increased unemployment (Leeladhar, 2006). It is against this backdrop that this paper highlights policies that foster stability in financial institutions and protect the interest of all other stakeholders.====The principal constraint in empirical studies on banking regulation is that of measurement. Prior studies have generally relied on prudential ratios as a proxy for banking regulation. For example, Anarfo et al. (2020) examined the relationship between banking regulation and financial inclusion using a single measure (capital adequacy) as a proxy for financial regulation. The problem with such a single measure is that it measures financial institutions’ resilience and fails to measure its effect on external stakeholders. This was, however, alleviated by Barth et al. (2004), who conducted a survey on multidimensional prudential policies. Motivated by the approach of Alam et al. (2019); Barth et al. (2004), and the World Bank (2019) in measuring banking regulation, this paper fills a gap in the literature by developing a multidimensional index that combines adherence to the core Basel principles related to bank stability, consumer protection, and the effectiveness of the regulatory authorities. Prior research on financial regulation focused on banking regulation and banking efficiency (Ahamed and Mallick, 2019; Barth et al., 2013) and bank performance (Bouheni, 2013; Bouheni et al., 2014). Our index further enables a holistic evaluation of the impact of financial regulation on financial inclusion from a stakeholder perspective.====Research on financial inclusion is abundant (Dienillah et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Neaime and Gaysset, 2018), but not much research covers Africa (Anarfo et al., 2020; Léon and Zins, 2020; Zins and Weill, 2016), and, more specifically, none concern those in regional blocs on the continent. Although these studies generally focus on financial inclusion and poverty alleviation or rural development, the few that examine the nexus between banking regulation and financial inclusion do so at a continental or country level, using a single ratio as a proxy for banking regulation. Thus, more studies on this area are needed, specifically at the regional level, given that the efficiency of regulators in driving inclusive finance varies from one regulatory authority to another. The IFI index by Sarma (2012) is employed to measure financial inclusion. This index combines three dimensions of financial inclusion (accessibility, availability, and use of financial services), and it is comparable across countries over time. One question yet to be answered is whether effective regulations promote sustainable financial inclusion. This paper empirically establishes the nature of this relationship in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) region but does not predict a sign for the coefficient.====The relationship between financial regulation and financial inclusion is empirically examined in this study using data from Financial Access Survey (FAS) for the FI index and Banking Regulation and Supervision Survey (BRSS) for the banking regulation index. The regression analysis controls for various socioeconomic, technological, and bank stability factors as well as time-fixed effects. In summary, the results reveal that banking regulation has a statistically positive impact on financial inclusion. In the individual dimensions, we also find a positive and significant relationship between financial outreach/use and banking regulation after controlling for an array of control variables. Our evidence is robust to several sensitivity tests, including (1) alternative assumptions and model speciﬁcations, (2) a dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to avoid reverse-causality bias, and (3) additional controls and approaches to address endogeneity. Our results support arguments in the literature that banking regulation enhances FI.====This paper makes a contribution to the literature on financial regulation and financial inclusion by combining several regulations that address the needs of all stakeholders in the credit creation cycle in the CEMAC bloc. Related studies on Africa focus on using a single ratio as a proxy for banking regulation. Next, this study complements the work of Anarfo et al. (2020) and Kodongo (2018), who also examine the FI implications of banking regulation. Unlike Anarfo et al. (2020), who rely principally on the principal component method for deriving an index for financial inclusion, we employ two methods in our analysis that confirm the robustness of our results. Additionally, whereas Kodongo (2018) focuses on particular macroprudential regulations (capital adequacy and liquidity), we take a comprehensive approach that examines banking regulations pertaining to supervisor power, supervisor independence, capital adequacy, licensing, external auditing and reporting, consumer protection, and deposit insurance. Our study extends that of Barth et al. (2004), who study the relationship between specific regulatory and supervisory practices and banking-sector development, efficiency, and fragility. We extend this line of thought by looking beyond bank stability and performance to consider the FI implications of these regulations. The study also has policy implications, as it highlights regulatory deficiencies in the region, particularly in consumer protection, and recommends possible solutions to alleviate them. Therefore, the work has relevance for regulators, as it serves as a starting point for pursuing policies beyond the traditional obligation of ensuring bank stability to become the precursor of financial inclusion.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 is the introduction, Section 2 reviews the literature on banking regulation and financial inclusion, Section 3 discusses the sample selection and regression variables, Section 4 presents the empirical results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.",An empirical analysis of the impact of banking regulations on sustainable financial inclusion in the CEMAC region,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000832,8 December 2021,2021,Research Article,51.0

The model is estimated using quarterly data on the Chinese economy over the period 2005Q3-2020Q4 and then applied to analyze how macroeconomic volatility varies with trade and financial openness in several representative settings. We find that the impacts on macroeconomic volatility of trade openness and financial openness depend on the nature of the underlying shocks and a moderate degree of trade openness, together with a high degree of financial openness, yield the optimal welfare results in most cases. These results highlight that the effects of trade and financial openness on macroeconomic volatility differ in various situations and that their interactions can lead to different welfare results.","In the past two decades, the opening up of consumer and financial markets has been an important strategy for accelerating development in many emerging market economies. Along with the great benefits of opening up, however, there are also concerns about economic and financial instability associated with opening-up policies. In this paper, we develop a new dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of an open economy to investigate the volatility effects of trade and financial opening-up policies. In particular, we extend the DSGE model of a traditional open economy by allowing for variations in trade and financial openness, under which the effects of trade and financial openness on macroeconomic volatility as well as the transmission mechanisms can be studied in a tractable way.====In the extant literature on open economies, the relationships between trade openness and macroeconomic volatility can be roughly divided into two categories. The first focuses on how trade openness is related to volatility in certain macroeconomic variables, such as output and consumption (Giovanni and Levchenko, 2009; Kose et al., 2005). Another strand of literature examines whether trade opening raises the possibility of a financial crisis, in which trade openness is considered a trigger of “sudden stops” (Cavallo and Frankel, 2008) or as a vehicle for spreading crisis (Easterly and Kraay, 2000). Despite the large number of studies on the effects of trade openness on macroeconomic volatility, no firm conclusions have yet been reached in the current literature. Some studies show that higher degrees of trade openness lead to greater macroeconomic fluctuation (e.g., Giovanni and Levchenko, 2012; Abubaker, 2015), but others find no significant impacts or even reverse effects (e.g., Ashraf et al., 2017; Bowdler and Malik, 2017; Cavallo et al., 2008; Mpofu, 2020; Pancaro, 2010). Still other studies emphasize that the impact of trade openness on macroeconomic volatility varies with conditions (e.g., Balavac and Pugh, 2016; Haddad et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2016).====As for the impact of financial openness on macroeconomic volatility, no consensus has been reached either. Literature in this field focuses mostly on the nexus between financial openness and consumption volatility. Although some studies show that fluctuations in consumption are the price to be paid for financial opening (Prasad et al., 2004), other studies find that financial liberalization facilitates consumption smoothing and has a stabilization effect on consumption growth (Ahmed and Suardi, 2009; Bekaert et al., 2006; Buch and Yener, 2010). There are also mixed empirical results regarding the impact of financial openness on output volatility (e.g., Aizenman et al., 2010; Cavoli et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2013) and on the volatility of capital flows (e.g., Broner and Ventura, 2010; Hegerty, 2011). Overall, the relationship between financial openness and macroeconomic volatility is ambiguous and varies over time as does the nature of the underlying shocks (e.g., Buch et al., 2005; Ghazouani et al., 2019; Ma, 2016).====Another strand of literature explores the role of institutions in the openness-volatility nexus. According to Kuncic (2012), institutions can be divided into three categories: legal institutions, political institutions, and economic institutions. Ahmed and Suardi (2009) claim that good legal institutions contribute to macroeconomic stability in the context of openness. Similar conclusions are reached by Balavac and Pugh (2016), with an emphasis on political institutions. Turning to economic institutions, Mpofu (2020) analyzes the stabilizing effect of alternative exchange rate regimes on exchange rate volatility when the economy is open to trade. Based on the theory of the impossible trinity, Aizenman et al. (2010) discuss the economic outcomes of each of the three policy choices (i.e., monetary policy autonomy, exchange rate stability, and financial openness) as well as combinations of any two policies. By constructing a DSGE model in which financial openness matters for macroeconomic stability, Faia and Iliopulos (2011) show that the optimal monetary policy responds to exchange rate variations in order to achieve greater stabilization and maximize social welfare.====In general, the current literature has three main inadequacies. First, most studies only empirically examine the relationship between trade (financial) openness and macroeconomic volatility, but formal theoretical models (especially general equilibrium models) are largely absent. Second, due to the lack of micro-based general equilibrium models in discussing the effects of trade and financial openness on macroeconomic volatility, the mechanisms underlying the trade (financial) openness-macroeconomic volatility nexus are not well understood. Third, in the current literature, very few (if any) studies have discussed the joint effects of trade and financial openness on macroeconomic volatility, particularly from a general equilibrium perspective.====In an attempt to address these limitations, this paper develops a new DSGE model of an open economy to study the effects of trade and financial openness on macroeconomic volatility. The paper makes the following four contributions.====First, we develop a new DSGE model for an open economy with explicit roles for trade openness and financial openness, which extends the conventional DSGE models that treat the economy as either closed or completely open. Specifically, the main novelty of the model is the introduction of an imperfect financial market. Unlike previous studies, which model financial openness as better access to broader capital markets and funding resources (e.g., Coeurdacier et al., 2020; Devereux and Yu, 2020), we focus on the reduction in financial friction and market distortion in the process of financial opening. As a result, the model provides a new framework in which the degrees of trade openness and financial openness are important determinants of aggregate supply and demand when international trade and financial markets are imperfect and face transaction costs.====Second, compared to purely empirical studies, the DSGE model developed in this paper is micro-founded and thus can be easily used to analyze the mechanisms underlying the nexus between openness and macroeconomic volatility. In particular, by employing impulse response analysis with an estimated DSGE model, we clearly show that an exogenous shock is transmitted through the model and that the volatility of the main macroeconomic variables varies with the degree of trade and financial openness. This contributes to the purely empirical literature by providing a model-based and thus tractable mechanism analysis.====Third, we also explore variations in macroeconomic volatility when trade openness and financial openness change simultaneously. This question has been largely ignored in the previous literature, leaving a major gap in our understanding of how the interactions between trade and financial openness affect macroeconomic volatility. In addition, exploring this question using conventional regression analysis unavoidably encounters the endogeneity problem, which is difficult to address. However, using a DSGE framework, as we do here, avoids this problem because the model variables and parameters are all jointly determined and estimated.====Last but not least, several interesting findings emerge from our analysis. Regarding the empirical relationship between trade openness and economic volatility, Karras (2006) finds that greater trade openness decreases macroeconomic volatility, whereas later studies (e.g., Ahmed and Suardi, 2009; Giovanni and Levchenko, 2009) document a positive relationship between trade openness and economic volatility. In general, our study supports the later conclusion. As for the effect of financial openness, Faia (2011) and Pisani (2011) both find that higher financial openness leads to greater macroeconomic volatility within a DSGE framework. In our study, however, we find that macroeconomic volatility is generally mitigated at higher levels of financial openness.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 reports and discusses the parameter estimates of the model. Section 4 analyzes how trade and financial openness affect macroeconomic volatility using impulse response simulations and welfare analysis. Section 5 concludes the paper.","Trade openness, financial openness, and macroeconomic volatility",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000820,1 December 2021,2021,Research Article,52.0

We tested the role of the growth rate of market sentiment and found that positive market sentiment leads to higher bank credit growth. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of several bank-specific variables on bank credit growth and discuss to what extent diversification and the investment portfolio reshape the credit growth process.","The 2007–2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) highlighted the fact that excessive lending growth exposes banks to systemic risk and makes them vulnerable to macroeconomic instability (Alessi and Detken, 2018). It uncontroversially showed that easy credit, fuelling an asset bubble, was very disruptive to the banking system, which had a substantial negative spillover effect on the real economy, and was the root of the GFC crisis (Jordà et al., 2015). Recognising the devastating effect of rapid credit growth on the real economy, academics and policymakers have placed banking institutions under heavy scrutiny, and started a lively academic and policy debate on identifying the factors that make banks susceptible or resilient to crises, using different performance measures such as profitability, efficiency, leverage and stability (Al-Khouri and Arouri, 2016; Bouheni and Hasnaoui, 2017; Alessi and Detken, 2018). The 2007–2008 GFC forces us to revisit bank lending with regard to bank-level and macroeconomic characteristics.====The literature suggests that bank-specific characteristics such as bank size, loan quality and ownership explain the pattern of bank lending behaviour (Bertay et al., 2015; Iwanicz-Drozdowska and Witkowski, 2016; Chen et al., 2014; Zins and Weill, 2018). While numerous macro-prudential tools such as capital regulation and activity restriction are believed to promote loan quality and restore stability during financial crises (Repullo and Saurina Salas, 2011; Noman et al., 2018), bank ownership is still a prominent tool in stabilising the banking system, as most countries resorted to the nationalisation of private banks as an initial response to the crisis (Beccalli and Frantz, 2016).====A few researchers such as Ibrahim (2016), Ascarya et al. (2016), Aysan and Ozturk (2018) and Ibrahim and Rizvi (2018) have investigated the role of Islamic banks regarding loan growth and resilience of the banking system during economic downturns. Their findings contradict each other; while Ibrahim (2016) found that Islamic banks were not influenced by cyclicality in Malaysia, Ascarya et al. (2016) found that Islamic banks were procyclical in Indonesia. On the other hand, Aysan and Ozturk (2018) found that both Islamic and conventional banks were procyclical in Turkey. Based on previous studies, it is clear that there are mixed results pertaining to the link between the business cycle and Islamic banks. This motivates the first objective of the study, which is to investigate the nature of the link between the business cycle and Islamic banks’ lending behavior in GCC countries. By investigating Islamic banks’ procyclicality, this study provides unique evidence from the banking market in the Gulf Council Countries (GCC), namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. This region is an important field of study for several reasons. First, it represents the core architecture of Islamic banks, comprising the largest Islamic banking market in the world, capturing 34 % of total banking assets in 2016 and indicating growth at an annual rate of 17.34 % during the period 2007–2016 (Gazdar et al., 2018). Second, the banking sector of this region has become more competitive and developed through the adoption of financial liberalisation and extensive reform strategies in the form of stringent capital regulations and official supervision, market discipline and the removal of interest rate controls (Khediri et al., 2015). Also, in the GCC countries, there has been rapid bank lending growth to the private sector as a percentage of GDP from 34.29 percent in 2000 to 74.08 percent in 2015, as a result of the financial deepening and restructuring of the banking system (World Bank, 2019). In this vein, Al-Hassan et al. (2010) demonstrated that this lending growth was consistent among emerging countries. If the lending was measured as a percentage of the non-oil GDP, however, the lending growth was highest in the oil-based GCC countries. Besides, the oil-based GCC countries connect emerging and developed economies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States, which captures the attention of investors and policymakers worldwide. This locational benefit makes the GCC countries more sensitive to political and economic instability.====On the other hand, the argument against the resilience and stability of Islamic banks suggests that there is a theoretical as well as an empirical justification for the opposite view. For example, although theoretically both types of banks differ in their operations, it is proven that they are indistinguishable. Table 1 below reports the deposit to loans ratio as well as the loans to total assets ratio in both Islamic and conventional banks in the GCC region. The values suggest that both banks are similar in terms of size of deposits and loans. This suggests that both types of banks do not rely heavily on deposits for the allocation of loans and, generally, loans indicate a moderate level of intermediation. Previous studies have found that PLS financing of Islamic banks constitutes a small portion of their total financing (Ibrahim, 2016; Chong and Liu, 2009; Khan, 2010). Furthermore, since Islamic banks impose ==== restrictions on the businesses and activities that they invest in or finance, Islamic banks have lower hedging opportunities to minimise risks (Beck et al., 2013). Besides, Islamic banks were not as completely unaffected by the GFC as it first appeared. Some of these banks were marginally affected thanks to government support and the captive customer concept, i.e. customers use Islamic banks not because they are efficient, but because of religious obligations (Meslier et al., 2017; Čihák and Hesse, 2010; Hasan and Dridi, 2011). Based on the previous discussion, it is clear that the results on the performance of Islamic banks are mixed (Alqahtani et al., 2017; Alqahtani and Mayes, 2018; Kassim and Abdulle, 2012). Therefore, the second objective is to look further at the difference between Islamic and conventional banks in terms of credit growth.====In addition, the behavioural finance theory claims that investment decisions are influenced by the cognitive bias of decision-makers (Danso et al., 2019). In this connection, the diagnostic expectation theory of Bordalo et al. (2018) suggests that the expectation of investors regarding the future credit default of borrowers is the driving force of boom and bust cycles in the credit market. This is because the current market condition influences investors’ expectations about future credit defaults. Such expectations include good information about market fundamentals giving them confidence in business, industry, and economic fundamentals, which all leads them to become too optimistic, lower their credit spread and expand more credit in the market (López-Salido et al., 2017). Such a condition is more pronounced during periods of high market sentiment, leading to high investment demand in the market. The endogeneity of market sentiment on credit is the key feature of this behavioural expectation, which depends more on investors’ expectations about default probability and risk perception rather than balance sheet measures (Bordalo et al., 2018). Based on the behavioural finance theory, we can argue that market sentiment induces banks to predict their risk appetite and the default probability of borrowers, shaping the credit growth of banks. Therefore, the third objective of this paper is to investigate the link between market sentiment and the level of bank credit growth in GCC countries.====This paper contributes to the literature in different ways. Firstly, it investigates the way different types of banks respond to the business cycle in a cross-country setting. Here, in particular, we are among the first to investigate the procyclicality of Islamic and conventional banks with regard to credit growth in the GCC countries. Secondly, we focus on the banking sector of the GCC countries, where both Islamic and conventional banks co-exist. In addition, the region is considered as the foundation of the architecture of Islamic banks, and it is also the region where lending growth increased by 116.04 % during the period from 2000 to 2015 (World Bank, 2019). Thirdly, in addition to different bank-specific factors, we incorporate the oil price in investigating credit procyclicality, because fluctuations of the oil price influence the financial sectors of the oil-based GCC countries (Mensi et al., 2019). This study further contributes to the literature by incorporating the impact of market sentiment on credit growth, as higher market sentiment leads to higher investment demand, which in turn increases bank credit growth (Danso et al., 2019).====Employing the two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system on a panel of 104 banks from the six GCC countries over the period from 2011 to 2017, we found that Islamic banks were procyclical and had higher credit growth compared to conventional banks. Furthermore, positive market sentiment led to higher bank credit growth in the GCC region. The rest of this paper is organised in the following manner. A literature review on Islamic banks and credit growth and the other determinants of credit growth is presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the methodology of this investigation. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 4, and concluding remarks are given in Section 5.",Cyclicality of bank credit growth: Conventional vs Islamic banks in the GCC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000327,20 November 2021,2021,Research Article,53.0

Using heterogeneous panel cointegration methods, we first estimate the real equilibrium exchange rate and detect episodes of currency misalignment. We find asymmetric effects of real currency misalignments: overvaluation has a negative effect, but undervaluation has no effect on the trade balance. Additionally, we find that global value chain participation weakens the effect of currency misalignments on the balance of trade. Therefore, our results suggest that globalization reduces the role of exchange rates in stimulating the domestic economy.","The relationship between exchange rate movements and economic performance constitutes an important part of textbook international macroeconomics. In the short and medium term, domestic exchange rate depreciation is supposed to make domestic production more competitive, improve net exports and, as a consequence, contribute to higher economic growth (Eichengreen and Gupta, 2013). Currency depreciations (or undervaluations when referring to the equilibrium exchange rate concept) have been considered to have played a key role in the export-driven economic growth of Japan and West Germany in the postwar era as well as of China and other East Asian economies over the past three decades (Dooley et al., 2004).====Recently, some studies, such as Ahmed et al. (2017), showed that the increasing share of global value chains (GVCs) in world trade reduces the strength of the relationship between exchange rates and trade balance (and economic performance). In other words, as production chains are located in numerous countries, countries increasingly need to import more to be able to export. Under such conditions, currency depreciations still make exports more competitive, but very likely with more limited competitiveness gains because of higher prices of imported intermediate products used in the production of exported goods. Accordingly, currency appreciation would not only make exports more expensive abroad but also make imported intermediate products cheaper, thus lowering the domestic production costs of exports and therefore reducing the exchange rate elasticity of exports. Consequently, the increased globalization of production, characterized by an increasing share of global value chains, is likely to significantly affect the relationship between exchange rates and the real economy. Therefore, somewhat paradoxically, exchange rates become less important for trade in a more globalized world. This phenomenon, i.e., the greater importance of GVCs, may help explain the experience of several of the new EU member states of export-led growth without currency depreciations.====In this paper, we focus on the new European Union (EU) member states—the former transition economies. These countries are characterized by two interesting features. First, they typically experienced high rates of economic growth, often driven by strong export dynamics despite a significant trend of appreciation of domestic exchange rates.==== However, during the transition process, the new EU member states also experienced a significant appreciation of their equilibrium exchange rates (associated with higher productivity) and thus, while the nominal exchange rates appreciated, the currencies of these countries may still have been undervalued. As a result, exchange rate appreciation in these countries does not necessarily mean loss of competitiveness. Consequently, in our empirical approach, we focus on exchange rate over/undervaluation, as opposed to mere appreciation/depreciation. Second, the new EU member states have often exhibited some of the world’s highest shares of participation in the GVCs and therefore the highest shares of reexports (or, alternatively, the lowest shares of domestic value added) in their total exports.====The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we reestimate the elasticity of exports to currency misalignments.==== Therefore, we extend the previous evidence on the role of the exchange rate in the economies of new EU member states by Cuestas et al. (2020). While these authors examine the effect of currency misalignments on economic growth, we evaluate the effects on the trade balance, as an undervalued exchange rate is unlikely to lead to an overall positive effect on the real economy unless it first improves the trade balance.====Additionally, the transition economies are expected to experience trade balance deficits in the early stages of the transition process, with the eventual trade balance surpluses often considered to be key macroeconomic preconditions for a successful completion of the transition process. Consequently, our paper not only helps improve our knowledge on the modalities of the relationship between the exchange rate and the real economy in the new EU member states, but also contributes to understanding the role played by real over/undervaluation in the successful conclusion of the transition process. This study is also relevant to new EU member states with plans to join the euro area (EA). If the exchange rate elasticity of exports is high, the benefits of conducting one’s own monetary policy increase. In such a case, policies focusing on maintaining an undervalued currency can aid in economic recovery or address persistent current account imbalances. However, our results, obtained using heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques, do not indicate that an exchange rate undervaluation improves the trade balance.====Second, we examine the possibility of nonlinearity in the effects of currency misalignments; specifically, we separately investigate the effects of real overvaluation and real undervaluation on the trade balance. Some authors examine periods of over- and undervaluation separately and evaluate the impact on economic growth, showing mixed evidence on whether currency undervaluation stimulates growth (Nouira and Sekkat, 2012; Rodrik, 2012). We contribute to this body of literature by providing evidence on the new EU members. We find that real overvaluation has a negative effect on the balance of trade. In the long term, our results suggest that a real overvaluation of domestic currency of 5 p.p. and 20 p.p. is associated with a deterioration of the trade balance by 0.6 % and 3.6 % of GDP, respectively. On the other hand, we fail to find evidence of a positive effect of real undervaluation on the balance of trade. Therefore, our results suggest that real overvaluation adversely affects the successful completion of the transition process by preventing the trade balance from improving. Moreover, undervaluation does not seem to be able to stimulate trade balance improvement, suggesting that the advantages of an independent monetary policy may be more limited in this group of countries.====Finally, the third contribution of this paper is an investigation of the role played by GVCs in the relationship between currency misalignments and the trade balance. We find that increased GVC participation (expressed as the backwards GVC linkages – that is, the share of foreign value added in domestic exports) reduces the effect of currency misalignments on the balance of trade. The strength of the effect of currency misalignments on the trade balance declines steadily with increasing levels of GVC participation – when the level of GVC participation reaches 40 % (i.e., one standard deviation above the average value of GVC observed in our sample), the effect disappears completely. We also find evidence that in smaller and richer countries, GVC participation limits the effect of currency misalignment on trade balance more than in larger and poorer countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Focussing on Africa’s real economy, this study investigates the linkage between portfolio investments and real sector growth, and whether financial sector development strengthens this association. The study covers 30 countries over the period 1990–2017. We adopt the Lewbel ==== general method of moments (IV-GMM) two-step robust estimator, which relies on heteroscedasticity for identification, while dealing with instrument insufficiency, unavailability, endogeneity and omitted variable bias. We found that portfolio equity has no growth impact on Africa’s real sector. Debt flows deter the growth of the overall real sector as well as the manufacturing and industrial sectors, but have no impact on agriculture and service growth. We found that financial development does strengthen the positive association between capital flows and economic growth, but this is dependent on the type of sector and portfolio investment, as well as on the degree of financial development. We control for known determinants of economic growth.","Despite the welfare gains associated with capital flows, much of the empirics is skewed towards foreign direct investment (FDI) with a slight emphasis on other flows. However, the distinct features of these flows require that attention to all should be the norm rather than the exception. While FDI differs from other types of flows in terms of control, stability, and resilience to both financial and economic crises, portfolio equity flows favour liquid assets rather than fixed capital investments. Portfolio debt flows impose an obligation on recipient countries and firms as opposed to the other two. In as much as portfolio equity flows and foreign direct investment (FDI) are deemed expensive because of the high required rates of return, they offer a bit of relief since rates on the return are tied to available profit. Whereas portfolio debt flows are relatively cheap in terms of rates of return, payment of interest and principal are not tied to available profit.====Nevertheless, most studies on capital flows have focused on FDI while treating equity and debt flows as an appendix to the relevance of FDI, despite the financial relief they bring to countries. In addition to the financial relief associated with equity flows, they reduce the risk of local firms by sharing risk with foreign partners, enhancing stock market liquidity and capitalization, as well as enforcing the establishment of robust corporate governance mechanisms. It is thus suggested that, given the varied characteristics of each capital flow, each type may have a completely different impact on different sectors of the economy and growth in the recipient countries. The United Nations make an important observation about the relevance of portfolio investment flows (equity and debt) relative to dominant FDI, official development assistance (ODA) and migrants’ remittances, and state that “it is important to consider FDI in the context of other components of the financial account in the balance of payments – portfolio debt and equity investment.” The United Nations further state that “The Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development recognizes the important contribution that FDI can make to sustainable development”, while noting that the other flows are also critical. An additional motivation for considering other types of capital flows is that the dividing lines between FDI and other types of flows are becoming increasingly blurred, for three main reasons:====Again, focusing on these types of flows is of utmost significance due to the surge inflows to developing regions including Africa. For instance, UNCTAD notes, “The sharp fall in global FDI contrasted with the trend in other cross-border capital flows. Total capital flows increased from 5.6 to 6.9 percent of global GDP, as bank lending and portfolio investment (mostly portfolio debt) flow compensated for the FDI slump” (UNCTAD, 2018). It is essential to state that portfolio debt flows were a significant component of capital flows as a proportion of GDP, until the onset of the recent global financial crisis, where it accounted for a higher percentage of global GDP. Between 2012 and 2016, the percentage of GDP that constituted portfolio debt flows was much higher than FDI. Though debt and equity flow dipped owing to their volatile nature amidst the crisis, the recovery has been encouraging, though slower (UNCTAD, 2018).====While the impact of FDI on economic growth seemed settled, work on the impact of debt and equity flows on growth is part of the capital-growth literature; as such, relevant studies are limited. Research on the effect of portfolio investment flows on the growth of real sector components and the extent to which financial development facilitates portfolio-real sector growth linkages is even rarer. For instance, although Gossel and Biekpe (2014) found a less robust association between portfolio investments and economic growth, they focused solely on South Africa. Similarly, Calderón and Nguyen (2015) considered the impact of FDI, aid and foreign borrowing growth on output growth of 38 SSA economies with no mention of portfolio equity. Other known capital flows-growth studies such as that by Agbloyor et al. (2014) have treated portfolio investmets virtually as an appendix to FDI flows. However, these studies focused on growth measured by GDP. To address the issue of capital flows, and the real sector in Africa, Kodongo and Ojah (2017) sought to assess the impact of FDI and remittances of growths in manufacturing, agriculture, industry and services. Again, their study ignored the impact of both equity and debt flows. Though Asamoah and Alagidede (2020) explored the causal linkages between portfolio investments (equity and debt) and the real sector, they failed to account for the mediating role of financial development while focusing on countries below the Sahara. In a recent study, Asamoah et al. (2021) examined the linkages between the growth of Africa’s real sector and capital flows (FDI, portfolio equity and debt) but the study paid particular attention to the moderating power of institutional quality.====This study therefore adds to the current discussion through the application of macro-level data on the association between portfolio investment flows and the growth of Africa’s real sector, and the extent to which financial sector development reinforces the portfolio investments-sectoral growth nexus. The study thus addresses the following shortfalls in the literature: (1) Do portfolio investments (equity and debt) stifle or promote the growth of Africa’s real sector? (2) Does financial development promote real sector growth in Africa? (3) At which levels of financial development can any adverse impact of portfolio investment on the real sector be mitigated or reinforce the growth impact of portfolio investments on Africa’s real economy? We measure the real sector as the combined growth of the value addition of the sectors that drive economic activity. These include growths in value additions in agriculture, manufacturing, industry and services. These indicators have been used as the main proxies for the real sector in the growth literature (see Aizenman et al., 2013; Ductor and Grechyna, 2015; Kodongo and Ojah, 2017; Igan et al., 2017; Ibrahim and Alagidede, 2017; Asamoah and Alagidede, 2020). Consequently, this study aims to separately assess the impact of portfolio equity and private debt flows on Africa’s real economy, and subsequently to determine if the association is conditional on the extent of financial development through a marginal effect analysis.====Although economic growth in Africa as measured by either GDP or GDP per capita has been impressive over the past decade, Fioramonti (2017) cautions that when countries focus largely on GDP, which is an aggregate figure, as the ultimate measure of growth, they may miss out on alternative assessments of development, especially at the disaggregate level. Also, Aizenman et al. (2013) contend that though GDP growth is mostly the first indicator of welfare gains, the value additions of economic sectors show the actual contributions to economic activity. They further maintain that it is within these sectors that social benefits and cost eventually exist. Accordingly, UNECA (2017) notes that growth in real sector components stimulated economic growth in 2016 for two of the four highest growing countries in East Africa. Growth in Rwanda was mainly on the back of agriculture and services, despite falling coffee and tea prices, while in Tanzania demand for manufacturing and services spurred economic growth (UNECA, 2017). Political and economic observers are optimistic that a critical component needed to sustain Africa’s growth lies in the transformation of SSA’s economy, which is unattainable without growth in the expansion of the real sector. The growth of the real sector (growth in agriculture and services as well as expansions in manufacturing and industries) linked to productivity and output is essential for growth in SSA. Grabowski (2006) puts forward the argument that broad-based expansions in agricultural productivity, coupled with political developments, are essential for sustained growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Loayza and Raddatz (2010) found evidence that growth in agriculture, construction and manufacturing matters for poverty alleviation. Warr (2001) also found the growth of the agricultural and services sectors to be essential poverty reduction tools. Accordingly, growth in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors is directly linked to the growth of other sectors and the economy at large.====Against the initial background, the study augments the growth–capital flows debate by empirically examining the relationship between portfolio investment (equity and private debt) flows and the growth of the real economy in Africa. We further test whether the extent of financial development facilitates such a relationship by assessing this relationship at changing levels of financial development (marginal effect analysis). Regarding financial development and the attraction of capital flows in general, Blomström et al. (2003) note the relevance of domestic conditions in the attraction of FDI and other capital flows by local enterprises. Regarding the relevance of the domestic market on capital flows, Bilir et al. (2019) note the importance of domestic financial conditions for attracting multinational enterprises, as they contend that the level of financial sector development is an incentive for entry of multinational affiliates. They show theoretically that one incentive for the influx of foreign firms lies in the development of the host country’s financial sector, which comes about through “a financing effect.” The financing effect aids the entry and expansion of most multinational enterprises. They show that an increase of private credit from the 10th to the 90th percentile will lead to a 13.9 % surge in the number of foreign affiliates to host countries. Striking a chord between one of the spillover benefits of capital flows and financial development, Hsu et al. (2014) note the benefits of a developed financial sector to technological innovation. Using data on 32 developed and emerging economies, they show a strong correlation between the development of the equity market and higher innovation for industries that are known to depend on seeking external financing. However, credit market development was detrimental to technological innovation.====Additionally, we make use of a new broad-based financial development index that takes into account the extensiveness and intricacies of financial development as opposed to the use of single indices in previous studies. As explained by Svirydzenka (2016), the broad-based financial development index is derived from the development of financial markets and institutions in terms of access, depth and efficiency. In addition, to estimate our empirical relationships, the study adopts an instrumental variable general method of moments (IV-GMM) two–step procedure developed by Lewbel (2012) that is applicable in cases of insufficient or unavailable instruments, while at the same time dealing with issues of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. The strength of the Lewbel IV lies in its ability to augment a precisely identified model to allow for overidentifying restrictions and at the same time gain efficiency. We further focus on Africa as a portfolio investment destination that has received little attention in contrast to the dominant form of private capital flows (FDI). Given the intention of its leaders to build a stronger trade bloc with the intention to set in motion the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), the continent will have the largest bargaining power in terms of trade and investments. Finally, we achieve our objectives in a three-step procedure. First, we evaluate the direct impact of portfolio investments and financial development of the real economy in Africa. Secondly, we determine the interaction effect of portfolio investments and financial development on the real economy. Finally, we evaluate the marginal effect of portfolio investments on the real economy at varying percentiles of financial development.====Succinctly, the main thrust of the current study is the prime focus on the growth of Africa’s real economy through the attraction of portfolio investments, given that such capital flows are neither sector- nor firm-specific in nature and could be deployed in place of the traditional type of capital flow (FDI). Subsequently, we extend the preliminary investigation to examine whether financial development is a prerequsite to boost the growth impact of portfolio investments on Africa’s real economy. We do this by applying a financial development indicator as well as an estimation procedure not previously employed in the capital flows-growth dynamics literature. The paper provides several policy implications for the growth and sustainability of Africa. The recent growth in Africa has revitalised the African growth agenda and countries growing through the real sector. Issues of industrialisation and revamping of agriculture are deemed essential to the growth agenda, although current growth is led by surges in the services sector. The study alerts countries of sector-specific capital flows needed for growth, as it brings into focus the relevance of other capital flows in addition to the dominant FDI. Additionally, it affords policymakers a framework to analyze the eventual levels of financial development required to mediate the real sector–capital flows dynamics. Section 2 presents the data and the estimation procedure. Section 3 discusses the empirical results, and Section 4 concludes the study with policy recommendations.","Financial development, portfolio investments and the real economy in Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000200,20 October 2021,2021,Research Article,61.0

There is evidence that the stochastic properties of the US current account are not compatible with the intertemporal national budget constraint. We argue that this is likely to be related to the dominant role of the U.S. dollar as an ==== asset, which allows the US to meet international demand for safe assets and allows borrowing at very low ","The global financial architecture is an important factor in international adjustments. The post-Second World War environment was shaped partly by the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the pre-Second World War period. The subsequent Bretton Woods System has thus called for fixed exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, which was pegged to gold. Member countries held their international reserves mainly in U.S. dollars and in gold, making the U.S. dollar the principal reserve asset and intervention currency (Krugman, 1984; Mundell, 2007; Corsetti and Konstantinou, 2012). Despite the introduction of the euro, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–08 and the rise of the Chinese remnimbi, the dollar share declined only modestly in the countries’ reserve portfolios (Frankel and Chinn, 2008; Goldberg, 2010; Seghezza and Morelli, 2018; Ito and McCauley, 2020). Since the dollar was a reserve asset, other countries accumulated U.S. dollars through U.S. balance of payments deficits, hence the US run official settlements deficits and accumulated liabilities to foreign Central Banks without increasing official assets such as gold (Salant, 1964; Bordo and McCauley, 2019).====More recently, global imbalances increased the prospect of trade wars that threaten the global economy and risk derailing global growth. Trade disputes risk diverting attention from a sound global architecture and constructive steps/reforms to “easy fixes”. The current climate is made worse in particular by the uncertainty about the availability of international liquidity in times of financial crises, large and volatile capital flows, the absence of automatic adjustment concerning global imbalances, and the absence of good substitutes to the U.S. dollar as a reserve asset. When the US currency is like a natural monopoly, US liquid asset supply (constrained by US fiscal capacity) is not able to keep up with the global demand for reserve assets as the global economy expands. It is thus the shortage of safe assets in the 2000s that distorted the incentives of the financial system by encouraging the issuance of “private label” safe assets, which contributed to the GFC==== (Caballero et al., 2017).====Even though debt sustainability sets limits to current account deficits, high demand for US issued safe assets increases their price and reduces their yield. The low interest (yield) is one factor contributing to current account sustainability where the US can run current account deficits in the long run while still obeying its intertemporal budget constraint. The risk of a financial crisis related to the balance of payments in the US is low because US liabilities are dollar denominated and the risk of a sudden stop in financial flows is low. Moreover, over two thirds of US asset holdings abroad are foreign currency denominated, which makes a dollar depreciation less damaging to the US (Coughlin et al., 2006). Overall, all the US needs in order to meet its intertemporal budget constraint is to grow at a rate higher than the interest rate it pays on debt. The issues surrounding current account sustainability and the risks current account deficits pose notwithstanding, the question that must be answered is to what extent US current account deficits are due to US aggregate demand expansions and the extent to which the rest of the world is responsible for these imbalances. After all, since Bretton Woods, some argued all along that the US external deficit problems were due to policies outside the US and that the rest of the world voluntarily held dollars because of their valuable service flow. In other words, the US deficits were demand determined in the rest of the world (Bordo, 1993). However, there is a general agreement that large current account deficits are still sustainable if the economy can run large net export surpluses (Garg and Prabheesh, 2020) or global savings inflows (Frankel, 2006). Recall that current account deficits can be funded by borrowing from international financial markets repaid in future; as such we follow an intertemporal framework of current account sustainability developed, among others, by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995).====Despite the fact that a substantial increase in the uneven distribution of current account balances has been recorded in recent years, there are only few empirical contributions on the determinants of intertemporal budget constraints over the last decades, particularly for the US. Corsetti and Konstantinou (2012) confirm that transitory shocks are key drivers of net output over short and medium horizons, while external assets and liabilities respond to permanent shocks. Hoffmann et al. (2019) point out financial market expectations that lead to inefficient flows of funds between countries. Garg and Prabheesh (2020) show that trade deficits are persistent in economies that experienced depreciation of their currencies and attracted capital inflows, and Huang (2010) emphasizes the effects of oil prices. Cerrato et al. (2015) contribute with cross-sectional behavior and show that openness and industrial production also play a key role in current account adjustment. Christopoulos and León-Ledesma (2010) focus on non-linearities and time-varying effects and show that US current account adjustments are faster after large shocks, especially over the GFC in 2008 and 2009.====This paper aims to provide some contributions to this stream of literature. First, we employ structural Vector Autoregressions capable of distinguishing between US permanent supply shocks, preference shocks and temporary demand shocks to investigate the presumed sources of variation in the US current account. The issue is germane since global imbalances and reserve accumulations have picked up after a brief decline in 2014–2016 and reached nearly 10 trillion in 2017 (Jones, 2018).==== Our results confirm that temporary shocks to the US current account play an important role, as predicted by the intertemporal framework, whereas the effects of these shocks diminish in the long run. Second, we show that both US domestic permanent shocks and temporary shocks played a prominent role in the uneven distribution of the current account balance and a surge in US current account deficits prior to the GFC.====Finally, we discuss the implications for the international financial architecture and point out that the US does not meet its long-term intertemporal national budget constraint because the dominant role of the U.S. dollar as an international reserve asset allows the US to finance its debt at low interest rates.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review. Some theoretical background within an intertemporal model is reviewed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the empirical methods and data. Section 5 provides empirical results and policy implications, while Section 6 concludes.","The US current account, sustainability, and the international monetary system",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000236,12 October 2021,2021,Research Article,62.0

A main feature of the study is that we also assess the relationships for two subgroups, the EU15 + Cyprus and Malta, and the CEECs. Using data spanning the period between 1995====1 and 2019====2, we identify similarities and differences between the responses in these two subgroups, which are obscured when an aggregate study of the EU28 is conducted, rather than sub-groups. Our results suggest that, in assessing the current account for economic blocs, an ==== assumption of similar relationships for member countries may be misplaced.","Over the past half century, both advanced and emerging economies have experienced significant capital flows, often accompanied by large current account imbalances. These then raise some concerns regarding the potential adverse consequences of abrupt interruptions of these capital flows and their determinants (see, for example, Edwards, 2004). More recently, the significant capital flights that have been associated with the Great Recession of 2008 and the European Sovereign Debt crisis of 2010 have provided additional impetus for better understanding the determinants of countries’ current accounts. Although such crises and phenomena have renewed both academic and policy interest in current account theory, much of the empirical focus has been on the country level, with a limited assessment of economic blocs. The relevance for economic blocs, such as the European Union (EU), should not be underestimated, since there are potential knock-on effects that capital flights will have on member states due to their high levels of economic integration.====Several theories including the intertemporal approach to the current account, initially proposed by Sachs (1981) and extended by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, 1996), and the Feldstein and Horioka model from the 1980s, have been utilized extensively in the extant literature, albeit typically for country-level analyses. The real economy implications of current account levels and imbalances have been highlighted in both OECD and developing country studies (see, for example, Arestis and Gonzalez‐Martinez, 2016; Isgut, 2001). Although huge current account deficits are not necessarily detrimental if the capital is used for productive investments, there is wide agreement that the longer such deficits remain, the worse off future generations are likely to be as they are likely to be burdened with excessive debts and interest payments, particularly when unproductive investments have been made. On the other hand, countries with consistent current account surpluses may face upward pressure on their currencies and may need to take some bold steps to control such demand-driven currency appreciations and maintain their export competitiveness, e.g. Japan. Against this background, a critical assessment of current account evolution, determinants and drivers is crucial for policy for both macro- and microeconomic stability. While the current account, similar to the tip of an iceberg, is observable, credible policy formulation hinges on a better understanding of its relationship with the underlying determinants. It is this area to which this study aims to contribute.====The EU, being an economic and political union of countries and operating an internal (or single) market that allows free movement of goods, capital, services and people between member states, lends itself well to analysing an economic bloc. The integration features enshrined within the EU, particularly the common currency for the nineteen euro members, and the trade and political ties among the countries present an appropriate case to analyse the determinants of the current account within such an economic bloc. This study focuses on the EU28 group of countries on the premise that the current account helps to accommodate adjustments to various shocks and provides a crucial link between the EU countries and other economies. Further, the mechanics of TARGET2, a real-time gross settlement system operated by the Eurosystem, implies that central and commercial banks can submit payment orders to TARGET2 for processing and settlement in central bank money. The system aims to prevent a sudden stop for euro area countries as foreign private debt is substituted by foreign public debt in the event of a crisis. In addition, analyses of the evolution and determinants of the current account are a key issue in the EU political economy agenda, due to the potentially negative effect of uncontrolled current accounts on future generations, and on the credibility of member states risking failure to repay accumulated external debt.==== Of the aforementioned features, the relevant one our study focuses on is the free flow of capital, which in turn affects each country’s current account. In this investigation, we employ several empirical methodologies, namely the dynamic OLS (DOLS) approach, the Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model and quantile regressions, to estimate a panel data model for the current account. More specifically, we estimate long-run equations by means of DOLS in a panel framework, where the current account (hereafter ====) is determined by the real exchange rate (====), ====, ====, ==== as the sum of exports and imports over GDP, ==== and ====. Further, in order to investigate possible nonlinearities, we also account for structural breaks and investigate asymmetric effects for periods following currency appreciations and depreciations. Furthermore, as a robustness check, we also estimate Bayesian panel vector autoregressive models (BVARs). These are complemented by generalised impulse response functions (IRFs) (Pesaran and Shin, 1998). For completeness and to determine whether differences exist between groupings within the EU28 group, we also consider the EU15 + 2 group and the CEEC groups. The joint evidence from these estimators supports the view that considering structural breaks and possible nonlinear behaviours is important in empirical analyses. A main finding of the study, however, is that while an assessment of the current account for the entire economic bloc is important, the relationships for subgroups within the bloc may differ.","Panel cointegration, quantile regressions, asymmetric adjustments and crises: The case of EU current accounts",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000182,7 October 2021,2021,Research Article,63.0

Specifically, we investigate the effects of four aspects (employment, health, education, rights) of gender equality with 20 variables in an economic complexity index. To deal with potential endogeneity, we used the two-step system–generalized method of moments approach with an unbalanced panel of data on 119 economies from 1991 to 2017. First, labor participation in ==== or service sectors as well as wage and salaried employment by women appears to improve economic complexity, while women’s employment in agriculture, contributions to family workers, self-employment, and vulnerable employment have a negative impact. Second, better health conditions for women increase economic complexity. Third, gender equality in education has a positive impact on economic complexity. Fourth, the empowerment of women in terms of socioeconomic-political rights is a positive factor for economic complexity. Overall, gender equality has great benefits for economic complexity.","The social issue of gender inequality has been extensively studied in various disciplines (Minasyan et al., 2019). However, gender inequality has recently become of greater concern because of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has likely reversed the previous limited achievements in combating the issue (Kristal and Yaish, 2020). In the economics literature, the economic outcome of gender inequality/equality has become a mainstream topic in recent decades, especially the effects of gender equality on economic growth, which has been studied by many well-known economists (for a critical review, see Cuberes and Teignier, 2014).====Several previous studies show the positive impact of female educational attainment on economic growth (see, e.g., Barro, 2001; Dollar and Gatti, 1999; Schultz, 2002). In contrast, Seguino (2000b) considers whether women’s relatively lower wages (as a result of gender inequality) can be a stimulus for exporting and thereby for economic growth. Despite the large number of recent empirical works (see, e.g., Bertay et al., 2020; Schober and Winter-Ebmer, 2011; Seguino, 2011), no consensus has formed about the economic outcomes of gender inequality/equality, especially the effect on economic development (for a recent review, see Minasyan et al., 2019).====This study discusses the economic outcomes of gender equality from a new perspective—specifically, the economic effects of gender equality on economic complexity, represented by the economic complexity index (ECI).==== Several recent studies (Dam and Frenken, 2020; Mealy and Teytelboym, 2020; Mishra et al., 2020; Pereima, 2020) have emphasized the importance of economic complexity in economic development and other socioenvironmental issues. For instance, Zhu and Li (2017) indicate that economic complexity has positive impacts on economic growth in both the short and long run.====The extensive literature on feminist economics agrees that gender equality is very important for economic growth (Braunstein et al., 2019; Cuberes and Teignier, 2014; Minasyan et al., 2019; Seguino, 2011). In particular, improvements in gender equality are found to improve human capital through different channels, such as the abilities of the workforce, the pool of talent in production, reduced fertility levels, reduced child mortality levels, and improvements in social reproduction (Braunstein et al., 2019; Klasen, 2002; Klasen and Lamanna, 2009; Knowles et al., 2002; Seguino, 2011). At the same time, improvement in human capital is an important driver of economic complexity (Lee and Vu, 2019; Zhu and Li, 2017).====Vu (2021) shows that the social inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people fosters human capital accumulation and thereby strengthens national innovative capacity. The importance of economic complexity to socioeconomic development is highlighted in the study by Hidalgo (2021). Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of gender equality on economic complexity in order to clarify not only the determinants of economic complexity but also how gender equality affects economic growth through the channel of economic complexity.====This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, this is likely the first attempt to consider the influence of gender equality on economic development through the channel of economic complexity or economic sophistication. More importantly, this study contributes by linking two important lines of literature: gender equality and economic complexity. In particular, gender equality has mixed effects on economic growth (Minasyan et al., 2019), but improvements in gender equality are found to enhance human capital (Vu, 2021). Meanwhile, human capital is important for economic complexity (Lee and Vu, 2019), and economic complexity is arguably a driver of economic growth (Zhu and Li, 2017). Thus, this paper builds on Vu (2021) and Hidalgo (2021) to examine the links between gender equality and economic development through the influences on economic complexity.====Second, most previous studies and the literature on the economic outcomes of gender equality focus on a single aspect of gender equality, such as education (i.e., the school attainment of girls; see Minasyan et al., 2019) or employment (i.e., the gender wage gap; see Kennedy et al., 2017). Less attention has been devoted to other dimensions of gender equality, such as health issues or socioeconomic and political rights, although they have gained prominence in modern society, especially the role of sustainable development (King et al., 2020). This study thus contributes to the literature by carrying out an inclusive and comprehensive analysis of the economic outcomes of gender equality. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the economic outcomes of multidimensional gender equality and thus have significant policy implications.====Third, the literature on economic complexity has evolved in recent decades, whereas the determinants of economic complexity are still underexplored (Hidalgo, 2021). Some important determinants of economic complexity have been documented, including the economic development level, population density, capital formation, financial development, and economic integration (Nguyen et al., 2020); however, no comprehensive study exists on the effects of gender equality.====Empirically, the study uses as the dependent variable the ECI introduced through the great efforts of recent economists (see, e.g., Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009; Hidalgo et al., 2007). To portray gender equality, we divide it into four dimensions, comprising 20 variables: employment (11 variables), health (3 variables), education (3 variables), and socioeconomic and political rights (3 variables). The empirical analysis is carried out with a sample of 119 economies from 1991 to 2017, based on data availability (in particular, data on gender equality and the ECI). To maximize the number of economies in the analysis, we construct an unbalanced panel consisting of the final sample data. Like Lapatinas (2019) and Nguyen et al. (2020), we obtain dynamic panel data estimations and then add gender equality as an additional driver of economic complexity. To deal with possible endogeneity in the main estimation, we use the two-step system–generalized method of moments (GMM) by Blundell and Bond (1998).====The empirical results are interesting. First, an increase in female labor force participation in industry or the service sector and in wage and salaried employment appears to raise economic complexity, but increased employment of women in agriculture, contributions to family employment, self-employment, and vulnerable employment of women has a negative impact. These findings imply that gender equality in employment enhances economic complexity. The previous literature indicates that the positive impact of gender equality in employment on economic complexity implies a positive impact of gender equality on economic growth (see, e.g., Bertay et al., 2020).====Second, the empirical results show that gender equality in education (higher ratio of female school enrollment at both the primary and tertiary levels) has a positive impact on economic complexity, whereas school enrollment of females at the secondary level has a negative impact. In general, gender equality in education can have positive effects on economic complexity.====Lastly, the empirical results show that the positive impact of gender equality in both health and socioeconomic and political rights has positive effects on economic complexity. These findings all highlight the importance of empowering women, so that they can then improve the complexity of the economic production system. In summary, our results imply that gender equality can help in expanding economic complexity.====The study is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of economic complexity and gender equality and then constructs the hypothesis. The methodology, data, and econometric estimates are discussed in Section 3.

We use Heckman’s two-step approach to predict earnings for the non-participating women and then use these predictions to estimate the participation equation. We find that women’s ==== is not influenced by their earnings. We also show that there exists a significant gap in employment propensities among ethnic Kyrgyz women in consensual or arranged marriages compared to women in kidnapped-based marriages. This finding suggests that the practice of bride abduction adversely affects women’s probability of employment and might have negative consequences on their economic well-being.","Women’s labour supply elasticities, both at the extensive (employment status) and intensive (hours worked) margins, have been the subject of several empirical studies and therefore are well-researched (e.g. Blundell et al., 2011). However, these efforts were mainly directed at analysing elasticities in higher-income countries where data is available and there have been limited attempts at evaluating women’s labour supply responses in the poorest states of the Central Asia region where data has just recently becoming available.====The greater participation of women in labour markets has a broader importance for economic development, as it is closely related to women’s empowerment and the benefits that women in employment bring to themselves and their families. In this respect, Kyrgyzstan makes an interesting case, since it is a country where marriage involving bride kidnapping is a widespread practice that still persists (Becker et al., 2017). This marriage custom may have a bearing on Kyrgyz women, in terms of their employment participation, and therefore, we wish to examine their participation elasticities in detail, using a Heckman correction procedure.====We rely on exclusion restrictions to achieve identification, including a variable – namely forced marriage through bride kidnapping – which we believe captures those women who come from more traditional families and in general may be more restricted in joining the labour force. Furthermore, we conduct a decomposition analysis which helps to explain the differences in participation propensities between Kyrgyz women in love or arranged marriages and women who were abducted for marriage. We hope to contribute to the understanding of individual and economic factors that shape the decision of women to enter employment in the poorer Central Asian economies. We wish to note, however, that there are wide inter-country variations in the magnitude of participation elasticities and there exists some debate over the size of elasticity used in the setting of economic policy (Bargain and Peichl, 2016).====The basic insight that we believe emerges from our research, is that the labour supply decision at the extensive margin does not depend on women’s labour income, and that marriage practices come into play in this decision. For this reason, we argue that policy efforts aimed at increasing labour force participation (LFP) of ethnic Kyrgyz women need to focus especially on those women whose circumstances are not accommodating towards participation in the labour market.

It must be noted, however, that most empirical efforts have focussed on the income inequality–growth nexus, while studies on wealth inequality are much scarcer. This study attempts to fill such a gap in the literature by assessing the correspondence between the top 1 percent's wealth share and economic growth. Employing time series cointegration techniques, we study the experience of France and the United States from 1950 to 2014. Our estimates suggest that the output growth rate is an inverted-U-shaped function of the wealth share of the top 1 percent. The estimated relationship is robust to variations in control variables and estimation methods. We compute the local ====, understood as the share of wealth compatible with the maximum growth rate, and show that France is growing close to its long-run potential, while the United States is significantly below its.","Since ancient times, societies have been concerned about the effects of inequality on peace and prosperity. Socrates, for example, in his dialogue with Adeimantus, as reproduced in ====, demonstrates awareness of the pervasive consequences of indiscriminate wealth in deteriorating peace and order. Aristotle, in ====, also presents inequity as a source of conflict and anger. From Adam Smith to Karl Marx, there has been a long-standing interest in the relationship between income–wealth distribution and sustainable growth, and this continues to fascinate economists among other social scientists.====It must be noted, however, that most empirical efforts have focussed on the correspondence between ==== inequality and growth, while studies on ==== inequality are relatively scarce. This is rather surprising given the evidence showing that global wealth-holding is far more concentrated than income (Davies et al., 2011), and that most theoretical contributions highlight the importance of both dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, Bagchi and Svejnar (2015) and Islam and McGillivray (2020) are the only two existing references to directly assess this issue. The first relies on a ==== for wealth distribution from Forbes list of billionaires. The second utilises recent data published by Credit Suisse for a sample of 45 countries between 2000 and 2012. This study aims at advancing this issue by investigating the long-term correspondence between the wealth share allocated to the top 1% and output growth in France and the United States (US).====For three decades, the debate vis-à-vis rising inequality in the United States and Europe has centred on the wage premium for certain types of labour. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing realisation that most of the action is at the very top of the distribution (e.g., Alvaredo et al., 2013, Alvaredo et al., 2018). The development of the ==== has facilitated the analysis and international comparison of the evolution of top income and wealth shares. The top 1 percent wealth share–growth relationship is not just a ==== for the inequality–growth nexus; rather it is an interesting tax policy issue in its own right. Piketty and Zucman (2015) and Alvaredo et al. (2017) have shown that the share of inherited wealth in several developed countries is back to 50–60% of the total wealth, with potentially important political and economic implications.====In 2018, the average net personal wealth of the so-called top 1 percent was 5.8 million US dollars (US$) in France and approximately US$ 12 million in the US, while its average pre-tax income was US$ 500 thousand in the former country and US$ 1.4 million in the latter. While it is certainly not a homogeneous group, such elites arguably wield a significant amount of power and have a particular set of skills that may justify their social position. This means that a very small or else a very large wealth share might be detrimental to economic performance. On the one hand, the former aforementioned case could indicate insufficient skill premia, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the other hand, high wealth concentration might weaken the social consensus required to sustain growth, thereby inducing the consolidation of equally inefficient institutional arrangements in both public and private sectors.====From the interaction of these two forces, the Kuznets curve of the Rich arises as an inverted-U relationship between the output growth rate and the wealth share of those at the very top of the distribution. The original Kuznets (1955) curve was widely used to describe the association of growth and inequality over the second half of the 20th century, though it fell out of favour in recent decades (see Milanovic, 2016). This paper provides an empirical contribution to the literature by applying time series cointegration techniques to study the experiences of France and the US between 1950 and 2014. The choice of working with these two economies is twofold motivated: first, they virtually represent two different institutional arrangements in developed countries, i.e., the Anglo-Saxon and continental Europe. While recognising that there is still significant heterogeneity in the Global North (e.g. Ranaldi and Milanovic, 2021), our understanding is that their differentiation may in any case provide some important insights. Furthermore, data are available for a sufficiently long period, thereby enabling the performance of time series analysis.====Our estimates suggest that the output growth rate follows an inverted-U-shaped function of the wealth share of the so-called top 1 percent. The obtained relationship is robust to variations in control variables and estimation methods, having some similarities with Banerjee and Duflo's (2003) results. The inverted-U is also robust to narrowing the analysis to the top 0.01 percent, though it is no longer statistically significant for France. It is possible for us to compute a local ====, which is defined as the share of wealth controlled by the top 1 percent and is compatible with the maximum growth rate. Any divergence from this level, in whatever direction, is associated with a reduction in long-run growth. We show that France is growing closer to its long-run potential, while the US is 1–2% below its.====As indicated by Piketty (2020), once we accept that private property will continue to play a role in society, it becomes essential to develop institutional arrangements capable of preventing the unlimited concentration of ownership which does not serve the general interest. The extreme concentration of wealth observed in European societies up to the early twentieth century did not serve to its general interest. Conversely, signs of excessive wealth concentration exacerbated social and nationalist tensions, thereby blocking educational and social investments that facilitated the development of the post-war model. At least, regarding the US, we show that the over-concentration of wealth in top percentiles of the population is damaging growth.====The remaining of the paper is organised as follows: in the next section, we briefly provide an overview of the literature on growth and distribution. Section 3 describes the main trends regarding the evolution of top wealth shares in France and the US, showing how wealth inequality is arguably more important than income inequality. Section 4 presents our empirical exercise towards identifying the inverted-U relationship. In section 5, we explore the robustness of our findings to alternative specifications and estimators.

Water ecological civilisation is a significant component and a solid guarantee of ecological progress, especially today when urbanisation is accelerating and urban populations continue to grow. Therefore, water ecological civilisation city construction is growing in prominence. However, the world’s water ecological environment is under pressure because of overly polluted water, which may have resulted from population growth, food production, economic development and urbanisation (Strokal and Kroeze, 2020). It is worth noting that water pollution has become a major global concern, especially in developing countries where approximately 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water at home and more than twice as many lack access to safe sanitation.==== Although the overall environmental quality of Chinese surface water has improved in recent years (in 2019, the proportion of Class I-III water was 74.9 %, and that of Class V water (polluted water) was 3.4 %), the problems of uncoordinated control of water pollution remain prominent. Furthermore, the water environmental conditions existing in some areas, such as Yingkou, Tongchuan and Baicheng, remain severe.====Against this background, many countries established a series of policies and regulations to tackle water pollution problems. In this regard, the United Nations (UN) developed sustainable development goals (SDGs) to improve the quality of the global environment. These are a novel, universal set of goals, targets and indicators that UN member states are expected to use when framing their agendas and political policies over the next 15 years. Furthermore, the Chinese government established a series of regulations to improve the water ecological environment, and the Water Ecological Civilisation City Pilot (WECCP) is one of the most representative water management policies. In 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources issued ====, indicating that the WECCP policy had been officially implemented. At its core, the WECCP policy implemented the strictest water resource management system and adhered to the ideas of ‘water-saving priority, spatial balance, system management and two hands efforts’ (Chinese Ministry of Water Resources, 2013). Its primary objectives include optimising water resource allocation, strengthening the conservation and protection of water resources and implementing comprehensive water ecological management (Chen, 2014). From 2012–2014, the Ministry of Water Resources successfully established 105 water ecological civilisation pilot cities (Chinese Ministry of Water Resources, 2018). By May 2019, 99 pilot cities had completed the construction tasks and passed the acceptance inspection (Chinese Ministry of Water Resources, 2019). The water resource utilisation rate, water quality compliance rate and water treatment technology have been dramatically improved, indicating that the WECCP policy has achieved remarkable progress (Deng et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2021). In recent years, as the world’s largest developing country, China has made greater contributions to the international construction of ecological civilisation and green development by making trade and investment agreements compatible with ecological civilisation principles, goals and practices (Hanson., 2019). Consequently, the WECCP policy is an innovative environmental policy tool for ecological civilisation construction, which may have practical significance for China and other developing countries to improve urban environmental quality and green innovation capacity.====Although researchers have engaged in extensive theoretical discussion and empirical research on the pollution reduction and green innovation effects of environmental regulation, most have not clarified whether environmental regulation affects urban pollution and emissions reduction through improving urban green capability. More importantly, the pilot project of water ecological civilization city is an innovative environmental policy proposed by the Chinese government. Research on the WECCP policy is still in the initial stage and focuses primarily on the fundamental concept, legal basis, implementation strategy and evaluation system (Li et al., 2014; Liu and Wang, 2018; Tian et al., 2021). However, current studies lack theoretical analysis on the pollution reduction and green innovation effects of this policy. Most current studies used the comprehensive evaluation analysis method to evaluate the policy effect of a specific water ecological civilisation pilot city or cities in the urban agglomerations from the perspective of water ecological performance (Ren et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2021). More importantly, few studies have evaluated the policy effect of all the pilot cities and compared the differences in the pollution reduction and green innovation effects between pilot and non-pilot cities. Therefore, it is of both academic value and practical significance to explore and identify the impact of the WECCP policy on urban pollution reduction and green innovation capability.====Given this, this paper treats the WECCP policy as a quasi-natural experiment, and utilises a pollution emission index and green patent data for 283 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2018 to examine the impact of WECCP policy on urban pollution reduction and green innovation by using the difference-in-differences (DID) model and a series of robustness tests. This paper’s contributions are listed as follows. First, in theory, this paper analyses the logical process regarding the impact of WECCP policy on urban pollution emissions and green innovation ability, and clarifies whether the WECCP policy promotes regional pollution reduction by strengthening urban green innovation capacity. Second, regarding empirical methods, this paper applies the DID model to comprehensively evaluate the pollution reduction effect of the WECCP policy based on the data of the urban water quality, air pollution and composite pollution indexes. Also, green patent data is collected for all enterprises, universities and research institutions located in the same city to measure urban green innovation capacity so that we can conduct an empirical study on the green innovation effect of WECCP policy. Based on this, the mediating effect model is used to verify that the WECCP policy may achieve pollution reduction by improving urban green innovation ability. Third, many developing countries also face severe water pollution problems. Therefore, the research can provide a theoretical reference and empirical support for the Chinese government and other developing countries to perfect environmental governance systems, accelerate the construction of ecological civilisations and achieve sustainable growth.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 illustrates the relevant literature. Section 3 introduces the background of WECCP policy and proposes our hypotheses. Section 4 describes the sample selection and methodology used in this study, and Section 5 presents and analyses the empirical results of this research. Section 6 concludes and provides some useful policy implications.","Environmental regulation, pollution reduction and green innovation: The case of the Chinese Water Ecological Civilization City Pilot policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000595,14 August 2021,2021,Research Article,67.0

Fixed effects, instrumental variable and dynamic panel regressions address endogeneity in trade growth, subject to traditional economic channels such as domestic investment, population growth, exchange rate, government size, and institutions. We find statistically significant thresholds and stronger trade-growth links during the 2000s commodity boom and in larger economies.","The relationship between trade and economic growth has been the subject of extensive investigation in the development literature. In the 1970s, the discussion was centered on strategies concerning either import-substituting industrialization or export expansion, especially of manufactured goods (Emery, 1967; Voivodas, 1973; Williamson, 1978). Neoclassical economists later reached a consensus on the theory of export-led growth as “new conventional wisdom” (Tyler, 1981). From the 1980s to the 1990s, the overall evidence supports exports leading to higher levels of output growth, as documented by an extensive literature that includes Krueger (1980); Feder (1983, 1986), Kavoussi (1984); Balassa (1985); Ram (1985, 1987), Singer and Gray (1988); Mbaku (1989); Fosu (1990, 1996), Otani and Villanueva (1990), Alam (1991); Dodaro (1991); Salvatore and Hatcher (1991); De Gregorio (1992); Sheehey (1992); Sprout and Weaver (1993); Coppin (1994); Amirkhalkhali and Dar (1995); Yaghmaian and Ghorashi (1995), and McNab and Moore (1998).====Helpman and Krugman (1985) argue that export growth accelerates economic development by means of economies of scale, specialization in production and diffusion of technical knowledge. Similarly, Bhagwati (1988) shows that exports promote economic growth, which promotes skill formation and technological progress, creating a comparative advantage for a country. In the 2000s, research started considering trade openness measured as the sum of exports and imports over GDP as a key driver of economic growth. Rodrik et al. (2004) note that, together with institutions and geography, international trade is a crucial determinant of economic development and part of one of the three main lines of thought in the large literature on the wealth of nations. Hausmann et al. (2007) argue that “what you export matters” and build an index of the income level of a country’s exports that predicts subsequent economic growth.====However, the literature has not yet addressed the question whether there is any evidence of threshold effects of terms-of-trade volatility on the relationship between trade openness and economic growth. This is important because Rodrik (1998, p. 1014) proposes that terms-of-trade volatility “not only would be the theoretically appropriate measure of external risk but would be the only relevant measure of such risk”. This proposition has been recently examined for the behavior of government expenditures to GDP ratios in Latin American economies by Vianna and Mollick (2018a). Along the same lines, Caporale and Girardi (2016) find evidence for Latin America that the trade channel appears to be the most important source of business cycle co-movements, while capital flows are found to have a limited role, especially in the very short run. Latin America has been subject to extreme commodity price fluctuations in recent years, including the post-2003 years normally referred to as the “commodity boom period” by Radetzki (2006) and Humphreys (2019), which makes the research question linking terms-of-trade volatility to economic growth once again worth exploring.====In this paper we attempt to fill the gap in the literature between economic growth and terms of trade for 14 Latin American countries at an annual frequency from 1997 to 2014. We employ the threshold estimation technique by Law et al. (2013), who run regressions of economic growth on financial development and controls using a bootstrap threshold test from Hansen (2000) and find that the impact of finance on growth is positive and significant only after a certain threshold level of institutional development has been attained. Our approach uses economic growth as a function of standard economic factors and can be contrasted to works on business cycles with very different results on the role of commodity prices in economic growth, such as Zeev et al. (2017) on a sample of Latin American countries in support of the hypothesis that terms-of-trade shocks are an important source of cyclical fluctuations. See also Fernández et al. (2018) and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2018) for studies of emerging markets with business cycle perspectives.====The 2000s commodity boom is different from previous booms because it combines a strong macroeconomic expansion in the period with the widespread use of commodities in emerging markets. Baffes and Haniotis (2010, p. 3) describe it as “the longest-lasting and the broadest in the numbers of commodities involved. It was the only one that simultaneously involved all three main commodity groups — energy, metals, and agriculture (…) It was not associated with high inflation, unlike the boom of the 1970s (…) it unfolded simultaneously with the development of two other booms — in real estate and in equity markets — whose end led most developed countries to their most severe post-WWII recession.”====We examine the trade-growth nexus using more recent time spans and country size effects, while controlling for the international financial crisis of 2008–2009. Since the literature on the export-led growth hypothesis shows evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship between its variables of interest, we also control for a potential reverse causation from economic growth to international trade.==== Our main findings are that the regime with above-threshold volatility displays stronger coefficients (5.98 or 4.34 for trade flows over GDP and exports over GDP, respectively, both significant at the 1% level) than the regime with below-threshold volatility (both measures with coefficients equal to 3.50 but not statistically significant). Results also support a higher positive impact of international trade on economic growth during the commodity boom when controlling for the financial crisis and size effects of large versus small economies of the region.====The implications of this paper vary from the global economy perspective to the level of concentration of exports at the country level. First, Latin America is one of the most commodity-dependent regions within the emerging market world. According to Harrup (2016), the region’s exposure to commodities is unique in the world, even greater than middle-income African countries. Rosnick and Weisbrot (2014) explain that the rebound in Latin American economic growth in the 2000s is often attributed to the commodity boom. Indeed, right before the global financial crisis, the global economy rose by more than 4% each year in the period 2003–2007, the highest economic growth year-by-year sequence since the early 1970s (International Monetary Fund., 2016). On the path to economic recovery, the 2010s have experienced intense trade agreement negotiations in several countries, not only in the Asia-Pacific region (Euromonitor Research., 2018) but also in the U.S. and Europe (Jackson, 2018).==== When we focus exclusively on the commodity boom period and add a crisis dummy (negative and statistically significant) to our estimations, the results support an even larger impact of international trade on growth with a coefficient of 12.20, compared to 7.32 for the full sample from 1997 to 2014.====Second, controlling for standard growth determinants, we show that the impact of international trade (measured by either volume of trade/GDP or exports/GDP) for regimes of above-threshold terms-of-trade volatility imply stronger economic growth. In this paper, terms-of-trade volatility corresponds to deviations from the mean of the index calculated as the price of exports divided by the price of imports. Economic growth is higher – for the panel of countries – when this measure is larger than a terms-of-trade volatility threshold; and lower otherwise. We argue that this result is due to the high share of natural resources in Latin American exports. In fact, recent research sheds light on some of these effects. Lectard and Rougier (2018), for example, find that defying comparative advantages helps diversify the export baskets of middle-income and resource-based economies while concentrating those of lower-income economies. Bahar and Santos (2018) introduce a theoretical framework showing how wage pressures caused by a resource windfall result in higher export concentration. When estimating export concentration indices on the share of natural resources in exports, Bahar and Santos (2018) find positive effects for non-OECD countries, which are more likely to be subject to Dutch Disease than OECD countries in which no effects are found. Articles on emerging markets using external trade include Dufrenot et al. (2010), who apply quantile regressions for a panel of 75 developing countries and show that the heterogeneous effect of international trade on growth is higher in countries with low growth rates. Lin and Ye (2018) quantify the effects of the international credit channel of U.S. monetary policy transmission to developing countries using trade data. Vianna and Mollick (2018b) perform system GMM dynamic panel regressions for 192 countries and find that international trade and institutions are the most important determinants of Latin American economic development.====The rest of paper proceeds as follows.

Surveys covering the period 2006–2016 are examined via a mix of time and cross-sectional methods. In doing so, we uncover clear behavioural biases in how respondents view the inflation outlook. Education and income tend to be inversely related to inflation expectations. This is consistent with the literature, although we observe significant changes over time that many other surveys are unable to uncover. Inflation expectations also respond to recently observed inflation, but this is likely facilitated by priming in the survey since respondents are given the previous year and five years mean inflation rates. Younger individuals have lower inflation expectations and react significantly to central bank communication, which is a novel variable not included in other studies of this kind. Another demographic characteristic interacting with communication by the South African Reserve Bank is race. Finally, the direction of change in inflation, that is, whether it is rising or falling, also matters. Hence, even if respondents are primed, they appear to be aware of changes in the direction of inflation. This represents an additional novel feature of the study.","Almost ten years after the Great Recession of 2008-09, former Fed chair Yellen (2016) expressed the view that policymakers still do not properly understand what drives inflation expectations. Other central bankers have also taken a similar stand. The role of the expectations channel in the monetary transmission mechanism, well established even before the financial crisis of 2007/2009, was further elevated in the aftermath of that event. In several economies, including many emerging market economies (EME), communicating the stance of monetary policy is supported by an explicit inflation target that aims to anchor inflation expectations. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) is one such monetary authority that has been at the vanguard among EME by adopting inflation targeting (IT) in 2000. However, for at least a part of the inflation targeting period in South Africa, there has been less adherence to targeting the mid-point of the target band that is the hallmark of the IT strategy in several advanced economies where this approach was pioneered (e.g., see Taylor, 2014, and references therein).====Inflation expectations provide insights into the future unfolding of macroeconomic conditions. Given that monetary policy has long been thought to be forward looking (e.g., Friedman, 1968; Woodford, 2003), it is reasonable for policymakers to devote considerable attention to inflation forecasts. All the more reason then for many central banks to more closely monitor broad developments in inflation expectations.====Generally, macroeconomic models treat inflation expectations as though they are adequately captured by a single point estimate. However, the recent literature makes a convincing case, both empirically and theoretically, that disagreement among individuals’ inflation outlooks are linked to macroeconomic conditions more generally (e.g., see Siklos, 2013; Brito et al., 2018). Ignoring the heterogeneity of expectations is tantamount to omitting a potential role for critical determinants of expectations whose origins may, as we shall see below, lie in the socio-economic sphere. As a growing body of empirical and theoretical research is making clear, the root causes of forecast disagreement remain unclear (e.g., see Siklos, 2019, and references therein). Nevertheless, there are growing indications that various behavioural biases, which themselves may originate from indicators of socio-economic status, represent significant determinants of macroeconomic expectations. Perhaps more importantly, studies of inflation expectations have tended to rely on the forecasts of professionals not only because they are more readily available but because the data could easily be incorporated into time series models. However, the extent to which macroeconomic outcomes are driven by such forecasts, as opposed to the inflation expectations of the general public, is unclear.====Inflation expectations are proxied in one of at least three ways. First, expectations of financial market participants can be estimated from asset price developments.==== Second, models employed by central banks, government agencies, and others also provide some information about disagreement in the economic outlook or about the future as a function of model specification or the judgment of central bankers.==== Finally, another approach to measuring inflation expectations consists of data from surveys of households and firms.====Some surveys consist of expectations of professional forecasters (e.g., Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) in the U.S. and the Eurozone, Consensus Economics forecasts globally); others are surveys at the individual, household or firm levels. The latter type is the focus of the present study. These data are often less accessible in part because they can be limited in their frequency, coverage, and availability, among other considerations to be outlined below. There are, of course, exceptions, such as the U.S. Michigan Survey.====Critically, these data enable researchers to measure the expectations of groups in society other than financial market participants. Individuals in the latter group are likely to be better informed about finance and are a sub-set of the group with the highest levels of education and income. In contrast, household level surveys permit researchers to obtain some idea of individual expectations as opposed to those determined by markets as a whole. However, survey data have the disadvantage that they are conducted infrequently and the results can be highly sensitive to the manner in which expectations information is obtained.====In any case, it is precisely from the data in such surveys that disagreement is likely to be rife and, as a consequence, to potentially have macroeconomic consequences. Central banks are also keenly aware that such surveys may contain important information about whether the central bank is credible and trustworthy, as well as the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored. The anchoring of inflation expectations is of particular interest when there is an explicit inflation target.====Blinder et al. (2008) called on researchers to investigate more deeply the inflation expectations of the non-financial market segments of the general public because they give central banks ‘the democratic legitimacy, and hence their independence’ (Blinder et al., 2008, p.58). More recent research adds that differences that exist between the inflation expectations of households and financial market participants have economic implications that are non-negligible (Das et al., 2020; Malmendier and Nagel, forthcoming; Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015). Many central banks concede that communication needs to be tailored specifically to this non-specialist audience (e.g., Binder, 2018; Haldane, 2017). Indeed, an early lesson from the nascent literature relying on microeconomic survey data is that socio-economic status, largely captured through education and income, is a critical ingredient in explaining the evolution of expectations over time, and macroeconomic conditions more generally. Moreover, socio-economic status is also likely to be correlated with various cognitive biases (e.g., optimism, pessimism, age cohort specific views about the stance of policies). While our study provides estimates of the connection between socio-economic status and inflation expectations, we cannot identify the type of cognitive biases that might explain the results.====In this paper, we examine survey data of the inflation expectations of South African households, as collected by AC Nielsen on behalf of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the Bureau for Economic Research (BER). Unlike some recent contributions (e.g., Kumar et al., 2015; and Coibion et al., 2018) that draw strong conclusions about the behaviour of inflation expectations based on surveys taken at one or a couple of points in time, our data cover a ten year period that contains expectations data from over 12000 different individuals in South Africa chosen on the basis of a carefully constructed cross-section of the population. As will be explained below, the survey is unique not only because it offers households’ views about the short-run prospects for inflation but also because a considerable amount of socio-economic information is collected alongside data about inflation expectations.====Our study is also novel for at least two other reasons. First, and consistent with the view that inflation-targeting central banks place a premium on transparency and communication, we include a variable derived from the statements published after each SARB Monetary Policy meeting. The communication proxy is derived from an algorithm used to detect whether the SARB is pessimistic about inflation. Second, we also include a variable that captures periods of rising versus falling inflation at the time surveys are conducted. In this manner we are able to determine whether households are attentive or not to such changes and conclude that they do respond to changes in the direction of inflation.====From a policy perspective, the results suggesting the economic relevance of studying the inflation expectations of households separately raise a number of questions about the household survey. These include: (1) Do inflation expectations within South African households differ markedly across demographic groups? (2) Are inflation expectations of some groups better anchored than others? and, (3) Why do they differ? Moreover, to provide some perspective on the experience of an emerging market, where the central bank is accountable for controlling inflation in an explicit numerical target range, we also provide some comparisons with the Michigan Survey conducted in the U.S.====Briefly, we find that expectations are determined by the available socio-economic strata. In particular, as several other cross-country studies have reported, female respondents tend to believe one year ahead inflation will be higher than their male counterparts. Moreover, censoring the distribution of inflation expectations has an impact on our interpretation of the role of socio-economic determinants of the inflation outlook. In line with international research, education and income tend to be inversely related to inflation expectations. However, the relationship between these determinants and expectations undergoes considerable changes over time. Educated respondents are found to react significantly to pessimistic language communicated by the SARB. In essence, the extent to which inflation expectations may be anchored appears to differ across groups with different demographic characteristics, and to be sensitive according to whether inflation is rising or falling. Finally, based on quantile regressions, the strength and significance of the socio-economic determinants of inflation expectations change significantly depending on where the responses are located in the overall distribution of expectations.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the relevant research focusing on what is gained by examining surveys of household inflation expectations. A description of the data follows and some stylized facts are discussed before we present some econometric evidence about the socio-economic determinants of inflation expectations. The paper concludes with a summary as well as pointing out areas where additional research is needed.",What drives household inflation expectations in South Africa?

In this paper, we investigate the extent of fiscal fairness in Turkey during the period 2008–2012. We define fiscal fairness by the degree of association of transfers and local spending with the structural and socioeconomic indicators, as opposed to political-party associations. Our empirical analysis reveals that while local fiscal transfers during the investigated period were significantly correlated with the socioeconomic and structural indicators, political factors also played a significant role. Particularly, we find robust evidence that cities where the incumbent party-AKP (Justice and Development Party), who won significantly more votes in the general elections than the main opposition party-CHP (Republican People's Party), received significantly more transfers and fiscal spending than the rest. The evidence also suggests that the metropolitan municipalities held by CHP received significantly more ==== than the rest; though less robust than the former. This observation also holds for the metropolitan municipalities held by AKP. Additionally, we observe that cities with metropolitan municipalities that were governed by either the incumbent or the main opposition party, were less fiscally independent than the rest. We also note, however, that given the increasing opacity in data reporting, this study does not account for the large amounts of public funds that are allocated in tenders with special invitees, via public–private partnerships or in the form of social assistance, although they are also likely to constitute a major component of politically-biased fiscal transfers during the study period.","There is a growing emphasis on the role of public policy in achieving economic growth and stability, especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the consequent rise in structural unemployment and relative wealth inequality. The rising demand for efficient and equitable public goods delivery also draws attention to the role of fiscal decentralization as an important fiscal institutional mechanism.====Fiscal spending and revenue collection duties and responsibilities are shared between the central and local governments to varying degrees in every country. In the first generation of literature on fiscal decentralization, (pioneered by Buchanan (1950), Tiebout (1956) and Oates (1972)), it was argued that local governments, especially in heterogeneous societies are better positioned than the central government to observe and respond to local demands. Sub-national governments may face different expenditure needs and resource constraints in their jurisdictions, depending on the level of socioeconomic heterogeneity of a country. Since the local government's borrowing capacity is generally more limited than the central government's, central to local transfers are essential for effective public goods delivery. Vertical and horizontal imbalances exist in almost all countries, and fiscal responsibilities are only partially decentralized even in federalist countries.====The second-generation theory of fiscal decentralization underlined the potential effects of political biases in the allocation of fiscal transfers.==== This points at the need for transparent and fair fiscal transfer mechanisms to reap the welfare gains from fiscal decentralization. Ma (1999) provides a broad typology of central to local transfer mechanisms based on estimating local expenditure needs, local revenue collection capacity, or both. For a fiscal transfer design, both expenditure needs and revenue collection capacities of local administrations need to be taken into account.====Until 2008, the central to local administration transfers in Turkey were mainly decided according to the population criteria.==== Based on Law No. 5779, dated July 2008, a significant percentage of the central government transfers to special provincial governments and municipalities continued to be allocated according to the population criterion, the rest of the transfers were based on other criteria such as the development index. Appendix Table A2 provides details on the revenue sharing system in Turkey during the period of 2008–2012.====Our empirical analysis focuses on investigating the effects of local fiscal transfers and spending in Turkey on socioeconomic and structural indicators, on the one hand, and political factors, on the other. Given the limitations of municipal level data, we examine city-level fiscal information. Thus, rather than testing the validity of the detailed transfer rules at all sub-national levels, we aim to find whether transfers or the central spending in localities, which are referred to as provincial or city-level administrations in this study, were fully explained by the structural and socioeconomic variables, or whether political factors also played an additional role.====Gürakar (2018) indicated that politically-oriented income and resource transfers in Turkey were mainly channelized through municipalities, via public procurement and tenders, public–private partnerships, and monetary or in-kind donations to citizens. In numerous cases, the founders of the municipal companies were identified as high-level bureaucrats in the municipal administrations. Since 2005, tenders with “exceptional content” and ‘among certain tenderers’ started to occupy a sizable share in the total public tenders, both in number and some nominal amount. Close to 190 changes in the public tender law during the 2000s and the concentration of the ruling party-related firms or municipal companies winning the invited tenders were clear indications of politically targeted transfers. Large-scale road constructions and public housing projects were typical ways of transferring resources to such firms that were exclusively invited to public tenders.====Ilhan (2013) documented the extent of economic inefficiencies arising from the non-competitive position of municipal companies in municipal and municipality-related tenders and procurement, based on 86% of the tenders conducted in 2008 and 2009. Gürakar (2018) also reported a positive correlation between the AKP, the ruling party, votes in municipalities, and such clientelistic activities. However, a lack of transparency in sub-governmental level transfer data shadows such politically-motivated or clientelistic spending, which is the basis for the current study. This study's analysis aims to decipher the possible political biases in central to local administration transfers and in the local fiscal spending.====In this study, we investigate the fiscal redistribution fairness in Turkey by examining whether political variables have a significant effect on either the direct spending or the transfers of the central government across the cities. For this purpose, we compiled data that covers 81 cities over five years (from 2008 to 2012), for which we were able to construct a balanced panel data set on the local fiscal and socioeconomic indicators. Using this data set, we tested the null hypothesis that socioeconomic and structural variables, rather than political factors, explain local transfers. Unlike the transfer rules that were detailed in Law No. 5779, macroeconomic data and fiscal accounts were not available with the necessary details to conduct our analysis at the municipal level. As widely argued, many creative accounting mechanisms also obscure the implementation features of ==== transfer rules. Hence, for the purposes of robustness, we also constructed alternative measures of central transfers to local administrations. As a measure of local development, we compiled a set of 22 socioeconomic indicators, which included educational, social, and macroeconomic indicators for each city. Additionally, we constructed a set of political variables comprising the share of political party representations in each city, based on the results of the general and municipal elections. We also employed dummy variables to control for the political identity of metropolitan municipalities, cities with development priorities, and different geographical regions.====Using the panel data set described above, we estimated our empirical model using fixed or random effects, depending on the specification test results. The empirical findings indicate that controlling for the effects in cities with developmental priorities and regional effects, while socioeconomic variables had a significant explanatory power for local transfer flows and central government's local spending, political factors also played a significant role in the redistribution of public funds. More specifically, our empirical findings show that cities where the incumbent party (AKP) won significantly more votes in the general elections than the main opposition party (CHP, Republican People's Party) received significantly higher transfers and fiscal spending than the others. This finding is robust across the alternative variables used in the analysis. Moreover, cities with metropolitan municipalities governed by the main opposition party are shown to have received more than their fair share of fiscal spending than the rest.====Next, we constructed a ‘predicted level’ of transfers and government spending in each city based on the regression results, where we excluded the effects of the political indicators in the unrestricted model. We called these predictions as the ====, and compared them with the level of actual local transfers and government spending. We consider that the differences between the socioeconomically justified level and the realized level of local transfers can be partly explained by the significant effects of politically oriented transfers.====As an extension, we investigated the effects of both socioeconomic and political indicators on the level of government expenditures and local revenues and their fiscal independence. The latter is measured by the ratio of local revenues to local spending in each city.

According to our results, the puzzling findings of the recent literature suggesting that domestic and foreign investors act as distant cousins, leading to capital inflows and outflows to act as twins, tend to be supported for the long run. The short-run relations, however, often appear to be consistent with the conventional theory suggesting that the behaviors of residents and non-residents do not systematically diverge from each other. Consistent with flight to safety concerns, capital outflows from EME and capital inflows to AE tend to increase in the long run in response to worsening global financial conditions. We find that these results essentially hold for the main components of capital flows as well.","International capital ﬂows and global financial conditions are often found to be among the most important determinants of growth (Cardarelli et al., 2010; Kose et al., 2012; Igan et al., 2016) and business cycles (Erdem and Özmen, 2015) in emerging markets (EME) and advanced (AE) economies. Recent studies often find that monetary policies of financially integrated EME and AE crucially depend on changes in global financial conditions and interest rates even under flexible exchange rate regimes (Rey, 2015). Consequently, understanding the basic determinants of capital ﬂows has always been a topic of research in open economy macroeconomics.====There is a wide and growing literature on the determinants of capital flows (see, e.g., Montiel, 2014; Avdjiev et al., 2017; Koepke, 2019). Gross capital flows, compared to net capital flows, are often found to be much larger and more volatile and thus crucially important for growth and financial stability (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille, 2011; Broner et al., 2013; Davis and van Wincoop, 2018). The recent literature suggests a potentially puzzling result that gross capital inflows (net purchases of domestic assets by foreign residents) and outflows (net purchases of foreign assets by domestic residents) tend to move together (Broner et al., 2013; Davis and van Wincoop, 2018). In this sense, capital inflows and outflows are twins.====Under perfect financial markets with no asymmetric information, frictions and home bias, the portfolio choices of residents and non-residents may be expected not to systematically diverge from each other. Consequently, as argued by Blanchard and Acalin (2016, p.1), the correlation between capital inflows and outflows “should be close to zero or even negative: If a country is for some reason more attractive to foreign investors, it is not obvious why domestic investors would want to invest more abroad”. The recent literature, however, often finds that this is not the case for gross capital inflows and outflows. Broner et al. (2013), for instance, find that when foreigners invest in a country, domestic agents invest abroad, and vice versa. Barrot and Servén (2018) also find that capital inflows and outflows are highly correlated. In the same vein, the results from Avdjiev et al. (2017) “imply that foreign and domestic investors behave differently in response to domestic and global shocks” (p.8), and this is “inconsistent with standard international macroeconomic models, which treat domestic and foreign investors symmetrically” (p.1).====The presence of asymmetric information (Tille and van Wincoop, 2014) or exchange rate risk (Broner et al., 2013), both leading to differences in expected returns, are among the basic explanations of the co-movement of capital inflows and outflows. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011) suggest relative perceived riskiness of home and foreign assets and the consequent differential shocks to risk aversion as a source of asymmetry. The relative expected deterioration of property rights of non-residents, leading them to have an incentive to sell domestic assets in the case of financial turbulence, may also lead to asymmetry according to Broner et al. (2010). The model by von Hagen and Zhang (2014) suggests that limited commitment and incomplete markets, leading to observationally equivalent financial frictions, are both important in explaining capital flows. According to Tille and van Wincoop (2010), the portfolio growth component of capital flows can generate a positive correlation between capital inflows and outflows when saving rates move together across countries. Davis and van Wincoop (2018) provide a model and empirical support for their postulation that higher international financial integration leads to co-movement of capital inflows and outflows. Accordingly, financial globalization causes higher volatility of gross flows relative to net flows and consequently increases the correlation, while trade globalization does the opposite. Lafuerza and Serven (2019) find that the international financial cycle and common global shocks, represented by a set of latent factors, are the main drivers of both capital inflows and outflows, leading them to move together. Caballero and Simsek (2020) explain the co-movement in terms of the relative safety, liquidity and returns of capital flows in AE and EME.====This paper investigates the long-run relationships and equilibrium correction mechanisms between gross capital inflows and outflows for a relatively large number of emerging market (EME) and advanced (AE) economies. The co-movement of capital inflows and outflows may also be driven by a common factor such as the global financial cycle. Consequently, following the recent literature including Forbes and Warnock (2012); Rey (2016); Barrot and Servén (2018) and Lafuerza and Serven (2019), we also consider the role of international financial conditions on the evolution of capital flows. The causes (Koepke, 2019) and consequences (Blanchard et al., 2017) of capital flows may also vary across the main components. Therefore, we consider not only aggregate gross flows but also their main components: portfolio (bond and equity), foreign direct investment and other investment flows.====The bulk of the literature does not take into account the integration and cointegration properties of the variables in investigating the relationship between capital inflows and outflows and thus may be subject to problems of spurious regression along with estimating equations containing variables with different orders of integration. Such an approach often does not allow making a distinction between long- and short-run relations and adjustment mechanisms towards the long-run equilibrium. Furthermore, the literature often employs the conventional panel fixed effects procedure, which may be subject to an endogeneity problem under invalid conditioning about the long-run drivers of capital flows. To tackle these issues, we employ the Johansen-Fisher cointegration procedure based on a reparametrized panel vector autoregression model, which allows us to estimate the long-run relationships and equilibrium correction mechanisms along with testing the validity of weak exogeneity restrictions.====The plan for the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents our empirical results by using annual data for a panel of a relatively large number of EME and AE. In Section 2.1, we consider the EME sample. Section 2.2 presents the results for the AE sample. In Section 2.3, as a robustness check, we consider a small set of core AE (AE_5), Germany, Japan, Switzerland, UK and USA, which are often perceived to be among the safe haven countries for international capital flows. This section also briefly reports a summary of our main findings for the EME and AE_5 samples.

In a corrupt economy, location might influence the ability of bureaucrats/politicians and firms to extract and dodge rents. Placing the analysis in the literature on determinants of corruption, our results reveal that the corruption experiences of firms located in nations’ capital cities are qualitatively different from firms located elsewhere: they do not experience greater corruption, while firms in large cities and main business cities do. However, when manufacturing and service firms are considered separately, their corruption experience and perceptions differ.","The importance of firm location and its implications for competitiveness and profitability have been recognized and widely analyzed in economics for quite some time since Hotelling (1929); also see Blair and Premus (1987); Goel (1994); Mccann and Sheppard (2003). However, the relevance of firms’ locations to corrupt exchanges has largely been ignored in the literature,==== leaving a research gap on the relationship between location choices of firms and the prevalence and intensity of corrupt activity. Filling this gap in the literature provides the motivation for the present study.====There are in fact several channels through which location might influence the ability of bureaucrats/politicians and firms to extract and dodge rents, and identifying them could contribute towards a better understanding of the nature and extent of corruption in different locations within a country. To that end, this paper studies the nexus between firm location and corruption by employing data from survey responses at the firm level. More precisely, the paper analyzes the impact of firms’ strategic locations on the prevalence and intensity of bribes, thereby adding firm location to numerous drivers of corruption that the existing literature has examined – see Dimant and Tosato (2018) for a recent literature review. Further, unlike most empirical investigations of corruption that rely on indirect or perception-based information on the prevalence of corruption, the present study uses data on actual corruption experiences of firms in the manufacturing and service industries across more than one hundred countries.====We begin by considering possible channels through which firms’ locations may influence the incidence of bribery/corruption. First, plant locations, especially locations of manufacturing firms, involve substantial fixed costs that are mostly sunk (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). Such costs often act as ==== barriers to entry by making firms reluctant to enter certain businesses in certain locations. Once the entry decision has been made, however, the same costs turn into hurdles that undermine firms’ abilities to move to other locations/industries. In a corrupt economy, this may also imply an inability of the firm to escape from bribe demands or rent-extraction by relocating to a less corrupt location/industry. The difficulty of relocation may therefore induce firms in a corrupt economy to think twice before making location decisions. It must be noted that while high relocation costs may, in principle, keep all firms facing a continuous demand for bribes to move away from their current locations, there are substantial structural differences across industries. Some industries like internet-based service businesses have contestability aspects (Goel and Hsieh, 2002) with inherently low sunk costs.==== This characteristic would relatively empower them in corrupt negotiations by making market exit easier. To account for such differences, we separately analyze and compare the corruption experiences of firms in manufacturing and firms in the service sector.====Second, the nature of corruption might be different depending on location. For example, it is conceivable for capital cities with a high density of lobbyists and politicians to have a disproportionate concentration of ==== corruption – whose effects are often more subtle, delayed, and indirect as compared to ==== corruption. As such, grand corruption may be relatively more difficult to detect, particularly when using data on outside observers’ attitudes and perceptions, which may fail to capture any concentration of political/grand corruption in capital cities. However, the corruption experience data provides direct insights into the prevalence (and intensity) of petty corruption.====Third, in large metropolitan areas, there presumably is a large pool of potential bribe givers and bribe takers – especially when government agencies have competing and overlapping jurisdictions (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1993). This would reduce the related switching costs and make moving from one corrupt transaction to another easier. Under these circumstances, bribe takers would find it easier to identify alternative “targets”, while bribe givers find it easier to search for cheaper alternatives. Along a related dimension, the large presence of bribe givers and bribe takers in capital cities is expected to make repeat corrupt interactions much more likely, with the related reputation effects influencing the size of bribes (Basu et al., 1992; Goel and Rich, 1989).====Fourth, the levels of enforcement and media scrutiny are likely to be different in metropolitan/capital areas compared to other areas. These could act as deterrents to corrupt exchanges. On the other hand, the supply of potential favors (government contracts) might be disproportionately larger in capital cities.====Finally, there is likely to be greater networking in strategic locations and this might also include networking between potential bribe takers and bribe givers. This might lead to informal exchanges of favors, including the use of non-cash means, changing the nature of corruption (see Goel et al., 2013).====To account for the influence of location on corruption, we distinguish between three possible locations: (i) firms located in a nation’s capital city; (ii) firms located in a nation’s main business city; and (iii) firms located in a nation’s large city/cities. These dimensions are qualitatively different, with potentially different implications for corruption. In some cases, the main business city, the capital city and the largest city might be the same – e.g., in the UK, London fits that bill. In others, such as in the case of India, the three are distinct: Kolkata is the largest city, Mumbai is the main business city, and New Delhi is the capital city. Yet in other cases, these roles may be assumed by only two cities - as in the United States where New York is the largest and the main business city, but Washington, DC is the capital city. Thus, our consideration of alternative location features is not necessarily picking up the same cities across the spectrum of nations considered.====Placing the analysis within the broader literature on the determinants of corruption, our empirical results, innovatively distinguishing among manufacturing and service industry firms located in different types of cities, reveal that the corruption experience of firms located in nations’ capital cities are qualitatively different from other firms in that they do not experience greater corruption, while firms located in large cities and main business cities might. The results also point to some interesting differences between manufacturing and service industries, and between the intensity and prevalence of corruption experience. When manufacturing sector and service sector firms are considered separately, manufacturing firms in big cities continue to face greater corruption experience and higher corruption intensity, but service sector firms in the capital and business center cities face lower corruption experience. On the other hand, manufacturing firms in business center cities face greater corruption experience and intensity, even though similar firms in the capital cities are no different from others.====Our findings should provide useful inputs in answering the following important questions related to corruption:====The relevance of these issues to corruption is worth investigating since some service sector firms, with their relatively low sunk costs, are able to change locations more easily than their manufacturing counterparts. Further, the relative dominance of political and economic functions or roles in a nation’s capital is often different from other (types of) cities. Finally, a wider prevalence of corruption might not impose substantial additional costs on firms if the intensity or magnitude of bribes is small.====The discussion in the rest of the paper includes the literature and the model in the next section, followed by data and estimation, results, and conclusions.",Strategic location of firms: Does it empower bribe givers or bribe takers?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000212,9 July 2021,2021,Research Article,72.0

This paper examines whether and how partisan ideology affects the extraction of shale gas. We use panel fixed effects as well as the system–generalized method of moments approach with quarterly panel data from 15 US states over the period 2007−2016. We consider not only the political ideology of the state governor but also the state legislature’s influence on the governor, control over the governorship and the legislature by the same party, the reelection of an incumbent government, and turnover in the political party in power. The results indicate that because the right-leaning party is more likely to support shale gas development, when a member of that party heads the state government, shale gas production performance is higher than when the left-leaning party is in power. Therefore, the production of shale gas rises with a turnover in political control from left to right, reelection of a right-leaning incumbent, and more right-leaning power in the state legislature. We believe our results shed light on the role of partisan ideology in shale gas production, which has implications for environmental regulations.","Natural gas is a clean, highly efficient, and low-carbon type of fossil fuel (Zhang et al., 2018). As the third-most-consumed energy source following oil (32 percent) and coal (27 percent), natural gas comprised 22 percent of the world energy mix in 2016 (Laurent, 2018), which is a sharp increase from 16 percent in 1971 (Burke and Yang, 2016), and this proportion has been forecasted to rise to 25 percent in 2035 (British Petroleum, 2017). The steady rise of natural gas resources is largely due to the increased feasibility of extracting gas from unconventional deposits (Unions of Concerned Scientists, 2015). Shale gas development is regarded as the main contributor to growth in the use of natural gas. Because of the application of new fracking technology (also known as the North American shale gas revolution) around 2008, the US has achieved great success in large-scale shale gas production for commercial use (Geng et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2019). Despite this boom in shale gas production in the US, few studies shed light on the driving forces of shale gas extraction, especially in papers discussing partisan ideology or political economy. Because the government’s energy policy and environmental policy are both vital to energy production, the link between nonnegligible political factors and shale gas development deserves to be carefully scrutinized.====Shale gas extraction is generally believed to be essential to job creation, economic growth, global gas output growth, transition away from a carbon-intensive energy economy (Maniloff and Mastromonaco, 2017), energy production, and security (Bruijnincx and Weckhuysen, 2013; Craig et al., 2018; Wang, 2018). However, shale gas extraction raises concern because of the negative environmental consequences, physical impairment (such as fragmentation on habitats), and so on (Davis and Fisk, 2014) of shale oil development (Warner and Shapiro, 2013; Zoback et al., 2010; Zonn et al., 2017). Specifically, large-scale fugitive methane leakage from flares (Howarth et al., 2011; Slezak, 2012; Willyard, 2019), degraded air quality from well emissions (Heikkila et al., 2018), contamination of water resources (in both underground and surface waters) (Finewood and Stroup, 2012), increased seismicity (Melikoglu, 2014), and severely deformed geological structures such as microdeformations in surrounding rocks (Wang, 2018) are considered the main negative externalities. Therefore, shale gas development is a topic of concern by the news media, scholars, environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), oil and gas companies, industry leaders, and policy makers.====Because of continuing environmental degradation worldwide, environmental protection and related policies have been critical issues for political parties and governments, which align their environmental policy with their partisan ideology. Varone and Aebischer (2011) show that political parties hold obviously different attitudes toward energy issues based on their partisan ideology. Wen et al. (2016) argue that left-wing governments care more about environmental quality whereas right-wing governments focus on economic growth. Given that shale gas production is accompanied by increased economic growth and worse environmental quality, governments have an incentive to develop and impose regulations according to their political ideology.====Because different political parties have different policy orientations and governments run by different parties at different times are incentivized and empowered to affect shale gas development, several meaningful questions emerge: Does partisan ideology (or orientation) influence shale gas extraction? If so, it would be worthwhile to know whether ideological differences lead to different levels of extraction. Which political ideology held by a ruling party is more likely to encourage the extraction of shale gas? In addition, does shale gas extraction have different drivers in states with abundant conventional energy compared to states with little production of conventional energy? Moreover, does a shift in the ruling party lead to a change in shale gas extraction policy? If the incumbent state governor wins reelection, does opportunistic behavior by that administration follow? Last but not least, can state legislatures influence the state governor’s policies? The answers to these questions matter for understanding the political economy of energy policy formation, offering voters a comprehensive perspective on which governing party will propose policies to their liking and giving oil and gas companies useful information to help them adjust their energy development plans.====Using quarterly panel data from 15 US states over the period 2007–2016, this paper investigates the influence of political ideology held by a state governor and administration on shale gas production. To understand the role of government ideology, we consider not only the state governor’s political ideology but also the state legislature’s influence on that governor’s policies, having the same party in power in the governorship and the state legislature, reelection of an incumbent government, and political turnover (i.e., transition from right to left or the reverse). We use the dynamic panel technique to account for the dynamics of shale gas extraction and potential endogeneity problems.====Overall, we contribute to the literature in the following ways. First, this paper enriches the study of shale gas development policy by exploring how partisan ideology affects shale gas extraction because overlooking the impact of partisan politics yields an inconclusive and limited explanation of shale gas development. To this end, we collect quarterly data spanning 40 quarters in 15 US states in 2007–2016, rather than using a general country-level dataset.==== The US does not have a national shale gas extraction standard to govern the placement or density of hydraulic fracturing wells, the disclosure of chemicals in fracking fluid, or negotiations for land use in hydraulic fracturing operations. All these issues are dealt with in different ways by each state, but the linkage between political orientation and shale development has received little attention. Second, this paper analyzes the effect of various partisan ideology variables on shale gas extraction, which fills a gap in the literature on this issue. We conduct a subsample analysis to examine whether partisan orientation has heterogeneous effects on shale gas extraction in states with different levels of conventional energy.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

Investment decisions are classified into two categories: fixed asset investment and non-fixed asset investment. Analysing a set of 1.3 million firm-year observations of businesses in Vietnam (2006–2016), we find evidence that local institutions (both formal and informal) positively influence fixed asset investment but negatively affect non-fixed asset investment. Also, we find that informal loans are positively associated with both types of firm investment while bank loans are negatively associated with both types of firm investment. More importantly, we find that the quality of local institutions is able to moderate firms’ external financing behaviour, leading to increased investment values.","Institutions are important in determining small business behaviours. The literature has shown that both formal and informal institutions significantly influence firms’ marketing activities (Dubova et al., 2017), cash balances and flows (Malinowska, 2019), as well as levels of innovativeness (Maksimov et al., 2017). In developing countries, where the formal institutional systems are underdeveloped and incomplete, informal institutions appear to be even more germane to shaping the ‘rules of the game’ (Steer and Sen, 2010). As such, recent studies have examined the relative importance of formal and informal national institutions for the performance of the entrepreneurial sector. However, a large body of the existing research assumes that institutions are homogenous within a country (Carbonara et al., 2016), with the result that most studies are conducted at the cross-country level. However, the local authorities in developing countries, due to the incompleteness of the formal institutions, may interpret and execute national legislation differently, leading to substantial heterogeneity in the quality of institutions across a country’s regions (Nguyen et al., 2018). Unfortunately, the issues related to local institutions have not been adequately addressed in the extant literature.====Access to finance is also key to determining small business behaviour. Small firms, due to their liabilities of newness and smallness, may find it difficult to secure sufficient external finance for their venturing activities (Carreira and Silva, 2010). Financing constraints are even more severe in developing countries because of their immature financial systems and the lack of alternative equity markets such as crowdfunding, business angels, and venture capital. In this situation, bank loans appear to be the only feasible external source of financing for the majority of small businesses. However, the banking systems in developing countries are typically controlled by state-owned banks, whose primary operational objective is to support state-owned firms, often to the detriment of privately-owned firms (Du et al., 2015). Faced with this situation, small businesses are ‘forced’ to rely on informal finance to support their venturing activities (Beck et al., 2015). Even though the relative importance of informal finance over formal finance has been widely investigated, the analysis is rarely conducted in conjunction with considering the role played by local institutions when explaining firm investment decisions.====Given these gaps in the literature, in this study we propose a framework that examines the roles of local institutions, external finance, and their joint effects on firm investment. The framework is novel in the following respects.====First, as well as examining fixed asset investments, we take into account non-fixed asset investments, such as obtaining additional working capital and repairing fixed asset investments (i.e., there is no increase in the number of fixed assets). Non-fixed asset investments are important to small businesses because small firms are typically not capital-intensive (Beck et al., 2013). As such, they must regularly invest in non-fixed asset projects to maintain their business operations. It is therefore important to take into account both the fixed asset investments and non-fixed asset investments of small businesses.====Second, we go beyond the national formal institutions (laws and regulations) by including the informal institutions (the local norms and practices of doing business) and the institutions of governance (the governance quality of local governments) in the model. The downgrade of the unit of analysis from national to local institutions is essential in the context of small businesses since their operations are mostly bounded by their local markets (Nguyen et al., 2018). Arguably, it is therefore reasonable to expect that the surrounding institutional factors are more relevant than the very broad and general national institutions to small business investment (Charron et al., 2014).====Third, on the finance side of the model, instead of following previous studies (Johnson et al., 2002) that employ bank loans as the sole representative of external finance, we also take into account informal credit (i.e., borrowing from relationship-based sources, such as friends and family). We expect that the inclusion of informal finance in the model will better explain small business investment decisions.====More importantly, our model also accounts for the potential interaction effects between local governance and external finance in determining firm investment. This consideration is based on recent literature showing that institutional and financial variables may not be independent of each other (Hasan et al., 2017). As such, we argue that the conventional comparison of the relative importance of institutions and external finance (Johnson et al., 2002) is unable to yield a meaningful conclusion. Rather, we suggest that the association between external finance and firm investment may change with the local institutional settings.====Analysing a set of 1.3 million firm-year observations of private small businesses in Vietnam (2006–2016), we find some evidence showing that local institutions (both formal and informal) are positively associated with firm fixed asset investment but negatively associated with non-fixed asset investment. In terms of external finance, informal loans are positively associated with firm investment, while bank loans are negatively associated with firm investment. This could be attributed to the underdeveloped banking systems in Vietnam. More importantly, our findings suggest that improved institutional quality (both formal and informal) positively influences the relationship between external finance and firm investment. Specifically, the negative effect of bank loans will become positive in regions with stronger institutional settings, while the positive effect of informal loans will be strengthened.====This study offers a set of important suggestions for policymakers who are concerned with boosting firm investment in developing countries where both the institutional settings and the financial systems are underdeveloped.","Local institutions, external finance and investment decisions of small businesses in Vietnam",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000285,15 June 2021,2021,Research Article,75.0

Based on certain characteristic features of innovation as a strategy available to state-owned enterprises, I build two sets of hypotheses formalising the channels of how these variables may affect the possibility and amount of R&D. Data is drawn from multiple sources to compile a dataset that covers all manufacturing central government-owned enterprises in India over a period of ten years from 2007 to 2016. The study employs an instrumental variable technique to reduce the endogeneity between disinvestment and R&D decisions. We find that, while disinvestment and local political corruption have strong negative effects on whether a firm invests in R&D or not, it has no effect on the amount of R&D. In fact, the amount is driven by a host of firm-specific factors such as size, profit and proficiency of the share of skilled labor, managerial strength and non-unionisation of labor. We also find that the effects are strongly driven by the size of firms, special status awarded to firms and the ideology of the state where the enterprise operates.","The role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is multidimensional. In principle, these enterprises deviate from the narrow focus of profit maximization and cater to a host of social objectives, including providing employment to the masses, reducing regional inequalities, and investing in projects with long gestation periods. This means that their performance of is driven by a hazy multidimensional objective function, which may imply performance adequacy. While much attention is focused on the effect of state ownership on standard accountancy measures of firm performance such as profits, productivity, etc., there is a paucity of studies examining innovations of state-owned enterprises.====Innovation, defined as activities undertaken by a firm in introducing new products or reducing costs in existing processes, has been identified as a conducive driver for profits. While profit-maximising private enterprises are driven by supernormal profits as the main motivation for investing in innovation, public sector enterprises have different reasons for engaging in innovation activities. First of all, as Stiglitz (1999) describes, innovation has a public good property, making state ownership better than private ownership at avoiding underprovisioning. Second, a limited focus on profits and profit variation makes SOEs better suited for a costly and risky activity such as R&D. Finally, the widespread presence and network of the public sector across various industry groups allows for a better coordinated and structured approach to R&D.====Against this background, the current study aims to study specific issues related to R&D in public sector enterprises, not contrasting R&D activities by ownership, but focussing on R&D patterns in public sector enterprises. This study focuses on enterprises owned by the central government of India for this context, better known as central public sector enterprises (CPSEs). The specific questions addressed are built on the premise that the performance of an enterprise is not driven by firm-specific factors in isolation. In fact, it is a combination of internal and external factors that influence performance. These external factors, comprising institutions, policies, and the political and economic environment, shape the business conditions in which the enterprise operates. Indian CPSEs provide an excellent premise for the questions at hand due to the federal nature of the Indian government. Despite being owned by the central government, these CPSEs come under the jurisdiction of the state governments as it is the electricity tariffs, infrastructural quality and local factors (which are controlled by the state government) that shape performance.====The study uses two particular external factors that may affect R&D activities in CPSEs in India. First, as part of the major reforms initiated in 1991, the Indian government adopted disinvestment, which is defined as the transfer of ownership in CPSEs from the government to the private sector. In the Indian context, this policy implied a dilution of state ownership, which makes it relevant in affecting decisions and efforts related to investment in a public good such as R&D. Secondly, R&D as a strategy requires enterprises to have frequent and lengthy dealings and engagements with public officials to obtain several licenses, permits and for other bureaucratic complexities. This makes the local political environment particularly important for firms choosing to innovate. The current study focuses on crime related to corruption among public officials (such as bribes) in the state where the enterprise is located to capture local political corruption. Based on these, the specific objectives of the study are to examine (i) the effect of disinvestment on R&D efforts in Indian CPSEs and (ii) the effect of local political corruption on R&D efforts in Indian CPSEs.====The study develops two sets of hypotheses relating disinvestment and local political corruption to R&D efforts drawing data from multiple sources and covering all manufacturing and non-financial services CPSEs from 2007 to 2016. The study limits capturing innovation activities by focusing only on R&D efforts due to unavailability of data on R&D type and quality. Taking explicit account of the possible endogeneity between disinvestment and R&D spending due to unobservables and reverse causality, an instrument variable estimation methodology is employed. Two sets of dependent variables are used to capture different dimensions of R&D – the decision to invest in R&D activities as measured by a dummy variable and a transformed variable on the amount of R&D investment. Given the slow implementation of disinvestment policy in India (with only five firms being privatized), most of the transactions involve miniscule ownership transfer. To capture this feature of the Indian disinvestment experience the study uses two variables – the share of private ownership in a CPSE and the time since the enterprise was selected for disinvestment for the first time. To capture local political corruption, the number of people arrested for corruption-related cases involving public officials in a state (where the enterprise is located) per million population is used. An interaction of this measure with incumbency of the state government in the most recent elections is also employed. In addition, a host of firm-specific financial and profiling variables that may influence R&D investment decisions is used. Finally the study uses dummy variables for year, industry and state-level unobserved effects.====The main findings are as follows. The private share of ownership has a non-uniform impact on R&D possibility and amount. While it hampers the possibility of a firm to invest in R&D, it has no effect on the amount of R&D investment. The time since first disinvestment has a positive and significant impact on both R&D decisions. Given the minuscule dilution of ownership in Indian CPSEs, the reverse sign of private share and time since disinvestment reflects that disinvestment does not have a permanent hampering effect on R&D decisions within CPSEs. The effect of local political corruption on R&D investment decisions is similar to the effect of disinvestment. High local political corruption in states leads to lower R&D possibilities for CPSEs operating there but has no effect on the amount of R&D. Further, the negative effect of local political corruption is stronger in states that have the same party elected in the most recent state-level elections compared to enterprises located in states that had a different party coming into power. This suggests that the effect of local corruption is strengthened when the party has more years in office. Broadly, the results reflect an interesting pattern regarding the decision whether or not to invest in R&D and the amount spent on R&D activities. While policy shocks such as disinvestment and the external political environment have a strong bearing on the decision of the CPSE to engage in R&D, it has no effect on the amount spent. On the contrary, the amount of R&D is driven by firm-specific internal factors that capture the quality of labor – managerial influence, ratio of skilled workforce and non-unionisation of labor. Finally, the study also finds that the effect of both disinvestment and local political corruption on R&D investment is strongly conditioned by factors such as firm size, Ratna status and ideologies of the state government where the enterprise is located.====The study makes an important contribution to the literature on R&D spending in public sector enterprises. The effect of partial privatization on R&D decisions has been explored in the context of developed countries but studies on firms in developing countries remain scarce. Furthermore, while there is abundant research on the effect of corruption on the profitability, productivity and export performance of firms, there is very little on how corruption affects R&D activities. The current study is one of the first efforts to examine the effect of corruption on R&D spending in public sector companies.",Is R&D spending influenced by disinvestment and local political corruption?

In particular, we carefully consider the heterogeneity of inward FDI with respect to its entry mode (ownership type) and sectoral distribution. Based on a panel dataset covering 30 provinces and cities in China from 2000 to 2016, our results show that inward FDI does not increase urban–rural wage inequality. In particular, we do not find a significant relationship between inward FDI in the secondary and tertiary sectors, while inward FDI in the primary sector has a slightly negative effect on inequality. When we consider inward FDI by entry mode, we find that wholly foreign-owned enterprises (WFE) have a negative spatial effect on urban–rural wage inequality in the short and long run, while equity joint ventures (EJV) reduce urban–rural inequality in the long run only.","Burgeoning globalisation has ensured that foreign direct investment (FDI) and its effects remain one of the most heated topics in academic and popular discussions alike. To date, there has been an extensive body of literature devoted to the impact of inward FDI on sustainable development. Although attracting inward FDI is one of the most efficient ways to boost the economy of host countries, the literature is concerned with the possibility that inward FDI increases income inequality, which prevents sustainability, especially for developing countries. However, a consensus in the literature on inward FDI and inequality is yet to be reached. For example, Tsai (1995) uses data for 33 developed and less developed countries, showing that less developed countries report increases in income inequality in the wake of inflow of FDI. Choi (2006) supports this argument, finding that inward FDI increases income inequality in developing countries but not in developed countries. Basu and Guariglia (2007) obtain similar findings based on 119 developing countries and show that inward FDI can exacerbate inequality. Taylor and Driffiled (2005) investigate the case in the United Kingdom and find that the increase of wage inequality can be explained by inward FDI. Figini and Görg (2011) provide a similar result by comparing OECD and non-OECD countries. Their results suggest that income inequality first increases with inward FDI but decreases once a turning point has been reached. Herzer and Nunnenkamp (2013) show that FDI negatively affects income inequality in most European countries. However, Asteriou et al. (2014) hold a completely opposite view, arguing that the highest contribution to inequality stems from inward FDI based on an EU-27 analysis. Mah (2003), conversely, reports that inequality is unaffected by FDI inflows in Korea. Similarly, Sylwester (2005) does not find any significant relationship between inward FDI and income inequality in a sample of 29 less developed countries.====This paper investigates how inward FDI affects inequality in China, which has been one of the largest FDI recipients and has drawn considerable attention for its exacerbated income inequality. Some studies on Chinese income inequality argue that inward FDI increases inequality. Zhang and Zhang (2003) ascribe growing regional disparities to the effects of inward FDI and trade openness. Wan et al. (2007) argue that globalisation substantially aggravates regional inequality and that this is largely due to the dramatic increase of inward FDI. Lessmann (2013), comparing China with 54 other countries, argues that inward FDI tends to raise income inequality in poorer regions. Mah (2013) adopts dynamic ordinary least squares from 1985 to 2007 to show that trade globalisation and trade openness have strong and positive effects on income inequality, while the impact of inward FDI is mixed. In a similar vein, Jalil (2012) shows that the relationship between openness and income inequality in China displays a pattern similar to the Kuznets curve: income inequality increases when openness grows but decreases later. From a firm-level perspective, Chen et al. (2011) show that inward FDI raises wage inequality because foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) report higher wage growth rates and discourage wage growth in domestic firms. On the contrary, some studies do not find evidence that inequality relates to inward FDI. Yu et al. (2011) use a simultaneous equation model and the Shapley value regression-based decomposition approach. They argue that inward FDI has no impact on income inequality. Wei et al. (2009) separate regional data into three groups: east, west, and central. They find that although income inequality climbs in the period they analyse, there is no consistent evidence showing that the inflow of foreign capital should be blamed for this. Western regions receive far less FDI but still suffer from rising income inequality. Using provincial-level data from 1999 to 2013, Greaney and Li (2017) find that the entry of multinationals does not have a significant effect on urban–rural wage inequality in general. Despite the growing debate on whether inward FDI drives wage inequality, little effort has been made to consider inter-regional interactions. As the spatial effect of inward FDI is explicitly recognised in the literature (Huang and Chand, 2015; Huang et al., 2017), it follows that inward FDI does not only affect inequality in the region where it is located but may also have a spatial effect on other regions, in that the employment effect of inward FDI has significantly increased labour mobility between regions (Fosfuri et al., 2001; Xu and Sylwester, 2016; Cuadros et al., 2019).====Our study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, it attempts to offer novel evidence of the relationship between inward FDI and inequality by investigating the spatial effect of inward FDI, filling a significant research gap in the literature. To disentangle this relationship, we base our empirical strategy on 30 provinces from 2000 to 2016, using spatial econometric techniques to account for the total, direct, and indirect effects. We focus on urban–rural wage inequality, which accounts significantly for the aggravation of income inequality in China, as argued in the literature (Yang, 2002; Xie and Zhou, 2014). Second, inward FDI can affect inequality not only on a regional level but also across sectors. As argued by Wang (2009); Yu et al. (2011) and Wang and Luo (2020), studies that do not differentiate sectoral FDI may result in biased and ambiguous results, which applies especially to China where inward FDI has been unevenly distributed across sectors. Therefore, we carefully account for the sectoral distribution of FDI, namely the flow into the primary (agriculture), secondary (manufacturing), and tertiary (service) industries, to study how they may exert different spatial effects on inequality. Third, the entry mode of inward FDI in terms of ownership should be not be neglected. The effects of inward FDI with different entry strategies (ownerships) on productivity (Javorcik, 2004), labour pooling (Fosfuri et al., 2001), technology (Girma et al., 2015), and regional development (Ouyang and Yao, 2017) vary significantly, which indicates a potential discrepancy in inequality as well. Therefore, we study how the spatial effect of inward FDI may vary depending on entry mode. Thus, we consider the entry mode by classifying ownership types of inward FDI into equity joint venture (EJV), cooperative joint venture (CJV), and wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFE).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review on the conceptual framework to explicate why spatial spillovers matter and outlines the different types of inward FDI by sector and entry mode. Section 3 introduces the methodology and describes the data in use. Section 4 discusses the empirical results.

Unlike the existing literature on this topic, which mostly uses cross-sectional or pooled specifications for either country-level or regional data, we use panel data. This approach allows us to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts and mitigates endogeneity concerns. As an additional contribution to the literature, we estimate the full marginal effects of institutions on manufacturing sectors with different degrees of institutional dependence. In terms of policy recommendations, our results imply that significant institutional improvements would be needed for the Russian economy to diversify away from heavy reliance on oil and natural gas.","A substantial literature demonstrates the differential impact of institutional quality on manufacturing sectors, with different degrees of institutional dependence. For example, countries with better institutions tend to export more in sectors with more diverse input requirements, as shown by Levchenko (2007), or greater reliance on relationships with specific suppliers and thus more subject to the possibility of “holdup” problems, as discussed by Nunn (2007). Feenstra et al. (2013) perform a largely similar exercise but with the data on Chinese provinces. Amirapu (2020) is an example of this type of research using data on Indian states.====All these papers use an essentially cross-sectional approach and thus cannot distinguish between the short- and long-term effects of institutions. Also, with cross-sectional or pooled specifications, using country (Nunn, 2007), state (Amirapu, 2020), and province-year (Feenstra et al., 2013) fixed effects, these papers fail to estimate full marginal effects of institutional quality on manufacturing sector performance because these fixed effects subsume part of the relevant marginal effect. We contribute to the literature by using panel data on manufacturing in Russian regions to show that even relatively short-term changes in the institutional environment can significantly affect the performance of industries with different degrees of institutional dependence.==== (We use the terms “sector” and “industry” interchangeably.) In addition, we use the system generalized method of moments (GMM) and quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) specifications to deal with the potentially dynamic nature of the effects of institutional quality and differentiate between its short- and long-term impacts. Finally, we estimate the effects on both the output levels and the growth rates in different industries.====Our data come from Russian regions, which adds a specific policy aspect to the research. The Russian economy has long been heavily dependent on oil and natural gas, which are exposed to highly volatile market prices. The Russian government claims that it has been trying to diversify away from hydrocarbons, so far without much success.==== Despite the presence of some advantages, such as a highly skilled labor force,==== Russia’s most institutionally dependent manufacturing sectors have not grown in relative economic importance as quickly as the government might have hoped. Although the share of the most institutionally dependent manufacturing sectors (machinery, transportation equipment, and electronics and communications equipment; see Appendix Table A3) in manufacturing output increased slightly, from 19.9 percent in 2005 to 20.7 percent in 2012, this share declined again to 18.7 percent in 2018.==== Relative to other countries, Russia has experienced stagnating complexity in its exports (Lyubimov, 2019). One conjecture is that the inability to foster institutionally dependent manufacturing (which is also more sophisticated and has high value added) is due to poor institutional quality in the country.==== Thus, according to the World Bank’s World Governance Indicators (WGI) data, Russia’s scores on the rule of law, regulatory quality, and corruption control went from, respectively, –0.93, –0.13, and –0.82 in 2005 to –0.82, -0.34, and -1.04 in 2012, and to -0.72, -0.43, and –0.83 in 2019, implying that in Russia rule of law and control of corruption are stagnant and significantly weaker than the world average, and regulatory quality is somewhat lower than average.==== Our results support this conjecture by demonstrating the strong relationship between performance in institutionally dependent manufacturing sectors and the quality of institutions in the country.====As mentioned earlier, our approach generally follows Nunn (2007) and Feenstra et al. (2013) but with some important differences. In his pioneering paper, Nunn (2007) uses cross-country data with country and industry fixed effects to estimate the coefficient of the interaction between “relationship specificity” of an industry and the country’s institutional quality on the industry’s export volumes. As we explain in the Data section, relationship specificity measures the degree to which a firm within an industry relies on inputs that cannot be purchased on organized exchanges and are not reference-priced in commonly accepted industry publications. That is, these inputs cannot be easily purchased “off the shelf.” Therefore, relationship specificity approximates the need for the firms in the sector to enter into complicated negotiations and/or long-term relationships with suppliers, exposing both parties to potential hold-up problems. This forces firms in highly relationship specific industries operating in a weak institutional environment to rely on excessive vertical integration and generating other distortions.==== These firms ultimately gravitate to jurisdictions with stronger institutions.====Nunn’s (2007) cross-country approach might suffer from the fact that it is difficult to account for potentially relevant differences among countries and industries in them in a cross-country regression, even with country and industry fixed effects. In this sense, the approach based on data for regions in a single country might be more reliable. Subnational units share some hard-to-measure characteristics, such as being in the same macroeconomic environment and legal system, which reduces potential omitted variable biases. Moreover, the factors of production are substantially more mobile between regions than across countries, making it easier for these factors to take advantage of interjurisdictional differences in institutional quality.==== Feenstra et al. (2013) pool data on twenty-three industries in thirty Chinese provinces in 1997–2007 to estimate the impact of similar interaction terms on provincial manufacturing exports.==== Although the data studied by Feenstra et al. constitute a panel, they use pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) specifications with province-year and industry fixed effects. Amirapu (2020) applies Nunn’s (2007) cross-sectional approach to Indian states. Similarly, Chakraborty (2016) estimates the effects of the strength of contract enforcement on the performance of firms with different degree of input complexity, using institutional quality data on Indian states.==== All these papers focus on estimating the coefficients of the interaction terms between a sector’s institutional dependence and the jurisdiction’s institutional quality without calculating the full marginal effects of institutional quality on performance in manufacturing sectors. By not using a panel structure, the existing research also fails to distinguish between the short- and long-term effects of changes in the institutional environment.====We use panel data to obtain a conventional “within” fixed-effects estimator, which is equivalent to using fixed effects for region-industry pairs and for years. These estimates show the short-term impact of institutions on manufacturing. However, this estimator may be problematic if the errors are serially correlated. Also, the conventional “within” estimator does not allow for the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable in the regression with a short time dimension and, therefore, does not take into account the potentially dynamic nature of the data or evaluate the long-term effects of institutions. To address these issues, we estimate dynamic panel specifications using QML and system-GMM.==== Both estimation approaches are appropriate in this case, given the large cross-sectional and short time dimensions of the panel. System-GMM is more flexible than QML and employs “internal” instruments to deal with potential endogeneity. However, the validity of these instruments is debatable, and, if they are weak, they may yield misleading estimates.==== The tradeoff between these two approaches to dynamic panel estimation in our case is unclear. However, both produce positive and significant marginal effects of institutional quality at high levels of relationship specificity, although these marginal effects are much larger in system-GMM estimations, whereas QML estimates are relatively close to those using OLS with fixed effects (FE).====As noted by several other authors, the OLS estimates of the relationship between an industry’s institutional intensity and institutional quality in the host jurisdiction may suffer from endogeneity, which can be caused by omitted variables or by reverse causality, in which more institutionally intensive industries can push the jurisdictional government to improve institutions. The omitted variables problem can be mitigated, if not fully eliminated, by using a sufficiently comprehensive set of fixed effects, and both problems, in principle, can be addressed by estimation with instrumental variables (IV). However, it is notoriously difficult to find valid instruments for institutional quality. Nunn (2007) uses countries’ legal origins as instruments for institutional quality (rule of law measure). Feenstra et al. (2013) instrument their variable for institutional quality (judicial quality) with dummy variables for different colonial powers that formerly occupied the respective provinces. The validity of legal origins as instruments for institutions is questioned by Bazzi and Clemens (2013). One could also question the validity of colonial powers in China as instruments. In addition, in the case of multiple instruments, one would expect them to satisfy overidentification tests, although they work only if at least one of the instruments is valid. Nunn’s instruments fail overidentification tests, and Feenstra et al. do not report such tests at all. Levchenko (2007) and Amirapu (2020) do not use IV estimation. Given the difficulty of finding appropriate instruments and testing their validity, we do not emphasize the use of internal instruments in system-GMM specifications, although we note that they pass overidentification tests.====Rather than using IV estimation, we rely mostly on the use of fixed effects as our main identification technique. We show that our results hold, whether we use region-industry and year fixed effects (i.e., the “within” estimator) or region-year and industry-year fixed effects. The first set of fixed effects is particularly important, because the resulting estimates reflect the impact of short-term institutional quality, making reverse causality unlikely. The region-year and industry-year fixed effects are also useful because they represent by far the most comprehensive set of fixed effects in the literature. Moreover, our use of regional data in the same country together with a battery of fixed effects mitigates the potential for an omitted variable problem as well.====In addition, unlike most other papers, we use both levels and growth rates in manufacturing sectors instead of only output (or export) levels.==== Using growth rates is important because they are indicative of current trends and are more likely to reflect the current institutional environment. Moreover, the use of the growth rates as a dependent variable is another way to mitigate potential endogeneity in the data because reverse causality between industries’ growth rates (as opposed to industry size) and the quality of institutions in a region is unlikely to occur.====We obtain statistically significant and quantitatively important effects of institutional quality on the size and growth rates of institutionally intensive manufacturing sectors in the short and long term, and with different sets of fixed effects. In the OLS FE and QML regressions that include the direct impact of institutional quality, the coefficients of the interaction term between the relationship specificity of an industry and the institutional quality of a region are always positive but mostly not statistically significant.==== However, these coefficients are statistically significant in system-GMM regressions. Also, the coefficients of the direct term for institutional quality in the system-GMM specifications are positive and significant whereas the respective coefficients in OLS FE and QML are negative and insignificant, suggesting that either OLS FE and QML estimates are biased because of endogeneity or system-GMM specification suffers from a weak instruments problem. Note, however, that we are interested in estimates of the full marginal effects of institutional quality, which are not estimated in the earlier literature, and they are statistically significant in all regressions for sectors with high relationship specificity.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The progress of globalization, the rise of emerging countries, increasing global inequality, and wars in the Middle East have led to demographic changes. In line with the expansion of international migration, in addition to sociological studies, a stream of literature has rapidly grown on the effect of ethnic identification on economic behavior and welfare, such as participation in the labor market, income, and household ownership. To some extent, these studies are related to identity economics, pioneered by Akerlof and Kranton (2000), who suggest that social identity became a considerable determinant of economic preference and labor market outcomes. In this sense, the identity of an immigrant became a primary variable for explaining participation in economic life, business and solidarity networks, property ownership, employment, and savings behavior. The dominant characteristics of identity in society define the degree of discrimination, wage inequality, and deprivation of social rights.====Pendakur and Pendakur (2005) conduct one study in this context, finding that, among European ethnic minorities, the degree of ethnicity is positively correlated with using informal network channels to find a job. However, the result is not the same for non-European ethnic minorities. From the same perspective, Battu et al. (2005) show a direct correlation between the measurement of identity and the probability of employment. However, Battu et al. (2007) focus on the importance of the impact of oppositional identity in adopting the dominant identity. They demonstrate that the self-definition of an immigrant with respect to family, friends, religion, and language leads to adverse labor market outcomes. Similarly, Battu et al. (2011) explicitly examine the consequences of an ethnic identity for getting a job. They show that in the UK ethnic identity is highly correlated with using ethnic job-finding networks.====Likewise, Zimmermann (2007) addresses the role of ethnic identity in earnings. Using an index called ethnosizer to capture the degree of integration by immigrants, he examines the particular contribution of ethnic identity. He finds that ethnic identity matters significantly and that the findings are highly robust to the concrete model specification. Constant and Zimmermann (2009) extend this framework to model the labor force participation and earnings of both male and female immigrants, because they may have completely different understandings and expressions of their ethnic identity. This is based on the idea that immigrants are mostly useful in the host country when they bring talents and skills that differ from those possessed by native workers. Constant et al. (2009a) demonstrate that, rather than ethnic identity, the level of integration induces homeownership. The probability that a migrant who is integrated and assimilated will have a home is greater than that of the other characteristics of migrants. Constant et al. (2009b) conclude that the probability that migrants will be willing to acquire the citizenship of the host country is related purely to their level of integration. However, ethnic identity and self- identity influence future naturalization. Nekby and Rödin (2010) use the same methodology as Constant and Zimmerman (2009) but with intergenerational data. The specific focus is the impact of the acculturation identity on the probability of employment by the second and later generations of immigrants in Sweden.====Several studies also introduce ethnic identity as a valuable variable for explaining wage and income inequality (Mason, 2004; Neuman and Oaxaca, 2005). Zorlu (2003) points out the significant differences in wage level across the seven different ethnic identities and workers with Dutch citizenship. The wage levels are influenced more strongly by ethnicity than by gender. Neuman and Oaxaca (2005) find parallel results in the Israeli labor market. Mason (2004) also obtains empirical results on the heterogeneity of Hispanic speakers, such as Mexican and Cuban Americans, which causes adverse selection in labor market outcomes and discrimination due to skin color or phenotype.====More recent research, for example, Lehmer and Ludsteck (2011), employs decomposition and quantile regression methods, further differentiating immigrants in Germany by their origin in a range of countries within and outside Europe. Similarly, in the Italian labor market, Dell’Aringa et al. (2015) show that contrary to the natives, work experience among migrants does not have statistically significant returns. Using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data for Austria, Grandner and Gstach (2015) compare the wages of immigrants and native workers, using the Oaxaca-Blinder Approach (1973) and the quantile regression approach of Machado and Mata (2005). They find a wage gap between native workers and migrants of between 15 percent and 25 percent that disadvantages migrants. Wage inequality between the host and immigrant population occurs in many countries in Europe. The majority of migrants within the European Union (EU) face income disadvantages, which tend to be even more pronounced for migrants from non-EU countries than for migrants from EU member states (Lehmer and Ludsteck, 2015). In Austria, which has a higher share of foreigners than Germany, Hofer et al. (2017) show a wage gap between immigrants and native workers.====In this article, using a survey conducted in Turkey, in particular in Istanbul, we explore the question of whether the integration process of refugees in that city, who mostly arrived over the past decade, influences the economic outcomes of the labor market, such as the job position, income level, and the wage gap. This is critical because the economic outcomes for refugees have vital implications, especially in the countries that are migration recipients, such as Turkey, which has a potential labor force numbering two million refugees, mainly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkic Republics, such as Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan. In this sense, we contribute to the literature by studying a city that has been highly affected by refugee flows because of the crisis in Syria and developments in other poor countries in the Middle East and other regions nearby. This study concerns the country that has harbored the largest refugee population in the past decade. In this way, we aim to fill a gap in the literature, which until now has not had a comparable analytical study about refugees in Turkey.====Our data cover household and labor-related characteristics that are relevant for understanding the determinants of labor market success across groups. We consider a rich set of control variables for typically unobservable labor market influences. In particular, we examine individual personality traits and integration barriers by taking into account the metrics of refugees’ proximity to Turkey. Hence, we do not consider refugees in Turkey as a homogeneous group but, rather, take into account differences based on the country of origin. This allows us to address whether the welfare differentials of refugees arise from their personal traits or from their refugee status.====To empirically measure the ethnic identity of refugees and analyze its impacts on their economic welfare, we employ a concept called an ethnosizer developed by Constant et al. (2009), which is used to measure the intensity of people’s ethnic identity with respect to the society in their host country and country of origin (source/home country). This measurement uses information on their language, culture, social interactions, history of migration, and ethnic self-identification. The ethnosizer can be either one-dimensional or the two-dimensional: the former shows the degree of identity commitment to the home or host country, whereas the latter allows simultaneous intensification of commitment to the host and source countries. In addition to these identity measures, we also employ other parameters of discrimination to see whether they have any economic impact on the welfare of refugees.====In this way, we analyze the relationship between the economic welfare of refugees and the integration level (or commitment), and discrimination defined by various concepts concerning the ethnicity of refugees. To do this, we focus on how the income level of refugees is related to their ethnic status, controlling for other variables. Using information from our sample data on migration in Istanbul, we also focus on refugees’ employment status. To do this, we use various probit models to analyze the impact of ethnic identity, controlling for the main determinants of the employment status of refugees in Istanbul. The wage gap between the refugees and local workers is another important issue we address in the paper. It is important to analyze whether wage differentials are due to observable differences in, for example, human capital endowments or to unobservable influences, that is, ethnic discrimination. In this sense, we also have an opportunity to test the human capital theory in the context of refugees in Turkey. This is essential for revealing structural and persistent disadvantages experienced by these groups. To consider the heterogeneous effects observed across the entire wage gap distribution, we also apply quantile regression models. Thus, we examine whether trends emerge in wage gaps in various quantiles of wage gaps between refugees and native workers.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we quantify the identity of the refugees in Istanbul using the ethnosizer concept. Section 3 explores the analytical links between the ethnic identities of refugees and their economic welfare in the context of income level and the probability of employment for the refugees in Istanbul and wage gaps between the refugees and the native workers in Istanbul.

This new approach uses the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2009) spillover methodology by combining the feedback relationship and the time-varying (dynamic) aspect of that same relationship. The empirical analysis is based on quarterly data over different periods in the European Union (EU) (as a whole) and in ten Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The main results indicate that the spillovers of shocks between ESI and GDP growth are time-varying for all observed countries, with increasing values of total spillovers in the last recession and afterwards. The direction and strength of spillover effects between economic sentiment and GDP growth are different for the analysed CEE countries. The results are robust with respect to changing the rolling window length, additional Granger causality testing and rolling correlation coefficients.","Economic sentiment is widely employed in empirical business cycle analysis. The idea to include sentiment variables in predicting economic activity is not new, but the scope of application of these variables is wider than it was before. The recent global economic recession, the financial crisis, and their impact on the real economy particularly have inspired many analysts and researchers to investigate the relationship between economic sentiment, macroeconomic and financial variables. It is well known that economic sentiment has predictive power with regard to GDP growth and many other economic variables (see Antipa et al., 2012; Camacho and Garcia-Serrador, 2011; Camacho and Perez Quiros, 2010; Giannone et al., 2009; Cotsomitis and Kwan, 2006; Hansson et al., 2005). However, the literature that finds mutual effects between the sentiment and GDP growth (Demirel and Artan, 2017; Aarle et al., 2012; Mermod et al., 2010) is also proliferating in the recent period.====A common approach to observing the mentioned relationship is either a static form of modelling (no time variation of parameters in the model, see Raoufina, 2016;Dritsaki, 2015; Mendicino and Punzi, 2013; Sdrakas and Viguie, 2013) or assuming a one-directional relationship between sentiment and macroeconomic variables (e.g. Islam and Mumtaz, 2016; Pošta and Pihkart, 2012). Dynamic modelling of sentiment and macroeconomic variables has been getting more attention over the last few years: a time-varying coefficient approach via state space modelling (Soric, 2018) or penalized regression splines (Zanin, 2010), where evidence of time-varying parameters has been found. This paper attempts to rectify the issues of static and one directional modelling by estimating a bidirectional relationship between GDP growth and the economic sentiment indicator (ESI) that allows the spillovers of shocks from one variable to another to vary over time. Furthermore, one of our research goals is to examine whether the spillovers are affected by the recent European recession. This is done by introducing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2009) dynamic spillover indices into the context of VAR (Vector AutoRegression) modelling. We focus on the EU as a whole and additionally on 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Our contribution is a comprehensive study of the time-varying bidirectional relationship between ESI and GDP growth; we estimate the direction of rolling shock spillovers between the two variables and contrast the results by performing a number of robustness checks on the results. Moreover, a novelty of the study is the use of the methodology of spillover indices, which has not yet been applied in this type of research (to the best of our knowledge). This methodology enables researchers to determine which variable was the net emitter, and which the net receiver, of shocks in the system. Our main results indicate that the relationship between the observed variables is changing over time. There is an interchanging of the variable that is the net emitter of shock spillovers and the one that is the net giver. This should be included in future economic forecasting and nowcasting when using the mentioned variables in the analysis. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced during and after the recession.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section deals with relevant related research, focusing on the interactions between ESI and GDP growth. The third section gives an overview of the methodology used in this study.

During an observation period of two decades, cross-country trade and financial linkages experience notable changes. We find CIS countries to be highly sensitive to global and regional shocks, with that sensitivity increasing after the global financial crisis. CIS countries show the strongest responses to output shocks originating in the US, Russia and within the region itself, but their sensitivity to euro area shocks also increases substantially. Despite growing trade relations with China, the responses of CIS countries to output shocks originating in China are still relatively moderate.","The economies associated with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) provide an interesting but relatively little studied region for examining the transmission and impacts of global and regional shocks. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, CIS economies have experienced highly volatile development while shifting from transition to market economies over the past three decades (Roaf et al., 2014). With the liberalization of foreign trade and financial flows they have also become much more closely integrated with the global economy. Although significant structural changes in domestic economies and global integration resulted in the development of a set of heterogeneous emerging economies with specific features, CIS countries are deeply interrelated due to common economic, geographic and political issues. This emphasizes the importance of a multilateral perspective that considers cross-country linkages in analyzing the response of CIS economies to international shocks.====To illustrate the increasing importance of the global economy for the CIS region, Table A1 provides real GDP cross-country correlations for the periods before and after the global financial crisis of 2007−09. It shows considerable changes for the major economies and CIS countries, as suggested in earlier literature (e.g. Ductor and Leiva-Leon, 2016; Fidrmuc et al., 2014). For the CIS region, average cross-country output correlations with all countries have doubled since the global financial crisis. Average cross-country correlation within the region also increased substantially from 0.08 to 0.41. Foreign trade and international capital flows of the CIS economies have grown substantially during the past couple of decades. Today, many CIS economies are more dependent on foreign trade than the world average. There have also been notable changes in the geographical composition of trade and financial flows of the CIS economies.==== China’s share of CIS trade has more than doubled from an average share of 5 % during 2001–04 to 11 % during 2013–16. The share of euro area countries in CIS trade has also increased, while the Russian share has shrunk. For most CIS countries, the share of intra-region trade has increased. On the financial side, the US and euro area see growing shares, while Russia’s share decreases.====Taking into account the potentially high vulnerability of the CIS economies to external shocks and the notable shifts in their international economic relations, we want to examine the impacts of external shocks on these economies and whether the transmission of shocks has changed during the past couple of decades. Therefore, we construct a Global Vector Auto Regressive (GVAR) model to analyze the response of several CIS countries to output shocks in the US, euro area, China and Russian Federation, as well as to regional CIS output shocks.==== We follow a model approach similar to that used in Feldkircher (2015) and Feldkircher and Korhonen (2014), complemented with features allowing us to examine the changes in responses to shocks in a similar vein to Fadejeva et al. (2017) and Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2012).====Regarding the most relevant previous literature, Feldkircher (2015) examines the transmission of US and EU shocks to Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) and CIS with a GVAR model comprising 43 countries over the time period 1995–2011. Following a 1 % shock to euro area or US output, he finds that on average the GDP in the CIS countries increases in the long term by 0.9 % and 0.7 %, respectively. He further supports the importance of regional interdependencies within CIS. Feldkircher and Korhonen (2014) study the transmission of Chinese shocks to the rest of the world, including CIS countries. Their findings, which are based on a GVAR model of 52 economies covering the period 1995–2011, suggest that a 1% shock to Chinese real output translates to a roughly 0.2 % rise in the output of CIS countries in the long term.====More recently, Fadejeva et al. (2017) examined spillovers from the euro area and the US to other regions in the global economy, including a number of CIS countries. Their GVAR model, which includes 42 countries and covers the years 1995–2013, focuses on the effects of credit shocks and aggregate demand shocks. The analysis extends to separate direct and indirect channels of influence. The results suggest that CIS countries are among the economies experiencing the most pronounced spillovers from foreign credit and demand shocks. These shocks have historically played an important role in GDP fluctuations of CIS countries. The median long-term response of the CIS countries to a 1% aggregate demand shock is found to amount to about 4% in the US and to 3% in the euro area. The large role of US shocks mostly reflects the indirect impacts of US shocks on CIS economies.====The impact of regional or Russia-originated shocks has not been examined in the GVAR framework, but there is some evidence of the significance of these shocks on various CIS economies. Alturki et al. (2009) find from a panel specification that a 1% shock to Russian GDP is associated with a 0.35–0.45 % increase in the GDP of CIS countries. They also estimate separate VAR models for several CIS countries to examine the effect on them of Russian growth. They find that a 2% shock on Russian output is associated with a 0.6–2% response in the GDP of some CIS countries, but the effect is not statistically significant for all countries.====The main contributions of this paper relate to the analysis of CIS economies. First, we examine the changes in the responses of CIS economies to output shocks originating in different regions for the first time. Second, we examine the effects of shocks originating specifically from Russia, with developments in recent years providing topical insights. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to examine the evolution of the decomposition of direct and indirect effects from trade and financial linkages by slightly extending the approaches applied in Fadejeva et al. (2017) and Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2012).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the analytical framework. The data and model setup are presented in Section 3.

Our results show that the direct effects, indirect effects and total effects of corruption on environmental performance are negative and highly significant, implying that corruption is detrimental to environmental performance. More importantly, we find that there is a significant spatial spillover effect between corruption and environmental performance, namely being surrounded by highly corrupt countries has a negative impact on the local country’s environmental performance. Our results also suggest that a larger population density will worsen the environment, while urbanization has a significant positive impact. These results provide some important implications for policymakers seeking to improve their environmental performance.","Environmental performance, as well as environmental quality, is being considered by scholars and policymakers in the context of a growing economy. It is well known that environmental performance is one of the most important essential conditions for human survival, and closely related to human activities and economic development. From an economic perspective, some authors suggest that the state should use cleaner energy and technology, control the level of trade openness, and improve the industrial structure for a better environmental performance (Grossman and Krueger, 1995; Press, 2007; Managi and Kumar, 2009). Meanwhile, the international community has also held many climate conferences, such as the 2015 Paris climate conference and the 2018 United Nations climate change conference in Katowice. More and more countries hope to reach a consensus on politics and govern the environment by political means. Indeed, environmental issues require a rapid political response in which government commitment and behavior are critical, because a good government will enact appropriate laws to protect the environment, and promote a harmonious relationship between economic development and environmental performance (Stern, 2008; Mavisakalyan and Tarverdi, 2018). Corruption involves the actions of national public officials and represents the quality of institutions, which means that corruption can have an impact on environmental performance from a political perspective (Chimeli and Braden, 2005; Leitao, 2010). The present paper seeks to re-examine the effects of corruption on environmental performance. More importantly, we aim to explore whether spatial dependence plays a key role in it.====Some scholars have explained theoretically that corruption has a negative impact on environmental quality through several channels. For instance, (i) a corrupt government will allow companies to over-exploit natural resources, leading to depletion of resources; (ii) corruption will make the government accept bribes, go against the management of local industrial production, and cause a large amount of industrial pollution; (iii) corruption will delay the introduction of environmental governance policies by the country, and the funds for environmental governance will flow into the pockets of individuals. Therefore, corruption will worsen environmental performance (Lisciandra and Migliardo, 2017). Empirically, an increasing body of literature also shows similar conclusions by utilizing cross-sectional or panel data, both considering the direct and indirect effects of corruption, such as Welsch (2004); Morse (2006), and Cole (2007).====Although the impact of corruption on environmental quality has been proved in both theory and empirical evidence, there are some inadequacies in the current literature that require further study. First, the existing literature mostly measures environmental quality with a single pollutant emission, such as CO==== and SO==== (Leitao, 2010; Biswas et al., 2012; Kasuga and Takaya, 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Although CO==== and SO==== emissions can undoubtedly represent environmental quality to some extent, they do not accurately reflect the level of the environmental performance (Al-Mulali and Ozturk, 2015). More importantly, changes in one certain pollutant emission may simply reflect changes in the composition of the pollutants, and this may imply that a reduction in one emission may involve an increase in another (Arrow et al., 1995). Therefore, more comprehensive environmental indicators are needed to re-examine this relationship. In this paper, we utilize a comprehensive environmental quality index, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which was proposed by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). This EPI calculates different pollutant emission indicators. Meanwhile, it also tests the effectiveness of national environmental policies and the impact of these policies on human health and environmental degradation. Compared with single pollutant emissions, it can reflect the environmental quality of a country more comprehensively.====Second, regarding empirical methods, spatial dependence is ignored by most scholars. Spatial dependence means that the variables observed by an individual depend on the observations of other neighboring individuals. Importantly, spatial dependence should be considered in studying the impact of corruption on environmental performance. On the one hand, some environment variables have spatial dependence (Miller et al., 2007). A sizable literature argues that there exists a spatial spillover effect on the emission of some polluting gases (Maddison, 2006; Meng et al., 2017; You and Lv, 2018), which means using traditional panel models to examine environmental issues may yield inaccurate results or biased estimations. On the other hand, a country’s corruption mechanism can serve as a reference and guide for illegal activities in neighboring countries (Seldadyo et al., 2010). To put it differently, there is spatial contagion between own corruption and neighboring corruption (Attila, 2008; Goel and Saunoris, 2014). Consequently, being a neighbor of a corrupt country may have negative impacts on the country’s corruption, economic development, and other aspects, as well as posing a great threat to environmental governance, thus reducing the environmental quality. These are the indirect effects of corruption on environmental performance in the spatial panel theory model that fail to be taken into account in the existing literature.====This paper aims to address these shortcomings. To that end, we apply the spatial panel method to re-examine the impact of corruption on environmental performance and draw a more comprehensive conclusion. Our study makes two contributions to the literature. First, as mentioned above, instead of choosing individual pollution indicators such as CO==== and SO====, we utilize the EPI, which is a recent composite and comprehensive index of environmental quality. Second, to the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first to adopt the spatial panel model to explore the influence of corruption on environmental performance. It is noteworthy that there are many spatial panel models in the literature and we use multiple tests to detect spatial dependence and select the appropriate spatial model. Moreover, we incorporate additional control variables that have been proven to influence environmental performance. By doing this, we can minimize omitted variable bias and ensure the accuracy of the results.====The remaining parts of this paper are structured as follows. The next section briefly reviews the existing literature on the effect of corruption on environmental performance and spatial econometrics in environmental performance. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical methodology, and Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 reports the robustness test. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and offer some policy implications.",The effect of corruption on environmental performance: Does spatial dependence play a role?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362520300807,29 April 2021,2021,Research Article,82.0

However, research has remained limited for developing countries despite their similar use of fiscal policy and concerns about the efficiency of public spending. To help address this research gap, this paper provides a case study of multiplier effects of local government spending in regions in the Philippines as well as spillover effects of local government spending across regions. An instrumental variable based on the country’s intergovernmental transfer system is used to identify regional public spending in panel regressions. The local fiscal multiplier is estimated to be above one, where a 1-peso rise in spending by local government units in a region corresponds to a 1.2-peso rise in regional output. Multiplier effects are highest for capital expenditures and appear to be primarily driven by the services sector. Spillover effects are comparatively large, at around 1.8–2.0, highlighting the important role of domestic trade when stimulating regional economic activity.","Research focusing on local fiscal multipliers has expanded since the Great Recession, when a great debate emerged on whether government spending could pull economies from a downturn (e.g., Clemens and Miran, 2012; Shoag, 2013; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Acconcia et al., 2014; Serrato and Wingender, 2016). Sub-national estimation of the impact of fiscal policy on output growth holds certain advantages over national estimation of multipliers, as sub-national panel data typically increase the number of observations, offer a richer source of exogenous variations, and raise the probability of finding stronger instruments to identify government spending.====While some studies have pursued this type of research for developed countries, only few have done so for developing ones. The exceptions are the papers by Guo et al. (2016) and Corbi et al. (2019) focusing on local fiscal multipliers based on counties in China and municipal governments in Brazil, respectively. It is no doubt worthwhile to address the issue, as a fuller understanding of the impact of fiscal policy on output growth matters as much for developing countries as for developed ones.====To counter the effect of the global financial crisis (GFC), for instance, developing countries also launched substantial fiscal stimulus packages in the late 2000s, even though there had been little theoretical or empirical assurance that such strategies would work. More recently, developing countries have been scaling up their public investment in infrastructure to support both short- and long-run economic growth, but concerns remain that the macroeconomic impact may fall short of expectations, especially in lower-income economies (Presbitero, 2016). Larger infrastructure shortfalls imply greater marginal productivity of infrastructure investment in less developed countries, but such places also tend to have poorer absorptive capacity, a limited supply of complementary factors (such as human and private capital), and weaker investment efficiency (Abiad et al., 2018).====The use of sub-national panel data opens a rare window for analysing the impact of public spending on the private sector in developing countries, which typically do not have aggregate datasets that are long enough or contain the desired amount of independent variation to meet the standards of time series methods typically used to estimate fiscal multipliers. Focusing on the sub-national level allows examining the conditions that help boost local economic activity and, hopefully, ultimately at an aggregate level, especially when the national government takes an expansionary fiscal stance.====However, while local fiscal multipliers are based on a cleaner identification strategy for public spending, they only provide a partial view of what aggregate fiscal multipliers might be. As Ramey (2011) and others point out, sub-national fiscal multipliers only measure the ==== effects of fiscal policy, which may or may not be directly related to the national multiplier.==== To explore the link, it becomes almost necessary to investigate spillover effects of sub-national government spending regarding their size as well as their direction.====A failure to account for spillovers of local public spending on regions that did not receive a fiscal stimulus would naturally bias the computation of the aggregate fiscal multiplier (Acconcia et al., 2014; Dupor and Guerrero, 2017; Chodorow-Reich, 2019). Such effects may reflect spending leakage and expenditure switching as the fiscal stimulus raises the demand for goods from other regions, generating positive spillovers, or a relocation of factors to the region receiving the fiscal stimulus, generating negative spillovers.====However, despite their importance in understanding potential inconsistencies between sub-national and national multipliers, there is an even bigger shortage of quantitative research on fiscal spending spillovers. The literature remains sparse even for developed countries, and is almost nil for developing countries. In the few existing papers, spillovers are typically found to be insignificant (Bruckner and Tuladhar, 2013; Acconcia et al., 2014; Serrato and Wingender, 2016; Corbi et al., 2019). Dupor and Guerrero (2017) argue that since estimated spillover effects across US states are small (i.e., public spending in one state does not significantly influence economic activity in other states), local fiscal multipliers may be reliable indicators of the fiscal policy’s aggregate or nationwide effect.====For Asia, there are surprisingly few papers even on national government spending multipliers. One would expect a stronger debate on the efficacy of fiscal policy given the available information (or lack thereof). While the anecdotal evidence (fast recovery of the region after the GFC) suggests that fiscal measures are highly effective, more rigorous investigations reveal otherwise. Using a small open economy structural vector autoregression (VAR) model, Tang et al. (2013) find that government spending in ASEAN countries generally had weak and insignificant effects on domestic output. Using a structural VAR with sign restrictions, Jha et al. (2014) make similar observations for a broader group of Asian economies, noting that government spending shocks seem to have only a limited effect on the gross domestic product (GDP).====Among developing Asian economies, the Philippines appears to be a marginally better candidate for countercyclical public spending policy than its neighbors based on the existing research. Like other countries in Asia, the Philippines also launched a fiscal stimulus package in response to the slowdown of world trading partners in the late 2000s. This package totaled about ₱330 billion (roughly 4.5 % of GDP), including both public spending increases and tax cuts, with at least a third of the amount funneled to infrastructure projects. Tang et al. (2013) estimate an impact multiplier from a spending shock of about 0.3 for the Philippines, in contrast to very low and even negative multipliers for other ASEAN countries. Jha et al. (2014) also find a positive and significant short-term impact of a spending shock on output in the country, but not for many other Asian economies where the effect tends to be very weak and even negative. Using a macro-econometric model, Ducanes et al. (2006) report a Philippine short-term multiplier of 0.3, which in their simulations rises to 0.7 if the spending is directed to capital expenditures.====Against this background, the aim of the present paper is to extend the scarce literature on the impact of government spending on economic output in developing countries. The originality of the research comes from examining the impact of fiscal policy on output, both regarding direct and indirect effects, at a sub-national level.====The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it estimates the sub-national multiplier for a developing country where the available research indicates relative efficacy of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Second, it successfully applies an instrumental variable (IV) based on the system of national transfers, a technique made possible by the recent availability of a more reliable local government finance dataset. This allows for a different approach to assess the impact of government spending, as current estimates are mostly derived from structural VARs. VAR-based studies are useful in that they capture the dynamics of the variables and summarize the effects of fiscal policy, but they require numerous observations to generate reliable estimates and tend to be weakened by endogeneity concerns. Finally, the paper fills a wide research gap by estimating fiscal spillovers in a developing country, providing vital information needed to understand the relationship between local and aggregate fiscal multiplier estimates.====The IV panel regressions offer valuable insights regarding local fiscal multipliers in the Philippines. The main estimate lies within the range found in the related literature, at 1.2 versus 1.5 on average, though existing computations mostly pertain to developed countries. The observed response in Philippine regions seems to be mainly driven by the non-tradable services sector. The impact on output tends to be strongest for capital spending, followed by economic services, and, to a lesser extent, general public services.====The focus on fiscal spillovers across Philippine regions based on domestic trade patterns also provides some interesting insights regarding the impact of local government spending on economic performance. The estimated spillover effect, at around 1.8–2.0, is larger than that measured for other countries, though the available literature is scant. It is also conspicuously larger than the direct local fiscal multiplier. A positive spillover effect suggests that the national fiscal multiplier for the country should be higher than implied by existing empirical work. This calls for further research on both national and sub-national multipliers derived from an integrated framework (e.g., using the same dataset and identification strategy) to better explain the inconsistency.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the institutional background by describing the country’s intergovernmental fiscal system and the nature of local budgeting and planning and local government financial reporting. Section 3 details the empirical strategy for identifying local government spending and estimating regional fiscal multipliers and spillovers. Section 4 provides a summary of the data used in the estimations, while Section 5 discusses the results.

In the context of potential budget constraints (e.g., large debt), the incumbent might consider alternative means. Tax collection performance could be one such means that is prone to incumbents’ electoral manipulation, particularly in transition countries with a weak institutional framework. Investigating Albania, we show that fiscal performance, measured by monthly tax revenues, is poor before elections, especially in elections that result in political change. Before all elections, we observe a reduction in ==== ranging from 3.2 percentage points in the twelve months before elections to 4.0 percentage points in the six months before elections. This implies a drop of more than half in fiscal performance compared with its long-term “natural” or average rate. Moreover, the deterioration in performance is considerably larger, by two- to threefold, before “change elections” (i.e. elections that result in a change of the governing party). After these elections, fiscal performance improves. The key to reducing deterioration in fiscal performance associated with elections is to establish rules and institutional oversight (independent or bipartisan) that reduce the discretion of tax authorities.","A large body of research examines the use of fiscal and monetary instruments by incumbent governments to improve macroeconomic conditions before elections. In the political economy literature, following the seminal paper by Nordhaus (1975), this perspective is commonly referred to as the “political business cycle” (PBC). Governments may behave opportunistically and potentially inefficiently before elections, engaging in expansionary economic policies to increase output and decrease unemployment in order to gain approval from voters.====Tufte (1978) was the first to address the question of instruments that the government can employ to generate economic expansion before elections. If patterns actually exist, they can be found in the instruments of economic policy, which are by definition more directly controllable than economic policy outcomes. Empirical tests of the PBC with instruments are much more persuasive, so nowadays tests related to outcomes are scarce (Dubois, 2016). Governments can use fiscal policies/instruments (within their domain) or monetary ones (depending on a number of factors, most notably the independence of the central bank). In this paper, we focus on fiscal policies—specifically, on fiscal performance in conjunction with elections.====Many studies empirically show electorally driven manipulation of the main fiscal policy instruments (i.e., public expenditure, budget balance). The occurrence and strength of the manipulation of fiscal policy for electoral purposes is conditioned by the level of development, institutional quality, age and level of democracy, electoral rules and form of government, transparency of the political process, the presence of checks and balances, and fiscal rules (De Haan and Klomp, 2013). Stronger political business cycles are observed in developing or transition countries with immature democracies.==== Shi and Svensson (2006) suggest that institutional indicators (i.e., government corruption, rent-seeking activities, and access to free media) can explain a majority of the differences in the size of policy cycles between developed and developing countries. Whereas Alt and Lassen (2006) show the relevance of transparency, Brender and Drazen (2005) also emphasize the voters’ lack of knowledge about the existence of political fiscal cycles in developing or transition countries and the lack of institutional mechanisms to constrain discretionary expenditure policies and strengthen fiscal control, which can result in opportunistic policy making around elections (Schuknecht, 2000).====In the context of potential budget constraints (e.g., high debt), the incumbent might consider alternative strategies. Tax collection performance could be one area that is prone to electoral manipulation by incumbents, particularly in transition countries (e.g., Albania) with weak institutional frameworks. Shifting to a more relaxed attitude regarding tax effectiveness (i.e., tax collection and control) before elections than is usually the case could be both an effective way of creating economic stimulus and pleasing businesses with less interference and more tolerance from a benevolent government while, at the same time, remaining relatively beyond the scrutiny of the typical voter. Other factors, such as potentially higher corruption before elections, could also contribute to higher fiscal evasion before elections. In a context of high corruption and impunity and because of lack of effective oversight, government corruption could increase before elections (Libman et al., 2012; Sidorkin and Vorobyev, 2018). After the election, tighter fiscal control might be reasserted by the incumbent, putting a halt to further fiscal evasion, enabling an improvement in fiscal performance.====The question that naturally arises is: what mechanism is at play that explains election-related fiscal performance cycles? Tax evasion can be associated with or caused by reduced auditing by tax authorities. Young et al. (2001) find that, in the US, Internal Revenue Service audits are adjusted in conjunction with elections and are less intense in electorally sensitive districts. Firms can respond to looser monitoring by immediately underreporting actual sales, as suggested by Skouras and Christodoulakis (2014) in Greece. Libman et al. (2012) show that, in Russia, regional governors use tax audit controls to extract private rents, rather than revenue for the regional budget used in public goods provision. Whereas Lami and Imami (2019) show a significant deterioration of value-added tax (VAT) collection performance before elections in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the magnitude of deterioration is higher in countries with a shorter history of democracy.====In the light of these arguments, we analyze fiscal performance in conjunction with elections in Albania. Albania is a country that is prone to political budget cycles. Previous research on Albania found evidence of election-related influence on fiscal policy instruments, manifested by significant fiscal expansion (Imami and Lami, 2006), as well as a significant increase in privatization income before elections (Lami et al., 2016). In this paper, we cannot reach a conclusion about the extent to which incumbent fiscal performance/enforcement behavior is driven by classical PBC motivations (e.g., stimulating the economy to please voters directly) or by corruption, which can increase before elections. Indeed, both motivations could coexist in creating an electorally induced cycle.====However, we can elaborate on the election cycle effects of the expectations of the results of elections by the governing party and/or government officials. On the one hand, if the incumbent party anticipates a strong possibility of losing office, it might engage in more aggressive PBC behavior by relaxing its discretionary tax collection efforts (lowering tax collection has an effect on stimulating economic activity similar to that of lowering tax rates). On the other hand, if government officials, particularly those related to the governing party, anticipate a change in political control, and a consequent oversight vacuum, they might engage more easily in corrupt practices resulting in lower tax collection. These alternatives, of course, are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, in this paper, we distinguish between the election cycle effects associated with a change in the party in office and re-election of the incumbent power holders. The paper makes an additional contribution to the PBC literature by investigating the election-related influences on fiscal performance (i.e., tax collection before and after elections) in a transition economy.====We analyze monthly fiscal data on the main tax revenue (a time series with 246 observations covering five regular parliamentary elections). Using monthly data is in line with the best practices in this field of research, allowing for the inclusion of any election effects that span more than one year. Empirical analysis based on annual data has serious drawbacks in many studies analyzing PBCs. The analysis of annual data often cannot capture the dynamics, especially when elections fall in the middle of the (fiscal) year (as in Albania). Streb ; et al;. (2012) argue that the failure of many studies to show econometrically significant opportunistic PBCs is due to their reliance on annual data. They conclude that results drawn from annual data strongly underestimate the presence of political budgetary cycles. Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya (2004) report similar findings for Russia. Indeed, our findings clearly show a strong difference in fiscal performance during the quarters before and after an election, robust to an alternative statistical setting, but that could not be clearly captured when the econometric analysis was replicated on annually collapsed data.====In the next section, we elaborate the background of the research by providing insights into the fiscal system in Albania and elections. In sections three and four, respectively, we elaborate the methodology of our study and explain our procedures for robustness checking. In section five we discuss the results. Section 6 concludes by highlighting the main results and outlining their policy implications.",Fiscal performance and elections in the context of a transition economy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362521000340,27 April 2021,2021,Research Article,84.0

Our aim is to investigate the role of financial sector development when it comes to the size of the underground economy, as well as how financial development aids in meeting the growth objectives of the ‘Europe 2020 Strategy’. Panel data analysis will be conducted for the period 2004–2017 in order to examine the effects of financial sector development on the size of the underground economy. The main findings of this paper suggest that financial development has a significantly reducing effect on the size of the underground economy. In conclusion, development within the financial sector significantly lessens underground economic activity in the European Union. With further development of the financial sector, underground economies will not be an obstacle for the fulfilment of the cohesion and growth objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.","The underground economy is an important concern with a prominent place in the literature. Even though many countries have taken actions to prevent unofficial activities, their increasing size is an inevitable fact. Recently, estimates of the size of the underground economy on average ranged from 28 to 43 % of GDP in developing countries, 38–40% of GDP in transaction countries, and 14–17% of GDP in developed countries (see Schneider, 2007). A considerable number of studies have examined the role of the underground economy and found that there are significant interactions of informality with the economic aggregates (Williams and Round, 2009).====However, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term ==== (Schneider, 2019; Koufopoulou et al., 2019; Schneider and Buehn, 2018; Williams, 2011, 2010; Öğünç and Yılmaz, 2000). The underground economy is the sum of all legal and illegal actions that have not been reported to the government. It includes illegal activities as well as economic transactions that are not measured by government statistics. There are many distinct definitions for the underground economy, and Smith (1994) gave an exhaustive definition as the total sum of the market basket of products and services, whether legal or illegal, which have not been added to the yearly registered GDP of a specific country. The underground economy has both positive and negative effects. One of its most significant positive effects as stated by Schneider and Enste (2000) is that two-thirds of the income generated from the underground is directly spent on the official economy. On the other hand, Capasso and Jappelli (2013) pointed out that a large portion of the underground economy causes a distortion in investment and a lack of development in addition to ethical and political concerns. It also results in unreliable macroeconomic variables that may cause ineffective policymaking. Informal firms set competitive price advantages over official firms. Avoiding social security contributions causes the financial positioning of social security institutions to deteriorate, and avoiding tax obligations causes a decline in the financial positioning of government budgets. The effects of the underground economy have also been discussed by many scholars (Elgin and Erturk, 2019; Schneider, 2006, 2009; Dabla-Norris et al., 2008; Maurin et al., 2006; Öğünç and Yılmaz, 2000). The main reasons to go underground can be summarized as being due to the burdens of taxation, regulations, and labor costs.====The development of the financial market and the banking sector, and the availability of credit and its cost have not received much attention. The financial sector is one of the foundations that are likely to influence the relative costs and benefits of operating the underground economy, which, in turn, impacts its size (Njangang, 2018; Berdiev and Saunoris, 2016; Capasso and Jappelli, 2013; Blackburn et al., 2012; Bose et al., 2012; Dabla-Norris et al., 2008; Straub, 2005). The financial sector enhances the efficient intermediaries entering the markets, reduces credit costs, and increases the opportunity cost of continuing to operate in the underground (see Capasso and Jappelli, 2013). Within the economy, the financial sector serves critical functions such as providing access to credit and monitoring business transactions for tax obligations, while financial development reduces informal work by increasing the opportunity cost of operating underground activities by providing access to credit (Capasso and Jappelli, 2013; Blackburn et al., 2012). Jappelli et al. (2005) stated that financial development reduces credit costs and the incentive to operate informally while increasing the revenue from high-tech projects. In their study, a technical model was proposed between agents choosing low-return technology that does not entail a plan versus agents choosing high-return technology that entails external funding. High-return technology agents need to pledge more collateral in the case of external funding to reduce credit costs.====The opportunity cost of operating the underground economy is increasing due to higher credit costs in the informal system. Financial development lessens the cost of credit and boosts the opportunity cost of operating underground, as shown in some of the literature. Straub (2005) built a model in which firms choose between the official and unofficial economies. Firms that choose the formal economy have to be registered, which exposes them to high entry costs. In addition, they have to declare their certifiable income and assets, which gives them access to credit markets, as well as the advantages of key public goods and the enforcement of property rights and contracts. It also lowers default and financial costs. Antunes and Cavalcanti (2007) investigated the formal versus the informal sector; engagement in the formal sector exposes a company’s higher entry costs, regulations and tax obligations, with the trade-offs of better outside financing against the higher financial costs of the informal sector. Ellul et al. (2012) pointed out that transparent firms can access cheaper financing but also have heavier tax obligations. They studied this trade-off in a model via the deadweight loss of taxation and the endogenous rationing of exterior finance. La Porta and Shleifer (2008) stated that unofficial firms avoid tax payments and regulations, but lose access to public goods and other authorized advantages, such as exterior finance. The main conclusion is that there is a negative correlation between private credit availability and an individual’s subjective assessment of their access to credit. Bose et al. (2012) stated that development in the banking sector is associated with a smaller underground economy by evaluating the effect of both the depth and efficiency of the banking system on the underground economy. Berdiev and Saunoris (2016) found evidence that financial development shrinks the shadow economy and shocks to the shadow economy prevent financial development.====The interaction between trade openness and the size of the underground economy is another interesting link, despite the fact that it hasn’t received too much attention either. The correlation between trade openness and the size of the underground economy is ambiguous. Trade reforms expose corporations to increasing foreign competition, and, in response, some corporations reduce their labor force costs by cutting employee benefits, for example by using part-time instead of full-time labor to reduce social security payments, and therefore trade liberalization boosts the informal economy (Fugazza and Fiess, 2010; Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2003). Furthermore, many studies found that trade openness increases the scale of informal employment, as does the underground economy (see Ghosh and Paul, 2008). On the other hand, Elgin and Oyvat (2013) stated that trade openness may have either a positive or a negative correlation with the underground economy; a positive correlation is expected when openness facilitates the external subordination of the informal to the formal sector, while a negative one is likely to occur if openness in international trade eases the government’s ability to examine informal production.====This study is based on the links that very rarely get attention from researchers. We will analyze the link of the underground economy with several macroeconomic aggregates for the case of European Union countries, emphasizing the direct effect of financial development and trade openness on the size of the underground economy with a set of control variables. This research is the first of its kind to link both financial sector development and trade openness with the size of the underground economy to observe how financial systems and trade openness may assist in meeting growth objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy.====The selection of the EU countries in this study is interesting for this topic for several reasons. The EU has initiated the Europe 2020 Strategy, which is an agenda for growth and development in EU countries emphasizing sustainable development, competitiveness, and productivity in the economic sectors of the member states. This strategy also provides a roadmap for eliminating weaknesses in the sectors of member states (====, 2017). On the other hand, Tudose and Clipa (2016) point out that shadow economies might be an obstacle for the fulfilment of the cohesion and growth objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Therefore it would be quite interesting to observe how financial systems, as well as trade, successfully attempt to reduce the size of the underground economy in order to meet the Europe 2020 strategy.====This study proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the theoretical settings; Section 3 describes the data and methodology; Section 4 presents the empirical results and discussions; and Section 5 concludes and discusses policy implications.",The role of financial development on the underground economy in regards to Europe’s 2020 strategy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362520300753,31 March 2021,2021,Research Article,86.0

Understanding and analyzing this unique case is a big challenge to economists.====Dollarization started during the 1975–1989 Lebanese civil war, which witnessed recurring depreciation episodes, leading to a generalized loss of confidence in the local currency. At present, Lebanese banks hold dollar deposits and provide dollar loans to their resident customers, alongside local currency deposits and loans. The deposit dollarization ratio was 71.25 % and the loan dollarization ratio was 67.65 % at the end of 2017. Lebanon’s exchange rate regime is classified as a “stabilized arrangement” in the IMF AREAER==== for 2017. The exchange rate of the US dollar (USD) has been fixed since December 1997 at the mid rate of 1507.5 Lebanese Pounds (LBP), thanks to daily interventions of Banque du Liban (BdL, Lebanon’s central bank) in the domestic interbank foreign exchange market. Since the adoption of the de facto fixed exchange rate regime, the country did not experience episodes of high inflation, as was the case during and after the civil war. In the period 2002–2017, the average annual real GDP growth rate was 4 %, and the average annual inflation rate was 3.3 %.==== Gross public debt is high (154 % of GDP at 2017 end), and the country suffers a chronic current account deficit (23.5 % of GDP in 2017) due to the weakness of its export sector.====In this paper, we aim to analyze the Lebanese case in light of the findings of the literature on dollarization and emerging market exchange rate regimes. We shed light on the specificity of the Lebanese case, namely the high level of foreign currency liquidity in the hands of the banking system due to the abundant capital inflows in the last three decades, the high levels of gross international reserves contrasting with low and sometimes negative levels of net international reserves of the central bank (Lebanon’s central bank borrows foreign liquidity, in the form of domestic banks’ dollar deposits), and the monetary “freezing” mechanism (the transformation of banks’ sight deposits into term deposits) that helped containing inflation, alongside the strong nominal anchor of the fixed exchange rate.====In the course of our analysis, we compute the fiscal cost of holding net and borrowed international reserves by Lebanon’s central bank. We explain the main motives behind the choice of the de facto fixed exchange rate regime – dollarization, small size of the export sector, institutional weakness and corruption. We also analyze the nominal and real interest rate implications of Lebanon’s fixed exchange rate regime. Finally, we analyze the implications of dollarization on the design of foreign currency macroprudential regulations, and discuss ways of promoting de-dollarization and preparing the move to a floating exchange rate regime in Lebanon.====This paper is a thorough documentation of the rarely analyzed and unique Lebanese case of dollarization. Desquilbet (2007) is the only published paper we are aware of that conducts a thorough analysis of Lebanon’s monetary policy. Moreover, it contributes to the literature on sterilization by suggesting a synthetic classification of sterilization techniques into three categories: countering the increase of the money base; increasing the mandatory deposit rate; and “freezing” the money base. It also contributes to the analytical literature on the cost of international reserves by computing the cost of net international reserves (both sterilized and unsterilized interventions) and borrowed international reserves, while the past literature – as summarized, for example, by Adler and Mano (2018) – has only taken into account the cost of sterilized net international reserves (i.e., the difference between the return on the domestic assets the central bank disposes of in the sterilization process, and the return on the foreign liquid assets the central bank holds as a result of its intervention). Another important contribution of this paper is the introduction of the monetary “freezing” mechanism that can apply to banks’ client deposits (i.e., the transformation of sight deposits into term deposits) or to the money base (i.e., the transformation of banks’ excess reserves into term deposits at the central bank).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we analyze Lebanon’s stylized facts. In the third section, we suggest a classification of sterilization techniques and conduct an analysis of the fiscal cost of gross and net international reserves. The fourth section is dedicated to the analysis of Lebanon’s monetary and exchange rate policy in the last two decades.

Unlike most cited research, the results provide evidence that favors crowd-in effect both at the aggregate employment level and across sectors. A main contribution of the paper is to empirically explore the underlying mechanisms that drive the results. They include positive public employment effect on local demand, lack of public wage premium, as well as no effect on private wages. It turns out that an increase in the local labor force participation is a driving factor for the latter channel. Interestingly, the increase in labor force participation exceeds that of public and private employment, leading to an increase in the number of job seekers.","The impact of expanding public employment in local labor market has recently attracted growing attention among economists (see for example Faggio and Overman, 2012 and Jofre-Monseny et al., 2020). This is simply because public sector generates employment for a large segment of workers. For example, the share of public employment, in OECD countries, is about 21 % of the total work force.==== The share also rises in many developing countries, like Iran, Egypt, South Africa and several other MENA countries.==== In addition, governments often utilize public employment to combat negative economic shocks or to reduce regional inequality (Alesina et al., 2000).====So far, the empirical literature, mostly covering developed economies,==== show mixed conclusions, differing by country, type of industries, and duration of the analysis, reflecting short run versus long run effect. Faggio and Overman (2012) use long-run differences from British data and provide evidence that is consistent with their theoretical prediction.==== In particular, they show that expanding public employment crowds in (out) jobs in the non-tradable (tradable) sector in the short run. They show that a crowd-out effect prevails in the long run (see also Senftleben-König, 2014; Ranzani and Tuccio, 2017). On the other hand, (Jofre-Monseny et al., 2020) use data from Spanish cities and find that increases in public employment crowd in private employment in the long run.====This paper investigates the short run effect of creating more public jobs on private employment in the occupied West Bank of Palestine during the Second Intifada period (between September 2000 and December 2004).The paper adds several contributions to the literature. First, it re-visits the linkages between public and private employment in a context of developing economy that faces ill economic conditions.====As violence intensified during this period, Israel imposed severe mobility restrictions on goods and labor, distorting market linkages across West Bank’s districts (See Cali and Miaari, 2018). Israel also revoke work permits for a large section of Palestinian commuters, reducing their share, relative to total Palestinian work force, from 0.26 in 2000 to about 0.11 by the end of 2004.==== During this period, unemployment rate rose from 0.12 to 0.23.==== Luckily for the Palestinian economy, these negative shocks did not impact public employment, partly due to the flow of international donation that kept feeding government budget (Sarsour and Atallah 2011). In fact, public employment expanded by 18 %, rising from 55,000 employee at the eve of the Second Intifada. This increase is largely accounted for by employing security personnel. The soaring unemployment as well as the expansion in public employment raised the share of public employment in the West Bank, relative to all waged workers, from 0.19 to 0.31 by the end of 2004. The same conclusion also holds when considering the trend for most districts (see Fig. 1).====Undoubtedly, the environment governing the Palestinian economy, mainly during the Second Intifada, is unique due to the constraints imposed by the Israeli occupation.==== Still, such an environment can be utilized as a simulation to examine how excess labor supply shapes the linkages between public and private employment.====The other contribution of the paper is that it empirically explores the channels of the effects of public employment. So far, the literature has paid little attention to this issue. One exception is Algan et al. (2002) who show that increases in public jobs crowd out private employment in countries with greater public substitutability between public and private sectors.==== Their findings mostly fit cross country analyses but may not be useful in explaining how increases in public employment influence local labor markets.==== Senftleben-König (2014) empirically shows that the increase in wages possibly explains the crowd-out effect in the German tradable sector. Nonetheless, he provides no explanation of why public employment has no employment effect on the non-tradable sector, even though creating additional public employment increases wages in this sector.====(Jofre-Monseny et al., 2020) set up a simulation model to explain how expanding public employment crowds in private employment in the long run. Consistent with Fagio and Overman (2014), the model predicts that creating additional public employment increases local demand for the non-tradable sector. It also predicts that household mobility limits the positive impact of local public employment on local wages. These two factors cause private employment in the non-tradable sector to increase. Nonetheless, the effect on tradable employment remains small as local demand for this sector is unaffected. This paper differs from (Jofre-Monseny et al., 2020) on two fronts. Firstly, it empirically tests the mechanisms driving the crowd-in effect. It also explores other labor market mechanisms, including public wage premium as well as linkages between wages in private sector and expansion of labor force participation.====This paper is also the first to explain how a local labor market responds to changes in public employment in an aid-based economy. Unlike countries where expanding the public sector is financed via tax increases, the Palestinian public wage bill is largely financed by international cash grants. As explained below, this may generate different mechanisms through which expanding public employment affects jobs in the private sector. In this context, the outcome of this research helps understand the local economic effects of international aid in the short run.====Drawing on district-quarter pooled data, the study shows that expanding public employment crowds in private employment. Specifically, the OLS estimates indicate that increasing public employment by an additional 100 jobs increases private employment by71 jobs. The study also considers the endogeneity concern due to the fact that the PA utilizes public employment to curb rising local unemployment and/or as a response to population growth. To address these issues, I use an instrument that utilizes district's initial share of public employment to redistribute the overall increases in public employment across districts. The IV estimates confirm the OLS findings, though the magnitude of the effect is smaller, crowding in private employment by52 jobs. Consistent with the related studies, the paper examines the impact of increasing public employment on non-tradable versus tradable sectors. The findings, using OLS and IV models, show that expanding public employment increases jobs in both sectors. Still, the magnitude of the effect is disproportionately concentrated in the non-tradable sector.====The positive impact of expanding public employment on overall private jobs and across sectors is at odds with most of existing literature. The question then becomes what are the mechanisms that support this finding? To seek answers, I firstly explore whether income generated from expanding public employment increases demand for goods and services (Faggio and Overman, 2012).To test this theoretical prediction, I estimate a model that links the expansion of local public employment with a change in the number of local entrepreneurs (employers and self-employed).The latter is utilized as a proxy for changes in local demand, which can be manifested either by expanding existing firms and/or inducing more entrepreneurs to join the market. The results, using OLS and IV models, show that the number of entrepreneurs increases both at the overall level and across tradable and non-tradable sector.====Second, I explore the impact of expanding public employment on private wages. The OLS and IV results report a negative estimate but statistically insignificant. This indicates that the offsetting wage effect seems to play little role and that the positive shift of labor supply is possibly a driving factor. In other words, it is likely that in a period with ill economic conditions and excess labor supply, the increase in overall employment (public and private) enhances the probability of employment and therefore induces more individuals to join the labor market. Noticeably, the increase in labor supply exceeds that of private employment, leading to an increase in the number of job seekers(a higher level of unemployment).====Following Algan et al. (2002), the paper also examines other channels of the public employment effect, focusing on the impact of public wage premium. They suggest that higher public wages would increase returns to seeking public employment, attracting workers out of the private sector (see also Edin and Holmlund, 1997). The paper suggests that the limited capacity of the PA to absorb excess labor supply neutralizes this effect. Evidently, the empirical results show that districts’ changes in private employment are independent of changes in public wages.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The second section explores a number of theoretical arguments regarding the relationship between public and private employment. Section three and four discuss the empirical models and the results, respectively. Section five provides evidence on the channels that explain the public employment effect.

Our study investigates the impact of FDI spillovers on productivity during the global financial crisis (2006–2014) and the accompanying credit shortage. A dynamic panel analysis of firm-level data from two neighbouring but distinct transition economies, Croatia and Slovenia, reveals that the impact of the crisis may go as far as halting the process of learning through spillovers if firms have difficulties in accessing external funds. The implications of the study may prove particularly beneficial to policy makers grappling with the economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Foreign direct investment (FDI) in transition economies (TEs) has increased significantly over the past three decades. In addition, FDI has gradually shifted towards the services sector, which now accounts for over two-thirds of world FDI, and 70 % of FDI in TEs (UNCTAD, 2017). In advanced economies, FDI is viewed as a potential driver of change and development, and the view applies equally to TEs. Entering transition with outdated capital stock and inefficient production structures, these countries believed that FDI would facilitate the modernisation of their production technology and enhance the transfer of skills and expertise. While the evidence on the effects of FDI on firm entry, growth, and productivity in TEs is ambiguous (Stojcic and Orlic, 2020), it continues as a dominant catching-up strategy in these countries. This was particularly evident during the economic crisis of 2008–2009 and, more recently, in the context of the current crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.====This study aims to estimate the effects of FDI spillovers on the productivity of domestic firms in the manufacturing and services sectors of two TEs, Croatia and Slovenia, that constitute a particularly interesting case study. Sharing much of their 20th century history, these neighbouring countries ended the socialist system at the same time, with the expectation of being among the forerunners of transition (Lavigne, 1999). However, their paths diverged, with Slovenia joining the process of regional and European integrations earlier and more quickly than Croatia, which, three decades later, is reflected in their different economic performance (Stojcic et al., 2018). However, due to a somewhat conservative approach towards foreign investors in Slovenia, and the late engagement in economic integrations in Croatia, FDI inflows in both countries have been more modest than in other Central and East European (CEE) TEs. Empirical studies have analysed the effects of FDI in these countries within groups including other TEs (e.g. Stojcic and Orlic, 2020); however, individual country analyses that could reveal the distinct nature of country-level FDI effects have been rare and mostly limited to the early transition period and the manufacturing sector only.====Our study aims to analyse the effects of FDI spillovers on domestic firms’ productivity in Croatia and Slovenia during the 2006–2014 period. These countries have been investigated to a less extent in the context of FDI spillovers than other economies. We analyse these effects in manufacturing and services, separately, as the nature of the knowledge and production process differs in the two sectors. Our main research question asks whether the financial crisis reversed the trend in the spillovers, and what the role was of access to bank finance by firms in this process. We hypothesise that a reversal might indeed have occurred, given the stringent bank policies and limited external funding that was available during and after the financial crisis. We argue that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and those facing high competition could be in particular danger, as their revenues are more severely affected during macroeconomic downturns (OECD, 2020).====Therefore, the study contributes to the existing literature in at least three ways. First, the study focuses on less FDI-intensive countries, where the effects of foreign investment are less clear than in other TEs. Second, the study sheds more light on the differences between spillovers in manufacturing and services. While FDI spillovers in manufacturing have been investigated before (Javorcik, 2004; Resmini and Nicolini, 2007; Jordaan, 2008; Ferragina and Mazzotta, 2014), only a few authors have investigated FDI spillovers in services (Gorodnichenko et al., 2014; Stojcic and Orlic, 2020). Third, the study addresses the impact of the global financial crisis on the spillover process. The (post-)financial crisis period is marked by two underlying forces—lower firm growth and lower access to external financing—which are quite different from the pre-crisis period. It is expected that the FDI spillover effects will be subject to these two forces. Understanding the pattern of FDI spillovers during the crisis has practical implications that stretch beyond the period under consideration in this study, and may prove particularly beneficial to policy makers at a time when the world is grappling with the economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.====The paper has six sections. Section 2 explores the theoretical framework and the empirical literature on the influence of FDI spillovers. Section 3 discusses the modelling strategy. Section 4 explains the empirical issues in the investigation of spillovers, while Section 5 presents the dataset and the results.

The financial development–governance nexus is explored using ,"The theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of economic growth and development underscores the importance of financial development and good governance. Efficient financial markets divert resources from unproductive to productive activities, thereby improving overall economic efficiency and increasing economic growth. Schumpeter (1911) first highlighted the role of financial development and financial markets in the growth process, suggesting that an efficient banking system is the key to economic growth because of its role in allocating savings to productive investments, thus promoting innovation. By contrast, without participatory, transparent, accountable, and justice-manifesting institutions, including those that guarantee property rights, policymaking can remain paralyzed, constraining countries’ abilities to optimize their economic and human development capacity: in short, governance matters. From an institutional perspective, laws and regulations that are effectively enforced by an impartial and efficient governance system can support innovation and investment and create an environment conducive to inclusive economic growth.====The dynamic interaction between financial development and governance remains largely unexplored. Extant studies focus entirely on exploring the role good governance plays in strengthening a country’s financial sector. Financial sector development has been found to occur in the presence of an efficient bureaucracy with low levels of corruption and strong law and order (Law and Azman-Saini, 2012; Le et al., 2015). La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) explore the link between financial development and institutions, focusing on whether differences in legal origin can explain capital market development. By contrast, Beck et al. (2003) examine the relative importance of the law and finance and initial endowment hypotheses. Their results suggest that initial endowments play a more critical role in financial market development than legal origins.====A related strand of literature explores the interrelationship between country-level corporate governance provisions and financial development (Li et al., 2018). However, few studies explore the interrelationship between institutional quality and financial development across countries (Banerjee et al., 2019; Miletkov and Wintoki, 2008). A growing number of studies have analysed the causality from governance to financial development, but to the best of our knowledge, the reverse causality from financial development to governance has not been explored. Several arguments can be made to support causality from financial development to governance. For instance, governance reforms are often costly; hence, well-developed financial markets can be a prerequisite for successful and viable governance reforms (Miletkov and Wintoki, 2008, 2009). It may also be the case that only countries with developed financial markets can afford good governance and build better institutions (Fergusson, 2006). Furthermore, when political power is unequally distributed, and a narrow elite controls political decisions, financial development can be curtailed to restrict political competitors’ financial access (Rajan and Zingales, 2003). This suggests that improving the level of financial development can lead to a higher degree of political competition, which can, in turn, improve the quality of institutions and governance.====A causal relationship from financial development to governance can also be motivated using North’s institutional change framework (North, 1971, 1981, 2005). According to this framework, new institutional and governance structures will emerge when the social benefits of change exceed the costs. Thus, any technological shock or change in relative prices alters the cost-benefit possibilities of new institutional and governance arrangements, consequently stimulating the demand for new institutional and governance arrangements or changes in the existing structures. Changes in financial development modify the costs and benefits of particular institutional arrangements (Miletkov and Wintoki, 2008). More specifically, improvements in the level of financial development act as a catalyst for the emergence of higher quality institutions and governance frameworks. Improvements in governance increase the benefits accruing from potential financial arrangements, and after a certain threshold, the benefits from governance reforms will exceed the cost of undertaking those reforms.====Indirectly, lower financial development levels increase economic volatility and uncertainty (Beck et al., 2006), which in turn increase the risk of political instability and lead to deterioration in governance quality. Similarly, with higher levels of financial development come greater financial liberalization and more frequent cross-border transactions (Miletkov and Wintoki, 2008). Such frequent interactions create a more informed citizenry, making them more aware of their legal and political rights and stimulating the demand for better governance structures (Khalid, 2017). Further, as Miletkov and Wintoki (2008) highlight, frequent financial transactions create incentives for people to acquire specific skills and education that are more conducive to administering and enforcing contracts, which, in turn, reduces the cost of administering and implementing governance reform. This discussion clearly underscores that financial development is a potential driver of improvements in governance structures, a premise that requires an empirical investigation.====This study builds on cross-country empirical studies that confirm a positive association between financial development and institutional quality. A related strand of literature also explores the link between financial development and legal origins, while a smaller body of work examines the role of good governance in financial market development more specifically. This study adds to this growing literature by exploring the bidirectional causality between financial development and governance and testing whether the relationship between financial development and governance varies by level of development and level of openness, which has yet to be considered in the literature.====In this study, bidirectional causality is tested using panel data of 101 countries from 1984 to 2013. Governance quality is measured using the International Country Risk Guide’s political risk index (====) and its two subcomponents, the Investment Profile index (====) and the Government Stability index (====). The financial development (====) data are collected from Svirydzenka (2016). The financial development–governance nexus is then explored using econometric methods robust to cross-sectional dependence to identify the models to be cointegrated.====When the time dimension in panel datasets is substantially lower than the number of cross-sections, it is critical to take into account cross-sectional dependence (Sarafidis and Wansbeek, 2012; Shafiullah et al., 2019). Moreover, in a globalized world, governance (institutional quality) in one country affects others, especially its neighbors (Hosseini and Kaneko, 2013; Stiglitz, 2010), and changes in governance and institutional structures are driven by common global factors (Khalid, 2016). Similarly, convergence (as well as spillover, contagion, etc.) in financial development has been hypothesized and empirically identified across many economies (Apergis et al., 2012; Bahadir and Valev, 2015; Dekle and Pundit, 2016). These highlight the hypothetical and empirical possibility of cross-sectional dependence in our panel dataset. As such, it is essential to implement econometric methods that are robust to cross-sectional dependence to obtain unbiased and efficient empirical estimates that will allow us to make valid inferences regarding the relationship between financial development and governance. Moreover, testing for cointegration in the specified models is important, as its presence precludes any question of endogeneity because the estimates of a cointegrated system are “superconsistent” (Stock, 1987). Cointegration and causality analysis has been used extensively in the literature related to financial development (see, e.g., Ahamada and Coulibaly, 2013; Coulibaly, 2015; Fromentin, 2017). Thus, our estimation strategy—controlling for cross-sectional dependence in a cointegration-causality analysis framework—enables us to uncover the causal relationship between governance and financial development and identify the direction of causality.====Long-run equation estimates show clear evidence that financial development positively affects governance. This positive impact of financial development on governance is found to be robust for three different measures of governance, while further analysis shows that the governance and investment profile indices have positive effects on financial development. The Granger causality tests demonstrate bidirectional causality between financial development and each governance measure. Finally, we find that the impact of financial development on governance depends on the level of economic development and the country’s economic openness.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a theoretical discussion of the relationship between financial development and governance and develops the hypotheses to be tested. Section 3 introduces the data and empirical methods. Section 4 presents and discusses the results, while Section 5 reports the results of our robustness checks.

We add to this new literature by using industry-level data from 59 2-digit industries that trade between the U.S. and Germany. We find that when the old approach of the linear model was used, the real dollar-euro rate had short-run effects in 17 industries that lasted into the long run in 26 industries. However, when the nonlinear model was estimated, we found short-run asymmetric effects of exchange rate changes in 49 industries, which lasted into long-run asymmetric effects in 28 industries. The J-curve effect was supported in a total of 18 industries.","The traditional approach of assessing the effects of a devaluation or depreciation on the trade balance of a country relies upon the so-called Marshall-Lerner condition, under which the sum of price elasticities of import and export demand must exceed unity.==== It is a long-run condition, and the short-run response of the trade balance to exchange rate changes is said to be different. Indeed, Magee (1973) and Junz and Rhomberg (1973) argued that due to contracts in old prices and exchange rates and to adjustment lags, the trade balance could still deteriorate and improve after new prices at new exchange rates kick in and after lags are realized, hence the J-curve pattern. Bahmani-Oskooee (1985) then offered a method of testing the phenomenon, mostly by using a distributed lag model.====Once Engle and Granger (1987) error-correction modeling and cointegration methods were introduced, Rose and Yellen (1989) demonstrated that one can use a reduced form trade balance model similar to that of Bahmani-Oskooee (1985) in conjunction with the error-correction approach to assess the short-run effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance and cointegration method to assess the long-run effects. Subsequent studies followed Engle and Granger (1987) as well as other cointegration methods to test the J-curve effect for other countries. Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2004) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2010) provide two comprehensive reviews of the literature.====From the two review articles, we gather that every country has its own literature and our country of concern, Germany, is no exception. Rose (1991) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Alse (1994) included Germany in their analysis, but were not successful in finding any short-run or long-run effects of currency depreciation on Germany’s trade with the rest of the world. Rose and Yellen (1989) criticized the above studies as well as others on the grounds that they used aggregate trade flows and suffer from aggregation bias. To reduce this bias, they recommended using trade data between two countries. However, when they tested the J-curve effects between the U.S. and each of the G6 countries including Germany, they were also unsuccessful.====Rose and Yellen (1989) approach of using aggregate bilateral trade data between the U.S. and Germany was said to suffer from another aggregation bias in that different industries may react to exchange rate changes differently. To reduce the bias, Bahmani-Oskooee and Hajilee (2012) disaggregated the U.S.-Germany trade flows by industry and investigated the response of the trade balance of each of the 131 3-digit industries to exchange rate changes. They found that euro depreciation has short-run effects on the trade balance of 91 industries but long-run effects on the trade balance of only 59 industries. Furthermore, a J-curve pattern was discovered in 31 cases. A similar approach was recently followed by Lucarelli et al. (2018), who considered the trade balance of 34 industries that trade between Germany and the U.S. and found that only three industries benefit from euro depreciation in the long run. They also reported evidence of an inverted J-curve in four industries.====All the above studies have one common feature in assuming the effects of exchange rate changes on the trade balance to be symmetric. The symmetry assumption implies that if an x% depreciation improves the trade balance by y%, an x% appreciation will hurt it by y%. However, recently, Bahmani-Oskooee and Fariditavana (2016) demonstrated that in fact the response to the trade balance to exchange rate changes could be asymmetric. While their argument was based on changes in traders’ expectations when a currency depreciates versus when it appreciates, others have pointed out different sources of asymmetries. For example, Bussiere (2013) has shown that import and export prices react to exchange rate changes in an asymmetric manner, which indirectly supports an asymmetric response of the trade balance to exchange rate changes. Furthermore, Arize et al. (2017) have argued that trade could be subject to hysteresis, which implies that if firms do not exit the market during currency appreciation, their export earnings will decline at a different rate than they would increase when the currency depreciates, hence causing asymmetric effects.====The main purpose of this paper is to reconsider the commodity trade between the U.S. and Germany once more and to not only investigate the symmetric effects of the real dollar-euro rate, but also its asymmetric effects. Fig. 1 depicts the movement of the real dollar-euro rate over our study period and, as can be seen, the dollar sometimes lost value and gained at other times. Monthly trade data over the period January 1999 to July 2018 are used for each of the 59 2-digit industries for which continuous monthly data are available. The 59 industries engage in a little over 96 % of trade. To that end, we introduce the models and methods in Section 2. We then report the results in Section 3, which is followed by a summary in Section 4.

We evaluate the performance of our newly proposed BPIs using two econometric exercises. Overall, they exhibit good statistical properties, are relevant to the countercyclical capital buffer decision-making process, and might contribute to a more precise assessment of both systemic risk accumulation and risk materialization.","The global financial crisis (GFC) highlighted the problem of procyclical banking regulation. Therefore, significant reform efforts were made during the postcrisis period. A new economic policy pillar emerged in the form of macroprudential policy, aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the financial system through careful implementation of preventive tools. A countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) was to be the main macroprudential instrument aimed at addressing cyclical risks. The macroprudential authority raises the CCyB rate when the cyclical component of systemic risk is rising and lowers it when it is falling.==== Since the introduction of the CCyB, national as well as supranational authorities have debated how best to set the buffer rate, that is, based on which criteria. This debate is related to influential literature on financial cycles (Borio, 2014; Borio et al., 2017; Drehman et al., 2012; Rey, 2018; Schüler et al., 2020).====In the aftermath of the GFC, the Group of Twenty (G20) leaders urged those who set accounting standards to come up with a new approach that would be more forward looking. In 2018, the International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) was introduced. It includes a model of expected credit loss (ECL) in the event of the impairment of financial assets, which was expected to be beneficial for financial stability through the enhancement of transparency and the earlier and fuller recognition of impairment losses (ESRB, 2017). However, several authors argue that the new accounting framework and the ECL approach might actually increase procyclicality in the banking sector, instead of decreasing it (Abad and Suarez, 2017; Krüger et al., 2018).====Under the IFRS 9 accounting framework and the ECL approach, banks should determine the amount of loan-loss provisions in a forward-looking manner (i.e., considering the evolution of the financial cycle and macroeconomic indicators). As such, the effectiveness of the ECL approach depends on banks’ ability to forecast future credit risk. If banks can predict credit risk, they can create provisions during a financial boom. This should reduce the potential losses when risks materialize. However, if banks do not generate provisions when cyclical risks are accumulating, their profit will be cyclically overestimated during a financial boom, and the potential loss when risks materialize will be higher because of the “cliff effect.”====In this paper, we propose a novel profit-to-provisioning approach that can be used as a supplement in the macroprudential decision-making process in setting the CCyB rate. Our approach provides a tool to address concerns about the unintended cyclical behavior of IFRS 9 and could be the key to mitigating possible risks to financial stability. We construct new indicators based on the logic of comparing profits and provisioning for loans. In this paper, we call our novel indicators “Banking Prudence Indicators” (BPIs). Under IFRS 9, the expected credit losses should be covered by the relevant risk component of interest income in the long run. If they are not, then, the banking sector did not correctly measure credit risk, and these loan pricing and lending mistakes will have a negative effect on the amount of loan-loss provisions and profit during subsequent periods of financial stress. Our baseline indicator builds on the ratio of the total interest margin to loan-loss provisions per unit of private loans. Therefore, it monitors whether sufficient provisions are created in relation to the risk premium contained in the interest margin on private loans. Furthermore, the baseline indicator can be further augmented with the banking sector leverage, that is, the ratio of client loans to capital, which should (indirectly) reflect the procyclicality of risk weights. Our proposed profit-to-provisioning approach builds on the following logic. We argue that, during a financial boom, the provisioning observed is often below the average level throughout the cycle, whereas profits are higher than average (not only because expected credit losses are not materialized but also because of strong loan growth). Banks thus collect cyclically overvalued profits during the boom, because of lower provisions and higher lending activity. A financial boom is the ideal period for creating capital reserves to be released during a subsequent period of financial stress when the nonperforming loan ratio rises, and bank profits trend downward.====Although using the CCyB can mitigate the unintended consequences from the potentially procyclical character of IFRS 9, it is not the only option. The other option is amendment of the existing regulatory treatment of provisions under IFRS 9.==== In fact, both options could be inspired by the dynamic provisions used in Spain (ESRB, 2019b).==== This dynamic provisioning has a countercyclical effect similar to that of the CCyB. The capital buffer (or the dynamic provision fund) is built up from retained profits during a financial boom to cover losses during a subsequent period of financial stress (Saurina, 2009). Whereas Spain based its provisioning system on the evolution of loan-loss provisions and their impact on profit, we propose that these variables be adjusted for the purpose of the CCyB rate decision-making process.====Our approach contributes to the debate over how to address some concerns raised about the current methodology for setting the CCyB. The decision on how to set the CCyB is based mainly on the state of the economy in the financial cycle, often expressed by the benchmark gap between credit and the gross domestic product (GDP), calculated as the deviation in the total credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-term trend.==== However, the use of the credit-to-GDP gap has turned out to be problematic for either purely statistical (Hamilton, 2017) or economic reasons (Edge and Meisenzahl, 2011; Geršl and Seidler, 2015). Geršl and Seidler (2015) show that the credit-to-GDP gap might give rise to erroneous recommendations about the CCyB setting, especially in converging economies. Therefore, countries often use other cyclical risk indicators to identify the current phase of the financial cycle. However, (to our knowledge) no indicator exists that would also directly take into consideration banks’ prudential behavior over the financial cycle, including the procyclical shortcomings of the accounting provisions under IFRS 9.====Furthermore, the proposed profit-to-provisioning approach does not go beyond the role given to this buffer in prudential regulation. A 2014 European Systemic Risk Board recommendation states that the CCyB is designed to help to counteract procyclicality in the financial system (ESRB, 2014). Capital should be accumulated when cyclical systemic risk is judged to be increasing, and the appropriate authorities should monitor a set of variables that indicate the buildup of cyclical systemic risk, including potential mispricing of risk. This approach is suitable for the purposes of the CCyB rate decision-making process, especially for traditional banking sectors, in which cyclical risk is primarily associated with the loan portfolio.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief literature review. Section 3 explains why a new approach is required in the decision-making process for setting the CCyB rate. Section 4 describes the construction of each BPI. Section 5 presents the results of a simple forecasting model and a nonlinear Markov-switching model, which we use to assess the BPIs’ ability to identify periods of systemic risk buildup.

The risk weights for retail exposures behave pro-cyclically not only with regard to the business cycle, but also with respect to the financial cycle and house price growth. In addition, monetary policy easing contributes to the pro-cyclicality in higher quantiles of risk weights.","There is a general belief among many academics and policymakers that the Basel II regulatory framework has contributed to strengthening the inherent pro-cyclicality of bank behaviour. Under Pillar 1, banks’ risk weights are related to the credit risk of the underlying assets, which varies with the business and financial cycle. During economic and financial booms, the favourable economic situation and low default rates are reflected in lower risk estimates, prompting lower minimum capital requirements per unit of risk-weighted assets. This gives banks an opportunity to use the resulting capital surplus for credit expansion. This credit expansion is usually accompanied by rising asset prices and easing of lending conditions, which might be desirable in a phase of economic recovery. Once the credit growth becomes excessive and asset prices reach levels far from economic fundamentals, the lower capital requirements may cause financial imbalances to emerge. During an economic downturn, banks’ capital may be insufficient for them to manage unanticipated loan losses and asset writedowns. Rising default risk will lead to higher risk estimates and risk weights, which will in turn raise the minimum capital requirements, further adding to this strain. Since it can be very expensive for banks to raise new capital at short notice in this situation, they may respond by restricting credit supply in order to meet the regulatory requirements. The credit reduction accompanied by falling asset prices will further aggravate the economic downturn and increase the risks to financial stability (Acharya and Richardson, 2009).====While this behaviour may seem rational from the perspective of a single bank, it poses a significant threat to the stability of the financial system if pursued by all banks collectively. Microprudential policy views the stability of the financial system as the sum of the soundness of its individual institutions. It does not usually take into account problems that may arise when all banks engage in similar behaviour, overexposing the system to the same risk – be it credit risk (debtors do not repay), market risk (collateral values decline) or other risk. The global financial crisis demonstrated that microprudential policy is not sufficient to safeguard the stability of the financial system as a whole. A consensus has emerged on the need to establish macroprudential policy as an essential addition to microprudential regulation and supervision.====This paper studies the pro-cyclicality of risk weights with respect to business, credit and financial cycles, using data for the Czech Republic. The analysis draws on a unique supervisory panel dataset covering 20 banks between 2004 Q1 and 2019 Q3. The detailed information on individual banks allows us to investigate the pro-cyclicality of risk weights under the IRB and STA approaches and for different asset classes. In addition, house price growth and the monetary conditions are considered as potential factors contributing to the pro-cyclicality. Distribution analysis and the quantile regression method are employed in order to explore the heterogeneity in banks’ behaviour, allowing us to study the effect in different quantiles of risk weights. The paper contributes to a growing stream of literature showing that risk-sensitive capital regulation may reinforce the pro-cyclicality of banks’ behaviour (see Section 2). Using a granular dataset, I am able to distinguish between credit exposures under the IRB approach and the STA approach at quarterly frequency and to empirically analyse the distribution of risk weights for different credit exposure categories.====The Czech Republic is an ideal candidate for this analysis for at least three reasons. First, the Czech banking sector is homogeneous, consisting mainly of universal banks with a business model focusing on providing loans to the private sector (risk-weighted exposures for credit risk accounted for almost 90% of total risk-weighted exposures as of 2019 Q3). Second, the IRB approach has been adopted by a large part of the sector (approximately 84 % as of 2019 Q3) and the Czech Republic has one of the largest shares of capital requirements for credit risk originated by internal models in the EU (Resti, 2016). Third, there has been a significant monetary policy easing over a prolonged period of time using both conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools, which provides a basis for analysing its effect on banks’ implicit risk weights.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a short literature review. Sections 3 and 4 present the empirical model and describe the data. Section 5 reports the estimation results and Section 6 discusses policy implications.

However, more recently, there has been increasing evidence pointing to a vanishing, and even negative, effect of financial sectors at high levels of financial depth, particularly since the global financial crisis of 2007−2009. Too much ==== could hurt growth. The paper shifts the focus towards labor market outcomes by examining whether too much finance also hurts unemployment. Using a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimation and a panel of 97 OECD and non-OECD countries for the period 1991–2015, we find that the answer depends on the type of finance and the extent of a country’s labor market flexibility. Specifically, (i) too much financial development hurts unemployment for countries with more rigid labor markets; (ii) too bank-centered or too little market-oriented financial systems worsen unemployment, particularly for countries with more flexible labor markets; and (iii) too much credit to private enterprises deteriorates unemployment in countries with more rigid labor markets, whereas too little credit to households worsens unemployment in countries with more flexible labor markets. Evidence also shows that these unemployment consequences possibly run through investment and entrepreneurship channels.","While numerous studies point to the growth-enhancing role of financial development, there is an emerging and controversial literature suggesting that there is a weakening effect (Rousseau and Wachtel, 2011; Hasan et al., 2018) that even turns negative once financial development exceeds a certain threshold (Law and Singh, 2014; Arcand et al., 2015; Law et al., 2018). This non-monotonicity possibly arises because large financial sectors may face diminishing returns (Philippon and Reshef, 2013), divert resources such as the talented from real sectors (Philippon, 2010; Bolton et al., 2016) or lead to frequent financial crises (Easterly et al., 2001; Loayza and Rancière, 2006). Too much finance hurts growth (Arcand et al., 2015).====This paper shifts the focus towards labor market outcomes and examines whether it is too much finance, not enough finance, or the wrong type of finance that hurts unemployment. The investigation is of paramount importance for academics and policymakers following the recent global financial crisis of 2008−2009. Due to excessive credit growth, the global financial crisis has caused massive job destruction and subsequent jobless growth, particularly for advanced countries.==== It has also strengthened the recent trend in financial development policies towards market-oriented financial system architecture and in the importance of credit to households relative to non-financial firms since the 1990s. Resolving these issues would help us understand the role of the financial sector in the process of economic development.====The paper makes four contributions to the current empirical literature. The first lies in investigating the empirical relevance of credit markets for unemployment dynamics, while taking account of frictions in both credit and labor markets, in a panel of 97 OECD and non-OECD countries spanning the period 1991–2015. To the extent that credit market frictions determine whether constrained firms can borrow funds to finance their investment and support their current labor demand and new job creation, financial development that mitigates credit market imperfections would improve employment and alleviate unemployment (Acemoglu, 2001; Wasmer and Weil, 2004; Dromel et al., 2010). However, the unemployment-reducing effect of financial development may decrease as credit market imperfections improve (Pagano and Pica, 2012), the economy is highly financialized (Krippner, 2005; van Treeck, 2009), and/or the labor market is less rigid (Petrosky-Nadeau and Wasmer, 2013; Petrosky-Nadeau, 2014). The failure to account for such nonlinearity, as is typical for most current empirical studies, may lead to invalid inferences if the actual relationship is nonlinear.====Second, we evaluate whether there are any differences in the effect between bank-based versus market-based financial systems. It is argued that both banks and markets may play different roles in mitigating credit market imperfections and in corporate financing. While banks are associated with personalized and private information-based relationships, markets are characterized by anonymous and public information-based relationships between firms and funders (Diamond, 1991; Rajan, 1992). It is also argued that a financial system in its infancy tends to be bank-dominated. However, as the country develops economically and financially, entrepreneurs are more likely to need a rich set of risk management tools and vehicles for raising capital, and stock markets become more important for reducing market frictions associated with complex and risky projects that require non-standard financial arrangements (Levine, 2005). The failure to consider the changing importance of banks and markets may lead to biased estimation results regarding the unemployment impact of banking or stock market development due to missing relevant information.====Third, we differentiate between the effects of credit to private non-financial firms and households for the first time. This is significant, given the increasing share in credit to households relative to firms, particularly for developing countries. The typical measure of financial development in the literature is private credit. It includes all types of credit to the private sector without distinguishing between lending to households and firms. However, these two types of credit play a different role in supporting production, investment and employment, given that credit to households facilitates consumption and asset transactions, whereas credit to firms has the potential to increase investment and labor demand (Beck et al., 2012; Bezemer et al., 2016). There is also evidence showing that household credit is strongly correlated to financial crises and recessions (Jappelli et al., 2013; Barba and Pivetti, 2009; Jordà et al., 2016), whereas enterprise credit is more relevant for economic growth (Beck et al., 2012; Bezemer et al., 2016).====Our last, but not least, contribution is to explore the potential channels through which finance could affect unemployment. It is argued that credit market imperfections limit the investment and labor demand of financially constrained firms and hence raise unemployment. It is also argued that financial constraints hinder the emergence of new innovating firms and thus harm employment (Acemoglu, 2001; Guiso et al., 2004). While there might be other effects, we consider two channels: investment and entrepreneurship.====To address these issues, we rely on a dynamic simultaneous model via system GMM estimators, given the dynamic nature of unemployment and potential endogeneity of finance (and other regressors).

We followed ==== to measure cultural distance, and employed the number of bank pairs involved in cross-border syndicated lending from the source to target countries as a measure of bank linkages. We found that cultural distance has a negative association with bank linkages. This effect is stronger in countries featuring higher informational asymmetries, as represented by weaker institutions, higher uncertainty, or revolution shocks. Our results hold even when employing alternative measures of bank linkages and cultural distance, and when considering the potential endogeneity of cultural distance.","In the current era of globalization, the internalization of the banking industry has made remarkable progress in the past two decades, especially in developing countries, where the pace of internationalization has been rapid. Cultural similarities are considered an essential factor in this internationalization, as they mitigate informational asymmetries to enable economic exchanges (Portes and Rey, 2005; Guiso et al., 2009) and promote the trend of making banking investments abroad. As argued by Portes and Rey (2005), similarities in culture can minimize the costs of evaluating and monitoring cross-border borrowers and investment plans. Further, making banking investments in foreign countries may entail a distinct institutional constraint (Siegel et al., 2011). The degree of institutional compatibility between the source and target countries can be explained in terms of cultural distance. The greater the cultural distance, the more difficult it is to price assets, and the less acceptable differences in corporate governance practices become. In these circumstances, stakeholder/manager relationships are more difficult to manage and negotiations are more likely to fail. Undoubtedly, there is a causal link between cultural distance and global investments, especially in the banking industry; however, there is also the broader issue of potential investment in countries with weak financial institutions or high economic uncertainty. The issue of institutional setting and uncertainty may be relevant, because foreign investors are more likely to choose unsuitable partners and make poor investments in countries with weak institutions and high uncertainty (Poelhekke, 2015). Addressing this issue is important, since it potentially elaborates the relationship between cross-border banking flows and cultural distance.====In this study, we employ a gravity model for country-pair data, to explore the effects of cultural distance on global bank linkages. The cultural measure suggested by Schwartz (2006) is used. In particular, the cultural theory proposed by Schwartz (2006) involves three key societal issues and corresponding dimensions for cross-cultural analysis. By analyzing differences in how universally recognized values are prioritized by the national population, the model developed by Schwartz (2006) operationalizes the cultural profiles of countries, with the derived profiles being superior to other cultural value dimensions (Siegel et al., 2011). The reasons are as follows. First, the central elements of Schwartz’s model are derived from previous studies in the social sciences. Second, Schwartz (2006) operationalizes the cultural dimensions by employing value measures that capture cross-culturally equivalent meanings at the individual level. Hofstede (2001) also identifies key cultural value dimensions==== . However, Nadler and Breuer (2019) show that the cultural dimensions of Schwartz are more suitable than those of Hofstede in assessing the effect of social preferences on financial decision-making, because—unlike Schwartz’s dimensions—Hofstede’s dimensions do not capture the underlying individual cultural values. Moreover, Schwartz’s dimensions consider cultural impacts by including social preferences, which are new characteristics for decision-makers in cultural finance. When the Schwartz dimensions are applied, decision makers can integrate ecological and social targets into traditional economic targets that are consistent with a much broader concept of culture. Moreover, Schwartz’s dimensions also capture indirect cultural impacts. Conversely, Hofstede’s dimensions are applied as proxies for either the uncertainty or time preferences of decision-makers, which seem to be especially suitable for traditional finance. Using Hofstede’s dimensions to measure the impact of cultural distance on bank linkages—a type of financial decision-making—therefore seems inappropriate.====We follow Caballero et al. (2018) and use the number of bank pairs involved in cross-border syndicated lending from the source to target countries, as a measure of the bank linkages of each country. Unlike cross-border flows of stocks and outstanding bank claims based on the Bank for International Settlements database and bank-ownership linkages (Claessens and Horen, 2014), our measure captures banks’ information acquisition, as it is based on the long-term interbank relationship. We augment the model by adding institutional risk factors to capture a higher level of information asymmetry, and these are then interacted with our measure of bank linkages. With this approach, we make two main contributions to the bank linkage literature. First, this paper documents a negative nexus between cultural distance and international bank linkages. Second, it refines our understanding of the role of culture in driving cross-border bilateral capital flows for a source country with weaker institutions, higher uncertainty, or revolution shocks.====We analyze international banking investment flows by using global country-pair data from 1990 to 2013. The empirical results indicate a strong negative effect of cultural distance on cross-border capital flows. We also conduct a robustness check by controlling for various dimensions of distance, including geographical distance and the distance between the levels of financial market development in two countries. Further, we find that the effect of cultural distance on cross-border capital flows is stronger in countries that either have weak institutions or face high uncertainty and shocks, leading to greater information asymmetry and risky investments. Specifically, we find this is more evident in countries dominated by a single religious group, those where the legal system possesses low impartiality, or where there is popular observance of the law. We also recognize the possibility of reverse causality. We find that the magnitude of the impacts increases when controlling for the issue of endogeneity.====Our findings suggest novel and important implications for economists and policy makers promoting the banking sector’s internationalization. The formation of cross-country bank linkages is more straightforward if home-country banks target partners in host countries that have a close physical and financial market development, and cultural distance. Moreover, authorities seeking to promote better networks between home-country and host-country banks should focus on issuing policies that promote institutional stability in the home country. The home country can attain this goal by imposing stringent controls on corruption and improving the stability of the government vis-à-vis international investors’ risks, by improving the impartiality of the legal system or managing internal conflicts and ethnic tensions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The results show that there have been significant improvements in the income distribution after 2002. The extent of this improvement seems to have been higher during the 2002–2007 reform period than for the rest of the period after 2007. Entrepreneurial and financial income groups were the most distinctive for this improvement. The results also indicate that the contribution of transfer payments was very small, but surprisingly positive in both the 2002–2007 and 2007–2009 periods, and expectedly negative in the 2009–2013 period.","After suffering a large-scale economic crisis in 2001, Turkey underwent a major economic transformation, which led to an astonishing economic performance in the early 2000s. The coalition government led by the prominent leader of the Turkish Left, ====, initiated a reform programme, and ====, former vice-president of the World Bank, was invited to take charge of implementing the programme.==== Many international observers agree that the radical reform efforts that were made to provide a sound fiscal standing, disinflation policies, and good macroeconomic management accounted for this success. It is also widely considered that the political stability brought by the single party government of the ==== (AKP) improved the business climate and strengthened the positive perceptions of international investors. In addition to political reforms undertaken as a pre-condition of likely EU membership, the strong commitment of the government to these reforms and the application of sound macroeconomic policies gave rise to high economic growth rates, particularly during the 2002–2007 period. Moreover, this high level of growth resulted in a sharp decline in inequality and a significant rise in public support for the government. Thus, the aim of this paper is first to see which aspect of economic reform is mostly responsible for this initial decline in income inequality. Second, we aim to examine the relationship between different macroeconomic policies and income distribution by putting forward various channels through which the different elements of macroeconomic policies affect income distribution.====The distributional issue is particularly critical in this case because Turkey had previously recorded the worst income distribution record among OECD countries (OECD, 2012; Gürsel et al., 2000). A number of significant factors are behind this poor distributional outcome: earlier successive economic crises usually followed by austerity programmes, a persistently high inflation record, ongoing high interest rate policies, and political and economic instability. These factors all produced negative effects on income distribution that lasted many years. Moreover, the population of Turkey had become tired of the continuous political struggles of the decade prior to 2001 without seeing any significant change in their living standards. In this respect, the public considered the economic crisis of 2001 to be an opportunity to shatter the existing political establishment and pave the way for one led by the AKP (Öniş, 2005, 2010).====The new political establishment took this opportunity and initially conceded to all the politically unpopular terms and conditions of the stand-by agreement with the IMF and the World Bank. The 2002–2007 period was marked by the incoming government’s good economic conduct and commitment to political and economic reforms and saw a resulting improvement in income distribution. The government quickly realised the importance of the distributional impact of good macroeconomic governance in gaining people’s confidence. Consequently, successive AKP governments have intentionally made use of all formal and informal distributional tools to ==== gain electoral support, and ==== sustain and even strengthen this support over time.====However, the distributional outcomes of the policies enacted during the 2002–2007 period have been mixed. Strong economic growth in a favourable international setting initially eased the use of redistribution policies and gave rise to a sharp decline in inequality. After the downturn in the global economy between the years 2008–2009, the pace of this improvement slowed, and the overall level of inequality became almost constant. These different distributional outcomes inevitably give rise to the question of whether the government’s commitment to both macroeconomic reforms and good governance – initially resulting in low inflation, low interest rates, and stability in the foreign exchange rate – are key reasons for the sharp decline in inequality between 2002 and 2007.====Of course, policies conducted in different macroeconomic settings have different impacts on income distribution and contribute to the overall improvement (or deterioration) in inequality to various extents. Despite the positive macroeconomic outcomes of earlier economic reforms, the AKP government later became extremely reluctant to undertake further reforms after the stand-by agreement with the IMF ended in 2007, preferring instead to follow populist macroeconomic policies. Both the worldwide financial crisis, which erupted in the US in 2008, and the government’s return to economic populism to maintain its electoral majority accounted for the changes in macroeconomic policy. Therefore, the case of Turkey allows examining possible links between income distribution and macroeconomic policy changes.====Attempts have been made to examine the distributional impacts of macroeconomic policies in different countries, but these have been very limited in number (====, Bulir, 2001; Sarel, 1997; Blejer and Guerrero, 1990). The unpopularity of this type of research arises mainly from the theoretical difficulty in identifying the channel through which macroeconomic policies affect income distribution. For example, a particular policy, which could be intended to have clear-cut distributional consequences, may sometimes result in different distributional outcomes at the aggregate level, especially when combined with other policy elements embodied within a comprehensive economic reform programme. Given the theoretical difficulty of the treatment of distributional aspects of macroeconomic policies, researchers have often been concerned only with the microeconomic dimension of income distribution.====However, there has recently been a growing awareness of the macroeconomic dimension of the distributional issue (====, Agénor, 2004; Bourguignon et al., 2008). Research into this dimension is particularly important for a country like Turkey, where far-reaching and successful economic reforms took place, and provides room to empirically assess the distributional consequences of these economic reforms. Taking into account these theoretical difficulties, we determined that our approach to the issue must be solely empirical.====This study identifies the mechanism through which macroeconomic policies and variables interact and affect different income groups for different periods. The whole period of 2002–2013 is divided into three sub-periods: 2002–2007, 2007–2009 and 2009–2013.==== This is because the income flows of each income group are affected by the different measures and variables that accompany a particular macroeconomic policy, and they in turn contribute to the overall level of inequality. For this purpose, we decomposed inequality into its sources for a particular year by using the ====s decomposition method, and then examined which income group(s) accounted for changes in inequality over time by applying the ==== decomposition methodology.====The next section contains a brief history of economic reform and the main macroeconomic indicators that operate under different macroeconomic settings.

Based on the measures taken by the authorities of our sample countries, we build several prudential indices. Additionally, we control for the effects of several country-specific factors and bank-specific characteristics. Finally, we test the homogeneity of these effects, accounting for cycle, ownership, and bank effects. Generally, the empirical findings reveal a negative correlation between prudential toolkits and credit growth, with a conspicuous impact for tools targeting lending activity. We see that the effects of a change in the lending framework on loan growth are heterogeneous when we account for crisis and cycle patterns. Furthermore, the interaction between ownership and crisis reveals that, in normal times, foreign banks recorded higher loan growth compared to domestic banks. The opposite is true in turbulent times. The analysis of interactions between credit-based measures and bank-specific variables show that the effects of prudential actions depend on the bank size and leverage.","The banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) experienced numerous changes and challenges over the last decades. The CEE countries’ transition from centralized planned economies to market economies implied the reorganization of their banking systems. During the 1990s, legal foundations, market liberalization, the creation of a dual banking system, regulation reforms, recapitalization, and privatization were the most important transformations. Also, during the transition changes, the banking systems faced increased non-performing loans, bankruptcies, low capitalization, and crisis. However, by the early 2000s, most of the banking sectors managed to overcome these challenges and became relatively stable. As a consequence of the privatization process, foreign ownership was predominant in the region.====The resurgence of economic growth, the prospect of European Union integration, and relative bank stability were the pillars of an increased credit growth cycle during the 2000s. De Haas et al. (2015) underlined that, from 1999 until 2007, loan growth grew by over 40 % per year. The cycle has been accentuated by increased foreign bank ownership and considerable cross-border inflows. For example, according to Thimann (2002) and Barisitz (2008), in 2000, foreign ownership in CEE countries passed 60 % of the asset share, except in Romania (50.9 %) and Slovakia (28.1 %), even exceeding the level of 80 % in the late 2000s. According to Bank for International Settlements data, cross-border inflows increased rapidly in the region, from an approximate value of USD 94 billion at the start of 2000 to peak values of approximately USD 1.200 billion in the second quarter of 2008. This was thought to have a positive influence on the development of the banking sector in this area, but the experience of the recent financial crisis showed that the exposure to foreign ownership and cross-border flows fostered turmoil. More specifically, the global financial crisis, particularly the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and the European sovereign debt crisis triggered a sudden slowdown of external loans, with the CEE region being particularly vulnerable to this process. Hence, the region faced persistent cross-border outflows, with total claims dropping from the 2008 peak values of USD 1.200 billion to USD 900 billion at the end of 2014. The deleveraging process, other risks specific to the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, along with country-specific vulnerabilities, increased the tensions within the banking systems. The banks’ capitalization dropped and the level of non-performing loans increased, while loan growth rates decreased dramatically. In these circumstances, some countries, such as Hungary, Latvia, and Slovenia, experienced systemic banking crises (Laeven and Valencia, 2013).====In order to flatten the credit cycle during the first part of the 2000s, and afterwards in an attempt to temper the stress and minimize the systemic risk within the banking systems in the period of turmoil, the CEE countries’ authorities resorted to prudential tools. In this regard, the CEE banking systems’ particularities, such as patterns of loan cycle and leverage, increased foreign ownership, and intensity of prudential policy actions, provide a fertile framework for analysis.====Under these circumstances, we shed light on the effects of prudential policy, several country-specific factors, and other bank-specific variables on loan growth in the CEE region by using a dynamic panel data model. This study has manifold objectives. First, we document the determinants of loan growth, highlighting prudential and lending toolkits, bank size, leverage, ownership, crisis effects, and country-specific variables. Second, we examine if loan growth responds similarly to changes in the prudential policy stance over the cycle period. Third, we investigate whether the effects of the prudential indices on loan growth differ according to the business cycle. Fourth, we test if loan growth depends on the ownership and crisis effects. Finally, we analyze if the effects of prudential lending framework changes are different when we account for bank size and leverage. Given our objectives and related studies, our paper adds to the literature, and to our knowledge, this is the first study to address the nexus between prudential policies and loan growth rates in CEE focusing on prudential lending frameworks and emphasizing the effects of crises.====There are several studies in the literature that are connected to our aims. Many papers document different determinants of loan growth (e.g. macroprudential policy, bank supervision, ownership, bank size, bank capitalization, bank liquidity, bank profitability, and bank credit risk). Despite its importance, the literature dedicated to the effect of macroprudential instruments on banks’ loan growth is scarce (Cerutti et al., 2017a; Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey, 2018; Erdem et al., 2017; Gersbach and Rochet, 2017; Cerutti et al., 2017b). Most of these papers use country-specific variables in their estimations. Investigating the effectiveness of macroprudential instruments in dampening the financial cycle for a large sample of 119 countries, Cerutti et al. (2017a) found that emerging economies most frequently use macroprudential policies. In general, the usage of such policies is correlated with decreases in the credit growth rate, especially in household credit. A similar analysis was conducted by Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (2018), according to whom macroprudential tightening is associated with lower bank credit growth, housing credit growth, and house price appreciation. Cerutti et al. (2017b) distinguished between the effectiveness of prudential instruments on credit growth. They emphasized that concentration and interbank exposure limits do not have a significant influence on credit growth, while changes in loan-to-value ratio limits, foreign reserve requirements, and local reserve requirements are counter-cyclical in relation to credit growth. Erdem et al. (2017) studied the effectiveness of macroprudential policies in controlling domestic credit growth in 30 emerging and developing economies in case of positive global liquidity shocks. Their findings indicate that macroprudential instruments were effective in restricting domestic credit growth during the expansion phase of the credit cycle.====The pro-cyclicality of credit is well documented in the literature. During upswings, banks tend to lend too much, and in downturns too little (Bernanke et al., 1996; Borio et al., 2001; Borio, 2014; Gersbach and Rochet, 2017). For the CEE region, similar behavior of banks was reported during the recent crisis (Cull and Pería, 2013; De Haas et al., 2015). Financial accelerators, information asymmetry, and lenient credit terms during growth periods are explanations for this behavior (Bernanke et al., 1996; Borio et al., 2001; Saurina and Jiménez, 2006). Given that the phase of a country’s business cycle influences credit demand and, consequently, the banks’ credit supply, we use the GDP growth rate to capture the business cycle. As there is a clear nexus between monetary policy and lending activity, we include interest rates in our models. We also introduce the exchange rate regime, as it is well known that the macroprudential framework is affected by a country’s exchange rate arrangement. Countries with a fixed exchange rate regime use more macoprudential tools as they do not have too much room for interest rate policies. Lim et al. (2011) suggests that the loan growth of these countries is linked to the capital inflows due to the fact that the guarantee of a fixed exchange rate represents a boost for the banks by increasing their credit through external funding. Under this motivation, we consider foreign claims growth as a country control. For robust results, we account for the event of a sharp increase or decrease in gross capital inflows by using two dummy variables, i.e. surge and stop, based on data extracted from Scheubel and Stracca (2016).====Along with the macro variables, we include three bank-specific characteristics that might affect credit supply in the context of macroprudential policy actions: bank size, leverage ratio, and foreign ownership. The empirical findings regarding the relationship between bank size and loan growth are mixed. On one hand, Duprey (2012); De Haas et al. (2015), and Laidroo (2016) detected a negative correlation between these two variables. On the other hand, Cull and Pería (2013) identified a positive correlation between size and loan growth during the crisis, while Gambacorta (2005) and Allen et al. (2017) discovered that bank size is irrelevant for the growth rate of lending. The nexus analysis between credit growth and bank leverage showed that banks with higher capital ratios, i.e. with lower leverage, are more stable in credit markets during crises (Chen and Liao, 2011; Beltratti and Stulz, 2012). However, for the CEE region, Allen et al. (2017); Cull and Pería (2013), and De Haas et al. (2015) did not find a significant relationship between leverage and loan growth, while Iwanicz-Drozdowska and Witkowski (2016) noted that leverage is the variable with the highest positive impact before the crisis. Concerning ownership, Allen et al. (2017) and Laidroo (2016) did not find significant differences between domestic and foreign banks’ loan growth rates in the CEE region. However, numerous papers documented asymmetries between domestic and foreign banks’ lending behavior when accounting for the nature of the crisis. For example, Cull and Pería (2013); Allen et al. (2017), and De Haas et al. (2015) showed that foreign banks had more pro-cyclical loan growth than domestic and public banks. Otherwise, during host country crises, lending by foreign banks was more stable compared to domestic banks (Allen et al., 2017; De Haas and van Lelyveld, 2006, 2015).====To address our goals, we formulate some research questions and summarize our results as follows. ==== Our results reveal that a tightening (loosening) prudential policy determines a decline (increase) in loan growth. ==== The empirical findings suggest that credit-based actions and measures strictly targeting credit growth have a negative effect on loan growth. In terms of magnitude, the effect of credit-based measures on loan growth is higher in comparison to the effect on all other prudential indices. ==== Both prudential indices that capture the actions taken with a credit growth purpose shift in the opposite direction with loan growth during tranquil periods, but this effect does not hold during distressed times. ==== As we expected, the state of the business cycle has a positive impact on loan growth, indicating that credit expansion is fuelled by economy boom phases. However, the interaction terms between GDP growth and prudential lending tools are statistically negative, revealing that the higher the economic growth, the lower the effect of prudential lending measures on credit growth. ==== We find that foreign banks respond to a change in lending actions by shifting their loan growth in the opposite direction by approximately 1.13 % compared to domestic banks. The interaction between ownership and crisis reveals that, in normal times, foreign banks recorded higher loan growth compared to domestic banks. ==== Our results indicate that smaller and less indebted banks have higher loan growth. Moreover, the analysis of interactions between credit-based measures and bank-specific variables reveal that the effects of prudential actions depend on bank size and leverage.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes countries’ experiences in applying prudential toolkits. Section 3 lays out the methodology and data used in the analysis, while Section 4 reports and discusses the empirical results.

The sample consists of 20 economies from around the world. Using quarterly data since the late 1990s, I find that the focus of some policymakers on the negative spillovers from monetary shocks is exaggerated. Four separate types of shocks are identified, and these can easily offset each other with a neutral to positive overall economic impact in some economies investigated here. However, a few economies, namely Brazil, Chile and China, experience a net economic loss from spillovers.","Even as the full effects of the Global or Great Financial Crisis (GFC) had yet to unfold, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke (2008) called attention to the role of commodity prices as a complicating factor in setting the course of monetary policy. He went on to ask: “…how should monetary policy deal with increases in commodity prices that are not only large but potentially persistent?” (Bernanke, 2008). The European Central Bank (ECB) would soon provide a test when the institution raised policy rates twice in April and July of 2011. The fear was that soaring commodity prices would unhinge expectations unless monetary policy was tightened, in spite of the single currency area being in the throes of a sovereign debt crisis. The central bank would soon reverse course and whether this contributed to a reputational loss remains in question.==== The Eurozone is not, however, a major exporter of commodities. Other central banks in commodity sensitive economies would also raise policy rates in spite of an ongoing financial crisis elsewhere (e.g., Canada in 2010, Sweden in 2010 and 2011). Both countries, of course, are resource-rich and major commodity exporters.====There is a tendency for macroeconomic models to focus on the links between monetary policy and the business cycle where a role for the financial cycle is often under-emphasized.==== In the case of commodity prices there is an equally common habit of treating them as exogenous determinants of output and prices. These positions are becoming less defensible because of the GFC of 2008–2009 and the Eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis of 2010 and beyond. For economies seen as resource-rich, the treatment of commodity prices as exogenous variables in conventional macro models is also questionable.====The present study estimates models that incorporate financial factors and also asks whether our understanding of macroeconomic activity is significantly influenced when we consider the impact of commodity prices as endogenous in estimated models. We examine the evidence for 20 economies. Six of the twenty economies are considered advanced (AE), while the remaining ones are generally labelled emerging market economies (EME).====Dynamic factor models are estimated for each economy individually and the possibility of spillover effects, especially from the US, is also investigated. Four factors are estimated. They are: real, financial, monetary, and commodity prices. More details follow in Sections 3 and 4. Data are quarterly from the late 1990s. I also separately examine whether important institutional developments over the past two decades, namely the spread of inflation targeting (IT), the introduction of unconventional monetary policies (UMP) or quantitative easing (QE), may have influenced key economic shocks over time.====Briefly, some of the key findings are as follows. First, estimates of factor models provide new insights into the evolution of macroeconomic and financial conditions over the sample considered. For example, factor scores for China indicate a loosening of financial conditions that are not as prominent if the same factor model is estimated for the full sample. Similarly, the loosening of monetary conditions in the US in the wake of the GFC is more apparent for time-varying than for full sample estimates.====Overall, I conclude that some of the focus on the (negative) spillovers of monetary shocks may be misplaced. To the extent that most EME in this study have demonstrated resilience to shocks suggests that, while outright policy coordination may not be essential, policy cooperation could reduce the potential incidence of spillovers. Four separate types of shocks are identified below and these can easily offset each other with a neutral overall economic impact on the domestic economies investigated here. Nevertheless, a few economies, namely Brazil, Chile, and China, are negatively impacted by US spillovers.====Finally, I report some evidence that IT economies on average experienced fewer monetary shocks, while AE were the principal beneficiaries of UMP. A key policy implication is that there has been an over-emphasis on believing that all spillovers from the US are negative. To be sure, some are. However, some economies, labelled resource-rich, were also the beneficiaries of positive spillovers, while several EME displayed resilience to external shocks.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A literature survey links the various strands of research concerning the role of financial factors and commodity prices, as well as UMP, in improving our understanding of monetary policy and real economic outcomes over time. The econometric methodology is outlined in Section 3. Section 4 describes the data and discusses some stylized facts before providing a summary of the main econometric estimates. The paper concludes in Section 5 with a summary, and a few policy implications are also drawn.","The macroeconomic response to real and financial factors, commodity prices, and monetary policy: International evidence",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362520301680,16 January 2021,2021,Research Article,99.0

We show that a green R&D subsidy is better (worse) than an emissions tax when the green R&D is efficient (inefficient), irrespective of R&D spillovers, whereas the existence of a publicly owned firm encourages the government to adopt a subsidy policy. We also show that the optimal policy choice depends on R&D efficiency and spillovers. In particular, when green R&D is inefficient and the spillover rate is low (high), the government should choose an emissions tax and (not) privatize the state-owned firm. When green R&D is efficient, however, an R&D subsidy is better, but a privatization policy is not desirable for society, irrespective of spillovers.","Over the past generation, global concern about climate change has led to the implementation of environmental policies in highly polluting industries around the world. As part of the Paris agreement, many countries submitted contributions based on their national conditions as well as environmental policies, including market-oriented mechanisms and stricter emissions standards. For example, many progressive countries have already adopted market-based environmental regulations using emissions taxes, cap-and-trade programs, and pollution abatement (green R&D) subsidies.====In the literature, researchers have made considerable efforts to evaluate various initiatives with a range of theoretical and empirical approaches. On the one hand, since the 1990s, many economists have explored the effect of emissions taxes and tradable permit systems in highly polluting markets. They showed that governments can promote social welfare by implementing a market allocation of tradable permits (quantity regulation) or emissions taxes (price regulation) because those mechanisms can minimize abatement costs when diﬀ ;erences are found in the abatement technologies used by regulated firms.==== Public policy with a green R&D subsidy has long been proposed to accelerate the adoption and diffusion of cleaner technologies and help support environmentally friendly products.====However, from the administrative perspective, that is, the ownership of firms, technological and managerial improvements in public domains have shown the possible benefits of public ownership in highly polluting industries. Research encouraging the development of cleaner technologies is receiving more attention from governments with mixed markets, where private firms compete against publicly owned firms that are concerned about the environment.==== In a first attempt, Beladi and Chao (2006) examined the environmental effect of public ownership, whereas Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2006) and Ohori (2006) investigated the effect of privatization policy on environmental regulation. Since then, a series of papers have explored the interaction between privatization policy and environmental regulation, but relatively few economic analyses have addressed the comparative welfare effects of different policy instruments in highly polluting industries.====In the study of economics, comparing emissions taxes to green R&D subsidies in oligopolies is clearly important in developing policies for a sustainable system. A considerable number of empirical and theoretical works on R&D incentives and policy implications have appeared. Many studies have concluded that both the R&D spillovers and the effectiveness of green R&D are critical for assessing the welfare effect of government intervention.==== For example, Poyago-Theotoky (2003) investigated the effect of emissions taxes and green R&D subsidies in a differentiated goods duopoly and compared market behavior between Cournot and Bertrand models to determine the optimal environmental policy. Youssef and Dinar (2011) analyzed the optimal combination of emissions taxes and R&D subsidies and showed that R&D investment is taxed when the marginal cost of pollution damage is sufficiently high. Poyago-Theotoky and Yong (2019) examined managerial compensation contracts in a Cournot duopoly and showed that the level of green R&D efficiency is crucial in the effect of an emissions tax on green R&D decisions. However, the parametric properties of green R&D technologies, such as R&D spillovers, R&D efficiency, and the progressive role of government ownership on environmental policy, are not sufficiently discussed.====In the recent scholarship on environmental policy in mixed markets, several works have demonstrated a significant relationship between government policy and green R&D technology. For example, Tsai et al. (2016) investigated government ownership with green R&D investment, and Kim et al. (2018) examined the effect of privatization on eco-technology licensing. In a mixed-duopoly market, Xing et al. (2019) considered green R&D subsidies with R&D spillovers, whereas Haruna and Goel (2019) examined the effect of emissions taxes on green R&D investment. Ouattara (2019) studied the impact of partial privatization on a firm’s R&D investment with emissions taxes. However, few comparisons have been conducted on policies, such as between emissions taxes and green R&D subsidies, despite the key role of such government policies in facilitating environmental innovation.====In this study, we perform policy comparisons between emissions taxes and green R&D subsidies in private and mixed markets, respectively, and investigate policy interactions with R&D spillovers and the efficiency of green R&D. We show that a green R&D subsidy is better for society than an emissions tax when the green R&D is efficient irrespective of R&D spillovers. This is because an R&D subsidy is more effective for firms’ R&D investments, which can directly reduce environmental damage at a lower emissions abatement cost. However, the reverse occurs when green R&D is inefficient. In that case, an emissions tax can directly reduce output production, which can indirectly reduce environmental damage at a higher emissions abatement cost. We also show that publicly owned firms are more aggressive in R&D investment and output production, either when green R&D is efficient or when green R&D is inefficient, but the spillovers are high. Thus, the existence of a publicly owned firm encourages the government to adopt a green R&D subsidy, rather than an emissions tax.====We then compare the two policies and examine the welfare effect of a privatization policy and analyze the relationship between that policy and environmental regulations. We show that when green R&D is efficient, a privatization policy does not improve social welfare, irrespective of R&D spillovers. Because publicly owned firms are more aggressive in their market activities when green R&D is efficient, they can achieve cost efficiency from R&D investment and allocational efficiency in output production. However, when green R&D is inefficient, the government should choose an emissions tax, whereas privatization policy depends crucially on the degree of R&D spillovers. Thus, a state-owned firm should be privatized only when spillovers are low. This is because a publicly owned firm can increase allocative efficiency from higher production output only when spillovers are high. Otherwise, however, privatization policy benefits society because publicly owned firms have a trade-off between cost efficiency and allocational efficiency.====Finally, we further examine an uncommitted tax policy and show that it is better than a committed tax policy in both private and mixed markets because the government can reduce the tax level, and thus firms can strategically increase their output. We then show that, under an uncommitted tax policy, a green R&D subsidy has better welfare effects with inefficient R&D whereas the emissions tax can have better welfare effects with efficient R&D only in the presence of publicly owned firms. Hence, a privatization policy in a time-consistent does not improve welfare.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a basic model of environmental regulations. In Sections 3 and 4, we provide the equilibrium results in private and mixed markets, respectively. We then examine the welfare effects of privatization policies in Section 5 and compare them to those with a committed tax policy in Section 6.

The scope of the assessment is broadened by exploring the effect of infrastructure development on sectoral differences in total factor productivity. The study calculated the total factor productivity over the period 2006–2016 for 16 ==== in 19 Asian countries. Further, the impact of lagged infrastructure and endowment is also explored with an eye toward improving different infrastructural measures. The empirical findings show that lagged infrastructure and endowment exert a positive and significant impact on infrastructural improvement. The impact of telecommunications, road, and power infrastructure on sectoral productivity is investigated by applying the fully modified ordinary least squares estimation technique to control the endogeneity problem associated with infrastructure provision. Overall, the empirical findings show that infrastructure provision, particularly the provision of telecommunications and power, is an important factor for explaining patterns of comparative advantage, whereas the provision of roads is important to explain patterns of absolute advantage. The results further indicate that road infrastructure is more important for low technology-intensive industries, while power infrastructure is crucial for high technology-intensive industries.","Infrastructural development has been extensively discussed in macroeconomic literature due to its impact on a country’s growth and development. Key indicators of physical infrastructure include the quality of roads, highways, airways, transport, telecommunications networks, and an adequate energy supply. The role of physical infrastructure in economic development is assessed based on the services provided by that infrastructure. The provision of efficient infrastructure services decreases trade and transaction costs, and helps with the mobility of goods and services and capital flows, which, in turn, positively affects economic growth via trade competitiveness and the diversification of exports (Kodongo and Ojah, 2016).====Infrastructural assets are associated with market failure because of their public good characteristics. Due to these characteristics, infrastructural assets require public intervention, as it is difficult to finance infrastructure through private investment, and returns on infrastructural assets materialize over a long period of time (McKinsey Global Institute, 2013). Due to its public good characteristics, the provision of key infrastructure, such as roads, highways, and power supply, is deeply embedded in the public domain. The public good nature of infrastructure assigns the government the responsibility of ensuring the provision of sound and efficient infrastructure. Therefore, infrastructural investments are largely controlled by government decision making and regulatory constraints. Consequently, government policy plays a decisive role in the establishment of infrastructure via decisions pertaining to public investment and the regulatory framework.====Infrastructure results in the geographic concentration of economic resources with wider and deeper markets for input, output, and employment (Gu and Macdonald, 2009). Moreover, it improves the population’s quality of life and strengthens national security (Baldwin and Dixon, 2008; Palei, 2015). Further, it facilitates economic exchange, not only domestically, but also internationally, through increased access to technology, education, and communication. Therefore, positive externalities induced by public infrastructure include higher productivity in private investments, increased efficiency in production, expanded foreign direct investment, and greater national and international integration (Aschauer, 1989a; Agenor and Moreno-Dodson, 2006; Fedderke et al., 2006; Dissou and Didic, 2013; Javid, 2019).====Adequate infrastructural facilities, like an uninterrupted supply of energy and well-operated transportation and telecommunications networks, are primary elements affecting any firm’s productivity. However, insufficient infrastructure capacity, like inadequate roads, electricity disruption, and a poor telecommunications network, act as barriers to export competitiveness and economic growth.====The existing literature shows that infrastructure improvement can play a significant role in achieving national competitiveness. There is an extensive body of literature that links infrastructural services to trade competitiveness and differences in productivity across countries at the industry level (see for example, Snieska and Draksaite, 2007; Yeaple and Golub, 2007; Jones, 2000; Harrigan, 1997; Golub and Hsieh, 2000; Snieska and Bruneckiene, 2009; Kodongo and Ojah, 2016). Several studies show that infrastructure capital is a key determinant that can influence economic and national competitiveness. Palei (2015) argues that national competitiveness is influenced by institutional and infrastructural development. Disparity in productivity at the sectoral level may affect international export specialization (Golub and Hsieh, 2000; Harrigan, 1997). Physical infrastructure, such as roads, power supply, telecommunications, and cross-border land access are important indicators of a country’s regional competitiveness (Snieska and Draksaite, 2007).====Most previous studies focused on the impact of infrastructure on aggregate productivity, which is referred to as absolute advantage. New theoretical literature suggests that the availability of infrastructure is likely to influence sectoral productivity, which is referred to as comparative advantage. Accordingly, Yeaple and Golub (2007) and Harrigan (1997) submit that infrastructure is likely to influence not only absolute advantage (total factor productivity, TFP) but also a country’s comparative advantage (sectoral productivity).==== The provision of infrastructure facilities is more crucial for some sectors of the economy. Empirical literature supports the hypothesis that the effect of infrastructure varies across different sectors of the economy (Feltenstein and Ha, 1995; Sturm, 2001; Morrison and Schwartz, 1992; Nadiri and Mamuneas, 1994; Cantos et al., 2005; Rioja, 2004; Lanau, 2017; Javid, 2019). Jones (2000) highlights the role infrastructural services play in reducing trade and transaction costs, which helps with international specialization and industrial location choices. Therefore, infrastructure helps to explain patterns of absolute and comparative advantage. The state can influence comparative and absolute advantage through its policies regarding the provision of infrastructure. For instance, several countries in the world have initiated specific infrastructure policies to attract foreign direct investment.====Recently, intra-regional trade has contributed substantially to Asia’s remarkable growth. Efforts to reduce intra-regional trade transaction costs have contributed significantly to economic growth and poverty alleviation in Asia. Asian economies have rapidly improved their economic situation, investment, and trade over the past two decades due to massive investment in infrastructure (Chatterjee, 2005; Straub et al., 2008; Sahoo and Dash, 2012).====Against this backdrop, the objective of this study is to analyze the effect of infrastructure on TFP in the context of Asian countries. The scope of the study is broadened by exploring the effect of infrastructural development on sectoral differences in TFP (comparative advantage). To the best of our knowledge, there are hardly any studies on Asian countries that measure the effects of infrastructure on TFP (absolute advantage) and sectoral productivity (comparative advantage). This study will contribute to the empirical literature by exploring the extent to which disparity in the availability of infrastructure contributes to differences in TFP across countries at the sectoral level, which, in turn, affects countries’ export and trade competitiveness.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

To review what is known until now, a global, multilingual database of 588 articles on MW effects is constructed spanning more than a century, from 1900 to 2020. Most of the studies belong to developed countries, and less than a third come from developing countries. The most researched subject during the period under review is the impact of the MW on employment, but the evidence is mixed independently of the country studied. Consequently, it is only possible to perform a meta-regression to suitably evaluate the impact of the MW on employment according to the number of studies collected on this topic. The meta-regression model is useful to explain the reasons for these differences. For this purpose, recently developed meta-analysis methods are implemented distinguishing between developed and developing countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that reviews articles on the effect of MW without limits on the analysis period, the variables relative to the labour market or the countries under consideration. The results show a negative publication bias for developed countries but not for developing countries. The impact of the MW on employment is negative in both groups, adjusting for that bias. This adverse effect is small but robust. Characteristics related to the control variables, the demographic groups concerned, the methods implemented and the inclusion of local fixed effects, trend or time dummies account for the estimated employment effect. Public policy recommendations are proposed based on the studies reviewed.","The minimum wage (MW) is one of the most controversial public policies (Gang and Tower, 1990). The first MW law was enacted in 1894 in New Zealand and was implemented in several countries after the Second World War. Since then, its role and social and economic effects have been extensively debated and researched. Over the years, the purpose of MW has evolved from a policy tool to be used selectively in a few low-wage sectors to an instrument of much broader coverage for all those who have jobs and need to guarantee a minimum level of remuneration.====The MW is often used as a public policy tool to reduce income inequality and poverty. It also serves as an indicator of labour productivity as well as the remuneration level in each country. MW systems are globally diverse, with many different policy approaches to achieve their effective application. Some countries have established simple systems that apply one MW for all employees, while others have more complex systems with multiple rates by sector of activity, occupation or geographical region.====Establishing and adjusting the wage level is the most challenging part of the MW setting process. If the MW is inadequately set, it is possible to observe effects contrary to the purposes for which it was created. If a level is set too low, the MW will have little effect on the protection of workers, but if it is too high, the MW will be poorly respected (International Labour Organization (ILO, 2016) or will have adverse effects on labour demand and employment quality. However, these and other impacts depend not only on the MW level but also on compliance. Both variables, in turn, can be affected by institutional factors such as the ineffectiveness of the inspection system, shortage of labour inspectors, the low impact of sanctions, trade unions and collective bargaining fragility (Rani et al., 2013).====Therefore, to ensure that the MW is an effective instrument of comprehensive coverage for workers, it is necessary to consider the economic context and the characteristics of the labour market. In some countries, substantial increases in the MW in economic slowdowns can be too steep for companies to absorb and therefore promote non-compliance. Conversely, if the economy is recovering and unemployment is falling, the MW will not necessarily affect labour demand, for example. The employment characteristics are relevant as well. The legal coverage of MW in developing countries is associated with the level of informal labour. Unregistered work also reduces the potential for the MW to redistribute income in favour of low-paid workers. If the MW raises all the labour costs calculated according to it, employers could promote the creation of low-quality employment to evade compliance. However, if an increase of the MW responds to the active participation of trade unions, the probability of non-compliance with the regulations is narrowed, and transitions from informal to formal jobs could increase (Groisman, 2015).====The effects of MW on the labour market are a matter of great importance in the ever-changing economic environment. This issue requires attention, particularly because of the intense debate about MW globally. To establish an adequate MW that meets its targeted objectives, it is essential to understand its impact and ensure that MW adjustments are adequately monitored and studied. To that end, a systematic review of empirical results could be useful. In the context of increasing the number of relevant articles, opposing arguments, and diverse results, meta-analyses enable a synthesis and systematisation of current scientific knowledge. The objective of this research is to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse articles that conducted an impact evaluation of the MW on any variable of the labour market. For this purpose, studies published in indexed journals worldwide over the longest period available were examined using search engines. The search includes a collection of articles covering more than a century differentiating between developing and developed countries.====The topic most frequently examined during the period of this literature review was employment. Consequently, it is only possible to suitably evaluate the impact of the MW on employment by performing a meta-regression analysis (MRA) according to the number of studies collected. Therefore, recently developed meta-analysis methods are implemented for this purpose. As far as is known, this is the first meta-analysis conducted without restrictions on the studies’ languages of composition, analysis period, or countries under exploration. This MRA is expected to reveal factors to explain the controversial findings regarding the impact of the MW on employment among countries and delineate future lines of research. Moreover, this paper aims to provide directives for public policies based on the summary of the main results and the evidence in the literature. This last objective requires robust evidence; therefore, the review includes only articles published in high-impact and rigorously indexed journals. To adopt an adequate policy approach, it is necessary to have reliable empirical data summarising evidence found globally that considers differences in MW systems and the economic and labour circumstances of each country (International Labour Organization (ILO, 2016). Meta-analysis articles can, therefore, provide useful information to support governments and social partners in their deliberations on setting an adequate level for the MW that suits the national context and the development of sustainable enterprises.",Are the effects of minimum wage on the labour market the same across countries?

While in advanced countries interventions in the banking sector were mostly related to a lack of liquidity and significant asymmetric information regarding counterparty risk, in many less advanced countries they had a precautionary motive. In our article, we investigate the effectiveness of policy interventions on healthy banking markets, with possible negative spill-over effects from other countries. To this extent, we use an event study methodology to test the effect of liquidity and financial sector policy announcements on interbank spread changes in six Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries over the period between 2007 and 2011. We find that standard liquidity interventions did not provide effective stabilization. In fact, our evidence suggests that the spread widened after their announcement, probably as a result of the negative signal and consequently increased risk aversion of banks. In such situations, regulators should consider policy instruments that aim to decrease uncertainty in the market.","During the global financial crisis of 2007–2011, the interbank markets in advanced countries stopped functioning efficiently. Banks, unsure about the depth of the problems of other banks’ balance sheets, were simply unwilling to lend to each other without significant accommodation for counterparty risk. Consequently, the interbank spreads increased significantly during this period and the volume of transactions decreased considerably. The existing literature explains this “phenomenon” mainly by the liquidity and counterparty credit risk existing in the interbank market during this time (McAndrews et al., 2009; Schwarz, 2009; Poskitt, 2011; Aït-Sahalia et al., 2012). In addition, some studies also claim that banks became extremely risk averse and preferred to accumulate liquidity rather than to transfer it to the market (Angelini et al., 2011; Acharya and Merrouche, 2012). To counteract the lack of liquidity in the interbank market, central banks (CBs) in most advanced countries stepped in and provided liquidity to the system through a wide set of instruments.====The global financial crisis, though originating in advanced economies, also extended to less advanced countries. In most of these countries, we could see an increase in the money market rates (Pan and Kenneth, 2008; Kocsis, 2016; Geršl and Lešanovská, 2014). However, banks in these countries seemed to escape both liquidity and capital problems. More interestingly, in some countries, banks experienced record profitability. For example, in 2008 ROE reached 17 % in Poland, 19 % in Hungary, and 16 % in the Czech Republic, while in Germany and France it was -11 % and 3%, respectively (Eurostat). More importantly, many of these less advanced countries’ banking sectors faced a liquidity surplus vis-à-vis the CB (National Bank of Poland (NBP, 2008, 2009; Kucharcukova et al., 2013; Queijo von Heideken and Sellin, 2014). Despite this fact, regulators decided to intervene in the interbank markets to counteract potential further consequences of the global crisis. The set of policy measures in the banking sector was wide; however, CB interventions dominated. For example, policymakers implemented repo operations and extended the collateral framework. In addition, many of them decreased reserve requirements and eased interest rates. However, only a few decided to inject some financial instruments aimed at restoring general confidence in the financial market.====In our study, we examine how different policy measures that are common during a crisis in a banking sector with liquidity shortage worked in countries where banks had enough liquidity and capital, but were more concerned with global uncertainty. Specifically, we study how money market rates behave in such countries, and whether, and which type of, intervention affects their behavior.====To answer our question, we design our study following Aït-Sahalia et al. (2012), who analyze how policy announcements in the US, the UK, the euro area, and Japan during 2007 and 2009 affected the interbank spreads in these countries. Similarly, we evaluate how the money market spreads reacted to the policy announcements between 2007 and 2011. Our sample includes six less advanced, though important, European countries: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the three Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The choice of the sample has been dictated by the fact that these banking sectors did not face any financial problems during the crises; however, as their banking structures exhibit high percentages of foreign banking ownership, the problems in advanced countries might have transferred to these countries. Moreover, all these countries were characterized by high liquidity in their banking sector (Laidroo, 2016; Csavas et al., 2011, p. 386–388; Queijo von Heideken and Sellin, 2014).====We use daily spreads between the 3-month interbank offered rate (IBOR) and the 3-month interest swap (OIS), as well as the spreads between the 5-year interest swaps (IRS) and government bonds of the same maturity. To analyze how effective the standard liquidity instruments were in stabilizing the situation during the crisis in markets with a banking liquidity surplus, we constructed a detailed database of all policy initiatives announced in all six countries between March 15, 2007 and December 21, 2011. The database covers both domestic and international announcements related to monetary policy (interest rate decisions, quantitative and credit easing), liquidity support (in domestic and foreign currency), and financial sector policy (mostly liability guarantees and deposit insurance). Then, following the methodology of Aït-Sahalia et al. (2012), we use an event study to assess how successful macroeconomic and financial sector policy announcements were in addressing the global uncertainty in the banking sector. Finally, we employ a parametric test of means to evaluate whether the policy announcements had an economically and statistically significant impact on interbank risk premiums.====In theory, it is hard to expect any clear direction from the CB’s actions on the spread change in our sample countries. On the one hand, we might expect a negative effect of such actions because in markets with surplus liquidity, CB actions can break the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. If there is an effective monetary policy implementation, then changes in CB rates are fully and rapidly reflected in changes in the interbank rates, and then in the wider structure of rates in the banking system. This is especially underpinned by the existence of a liquidity shortage in the interbank market because it forces the market into transactions, which allows the CB to exploit its position as the monopoly supplier of domestic currency (Ganley, 2004). By contrast, when markets experience surplus liquidity, the transmission mechanism can break down because banks have a discretion as to whether they lend their surplus reserves. The CB cannot force banks to lend, so, to one extent or another, the CB’s ability to transmit its preferred interest rate or any other instrument into the market is weakened. Moreover, when the spreads are not driven by counterparty risk, but rather by other external factors such as general uncertainty, the CB’s actions may even intensify risk aversion among banks, as these might signal “bad information.” Consequently, Brunetti et al. (2011) document that CB interventions create greater volatility and reduce the trading volume of the interbank market. This may therefore lead to greater risk aversion and precautionary motives for banks to hoard liquidity (Angelini et al., 2011; Acharya and Merrouche, 2012; Heider et al., 2015). On the other hand, some academic evidence demonstrates that policy interventions have a stabilizing effect on the interbank market, and without them, the spreads would have been much larger (Christensen, 2009; Aït-Sahalia et al., 2012). In particular, the market might view international interventions positively due to the greater creditworthiness of international institutions and potential financial support such institutions can offer (Papi et al., 2015). They might also bring confidence into the market, especially, in markets dominated by foreign capital due to their higher creditworthiness.====Our results document that the global financial crisis affected the interbank markets in our sample countries, especially following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Consequently, we notice that all spread measures changed negatively. However, the policy interventions, which should have stabilized the market, induced an even further increase in interbank prices. We document that the ease of interest rate and liquidity support measures led to an increase in IBOR-OIS spreads and a decrease in swap spreads in our sample countries. This seems to be consistent with the view that in markets that do not have a liquidity shortage, intervention does not bring a stabilization effect, as banks have discretion in how to use their funds’ surplus. However, the global uncertainty makes them reluctant to lend. More importantly, the liquidity injection announcement might signal “negative information,” to which banks might react nervously, as our evidence of the spread change shows.====More specifically, we show that the market reacted particularly negatively to repo transactions. The spread increase was the highest after the announcement of this type of support. This result is not surprising, given that in some countries, such as Poland, the CB stopped the repo transactions, due to the lack of demand from market participants. The evidence suggests that the intervention did not help, leaving banks highly risk averse.====Interestingly, we do not find any statistically significant results on the effect of financial market policy announcements. This might be interpreted as a positive signal, given that the market reacted nervously to other policy announcements. However, the weak power of the statistical tests due to limited policy actions probably does not allow us to ultimately confirm our assumption. Finally, we notice the spillover effects of policy interventions on our spread measures in other countries. Our results suggest that these effects were statistically significant, especially after the announcement of CB actions. However, the sign of the effect was the same as during domestic announcements, where we notice a negative reaction to the announcements on the spread. The reason for the spillover is that the banking sectors in the CEE countries are dominated mainly by foreign capital, which drives similar behavior between the banks. This is in line with Kocsis (2016) and Kliber (2014), who document that uncertainty increased the risk correlation between neighborhood countries in the CEE region. Our results are robust with regard to five-day and three-day event windows, as well as across different interbank distress measures. They also stay consistent if we exclude Baltic states, which might be more exposed to European announcements due to their currency regimes towards the euro.====Our results are novel and add to the current debate on the effectiveness of policy interventions in countries with a liquidity surplus. So far, it is not clear how policymakers should react in such countries (see, for example, Ganley, 2006). In the case of a liquidity shortage, CB operations, including monetary policy instruments, have mostly worked well so far. However, if the banking crises do not relate to a liquidity problem, the CB’s standard policies might not be effective, as they will not have a material effect on bank behavior. In our study, we show how different interventions work in sectors equipped with sufficient funds. The evidence seems to be very timely, as the number of countries with a liquidity surplus toward their CBs has increased steadily since 2010 (Queijo von Heideken and Sellin, 2014). Moreover, our results also extend the literature on the effectiveness of interventions in less advanced countries. This literature is still very limited, with most studies focusing on advanced economies. Finally, our study contributes to the discussion on the role and success of different policy interventions during the crisis. This debate is still unsolved due to inconsistent results in the academic literature. We show that the policy initiatives do not always work and that interventions should address the specific problems of countries’ banking sectors.====The paper is organized as follows. The second section discusses how our study contributes to the existing literature. Section 3 describes the measures of market distress, whereas Section 4 analyzes the behavior of the spread measures in the CEE countries. Section 5 describes the policy announcements in the CEE countries and Section 6 the methodology.

We use a unique dataset covering 5555 cities in Brazil, with granular information on credit characteristics. We find that non-earmarked credit to the corporate sector is associated with municipal economic growth more strongly than earmarked credit, despite the increase in the relevance of the latter after the global financial crisis. We also find that the type of credit—whether the loans are general purpose or for a specific purpose—is associated with economic growth in different ways. Overall, credit provided to the corporate sector by domestic private banks is correlated with higher economic growth rates. In contrast, the relationship between credit from state-owned banks and economic growth becomes statistically significant only after the crisis. Although we follow the finance-growth literature in our empirical exercises using internal instruments in generalized method of moments (GMM) estimations, we also conduct robustness tests using two additional external instruments: the number of complaints filed against each bank and local credit accessibility. Our findings with external instruments are the same with respect to the use of traditional internal instruments in GMM estimations.","Over the past few years, a vigorous debate has taken place on the finance-growth nexus and the role of banks (Benhabib and Spiegel, 2000; Combes et al., 2019; Iamsiraroj and Ulubas¸og˘lu, 2015; Islam and McGillivray, 2020). We contribute to the literature by studying the finance-growth nexus in Brazil using unique datasets. First, we explore how different credit characteristics are related to economic growth. Second, we analyze whether the link between financial development and economic growth changed after the global financial crisis (GFC). By matching unique data on granular loan-level credit operations to the corporate sector and city-level economic and social development indicators, we analyze the relationship between credit from state-owned, domestic-private, and foreign banks and local economic growth. We also outline the relation between economic growth and credit from commercial, investment, development banks, and credit unions in each Brazilian city. We also look at whether different types of credit—that is, whether they have a specific purpose—are correlated with economic growth in cities. Although we find a statistically significant link in the finance-growth nexus in Brazil, we find that this relationship changed after the GFC.====Many studies regarding the finance-growth nexus use cross-country data, which is hard to interpret because of the diversity in historical experience, cultural norms, and institutional contexts. That is why we focus on domestic city-level data from Brazil. Brazil is an emerging market country that experienced tremendous credit growth in the mid-2000s, especially between 2004 and 2008. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) had annual growth rate of 6 percent in 2007 and 2008, just before the GFC. GDP in 2008 increased 26.5 percent over the level in 2003, equivalent to average annual growth of 4.8 percent.====Although the rapid credit growth seems to have fueled economic growth to some extent, the pace of economic growth was somewhat lower. The question of how the quality of lending and who obtains credit affects economic growth is very relevant for policy makers. This fact becomes even more important in the Brazilian case because of its bank-oriented economy. As capital markets are underdeveloped, bank credit is the only source of external funding for the average firm. In this way, the role of bank financing in economic growth stands as an important point worth investigating.====Brazil has the largest financial and banking system in Latin America. The Brazilian banking system comprises financial institutions with diverse ownership structures. State-owned banks have an important presence in the economy and fund a significant share of the corporate and housing markets. The federal government exercises strong intervention in the form of prudential regulation, price regulation, and direct quantity regulation through subsidized loans. Credit in the Brazilian banking system is usually grouped into earmarked and non-earmarked credit.====Earmarked loans comprise a significant share of the Brazilian credit market and are directed to specific sectors or activities through resources regulated by law. They include mandatory lending to specific sectors, such as small rural producers and a subset of households to finance specific assets, such as low-income families buying their first home. The supply of long-term credit is mainly in the form of earmarked loans. These loans are granted through government programs that seek to address specific market failures in the banking system. For example, most of the lending for housing is earmarked, with interest rates below market rates for non-earmarked loans. In this paper, we show that the relationship between bank financing and economic growth differs between earmarked and non-earmarked credit.====The impact of state-owned and private banks on economic growth is not clear. They differ in several respects, such as institutional arrangements and goals, but it is an empirical question as to whether these distinctions are complementary and generate higher economic growth rates. For instance, Brazilian state-owned banks engaged in countercyclical policy making during the GFC. Has this behavior had an impact on municipal economic growth? Additionally, because of higher information asymmetry, does the role of foreign banks in economic growth change during times of distress, such as the GFC? Our empirical results document the relationship between financial development and economic growth based on several bank- and loan-specific characteristics, making an important contribution to the literature.====The finance-growth literature has some empirical identification challenges, as financial development has an endogenous relation to economic growth. Endogeneity can lead to inconsistent estimates and incorrect inferences, which can yield misleading conclusions and inappropriate theoretical interpretations. To mitigate endogeneity, the finance-growth literature usually resorts to generalized method of moments (GMM) estimations with internal instruments, in contrast to the usual ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation. Internal instruments normally include first-differenced or in-levels lagged values of endogenous (instrumented) regressors. However, if the endogenous variable has any relation to their past values—which is likely in most cases—then endogeneity is still a concern (Blundell and Bond, 1998).====This paper does not address the issue of causality between financial development and economic growth. Instead, we document a series of statistical relationships between bank financing and local economic growth from different perspectives. We follow the standard finance-growth literature and use dynamic panel-data estimation (Blundell and Bond, 1998) with internal instruments. To complement these results, we also run two-stage instrumental regressions as robustness tests, in which we instrument financial development using two external instruments. In the first test, we instrument bank-specific credit growth with the number of complaints local customers filed against that bank. As complaints increase, demand for credit from that bank tends to decrease, likely reducing the growth of outstanding bank credit. In the second test, we instrument credit growth with a proxy for credit accessibility in a city. The more accessible banks are, the greater the likelihood that customers will engage in credit operations with those banks. Our results remain qualitatively unchanged across different specifications, regardless of the use of internal or external instruments and the estimation method. Additionally, we run further robustness tests to account for the potential issue of transfers among firm branches that could cause a mismatch between the city that receives the credit and the city that actually uses it.====The use of GMM estimators has some practical problems. For instance, the literature has some evidence on the vulnerability of GMM as a consequence of the abundance of internal instruments, discouraging improvement in the two-step over one-step GMM findings, poor size control of test statistics, and weakness of instruments, especially when the dynamic adjustments process is slow, with a unit root of nearly 1. To mitigate this concern, we run Im et al.’s (2003) panel data unit-root tests and show that our variables do not have unit roots. In addition, it is well known that imposing invalid coefficient restrictions and employing regressors wrongly as instruments often leads to relatively small estimated standard errors. Hence, they provide misleading information on the actual precision of the estimators, which often have serious biased.==== To mitigate this issue, we use robust standard errors in our GMM estimations.====Our results show that the non-earmarked credit is related to economic growth more strongly than earmarked credit is. However, we find evidence that earmarked credit becomes more relevant to economic growth than non-earmarked credit after the onset of the GFC, which may be explained in part by countercyclical behavior in the credit market by state-owned banks after the crisis.====We also find that the type of credit matters for economic growth.==== We find that loans with a specific purpose play a larger role in explaining economic growth than general-purpose loans or other kinds of credit. However, after the GFC, our estimates change, and general-purpose loans are correlated more strongly with growth. These findings may be explained in part by the fact that financially constrained (small) firms might have higher demand for short-term credit to withstand unexpected negative events due to the sudden increase in risk aversion and decrease in international demand for goods and suppliers.====We also find that domestic state-owned and private banks and foreign banks are positively related to economic growth. Our results suggest that domestic private banks play an essential role in economic growth in Brazilian cities. However, state-owned banks are more strongly related to higher economic growth after the GFC than in the pre-crisis period. In our empirical test, we also find that foreign banks help foster economic growth and that this impact is smaller after the GFC. Our results are similar to those in Du et al. (2018), who find that foreign banks in Chile help promote lending and thus are important drivers of economic growth. The diminution in the impact may be due to a reduction in the share of foreign banks after the crisis. With respect to the type of bank, commercial banks are more relevant in explaining growth. We also find that credit unions are correlated with growth, especially after the GFC, despite their relatively small market share and greater concentration in specific regions in Brazil.====In our estimations, we control for the human development indexes for health, education, and income. These indices may be seen as proxies for the institutional quality of local governments. It is worthwhile to point that Slesman et al. (2019) find that variables for good-quality political institutions are crucial in translating financial development into higher economic growth. Therefore, controlling for these institutional variables is important. We also use fixed effects to control for unobserved characteristics.====We also study determinants related to economic growth other than financial development, such as income distribution and social inequality. A worse income distribution tends to reduce economic growth. Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2008) focus on redistributive policies to reduce inequality with positive effects on economic growth. As reviewed by Aghion et al. (1999), some models suggest that public policies that redistribute income from the rich to the poor reduce the negative growth effects of income inequality and therefore boost aggregate growth. In turn, Beck et al. (2007) propose an alternative policy approach in which financial sector reforms are aimed at reducing market friction, lower income inequality, and boost growth, without the potential incentive problems associated with redistributive policies. Our work documents statistical evidence of the role of variables other than financial development variables that may influence economic growth.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follow.

It has been theoretically argued that this culminates in suboptimal portfolio diversification, which in turn adversely affects risk-adjusted returns. We offer empirical evidence that such a conceived portfolio diversification “penalty” is far from a foregone conclusion, at least empirically. Our results tend to indicate that Islamic portfolios are not invariably handicapped in terms of portfolio diversification. We also explored dimensions that may account for differences in the relative investment performance between Islamic and conventional portfolios, such as portfolio constraints, short selling and market conditions. We believe this paper is among the first to apply substantial empirical analysis specifically with respect to the portfolio diversification perspective on Islamic equity investments.","Diversification in financial assets has been subjected to academic rigour for decades. Since the advent of the modern portfolio theory championed by Markowitz, there is arguably little apparent dearth in research addressing various diversification perspectives. One aspect that has received some attention is the effect that constraints applied to portfolios would have in terms of diversification. Rudd (1981) argues theoretically that when a given portfolio is constrained, its performance will be affected. Using the case of stock portfolios avoiding firms that had dealings with the then-Apartheid South Africa, it was hypothesized that portfolios subjected to ethical screening would report an inferior performance, primarily due to size and other biases. Grossman and Sharpe (1986) found some empirical support for Rudd’s argument. The basic concept here is that having a smaller pool of potential stocks to choose from is detrimental to diversification, which in turn affects the risk-adjusted returns.====Shari’ah compliant stocks or simply Islamic equities represent a growing investment category paralleling socially responsible investing. Islamic principles and tenets are employed to screen stocks deemed unacceptable for investment by Muslim investors. Typically, firms involved in sectors like interest-based finance, gambling and gaming, tobacco and alcohol are excluded from Islamic stock portfolios. In a rising number of Shari’ah jurisdictions, financial ratios are also applied to limit the reported quantum of interest income, interest-based debt and receivables. Investor portfolios and funds adhering to the rules of Shari’ah compliance are unmistakeably a form of constrained portfolio. Just as much research has been devoted to comparing socially responsible funds with mainstream ones, and, in particular, examining diversification differences and their impact on performance, it makes sense to do the same for Islamic equities. In a diversified portfolio, how much a particular security contributes to the overall risk depends on the covariance of that security with other securities in the portfolio. Risks attributable to individual securities are diversified away. Given the assertions of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), equity returns only reflect systematic (undiversifiable) risk. When a portfolio is constrained, as is the case with a Shari’ah compliant portfolio, it is arguably less diversified and in turn its risk-return performance may be sub-optimal.====Relating to the case of ethical funds in South Africa mentioned above, it can be argued that while a morally screened portfolio may be less diversified, the resulting small-stock bias may actually work to its advantage. There is ample empirical evidence that small stocks have historically outperformed larger stocks (the so-called small stock risk-return anomaly in the CAPM literature). It follows that a number of recent empirical investigations find no statistically discerning evidence that the performance of socially responsible mutual funds is different from that of conventional ones (Diltz, 1995; Sauer, 1997; Goldreyer et al., 1999; Statman, 2000). More pertinently, if it is true that Islamic portfolios have less diversification, why do ==== empirical results indicate that they have outperformed or are on par with conventional portfolios (for example, see Ashraf and Mohammad, 2014; Charles et al., 2015; Bousalam and Hamzaoui, 2016; Dharani and Natarajan, 2011; Walkshausl and Lobe, 2012; Binmahfouz and Hassan, 2013)? It may be the case that the idea that less portfolio diversification implies suboptimal risk-adjusted returns is only valid theoretically. In reality, this intuition may not be observed empirically. We believe that tackling this from an empirical perspective can contribute to demystifying the issue.====It can be noted that some investors are constrained to only investing in Shari’ah compliant equities. For this reason, the scope of our analysis includes an investigation of factors that may have a bearing on the extent that diversification levels impact investment performance. More specifically, we examine the impact of allowing short selling and the use of portfolio constraints such as setting minimum weights for a given portfolio constituent. In addition, sub-period analysis is performed, segregated by events of financial crisis. With these, investors would potentially find practical use for our findings in making informed investment decisions as well as in managing their equity portfolios.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section is a review of some related literature, Section 3 describes the data and the empirical methodology, and Section 4 discusses the empirical findings while offering some intuitive interpretations.

This paper employs a longitudinal individual-level dataset—the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS)—to study the impact of trade liberalization on the relative ==== of various groups of workers in Russia. More specifically, we use the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a quasi-natural experiment to analyze the impact of trade liberalization on workers at different skill levels and types of firms. Our analysis reveals significant trade-induced job polarization, meaning that, in the tradable sector, even though employment and wages are increasing for low-wage and the high-wage occupations, they are shrinking for mid-wage occupations, leading to a higher poverty rate for workers seeking employment in mid-wage occupations in that sector. Our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks, and they point to the crucial role of state-owned enterprises in attenuating the adverse effects of trade shocks on the welfare of workers.","In recent years, research on employment and wages has become increasingly popular. This is evident in the existing labor market studies—for instance, Blanchard and Willmann (2016); Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2019); Goos et al. (2014), and Utar (2018). The trade literature has had a continuing discussion on how the labor market responds to trade liberalization. For instance, Keller and Utar (2016) examine whether international trade causes job polarization in Denmark. Their results revealed that import competition from China is highly associated with shrinking medium-skilled employment in that country. In a recent study, Utar (2018) finds that the affected workers adjust by obtaining more education.====In this study, we present robust evidence suggesting that trade affects poverty in Russia and that the underlying link is job polarization. Job polarization is produced when employment and wages increase in low- and high-wage occupations while shrinking in mid-wage occupations. Specifically, we pose the following questions: What is the effect of tariff cuts on relative poverty in Russia? Does the impact of tariff reduction on poverty depend on the skills of workers and their firm? What is the channel through which tariff cuts affect poverty?====To answer these questions, we use an individual-level dataset from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) covering the period 2004–2018. The RLMS is a representative survey of Russia designed to monitor the impact of various economic and health policy reforms in the country. Why do we study Russia? Russia is our country of interest for three reasons. First, most existing studies investigating whether trade causes skill-biased growth focus on developed countries (Blanchard and Willmann, 2016; Keller and Utar, 2016; Utar, 2018). By focusing on a developing country, such as Russia, we confirm whether the findings in existing studies hold for a developing country.====Second, a substantial share of Russian enterprises are under state control. For instance, according to Di Bella et al. (2019), in Russia, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for more than 33 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. Also, more than 40 percent of total employment in 2007 was at SOEs. SOEs undoubtedly play a vital role in the achievement of high economic growth and development, especially in socialist countries. In addition, Qi and Kotz (2020) provide empirical evidence confirming that SOEs contribute significantly to long-run economic growth in China and that they can cushion the impact from reduced regional economic activity. Hence, an ongoing debate concerns whether developing countries should embrace state capitalism as a useful model of economic development. A deep understanding of how the number of privately owned enterprises (POEs) and SOEs in several countries affects the labor market would go a long way in advancing this debate.====Third, Russia has carried out numerous economic reforms, the most prominent being its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2012. Given the country’s weak bargaining position in the negotiation over accession, joining the WTO in 2012 is arguably an exogenous shock (see Baccini et al., 2019; Liu and Qiu, 2016). We also observe a massive drop in Russia’s tariffs after accession to the WTO. For example, the simple average tariff rate for all products fell from about 14 percent in 1997 to 8.1 percent in 2013 and 4.9 percent in 2018. This tariff reduction varies considerably across industries. As a result, we can assess the effect of trade liberalization on poverty using a simple difference-in-difference (DID) model.====Therefore, we start by analyzing how tariff cuts affect workers’ probability of poverty. Unlike previous studies, which use the degree of exposure to import competition==== due to accession to the WTO as an exogenous shock, we divide the industries in which workers are employed into tradable and nontradable industries. The underlying assumption is that the tariff reductions were higher in tradable industries than in nontradable industries. We find that the probability of workers’ being poor was higher among those in tradable industries than those in nontradable industries.====A primary econometric concern is the problem of selection bias. Specifically, the characteristics of workers in tradable industries differ from those employed in nontradable industries in numerous respects, which could affect their likelihood of being poor. We mitigate this selection bias by using propensity score matching (PSM). This method allowed us to generate a treated sample of workers who are comparable to workers in the control group on all observed covariates.====To understand the heterogeneous impact of the trade shock, we estimate the impact of tariff reduction on the poverty status of workers at different skill levels. Following Keller and Utar (2016), we divide workers into three groups according to their wage level: high wage, midwage, and low wage. The high-wage workers are managers, professionals, technicians, and associate professionals. Mid-wage workers mainly consist of clerical support workers, plant and machine operators and assemblers, and craft and related trade workers. Low-wage workers are workers in elementary occupations and service and sales workers. We then estimate separate regressions for each group. We find that the relevant results in the main estimation regarding poverty come from workers in mid-wage occupations. Among high- and low-wage workers, those in tradable industries have a lower likelihood of being poor. But for mid-wage workers, those in tradable industries are more likely to be in poverty.====Finally, we search for the possible channel through which tariff reductions affect poverty. We show that trade-induced job polarization is one channel through which trade liberalization affects workers’ poverty status. We show that tariff reductions raise the probability of employment for tradable industry workers in high- and low-wage occupations but reduced the chances of employment for midwage workers. We also show that tradable industry workers in both high- and low-wage occupations earn more than workers in a nontradable industry. This situation is reversed for workers in midwage occupations in tradable industries.====This study contributes to three strands of the literature. First, several studies have documented empirical evidence confirming that exposure to tariff cuts influences the level of poverty (Aredo et al., 2011; Attanasio et al., 2004; Castilho et al., 2012; McCaig, 2011; Orden, 2006; Topalova, 2007). Castilho et al. (2012) employ household-level data and show that households living in states exposed to a tariff reduction experience a reduction in poverty and inequality. Le Goff and Singh (2013) also find that trade liberalization reduces poverty, especially in countries with strong institutions, a high education level, and a well-developed financial sector. We contribute to this literature by investigating how tariff reduction affects poverty in a country with a high percentage of SOEs, using an individual-level dataset. We also show that the effect of tariff reduction on poverty depends on workers’ skills and the type of firm.====Another strand of literature to which this paper contribute is investigating how trade liberalization affects wage inequality (Dasgupta and Osang, 2002; Feenstra and Hanson, 1999; Galiani and Sanguinetti, 2003; Han et al., 2012; Haskel and Slaughter, 2003; Hijzen, 2007; Janeba, 2003; Mehta and Hasan, 2012; Townsend, 2007). For instance, Townsend (2007) exploits the exogenous variation in industry tariff cuts due to the free trade agreement between Canada and the United States and shows that workers’ earnings fell more in industries that were more exposed to the tariff cut. Most of these confirm whether the findings of previous studies apply to a developing country.====Finally, more recent literature examines the issue of trade-induced job polarization (Adermon and Gustavsson, 2015; Antonczyk et al., 2018; Autor et al., 2013, 2014, 2015; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2015; Goos and Manning, 2007; Utar, 2018). We contribute to this literature by showing that job polarization is a channel through which tariff reduction affects poverty in Russia.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses Russia’s economic reforms and its accession to the WTO, labor market characteristics, the dataset, and the empirical strategy. Section 3 reports the main estimation results and robustness checks. Section 4 discusses the channel through which tariff cuts affect poverty, and section 5 concludes the paper.",A micro-level insight on trade-induced job polarization and poverty in Russia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362520301552,19 November 2020,2020,Research Article,106.0

We make an attempt to overcome some problems associated with previous studies; the aggregation problem, inadequate measures of volatility, short-run focus and the endogeneity problem. Using a GARCH specification, we focus on long-run volatility, while we control for the endogeneity problem by applying SYS-GMM estimation. The obtained results show that the impact of the unexplained component of real exchange rate volatility on FDI differs among economic activities since 2000. As part of the re-estimation exercise, we use two alternative measures of volatility to avoid arbitrariness. The obtained results are to a large extent in accordance with the first one.","There is a growing number of studies analysing the impact of different determinants on foreign direct investment (FDI) in transition countries (see, e.g., Damijan et al., 2003; Hanousek et al., 2011; Acaravci and Ozturk, 2012; Nicolova, 2013; Savaiu et al., 2013; Kejžar, 2016; Andrijić and Barbić, 2018). According to Jensen (2004); Chaido et al. (2014) and Estrin and Uvalic (2013), this is to be expected, keeping in mind that foreign capital has played a significant role in these countries throughout the twenty-year transition period from centrally planned to market economies. During the early 2000s, foreign investors required only a few minimal conditions – basic security, beginnings of economic recovery and modest improvements in the business environment (see, e.g., Masso, 2002; Shrikhandle, 2002; Nakamura et al., 2012). In this period, the majority of FDI entering transition economies was related to large privatization projects. Almost twenty years later, attention started to shift to other determinants (see, e.g., Rodriguez and Bustillo, 2015; Yean et al., 2018). One of these is certainly exchange rate volatility. Due to the fact that exchange rate volatility influences expected profits, uncertainty about future exchange rate volatility can affect FDI decisions. Another reason why exchange rate volatility could be a determinant of FDI in transition countries emerged partly from the prospect of the European monetary union. However, despite a growing literature analysing the impact of different determinants on FDI in transition countries, there are only few studies that examine the influence of exchange rate volatility on FDI. We strive to fill this gap.====There are a few potential problems associated with the analysis of the effect of exchange rate volatility on FDI. First, the majority of the previous studies used aggregate FDI data. The results obtained from these studies probably suffer from aggregation bias and may lead to unreliable conclusions, considering that the influence of exchange rate volatility on FDI might differ among economic activities and by FDI motive (see Kiyota and Urata, 2004).==== Second, some researchers suggested that there is an absence of adequate treatment of exchange rate volatility (Amuendo-Dorantes and Pozo, 2001; Pain and van Welsum, 2003). Third, the focus of most previous empirical studies was on short-run volatility, not long-run misalignment, as was criticized by Jeanneret (2005).==== Finally, Russ (2007) showed that the results of partial analyses based on regressing FDI flows on any measure of exchange rate volatility may be subject to endogeneity bias.====In addition, Cavallari and d’Addonna (2013) found that real uncertainty is crucial for the decision to invest abroad. Hence, we convert nominal into real terms using producer price indices, considering that these prices heavily influence the decisions of foreign investors. Following Kiyota and Urata (2004) and Schmidt and Broll (2009), we assume that the failures of the law of one price are not part of “true” exchange rate volatility. In order to focus on an unexplained component of real volatility, we estimate regressions that should explain whether distance, national borders and market size affect real exchange rate volatility in transition economies. Also, we assume that an unexplained component of real exchange rate volatility has an impact on FDI. Theory proposes that the linkages between FDI and exchange rates are likely to be different among economic activities and by FDI motive, hence these linkages may be revealed at disaggregated levels (see, e.g., Phillips and Ahmadi-Esfahani, 2008). According to the obtained results, Dennis et al. (2008) showed that the influence of exchange rates on FDI reflects heterogeneity across different types of FDI. Our analysis is based on data of aggregated FDI and FDI disaggregated by economic activities. In order to overcome the aggregation bias, we focus on three major economic activities in which foreign investors have mostly invested; manufacturing, financial intermediation and transport and communication. Given the results of previous studies, we assume that the influence of exchange rate volatility on FDI might differ by FDI motive. Another assumption is related to the GARCH specification. Namely, we assume that by using the GARCH specification we focus on long-run volatility.==== Additionally, we assume that using different measures of exchange rate volatility, such as GARCH (1,1), EGARCH (1,1) and SD, we avoid arbitrariness. Finally, we assume that our analysis controls for the endogeneity problem by adding lags and leads of the regressors. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first that tries to overcome the criticism arising from previous studies on the relationship between the unexplained component of real exchange rate volatility and FDI in transition countries. This is in contrast with the more typical approach of examining the effect of exchange rate volatility on FDI.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

Using graph theory and a recently developed time series technique, we are able to identify the systemically important sector in the market and the patterns of risk spillovers across sectors over time. Unlike standard econometric modeling, graph theory enables us to approach this question in a more reader-friendly way. The empirical results show that Industrial sector plays a central role and should thus be considered the systemically most important sector in the Chinese stock market. The spillover structure is found to be time-varying. While Industrial sector dominates the system for most of the time, other sectors such as Consumer Discretionary sector also occasionally appear as the central sector. Our empirical results also indicate that the simple correlation-based approach can produce equally useful information as more advanced econometric models.","Financial markets have become remarkably volatile since the 2008 global financial crisis. This has attracted enormous attention from both academia and regulators trying to model interconnectedness in financial markets and understand the patterns of how risks spread across sectors or markets. Systemic risk in financial markets threatens “====” (Billio et al., 2012) and impairs “====” (European Central Bank (ECB), 2010). It is widely observed that since the 2008 crisis, systemic risk has shown clear contagious patterns. Risks have spread across countries, markets, sectors and inevitably individual assets, causing considerably adverse effects on financial markets, the rest of the domestic economy and global markets. Understanding the mechanisms of how risks transfer across financial markets is therefore equally, if not more, important as modeling systemic risk ====.====The definition of contagion, a widely discussed concept, is yet to gain a consensus (Sewraj et al., 2018). Dornbusch et al. (2000) suggest that contagion is “====”. There are three key aspects of this definition: the interconnectedness of a market, spillover of risks and the source of the shock. In other words, shocks to one sector (or a group of sectors) can spill over to others due to interconnectedness within a market, thus causing a significant (excessive) increase in the level of overall systemic risk. Following this logic, understanding risk contagion is thus conditional on mapping the interconnectedness among sectors or markets and identifying mechanisms of risk spillovers as well as sources of shocks.====While methods of mapping interconnectedness and spillovers have been well established in the literature (among others, Diebold and Yilmaz, 2014; Acharya et al., 2017) and kept being explored, identifying the source of contagion is a topic that is attracting growing interest. For example, the Financial Stability Board (2010) introduced the concept of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Central to several regulatory frameworks, SIFIs are institutions that can cause significant disruptions to the wider financial system when they fail, potentially due to size, leverage, or connectedness within the financial system. Identifying these riskiest institutions is of critical importance to both regulators and investors. SIFIs should be closely monitored and regulated during calm times to effectively curb systemic risk and its contagion (Acharya et al., 2012). Investors can also benefit from studying the behaviors and dynamics of SIFIs and using smarter trading strategies.====The concept of SIFIs can be extended to non-financial institutions and, more broadly, to sectors or markets. The extant research reveals that sectors respond differently to shocks due to their own market and industrial heterogeneities and risk characteristics, and shocks to one sector can transmit to others (Ewing, 2002; Ewing et al., 2003; Ranjeeni, 2014). For financial market participants, sectoral indexes are used as important indicators to evaluate portfolio performance. Identifying which sector leads market movements and how risks transmit across sectors is critical for effective risk management and portfolio diversification. For policymakers and regulators, identifying systemically important sectors can also be of great assistance to customize policies and regulations to their specific risk characteristics. Borrowing the logic underlying the identification of SIFIs, this study mainly focuses on the interconnectedness of sectors within the Chinese stock market to identify which sector(s) plays the leading role in risk contagion and market movements, and to detect the mechanisms of risk spillover across sectors.====Despite its great importance, this topic has been sparsely studied. This study uses sectors in China’s stock market as the unit of interest to analyze how risk contagion works in the Chinese market. Starting by mapping out cross-sector interconnectedness, it seeks to identify the systemically important sector(s) and explore how systemic risk develops and evolves over time in the fast-growing, complex and highly risky Chinese market.====In this paper, two approaches are adopted to investigate the risk contagion problem in sectoral returns of the Chinese stock market. We start with a simple correlation-based method and use graph theory to visualize the centrality of the system and thus identify systemically important sectors (SISs). The second step is to use a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and a rolling window approach to show how sectors have been systemically connected over time and identify the SISs. The second method was recently developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2014). Due to its simplicity and the ability of modelling system interactions, the method has been widely applied to investigate relevant issues, and has demonstrated great power in understanding systemic connectedness and spillovers (for example, Zhang, 2017; Ji et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a).====Our empirical results from both methods present evidence that Industrial sector has played the most important role in the risk transmission mechanism. Together with Consumer Discretionary and Materials sectors, these are three SISs in the Chinese stock market. These findings have much practical implication. Both regulators and investors should pay additional attention to these sectors’ performance and closely watch the movements and volatilities in these sectors, as they tend to lead the changes of market systemic risk and cause other sectors to follow their dynamics. Capturing the characteristics of volatilities and risk patterns in these sectors will greatly help investors adjust their trading strategies in a timely fashion to avoid systemic risk exposures. At the policymaking level, it can facilitate identifying the source of risk contagion and taking ex ante measures to possibly prevent massive market failure or alleviate its adverse effects.====It is worth noting that the two methods adopted in this study eventually lead to consistent conclusions. The correlation-based method and graph theory may seem relatively simple to apply, and their results are easy to understand and interpret. In contrast, the time-series approach requires both the user and reader to have an advanced background in econometrics, which may set up barriers to those without a relevant foundation and deter them from well understanding the information conveyed. Through the lens of our research, we find that the empirical results from a simple correlation-based method highly match those from the more complicated time-series method. Though the former is a relatively simple method and not technically challenging, it performs as well as the more advanced method, and provides equally reliable key information on risk contagion in China’s stock market, but in a more user-friendly way.====This paper contributes to the extant literature in the following ways: First, it uses a simple correlation method to describe interdependence in the sectoral network of China’s stock market, which helps to precisely identify the leading sector(s) with critical roles in the mechanism of systemic risk contagion. On one hand, locating the source of risks solves one of the essential problems of curbing systemic risk from a regulator’s perspective. On the other hand, knowing which sectors play the leading role and export risks to follower sectors is vital for investors to find sound trading strategies. Second, this paper adopts a VAR approach to account for systemic connectedness, which provides additional evidence on patterns of risk spillovers in a systemic way. Third, this paper is one of the few studying the sectoral correlation within China’s stock market. Despite the increasing significance of China’s economy and its financial market to both domestic and global economies, this area is understudied and yet to be well explored. This paper fills this gap by carefully examining intersectoral connections and risk contagion mechanisms within the stock market in the hope of aiding potential users in the process of making policies or trading decisions.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature with a special focus on the recent development of modelling connectedness and risk spillovers and studies on the Chinese stock market.

Using daily data between November 1991 and March 2017, we show that extreme market movements are mainly associated with the high degree of interdependence registered by countries in this region. Evidence of contagion is scarce. Asymmetries do not appear to be important. Specifically, currency co-movements are statistically identical during times of extreme market appreciation and depreciation, indicating that phenomena such as the fear of “appreciation” do not appear to be relevant in the region’s foreign exchange markets.","This paper studies exchange rate contagion in Asia-Paciﬁc markets between 1991 and 2017 following an R-vine copula approach.==== As in Forbes and Rigobon (2001), contagion consists of a signiﬁcant increase in cross-market linkages after the occurrence of a shock in a country’s ﬁnancial market. Deﬁning contagion this way offers two important advantages. First, it allows distinguishing between temporal and permanent mechanisms for the transmission of crises, facilitating the implementation of macro-prudential policies. Second, it provides a useful frame work for empirically testing contagion in a very general setup. Here, we employ the tail dependence criterion proposed by Cherubini et al. (2004) and used in related studies including Czado et al. (2012), Loaiza-Maya et al. (2015a, b) and Cubillos-Rocha et al. (2019).====Contagion during currency crises has been extensively studied. Much of the ample empirical literature emphasizes its geographical component (see Lee and Kim, 1993; Forbes and Rigobon, 2001; Dungey et al., 2006; Lucey and Voronkova, 2008; Arouri et al., 2012). Currency crises tend to be regional, as they affect countries in geographical proximity (Glick and Rose, 1999; De Gregorio and Valdes, 2001; Beirne and Gieck, 2014; Grabowski and Welfe, 2016; Lee et al., 2016).====Studying developed and Asia-Paciﬁc exchange rate markets from the 1990s onwards is interesting for various reasons. First, the term “contagion” in ﬁnancial markets began to be used after the Asian banking and currency crises of 1997 (Claessens and Forbes, 2001). There is relative consensus in the literature that these are benchmark events for studies on interdependence and spillovers among ﬁnancial markets. Hence, providing further evidence for a better understanding of contagion during those episodes is always useful. Second, the Asia-Paciﬁc region’s importance in the global economy is growing. Estimates of the IMF indicate that, by 2030, Asia’s economy will be larger than those of the United States and the European Union combined. The countries in this region are increasingly gaining importance in international ﬁnancial markets and, therefore, their potential of transmitting volatility shocks to other emerging and developed economies is also growing (Engle et al., 2012). Finally, currency markets in the region have undergone important reforms and transformations over the last two decades. Thus, the data presents sufficient heterogeneity to identify interdependence and contagion appropriately.====The results show that the Malaysian ringgit is central in the region’s exchange rate network. On the contrary, the Japanese yen and the New Zealand dollar are the least integrated currencies in the network. In contrast to recent studies that have found evidence of contagion in Latin American and East European countries, this paper shows little evidence of contagion for the Asia-Paciﬁc region. Exchange rate co-movements are mainly due to high interdependence between countries, as in Forbes and Rigobon (2001).====We find that exchange rate dependencies in Asia behave quite similarly during periods of large appreciation and depreciation. In other words, our evidence suggests that the asymmetries in exchange rate contagion that have been encountered for other regions and other samples of countries (see, for instance, Levy-Yeyati et al., 2013) do not hold for our sample of Asian economies. This result may be due to the fact that central bank intervention is more symmetric in Asian countries than, for instance, in Latin American countries, where a “fear of appreciation” effect has been identified in the literature.====Using a large number of Asian economies and a long sample period covering the global financial crisis, we contribute to the literature on exchange rate contagion by showing that exchange rate co-movements in this region are mainly due to the fact that their foreign exchange rate markets are becoming more integrated. This result contrasts importantly with those of other similar papers that have shown evidence of contagion in other regions of the world such as Latin America (Loaiza-Maya et al., 2015a, b). Our results are in line with those of Forbes and Rigobon (2001), who show that during the Asian ﬁnancial crisis of 1997, exchange rate interdependence increased for countries in the region without evidence of contagion. Additionally, our asymmetric DCC GARCH approach allows us to test for possible asymmetric co-movements during large appreciations and depreciations. The results indicate that co-movements are symmetric in this sense. This result, which is also in contrast with those of studies for other regions, shows that contagion exhibits an important regional component.====The fact that contagion has an important regional component provides important information for global investors. Speciﬁcally, it indicates that global hedging strategies require regional diversiﬁcation. This ﬁnding complements those of Dimitriou and Kenourgios (2013) and Dimitriou et al. (2017), who show that correlation dynamics between currencies vary largely over time, increasing vulnerabilities during times of ﬁnancial distress. Hence, there are higher portfolio diversiﬁcation beneﬁts during times of ﬁnancial distress, since holding a diversiﬁed currency portfolio reduces systemic risk more during those times.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the descriptive statistics. Section 3 introduces the ARIMA-GARCH best models and the DCC speciﬁcation to account for asymmetric effects to obtain the standardized residuals.

The results show that the relationship between oil prices and efficiency changes from positive to negative when the prices increase, whereas the relationship between the financial market and efficiency is negative. No clear evidence of the impact of oil prices on efficiency arises from the differences between conventional insurance and ====. However, there are differences regarding the financial market, with a negative impact on conventional insurance and a positive one on the ==== business. The results of this study have implications for regulators and management. The ==== industry is rapidly growing compared to conventional insurance in the GCC and, therefore, the financial market may have added benefits for the GCC region. However, caution is required in relation to the impact of the financial market on conventional insurance. Furthermore, management may require the development of strategies to deal with the nature of GCC economies to avoid shocks to oil prices.","Since its establishment, the insurance industry in the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has grown substantially in various respects, such as premiums/contributions, market penetration and market density; however, its profitability is still relatively low (Alpen Capital, 2017; EY, 2014; IFSB, 2018). Middle East Global Advisors (2016) and Finance Forward state that the drop in oil prices and the lack of development in financial markets may adversely affect the sector’s performance.====The literature has shown limited interest in the connection between oil prices and efficiency at financial firms, with only one study examining it. Said (2015) analyses the effect of oil prices on efficiency scores in Islamic banking during the financial crisis of 2008–2009. The current literature lacks sufficiently comprehensive empirical studies on the impact of the stock market performance and efficiency on insurance firms. Few studies examine the connection between firm efficiency and stock price performance in insurance (Ajlouni and Tobaishat, 2010; Aktaş and Seyfettin, 2015; Gaganis et al., 2013).====First, global oil prices might influence the profitability of insurers and ==== (Islamic insurance) providers. Gulf countries rely heavily on oil as their primary source of revenue, hurting other sectors (Khamis and Hamdan, 2016). The current drop in the price of oil has shrunk government revenue. Gulf members lost $380 billion in revenue, reducing government expenditure and investment in construction and other sectors. Saudi Arabia cancelled $20 billion in projects in 2016 (PWC, 2016). Therefore, insurance and ==== firms have to compete for limited opportunities.====Second, the financial market is a crucial factor that affects profitability (Naceur et al., 2014). Insurers and ==== providers allocate their investment heavily towards equity and real estate, because of the lack of development in financial markets. These asset classes can be profitable when the economic conditions are sound. However, when an economic slowdown occurs, the greater economic risk affects investment (Mensi, 2017). This high allocation of assets to equity and real estate is an area of weakness for sharia-compliant fixed-income instruments. Hence, having an appropriate capital market—including an Islamic capital market—with sufficient instruments in fixed income is a solid platform for firms to diversify their investment. Diversification reduces risk by allocating investments to different financial instruments with different characteristics. It seeks to maximize returns by utilizing different investment opportunities, which react differently to the same event. Middle East Global Advisors (2016) and Finance Forward state that ==== firms in the GCC have limited investment options and rely on real estate investment and unit trusts.

Over the analysed period, a transformation of the analysed regions has taken place towards the tertiary sector and high value-added activities. The results from a spatial panel Durbin analysis reveal the existence of product-space linkages and point to a productive transformation towards high technology-intensive activities as an important driver of industrial development. Equal access to digital infrastructure in urban and rural areas and transfer of skills, knowledge and resources through the inflow of foreign investment and imports of production inputs increase the contribution of manufacturing to regional employment. The effect of profit tax reductions on the share of manufacturing employment is about five times larger than the effect of government subsidies to production.","More than half a decade ago, Clark (1957) and Bell (1973) noted the importance of structural change for socio-economic progress. As societies advance, the locus of their driving engine shifts from agriculture over manufacturing to services. In the decades that followed, the shares of manufacturing in output and employment declined across Europe. The policy of the time expressed little concern over such trends and took a stance against sectoral policy measures. Evidence from the recent economic downturn, however, reveals that countries with an established industrial base and intensive use of industrial policies coped more easily with the economic crisis than their counterparts, which embraced the conventional policy package. It is for these reasons that European economic policy nowadays speaks about the beneficial effects of manufacturing on job creation, diffusion of technology and productivity across the entire economic system. After decades of deindustrialization, manufacturing is again praised as an engine of modern European economies (EC, 2013).====The revived interest in industrialization gives raise to many questions, the most prominent ones being what kind of industries can yield sustainable growth of productivity and employment and how such an industrial structure can be achieved. In a changing technological environment, this requires specializing in innovative activities and high value-added sectors by developing cumulative capabilities and knowledge as well as technology transfer from other economic agents (Kim, 1997; Salazar-Xirinachs et al., 2014). Such effects are also related to “product space” linkages (Hidalgo et al., 2007) that are not necessarily confined to an individual geographic area but instead depend on the degree of similarity between production activities. It appears that the technological relatedness and cognitive proximity within the regional or national industrial structure enable innovations and structural transformation. Findings from several parts of the world point to the non-negligible role of industrial relatedness in the process of industrial development (Neffke et al., 2011; Gezici et al., 2019; Morkute et al., 2017).====Our paper explores the processes of the regional structural (between-sectoral) and productive (within-manufacturing) transformation of the new European Union (EU) member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs). Nearly two decades of deindustrialization have destroyed old production links and distorted traditional industries and cumulative capabilities in many regions of these countries (Rodriguez-Pose, 1994; Landesmann, 2005; Balthelt and Kappes, 2008; Damiani and Uvalić, 2014; Bartlett, 2014; Kunc et al., 2014; Popescu, 2014; Bruno et al., 2015). The consequences of this process are visible even today, with some of the least developed regions in the EU situated in these countries. Research has yet to answer which factors shaped the industrial structure of individual CEECs and their regions over the past decade and a half, as to the best of our knowledge such an analysis has not been undertaken previously for these countries and the period under consideration. The research focuses on 56 NUTS2 regions of CEECs in the 2008–2014 period.====Three important questions regarding the future regional development of CEECs are answered through this research. First, the most recent regional patterns of structural and productive transformation are identified. Second, we show through which policy measures the industrialization of the analysed regions can be facilitated. Third, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explore the role of spatial linkages in regional industrial development in CEECs. The novelty of the paper also lies in its research strategy, combining recently developed techniques for the decomposition of changes in regional structures with means of spatial panel econometric analysis.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a discussion of the sources, nature and implications of deindustrialization and the importance of industrial development. The regional patterns of structural and productive transformation are discussed in Section 3. A model for the investigation of the spatio-temporal patterns of structural and productive transformation, a description of our econometric technique and the results of our estimation are presented in Section 4.

The first part of the paper documents and analyzes the interactions between policy, financial markets and the economy during the acute and subsequent moderate phases of the crisis as well as during the later gradual exit from the zero lower bound and the extremely slow reduction in high powered money and bank reserves. The remaining parts develop alternative aspects of the thesis that mutual uncertainties inflicted by ==== on policymakers and by the latter on financial markets were at the root of the non-negligible surprises that the crisis inflicted on everybody. In particular, it discusses the political economy of bailout operations, reviews and evaluates recent controversies about the reasons for not rescuing Lehman Brothers, and informally presents the structure and policy lessons from a general equilibrium model of the financial sector highlighting the consequences of policy actions that have raised (Knightian) bailout uncertainty. The last section takes a brief look ahead and discusses some longer term consequences of the crisis.","September 2018 marked the tenth anniversary of Lehman’s collapse. Although the crisis already sent tremors though the financial system in 2007, this was the most traumatic single event of the subprime crisis. Relying on the advantage of a ten year perspective, this paper takes a broad look at the evolution of the crisis, the extraordinary policy responses and their consequences, the slow exit from such policies as well as at the long-term consequences of the crisis.====The financial crisis initially ignited fears about a potential replay of the devastations caused by the Great Depression, but the impact was neither as deep nor as persistent. This outcome was made possible by lessons learned from the depression of the 1930s and the audacity to experiment with policy measures that, up to 2007/2008, were considered unconventional. But the crisis produced the deepest post-war recession and took most policymakers and the financial community by surprise. Interestingly, this occurred despite the fact that the actions (and inactions) of financial institutions and policymakers contributed to creating the substantial levels of uncertainty that surprised both of them.====By 2018 the impacts of the crisis on the real economy and on banking credit were gone. Policymakers’ reactions during the crisis went through the following phases: Pre-crisis regulatory complacency, vigorous and unconventional deployment of monetary and fiscal measures during the acute phases of the crisis to shore up the financial system, regulatory reform in 2010, extension of large-scale asset purchases over 2010–2014 to revive the real economy, and, since the end of 2015, gradual lifting of the federal fund rate that had been maintained at the zero lower bound (ZLB) since the end of 2008.====But other economic and policy consequences of the crisis still persisted in 2018. Some of them were likely to characterize the post-crisis era for a long time to come. Although they rebounded from their depressed crisis levels of 2017, aggregate net new issues of bonds were still far below their pre-crisis levels. As of 2018, the huge levels of high powered money and bank reserves created through large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) were still not far from their 2014 peaks. Various regulatory changes permanently altered the regulatory landscape, LSAP at the ZLB along with forward guidance became standard measures in the toolkit of monetary policy and, ever since October 2008, the Fed has been paying interest on excess reserves. Last but not least, the dilemmas confronting policymakers faced with the need to bail out systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) had not vanished and are likely to occasionally re-emerge in the future.====This paper takes a retrospective bird’s eye view on the interactions between policymaking, the financial system and the economy before, during and after the subprime crisis. The first part of the paper documents and analyzes the interactions between policy, financial market and the economy during the first acute and later more moderate phases of the crisis as well as during the gradual exit from ZLB and the much slower reduction in high powered money and bank reserves. The remaining sections develop various aspects of the claim that the surprise elements induced by the crisis were largely due to mutual uncertainties inflicted by financial institutions on policymakers and by the latter on financial markets. In particular, prior to the crisis, regulators and other policymakers failed to recognize the full impact of financial innovations and their own regulatory neglect on the systemic risks associated with the emergence of the subprime bubble. Once the crisis was in full swing, the absence of preannounced transparent bailout policies contributed to raising the level of uncertainty faced by financial institutions, triggering the devastating post-Lehman financial panic.====In spite of a succession of highly criticized previous rescue operations, the Fed and the secretary of the Treasury were faced with the imminent downfall of three colossal SIFIs in early September 2008; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, AIG and Lehman Brothers.==== They chose to rescue the first two and leave Lehman to its fate. The memoirs of the three main framers of the bailouts (Bernanke, 2015; Paulson, 2010; Geithner, 2014) suggest that the latter decision was due to the fact that, in the absence of congressional approval, the Fed had reached the legal limits of its lender of last resort mandate. In contrast, Ball (2018) argues that the Fed had the legal authority to offer emergency lending to Lehman and that Lehman’s collateral was no more risky than that of other SIFIs that were rescued..====Against this retrospective disagreement about the motives and reasons for the dramatic policy decisions of September 2008 this paper discusses the political economy of bailout operations in the face of dilemmas not encountered since the Great Depression. It presents, contrasts and evaluates different current views on the important September 2008 policy decisions and suggests an improvement designed to reduce bailout uncertainty if and when financial rescue operations become necessary in the future. Interestingly, a similar policy recommendation is implied by a general equilibrium model of the financial system, whose main assumptions and results are summarized in the paper.====The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a bird’s eye view of the interactions between policymaking, financial markets and the economy through the various phases of the crisis and its aftermath. The section documents and analyzes the interactions between policy on one hand and credit formation through the banking system and the bond market on the other. Subsection 2.2 discusses the consequences of payment of interest on excess reserves for banking credit and Subsection 2.3 documents the allocation of credit through the bond market. Subsection 2.4 argues that the low levels of inflation prevailing until 2016 were due to the reluctance of banks to lend in spite of their huge reserve levels. Several factors such as an increase in aversion to bailout uncertainty, payment of interest on excess reserves and post-Lehman toughening of regulation fed this reluctance.====Section 3 contains a brief introduction to the mechanisms through which policymakers and financial institutions inflicted elevated levels of uncertainty on each other. The political economy of financial bailout operations during the acute phases of the crisis is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 confronts and evaluates conflicting recent views about the reasons that led to the decision not to bail out Lehman. Using concepts from modern decision theory and psychology, Section 6 informally presents the structure and results of a theoretical model designed to highlight the adverse impact of increasing bailout uncertainty. The main point is that, by raising (Knightian) uncertainty about future bailout policies, the decision not to rescue Lehman triggered the devastating post-Lehman panic. This is followed by a brief summary and a look at the longer term consequences and lessons from the crisis in Section 7.",A retrospective on the subprime crisis and its aftermath ten years after Lehman’s collapse,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518304631,22 August 2019,2019,Research Article,117.0

For the first time, the study provides policy implications based on the data of all SAARC countries. The study recommends focusing on increasing the inflows of resources in the form of aid and foreign direct investment (FDI) from the developed world to achieve higher economic growth.","The debate regarding foreign inflows and their possible impacts on the economic growth of host countries is still an open question in the literature. These inflows are of different types, such as aid, trade, debt, remittances and FDI inflows. The growth effects of foreign inflows mainly depend on their nature and type. Dalgaard et al. (2004) documented that aid inflows generally lead to higher economic growth; however, climate-related circumstances plays a role in determining the magnitude of the impact that aid inflows have on economic growth. Askarov and Doucouliagos (2015) have established a positive relationship between aid inflows and growth for a specific set of countries. However, it is a fact that aid inflows don’t necessarily always lead to higher economic growth. It is also possible that they may in fact have a deteriorating influence on the economic growth of recipient countries. For example, Veiderpass and Anderson (2007) stated that there is indeed very little evidence regarding positive impacts of aid on the economic growth of countries, especially in the case of poor countries. Recent findings (Kumar, 2013) show that aid inflows are inversely linked with economic growth. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding the impact of foreign aid inflows on the economic growth of recipient countries. Ekanayake and Chatrna (2010) argued that the literature on the growth effects of aid has provided mixed results and therefore further investigation is indeed needed.====Regarding the growth effects of trade inflows (trade openness), the initial literature starting with Dollar (1992); Sachs et al. (1995); Edwards (1998) and Frankel and Romer (1999) has provided sound evidence to support the hypothesis that trade openness is positively related to growth. However, Rodrik and Rodriguez (2000) have shed doubt on the findings of these studies by showing weaknesses associated with the applied methodologies and measures of trade. In his subsequent paper, Rodríguez (2007) critically evaluated the research evidence of Warner (2003); Wacziarg and Welch (2003) and Dollar and Kraay (2002) and pointed out that there is no connection between the standard measures of trade policy and economic growth (Tahir and Norulazidah, 2014). Dava (2012) reported that research on the links between openness and growth is not settled yet. The trade-growth relationship is basically an empirical question, as the theory provides very little evidence regarding this relationship (Ulasan, 2012). However, some recent empirical studies report that trade does cause growth (Tahir and Azid, 2015; Tahir and Khan, 2014). But it is also a fact that trade may not always contribute to economic growth. The impact of trade on growth largely depends on many internal factors, such as an improved infrastructure and financial sector of the host country.====As far as the relationship between debt inflows and economic growth is concerned, the literature has yet to provide conclusive evidence either supporting or rejecting the debt-led growth hypothesis. Some influential researchers have provided evidence of the positive relationship between debt and the growth of recipient economies. On the other hand, some authors consider foreign debt as a detrimental factor for the growth of host countries. Changyong et al. (2012) reported that debt transformation may enhance economic growth and debt will furthermore act like a barrier to growth if the debt ratio crosses a certain limit. Afonso and Jalles (2013) postulate that, with a higher debt level, the expected future tax will adversely affect the employment and output growth of the economy owing to its impact on consumption and investment. Siddiqui and Malik (2001) articulated that a consensus regarding the growth effects of debt flows has not been reached in the empirical or theoretical literature. Were (2001) demonstrated that debt accumulation is inversely linked with economic growth. Recently, Calderón and Fuentes (2013) reported a robust negative impact of public debt on growth. Lin and Sosin (2001) also reported a negative and significant relationship between foreign debt and economic growth. Pescatori et al. (2014) highlighted that the debt trajectory is important and further found that countries with high but declining debt grow at the same rate as countries with lower debt levels. The findings of this literature have created a common and mostly prevailing perception that foreign debt from the developed world towards the developing world is detrimental for the growth and development of the latter.====The inflow of remittances is a key source of revenue, especially for the developing world. Adam et al. (2016) stated that remittance inflows have shown an increasing trend although other flows have been decreasing in the last decades. Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo (2004) highlighted the importance of the flow of remittances and argued that they could be the primary source of foreign exchange earnings. Similarly, Bayangos and Jansen (2011) argued that remittance inflows play a role in the competitiveness of the economy owing to their labour market effects. Moreover, Kumar (2013) confirmed the positive impact that remittances have on economic growth. However, there is a possibility that remittance inflows may lead to the Dutch Disease problem for the recipient country, as mentioned in the literature. Acosta et al. (2009) have shown concerns over the inflow of remittances and argued that a high inflow may decrease international competitiveness owing to real exchange rate appreciation and hence adversely influence the production of manufacturing and tradable goods. In other words, the impact of remittances on the economic growth process of the recipient country is not straightforward and always not positive. From the household perspective, it could lead to overall welfare. An increased inflow of remittances may adversely affect the motivation of recipient families to work, especially in the developing world, and hence would lead to an overall negative impact on economic growth. At an aggregate level, therefore, the association between remittance inflows and economic growth is not straightforward and hence calls for further investigation.====FDI inflows and their impact on economic growth are also not a new phenomenon and the available literature has extensively researched and debated this relationship. FDI inflows complement domestic investment and hence aids to the domestic capital. Alfaro et al. (2010) developed a mechanism in which they highlighted the role of the financial market, which further enables FDI inflows to influence economic growth positively. They further demonstrated that higher FDI produces additional benefits for financially developed economies. More to the point, Tiwari and Mutascu (2011) provided evidence in favour of FDI-led growth for the Asian countries. Similarly, Azman-Saini et al. (2010) and Baharumshah et al. (2015) focused on the role of the financial market and argued that the benefits associated with inflows of FDI would be absent if the available financial system was less than a certain threshold level. Further, Mah (2010) pointed out that in developing countries, FDI inflows are the key determinant behind high economic growth; however, the evidence from the literature is not clear.====The current paper focuses on the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC hereafter) member countries to examine the impact of selected foreign inflows on economic growth. The rationale for choosing the SAARC region is that these economies receive large amount of foreign inflows in the form of remittances, FDI, foreign aid, etc. Since foreign inflows have a vital impact on the economic growth of developing countries, exploring this phenomenon in the SAARC region merits attention. The current study adds to the existing literature in various aspects. Firstly, this study considers all member countries of SAARC including Afghanistan, Bhutan and the Maldives, which have largely been ignored in the previous literature. The main problem with the existing literature is that, in most cases, researchers have ignored some of the countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal in order to increase the time span of their studies. It is a fact that empirical data for these countries are scarce and this has led to researchers excluding them from their sample. However, this has narrowed the scope of their studies in terms of generalizing the findings. In other words, the excluded economies could not find any advice in the existing studies. Second, our study carries out a comprehensive analysis to examine the impact of the selected important inflows as compared to previous studies that focus on only one inflow. Third, we address the endogeneity issue of trade openness using the instrumentation strategy following the methodology of Tahir and Khan (2014) and Tahir and Azid (2015) in order to obtain unbiased results. These authors constructed instruments of trade openness that are expected to remove the bias from trade openness that may arise because of the population of countries. Therefore, their methodology of instrumentation is considered suitable and is hence adopted to address the problem of endogeneity. Lastly, the study also tests the robustness of the obtained findings.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Statistics on the selected inflows into the SAARC region are reported in Section 2. The model and methodology are discussed in the third section. In Section 4, the results are reported and analysed. These results provide sound evidence in favour of a positive relationship between inflows of FDI and aid and economic growth, while a negative impact of debt and trade inflows on economic growth was observed. Similarly, it is also revealed that remittances do not have any significant connection with economic growth. A robustness check of these results is carried out in the fifth section. The final section concludes and makes some recommendations for policymakers.",Foreign inflows and economic growth: An emiprical study of the SAARC region,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518301614,14 August 2019,2019,Research Article,118.0

First, we test long memory in liquidity in these markets. Second, we select a number of factors eligible to affect liquidity commonality among local, regional and global factors. We find that regional and US factors do not explain liquidity variations in all the markets that exhibit low sensitivity to external factors. Our results are robust to the use of alternative proxies. The analysis in sub-periods confirms our results showing that most markets are not very sensitive to fluctuations and external shocks of liquidity. For international investors, stock markets in the Middle East and North Africa present an opportunity for further diversification, as these markets exhibit weak correlations between them and with the global market with regard to liquidity.","Liquidity in stock markets is a key factor strongly related to financial and economic development (Levine and Zervos, 1998; Naes et al., 2011). Much research has demonstrated that illiquidity presents an important source of risk for investors (Choi and Cook, 2006; Goyenko et al., 2009). Due to the immense importance of stock market liquidity, both academics and market makers are becoming more interested in studying the determinants and pricing of this liquidity in international stock markets. Interestingly, recent studies have found that the global financial crisis is closely linked to the drop in liquidity in the US market, which spilled over to the rest of the world. These studies highlight that illiquidity shocks are a determining factor in triggering and amplifying recessions, namely, the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis (Brunnermeier, 2009; Gorton, 2009; Calice et al., 2013; Jaccard, 2013).====Chordia et al. (2000) were the first to show the existence of a systematic component of liquidity among individual stocks in the US market. This phenomenon is called commonality in liquidity. Subsequent studies documented that this phenomenon is pervasive in many other stock markets (e.g. Brockman et al., 2009; Karolyi et al., 2012). Some studies investigated whether liquidity affects asset risk and constitutes a priced non-diversifiable risk (e.g. Bekaert et al., 2007; Ho and Chang, 2015). Another strand of the literature has focused on exploring the underlying drivers of this commonality, for example, investor sentiment (Huberman and Halka, 2001), financial liberalization (Lin, 2010), market volatility (Hameed et al., 2010) and correlated investor trading (Koch et al., 2016).====Since the last financial crises (subprime crisis, European sovereign debt, etc.), emerging markets have attracted investors with regard to the opportunities of investment portfolios and international diversification owing to their low degree of integration with the global market (Al Nasser and Hajilee, 2016; Boubakri et al., 2016; Neaime, 2016). In particular, MENA emerging markets have attracted the interest of investors over the last decade. Foreign direct investment into the region increased from 6.87 billion US$ in 2000 to 42.2 billion US$ in 2016 (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2017) and the market capitalization in these markets increased from 895.25 billion US$ in 2009 to 1.33 trillion US$ in 2016 (World Bank, 2017). However, the higher returns offered by these markets need to be balanced by their liquidity costs, induced by the increased illiquidity of the stocks traded in emerging markets compared to developed markets (Lesmond, 2005). Thus, it would be interesting for investors and market makers to know the characteristics of stock market liquidity in these markets, especially in recession periods.====Furthermore, emerging markets are known to have many distinct economic and institutional features that distinguish them from developed markets. In particular, they have lower liquidity, which is one of the main reasons why foreign investors avoid investments in emerging markets (Chuhan, 1992; Bekaert et al., 2007) and low integration with global markets, and they are particularly dominated by individual investors. As liquidity is a major concern for domestic and international investors, it would be interesting to explore its dynamics within and among markets in order to construct more efficient portfolios.====This study aims to fill the gap in the literature by dealing with the issue of commonality in liquidity for the MENA region, as global investors, economic policymakers and market regulators tend to focus on market-wide rather than stock-level indicators (Wang, 2013). In this study, we focus on the cross-market determinants of aggregate liquidity at the market level. We use daily data of 11 MENA emerging markets (Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Dubai, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Turkey). The sample period is from January 2005 to June 2017. Our methodology consists of measuring liquidity commonality by cross-market and global average liquidity jointly with market-specific factors, such as return and volatility. This constitutes a two-fold contribution to our understanding of liquidity commonality and financial integration in MENA markets.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This paper represents a first attempt to explain this contradiction from the perspective of urbanization. Urbanization provides opportunities for investment and helps moderate the capital/labor ratio in the urban sector. In particular, it promotes knowledge accumulation through “learning by doing”. This can explain why the law of diminishing marginal returns to capital is not applicable to economies in the early period of their catching-up. More specifically, we construct a two-sector ==== model incorporating urbanization and “learning by doing”, predicting that in the presence of urbanization, as long as the “learning by doing” effect is sufficiently large, capital return will depict an inverted U-shape as capital accumulates or urbanization proceeds. Empirical evidence from China confirms the theoretical prediction.","Lucas (1993) argued that to understand economic growth, it is important to study the growth miracle of East Asia where Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are among the dozens of economies in the world that have managed to escape the middle income trap after the Second World War. As a stylized fact, these economies maintained high investment rates during their take-offs (Young, 1995; Krugman, 1994). Table 1 confirms that Japan, China, South Korea, Indonesia, and Taiwan invested a high proportion of GDP, in the order of 30% or more, for many years following their take-offs. Further, the prolonged high rate of investment has been accompanied by high returns to capital, particularly in the non-farming sector (see Fig. 1 and Lu et al., 2008). According to Bai et al. (2006), the aggregate rate of return to capital in China had been quite high, reaching 20 percent or more from 1978 to 2005.====This stylized fact not only defies the law of diminishing marginal returns, but also contradicts standard growth theory, which predicts a declining marginal product of capital (Ventura, 1997). Naturally, this theory-fact contradiction calls for research attention to uncover the underlying reasons, the resolution of which is also important for setting development strategies. For example, there is a heated ongoing debate in China whether the country could or should continue relying on investment as a major driver of growth. After all, the largest developing economy in the world has sustained growth for more than 40 years with an exceptionally high investment rate. Opponents have been arguing for substantial reductions in capital formation, while others still support the high investment-driven strategy (Lin et al., 2016).====Ventura (1997) attributed the non-decreasing returns or high rate of investment to East Asians’ ability to trade. But trading ability usually grows over time and is not unique to developing economies, and certainly not to East Asia. Some turned to improvements in resource allocation as the explanation of the theory-fact contradiction. For example, Song et al. (2011) argued that gradually removing misallocation of financial resources helped China maintain high levels of capital returns. Through capital accumulation, private enterprises that are more efficient expand their share in the national economy, leading to rises in aggregate capital returns. According to Hsieh and Klenow (2009), if financial misallocation is eliminated, manufacturing TFP could increase by 30 percent in China, which will improve capital returns. However, other scholars such as Geng and N’Diaye (2012) held the view that low interest rates and an undervalued currency are jointly responsible for the high capital returns and investment rates in China.====The majority of the existing literature, including most of the studies discussed above, attributes the contradiction to technical advances or TFP improvement. This is consistent with Abramovitz (1993), who found that TFP growth contributes to the enhancement of capital returns during the industrialization of the U.S. Similarly, Gordon (1999) concluded that capital deepening is driven by TFP growth, leading to a non-linear relationship between capital returns and capital deepening. Also, Huang et al. (2011) pointed out that improvements in technology are the main reason for China’s rising capital returns.====However, technology progress or TFP growth is perhaps more prominent in industrialized countries such as the US and thus can’t explain the unique phenomenon of increasing returns to capital in fast-growing Asia. As is known, industrialized countries such as the US are often more innovative. Further, few analyze what drives TFP growth. While not rejecting the role of TFP growth, more fundamental forces that are unique and common to emerging economies must be at work.====This paper contributes to this debate by focusing on the role of urbanization, which is hypothesized to be one such force that could drive the growth of TFP. Urbanization provides opportunities for investment and helps moderate the capital/labor ratio, as it means a transfer of labor to the urban sector where most investment occurs. For instance, the quickly rising capital returns in China around 1995 correspond to the rapid urbanization that followed government abolishing the food rationing system. According to Arrow (1962), however, increases in per capita income cannot be explained simply by increases in the capital-labor ratio. Similarly, non-decreasing marginal returns to capital cannot be explained simply by the labor-capital ratio alone. Knowledge accumulation through “learning by doing”, which comes with urbanization, is crucial.====In this paper, we develop a model to explain the East Asia Miracle by bringing in urbanization or structural transformation, which generates demand for capital and helps moderate the K/L ratio so the law is postponed until urbanization is approaching the end, when diminishing returns set in. Thus, capital returns will depict an inverted U-shape as capital accumulates and urbanization proceeds. This model is verified by empirical evidence from China, where rapid urbanization makes it possible to empirically identify and estimate the relationship between regional capital returns, capital deepening and urbanization.====Indirectly, our paper relates to the literature on global imbalances. Excessive savings in China and other net export economies are often blamed for causing the USA subprime crisis in 2008 and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. For example, Bernanke (2005) argued that one important factor in the global saving glut story is the sharp reserve accumulation by developing countries. Greenspan (2009) alleged that the high Chinese savings rate was the culprit for the recent American subprime mortgage crisis because it caused low interest rates in the global financial markets, which pushed Americans toward excessive consumption and housing finance. In essence, these economies are simultaneously blamed for both high investment rates and high net exports.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 constructs a two-sector general equilibrium model incorporating urbanization and “learning by doing”. We show that, in the presence of urbanization, as long as the “learning by doing” effect is sufficiently large, capital returns will depict an inverted U-shape. Section 3 provides an empirical analysis using data from China, testing whether China’s capital returns depict an inverse U-shape as capital accumulates.

The historical decomposition indicates that 18.8% and 23% of the variations in the world factor after 2009 can be explained by US monetary policy shock and Chinese industrial production shock, respectively.","The foreign exchange market, though highly volatile, sometimes witnesses co-movement of exchange rates among certain countries, especially emerging markets, which are more prone to being affected. The Argentine Peso, South African Rand, Russian Ruble, and Turkish Lira, for example, simultaneously plunged by 23%, 7.5%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, in the opening month of 2014. It was the ‘single biggest sell off in emerging market currencies since 2009’. Despite domestic factors had been identified as the triggers, analysts also pointed to some outside forces such as the withdrawal of stimulus by the US Federal Reserve to prop up its own economy. The devaluation was contagious and spread across continents, providing the first hint of our primary concern: are there any global factors, beyond national or regional economic conditions, that induce co-movement of exchange rates in emerging markets?====To address this question, we use a dynamic hierarchical factor model proposed by Moench et al. (2013). It uses multi-level factor models to characterize within- and between-block variations as well as idiosyncratic noise in dynamic panels. We extract the components common to all emerging market economies from local components, including regional factors, specific to each continent as well as country-specific factors. We find that, for the period from 1996 to 2014, local components were the major driving forces of exchange rate changes in emerging market economies. The common component (which we also refer to as the world or global factor), in the meantime, only accounts for less than 20% of the variations in the exchange rates fluctuations of emerging market economies on average. However, in recent years, the effect of the common component has become more prominent, accounting for almost 40% of the variations on average.====Given the role of common components, a follow-up question arises: what are the economic forces behind the world factor? Bearing in mind that driving forces and shocks that influence exchange rate changes in emerging markets are vast and sophisticated, we do not intend to dig out all possible explanations. Our main focus is the effect of the US and Chinese economy, especially that of the US monetary policy shocks and China's economic slowdown. As two leading economies, the policies and economic conditions of the United States and China do have spillover effects on the rest of the world. As an example, in the quantitative easing (QE) phrase, much of the capital the Federal Reserve injected into the economy flowed to emerging markets, and the tapering off of QE thus meant that liquidity was drying up. Furthermore, the performance of economic growth in China may affect the volatility of exchange rates in emerging markets, because China is not only the world's largest emerging market economy, but also the chief buyer of exports from other emerging market countries.====We thus use a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to investigate whether, and how, the US and Chinese economies affect the world factor of the exchange rate changes in emerging market economies. We look at both the magnitude of the influence as well as the differential effect on the world factor across time. We find that since the end of 2008, shocks to US monetary policy and the Chinese economy exert considerable influence on the fluctuations of the world factor, thereby affecting changes in emerging markets’ exchanges rates. The historical decomposition shows that 18.8% and 23% of the variations in the world factor after 2009 can be explained by US monetary policy shock and Chinese industrial production shock, respectively. The variance decomposition further indicates that, since 2009, US and Chinese shocks each account for 12% of the fluctuations in the world factor. Further, 3%(9%) of the forecast error of the world factor can be explained by US monetary policy shocks, and 7%(12%) can be explained by Chinese shocks in the short run(long run). These numbers are significantly larger than those before 2009. The results imply that the US monetary policy and Chinese economic performance matter in terms of common exchange rate fluctuations in emerging markets. The difference that we captured in their effect before and after 2009 is reinforced by our finding that the world factor becomes more critical in tracing the stimulus of exchange rate changes in emerging markets.====This study is related to four strands of literature. The first is literature investigating links between currency movements. In their seminal work, Baillie and Bollerslev (1989) find that a panel of seven currencies from industrialized economies are cointegrated, which is consistent with the hypothesis that there is one long-run relationship among these exchange rates. After examining five currencies in the ASEAN countries, Lee and Azali (2010) find that there are two cointegrating relationships in the post-crisis period, while the currencies are not cointegrated in the pre-crisis period. Frankel and Rose (1996) construct a panel of annual exchange rate data for over 100 developing countries and investigate the factors that contribute to a currency crisis. Besides national factors, their results point out the important role of foreign interest rates, which affect capital flows substantially. Similarly, Phylaktis and Ravazzolo (2005) test for cointegration among a group of Pacific Basin countries over the period 1980–1998, and find that stock and foreign exchange markets are positively related to the US stock market, regardless of the adoption of foreign exchange restrictions. The currency links among emerging markets are potentially facilitated by regional financial integrations, a process which authorities in Asia, in particular, are taking steps to accelerate (García-Herrero and Wooldridge, 2007).====Second, there is a vast body of literature on exchange rate forecasting. Engel et al. (2015) construct factors from a cross-section of exchange rates and use the idiosyncratic deviations from these factors to forecast exchange rates. Balke et al. (2013) start with the asset pricing approach of Engel and West, and then examined the degree to which fundamentals can explain exchange rate fluctuations. Verdelhan (2012) study the share of systematic variation in bilateral exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the co-movement of emerging market exchange rates and the main forces behind them.====Third, the methodology used in this study belongs to the body of literature investigating dynamic factor models. Kose et al. (2003) use multilevel factor models to investigate international business cycles, and Stock and Watson (1989) adopt a similar methodology to analyse national and regional factors in housing construction. Different from the top-down approach taken by Kose et al. (2003), however, Moench et al. (2013) undertake a bottom-up application without making an assumption that requires that level components be orthogonal to the global factor.====Fourth, this study is also related to the literature on the spillover effect of US monetary policy on emerging markets. Mackowiak (2007) investigates whether external shocks are an important source of macroeconomic fluctuations in emerging markets and finds that ‘when the US sneezes, emerging markets catch a cold’. Chen et al. (2016) study the effect of US quantitative easing (QE) on both emerging and advanced economies, and find that the effects of QE are sizeable and vary across economies. Ho et al. (2018) use a FAVAR approach to examine how the unconventional US monetary policy affected the Chinese economy. Different from their works, our study focuses on the spillover effect of US monetary policy on exchange rate fluctuations in emerging markets.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Professional forecasters attempt to be more precise than their peers when they are uncertain about others’ ability to forecast, given their own ability to forecast macroeconomy. We then empirically estimate the peer effects using the two-step method proposed by Bajari et al. (2010). The results identify a pronounced peer effect among professional forecasters and specify the asymmetric peer effect exerted by prominent professional forecasters. The results remain valid through several robustness checks. The forecast customers must thus address the peer effects due to competition among professional forecasters when they use forecasting reports.","China’s macroeconomic forecast industry emerged as it transitioned gradually from a centrally planned economy to a market economy during the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Since the leaders in China strived to build a socialist market economy in 1992, the pressing demand for macroeconomy forecast has been increasing enormously because economic agents need such forecast to deal with uncertainty under a more decentralized economic system. In this regard, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the leading research institution in China and national think tank affiliated to the central government, has been publishing annual macroeconomic forecast reports since 1992.====The emergence and development of capital markets attracted business companies, especially financial institutions such as investment banks, to enter the macroeconomic forecast sector in late 1990s and early 2000s. Records indicate that the renowned ==== journal launched a program in 2003 to award the best macroeconomic analysts in the financial sector.====With China’s rapid economic expansion, rich investment opportunities and government macroeconomic regulations have created a growing demand for forecasts of its economic trends. On the supply side, many foreign investment banks such as JP Morgan and HSBC offer insights on future momentums of the Chinese economy in their report to appeal to foreign investors who are interested in entering the Chinese markets. At the same time, research institutes such as universities and governmental research affiliates also attempt to secure a position in this market and publish macroeconomic reports as proof of their research ability. Predominantly, among the institutions that participate in forecasting, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences are now considered national think tanks.====As forecasting gains its value from a variety of users, many critics doubt whether analysts are willing to reveal all they know to their users. In fact, the literature on the ==== and ==== of analysts in financial markets typically makes use of reduced-form regressions or tests method to answer this question. Following this line of the literature, the current study estimates the peer effects of professional forecasters in a static game setting with incomplete information.====We adopt a two-stage estimating procedure to estimate the parameters of interest (Bajari et al., 2010). The data consist of a set of predictions on China’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate and industrial added value at a quarterly frequency. The predictions are collected from Langrun Forecast Program (LFP) by China Macroeconomic Research Center (CMRC), Peking University. The LFP data cover all 31 institutions that routinely predict the growth rate of China’s macroeconomic indicators. Using the GDP growth forecasts, we estimate the strategic interactions among forecasters. We find strong evidence of positive peer effects, which reflects the strategic interactions among professional forecasters. We also find that the peer effect asymmetrically comes from the most prominent institutions. As a robustness check, we also estimate the results in different samples and with different macroeconomic indicators.====Bajari et al. (2010) provide powerful tools for our estimation of empirical games. We extend and improve the empirical application in two aspects. First, we apply the method to the macroeconomic forecasts industry in China. Next, we extend their method by further considering the possibility of an asymmetric peer effect rather than symmetric ones, as is proposed in the original models.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

Using World Bank data on Thailand and United Nations trade data from 2003 to 2006, the empirical results show that there is no significant impact of Chinese import competition on employment, wages, or labor income share. However, further checks show that for firms with lower productivity, the impact on employment and labor income share is more likely to be negative. The impact of Chinese import competition on profit margins is significantly positive. Considering the impact on labor income share and profit margins, we conclude that because of Chinese import competition, income distribution possibly goes in disfavor of labor. Our study shows that the impact of Chinese import competition on the skilled labor ratio is positive and significant. This result suggests that Thai firms are on the path to skill upgrading as a result of Chinese import competition, which is helpful for Thailand’s long-run economic growth. As firms with low productivity are more likely to be negatively affected by Chinese import competition, improving productivity is still an efficient way to counter such competition.","In this study, we examine the impact of China’s exports on firms in a neighboring country, Thailand. This research topic is related to the so-called “China effect” literature. For quite a long time, China has mainly exported labor-intensive products. Thus, many studies naturally focus on the impact of China’s exports on workers in other countries, especially on their employment opportunities and wage levels.====The present study differs from previous studies in three aspects. First, we use firms in Thailand as the research sample. Both China and Thailand are middle-income countries. The impact of imports from China on Thailand is likely to be different from that on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, which other studies mainly consider. Second, we divide the impact of imports from China into scale effect, income effect, and structural effect. In so doing, we can evaluate the “China effect” more comprehensively than the literature does. Previous studies in this field often focus on only one type of effect, making it difficult to assess the “China effect” objectively. Third, we rely on more than one indicator to capture the income distribution and structure of firms, which enriches the research findings and makes the conclusions more convincing.

Using the monthly merchandise import and export data across 33 Asian economies, together with the US, EU and UK, we detect the community structure of the evolving network and we identify clusters and central nodes inside each of them. Our findings show that data are well represented by two communities, in which People's Republic of China and Japan play the major role. We then analyze the synchronisation between GDP growth and trade. Furthermore we apply our model to the prediction of economic fluctuations. Our findings show that the model leads to an increase in predictive accuracy, as higher order interactions between countries are taken into account.","The global economy is evolving rapidly, with a complex and ever-changing picture. Despite a growing body of research on the globalization, our knowledge on its working forces and on its impacts on trade, the structure of economies, employment, incomes, and human capital are at best incomplete. What has been largely missing is a comprehensive and detailed picture of the dynamic network structure of the global economy. In the presence of flows of goods, services and capital across countries as well as intersectoral input–output linkages, microeconomic idiosyncratic shocks may lead to aggregate fluctuations (Acemoglu et al., 2012). The clear link between trade patterns and global business cycle indicates that trade networks provide a natural framework for us to understand the transmission mechanism of economic shocks from one unit to another. The idea that sectoral interdependencies and trade relationships has an important influence on aggregate economic behavior has attracted increasing attentions in economics. Long and Plosser (1983), Horvath (1998), Horvath (2000) and Acemoglu et al. (2012) show that the topology of the input–output network has a crucial role in determining the aggregate behavior of the system. If the network is significantly asymmetric, that is, if relatively few nodes play a predominant role as suppliers, then idiosyncratic shocks give rise to aggregate fluctuations. When the organization of production is dominated by a small number of key players supplying inputs to many different sectors, disruptions in these critical nodes can affect the global production system, determining losses in production and welfare (Acemoglu et al., 2012).====Our research uses the export and import of merchandise across Asian economies to map the dynamic trade network and its strength on spreading economic fluctuations at different periods of time. Moreover, we also take into account the main world economies including the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), as additional nodes in the network. Asia provides a compelling setting to study this issue due to two reasons. First, Asia is a region of growing global significance, currently accounting for around 30 percent of the global economy by most measures, e.g. production, trade, investment and finance (Dent, 2017). It is also a regional economy that has become increasingly integrated in various ways and, in particular, in a rising intra-regional trade. Indeed, despite the slowdown in global trade since 2011, the share of intra-Asian trade continues its growing trend and rose to 57.1 percent in 2015, up from an average of 55.8 percent during 2010–2014 (see Fig. 1). By comparison, the shares of intra-regional trade flow within North America and Europe has fallen since the end of 1990s. This reflects a growing importance of the Asian trade network in the world economy.====Moreover, the Asian trade network has undergone several stages of dynamic and significant transformation since the beginning of this century, mainly due to the rise of People's Republic of China, thereafter PRC, as the dominant supplier in wide-ranging manufacturing industries to both regional and global markets. In a nutshell, the dense patterns of trade network and other forms of supply chain activity have helped forge systemic economic interdependencies among Asian economies, that have been further augmented by developments in financial markets and industries, and strengthened regional infrastructure networks.====In this paper, we first identify the centrality and the community structure of the Asian trade network. Understanding the structure of the trade network, and in particular determining which countries act as hubs in the network is important to understand the origin of aggregate fluctuations, so to inform policymakers on how to prepare for, and recover from, adverse shocks hitting the regional network. Not surprisingly, the research in network theory has dedicated a vast amount of effort to deal with this topic (Battiston et al., 2012). Various measures of centrality had been proposed in network theory (see Perra and Fortunato, 2008, Bonacich and Lloyd, 2001, Bonacich, 1972, Katz et al., 1973, Brin and Page, 2012, Kleinberg, 1999). Our results indicate, in particular, the increasing importance of PRC in the Asian trade network, especially after 2000.====Moreover, studies that analyze the empirical characteristics of economic networks have systemically found the existence of a community structure among players (see Garratt et al., 2011, among others). The community structure reveals how a network is internally organized, and indicates the presence of special relationships between nodes, that may not be easily accessible from direct empirical tests. In other words, the community structure refers to the occurrence of groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. A recent survey (Malliaros and Vazirgiannis, 2013) provides a broader definition of community structure as a set of nodes that share common or similar features together. The import-export networks, where links representing flows of goods are typical examples. Much of the focus in community detection algorithms has been devoted to identify disjoint communities. However, it is well known that nodes in a network are naturally characterized by multiple community memberships (Xie et al., 2013). In economic networks, it is very common for an institution to participate in more than one community, so that communities are often overlapped. Cao et al. (2013) propose a novel model to identify overlapping communities and central nodes, in the case of static networks. In our context of international trade, adapting the model of Cao et al. (2013) to temporal networks can dynamically capture both nodes’ systemic importance and revealing the most plausible areas of contagion, thereby, enhancing our understanding of the system. Our results indicate that the Asian trade network can be decomposed into two overlapping communities, with different countries inside each community playing the role of main importers or exporters. In the paper we also investigate the relationships between trade and GDP growth. We first analyze the synchronization between business cycle and trade, by applying a Hidden Markov Model to the pairwise correlations between countries’ GDP growth and export levels. The increasing level of synchronization found in the data reinforces the idea that globalization has increased the interconnections between countries, making them more susceptible to global fluctuations. We then apply the proposed network model to the prediction of economic slowdowns or crisis. Our results show that the model leads to an important gain in predictive performance, which can be explained by the fact that the centrality measures at the basis of our model take into account not only first order trade interactions but also higher order interactions, ranking countries according to their influence on the whole network.====This research extends the existing literature on trade network (Serrano and Bogu, 2003, Kali and Reyes, 2007, Barigozzi et al., 2010, De Benedictis et al., 2013, Cepeda-Lopez et al., 2017) and contributes to the economic and financial stability literature in several perspectives. We propose a network model, based on temporal trade data, to detect the modularity structure of an evolving weighted directed network. This helps to identify important nodes inside each community, tracking their common activity over time. To our knowledge, the paper is the first application of network modelling to capture the flow of merchandise through export and import across Asian economies, a region that is gaining increasing importance in the world trade. From a methodological viewpoint, we present a novel method, based on import-export trade network tensor decomposition aimed at deriving centrality measures and, accordingly, rank countries in terms of their importance within their community. Communities can be thought as proxies of the most plausible areas of countries’ influence. Our method is based on the fact that a temporal network is naturally represented as a time-ordered sequence of adjacency matrices, each describing the state of the system at a given point in time. Adjacency matrices can be combined in a single mathematical object: a three-way tensor (Acar et al., 2005, Kolda and Bader, 2006). While static networks have been extensively studied, few studies pioneered approaches to community detection in temporal networks (Gauvin et al., 2014) and, in particular, none of them addressed at the same time the issue of identifying communities and central nodes inside each community in dynamic networks. Our research fills this gap in the literature.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology, the data and the reports of the main results; and Section 3 concludes the paper.",Trade networks and economic fluctuations in Asian countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518305776,June 2019,2019,Research Article,125.0

However, productivity and innovation begin with human capital (Fleisher et al., 2010; Kharas and Kohli, 2011; Musacchio et al., 2012) With regard to income inequality, human capital inequality has been a major source of overall income inequality worldwide (Chen et al., 2010; Sylwester, 2002). It is crucial to narrow the human capital gap within a country to control income inequality. Especially during these times of revolutionary skill-biased technical changes, the strengthening human capital accumulation is urgent because there exists a plethora of low-skilled jobs in developing countries that are being substituted by capital and new technology (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017; Autor et al., 2003; Bresnahan et al., 2002).====Despite many remaining problems, China has made remarkable achievements in education, the primary source of human capital, in recent decades. First, China made primary education and lower secondary education legally compulsory in 1986 by instituting nine-year compulsory education. Subsequently, due to a serious of targeted policies, the nine-year compulsory education requirement has been basically universalized among children of school age, even rural children (Chyi and Zhou, 2014). With regard to higher education, colleges in China were instructed to massively expand their enrollment beginning in 1999 (Fig. 1), an event referred to as China’s Higher Education Expansion (HEE). HEE enlarged the share of highly skilled laborers in the market (Xing and Li, 2011) and significantly benefited human-capital intensive industries (Che and Zhang, 2017). Nevertheless, because of human capital externalities within cities (Combes and Gobillon, 2015; Glaeser and Lu, 2018; Moretti, 2004), returns to higher education actually increased rather than declining after HEE (Liang and Lu, 2017; Xing, 2016). In addition, one often-neglected part of educational achievement in China is that the senior high school enrollment rate has risen rapidly from the late 1990s (Fig. 2).==== This progress was largely driven by young people from rural households, and the senior high school enrollment rate of eligible rural children rose from 27% in 2000 to 43.5% in 2005, then to over 75% in 2015.====There is a time-series correlation between the HHE and the rise in the senior high school enrollment rate for rural children, so there may be a necessary connection between the two. In China, becoming a college student is a great turning point for rural people. If rural students are admitted into colleges via the college entrance exams, i.e., the ====, they will become highly-paid laborers in the nonagricultural sector and acquire urban ==== (Deng and Björn, 2014), a kind of identity that has multiple benefits. When the chance to go to college increased because of the HEE, naturally the opportunity cost of dropping out of senior high school increased too. Therefore, it is very likely that the HEE resulted in improvements in the participation of rural children in senior high school.====An investigation into the impact of the HEE on the participation of rural children in senior high school has both academic and policy significance. Academically, such an investigation can promote our understanding of educational participation behaviors. The HEE is a rare policy that has drastically changed the expected returns to education. It allows researchers to convincingly identify the effects of educational returns on educational decision-making, which is largely absent in the existing literature. Specifically, the significant progress in senior high school participation in China urgently needs to be explained. If access to higher education can be proven to be decisive in secondary education participation, some new policy implications can be derived to further enhance the education in China and in other developing nations.====The overall goal of this paper is to examine whether and how the rural children senior high school enrollment rate was affected by the HEE. To meet this goal, two specific objectives are developed. The first one is to identify and measure the casual effect of the HEE on the senior high school enrollment rate of rural children. The second one is to confirm that the increased expected gain from staying in school is the intermediate mechanism of the effect.====A (quasi-) difference-in-differences (DD) strategy based on two waves of nationwide micro survey data collected in 2000 and 2005 is used to investigate these questions. Rural students have generally been low rankers in the ====, and gain more from college, so the HEE has typically marginally benefited rural students more than urban students. Accordingly, the hypothesis of this study is that educational decision-making of rural individuals is more sensitive to the HEE. Therefore, in the baseline model developed in this study, rural children eligible for senior high schools are the treatment group and their urban counterparts are the control group. Pooled cross-sectional data are used to estimate the relative change in the senior high enrollment rates for the two groups. To verify the causality between the HEE and the DD effect, a triple-differences (DDD) test is conducted by exploiting the disparity of the HEE intensity among regions. Additionally, an indirect parallel trend test is conducted to further strengthen the verification. With regard to the mechanism analysis, more triple-differences regressions are conducted to check whether the effect of the HEE is larger in regions with larger college gains for people from rural backgrounds.====Baseline results shows that, after controlling for other observables, the probability that rural eligible individuals would attend senior high schools increased by 0.18 more than the probability for urban individuals from 2000 to 2005. According to results of causality tests, the baseline DD effect was indeed caused by the HEE. In the mechanism analysis, it was found that the impact of the HEE on rural children senior high school enrollment rate was larger in regions with higher college income returns or greater income gaps between urban and rural groups. Thus, it can be argued that there was increased expected gain from going to senior high school that encouraged rural children to stay in school. The results of this study could provide early evidence that higher education development may spill over to lower levels of education. This spillover effect may lead to an under-estimation of the social returns of higher education expansion.====This study contributes to the research on the importance of increasing returns to education. There have been many studies that have dealt with the outcome of educational subsidy policies (Benhassine et al., 2015; Mo et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2017), but very few studies have considered improving education by increasing returns to education. However, in the context of developing countries where distortions and misallocations are normal, there is great potential to elevate educational returns via structural reforms. Using China as an example, the potential returns to education have not been fully realized because of the ==== system, land policies, and other social programs that have obstructed flows of labor into big cities where educational returns are strikingly high (Liang and Lu, 2017; Liang et al., 2016; Lu and Xiang, 2016). Based on the results of the mechanism analysis, if these barriers can be removed, the government’s recent goal of universalizing upper secondary education will be much less costly to accomplish.====This study also adds to the research to identify the specific causal effect of the HEE on rural senior high participation in three ways. First, compared with existing studies (Du and Yang, 2014; Xing, 2014), there is stronger causality verification in this study. Second, this study provides a more accurate measure of rural children enrollment rate increases caused by the HEE. Third, this study confirms that the intermediate mechanism of the effect is indeed an increased expected gain from senior high schooling.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the educational institutional background in China and the HEE. Section 3 describes the data and outlines the empirical strategy used in this study. The empirical results are presented and discussed in section 4.

A nonparametric approach is adopted to investigate the long-run distribution dynamics. Intertemporal dynamics and spatial conditional dynamics are analysed to explore the impacts of the global financial crisis and knowledge spill-over on intangibles’ distribution. It is shown that the formation of convergence clusters persists in the long run. High levels of investment tend to be concentrated in a few coastal regions while investment in most Chinese regions is projected to be low. External shocks exert an adverse effect: The post-global financial crisis transition dynamics indicate that most regions tend to converge towards a lower level than the pre-crisis dynamics imply. Finally, knowledge spill-over in the context of intangibles is identified to be an important factor that helps mitigate regional imbalance.","World economies are transforming into knowledge-based ones due to the revolution in information technology. Investment in intangible capital thus becomes crucial for a country’s future competitiveness and sustainable development (World Bank, 2006).==== Following this trend, intangible capital development has received increasing attention in China. In order to understand its impacts on economic and productivity growth in China, intangible investment and its capital stock is measured at different levels and examined in growth accounting exercises (Hulten and Hao, 2012; Tian et al., 2016; Li and Wu, 2018). A positive relationship between intangible capital and Chinese firm performance is reported (Yang et al., 2018). However, these studies have not addressed the impacts of intangible capital on China’s regional development. If intangible capital contributes significantly and unevenly to regional economic development, studies of Chinese economy would be incomplete without considering intangibles across regions.====This study aims to fill in this gap by examining regional intangible capital distribution dynamics and drawing implications for regional development in China. To achieve this goal, we analyse not only a current distribution map but also the convergence or divergence development of intangible capital in Chinese regions. In China, coastal regions took advantages of cheap labour, geographical proximity to the world market, and preferential policies to become the spearhead of economic reform (OECD, 2010). Spatial imbalance has therefore increased sharply since the early 1980s and rendered China among the most unequal countries in the world. However, since the mid-2000s, there has been evidence of spatial rebalancing in China because of government policies, structural changes, rising costs, and backwardness advantages (Feng, 2009; Wei, 2009; OECD, 2010; Deng and Jefferson, 2011; Andersson et al., 2013). Nevertheless, intangible capital was included in none of these studies. We argue that spatial rebalancing in China would be difficult if intangible investment is persistently highly concentrated in a few coastal areas.====Intangible capital is expected to further increase spatial imbalance in China. Krugman (1998) suggested that intangible capital like research and development (hereafter, R&D) is tacit knowledge, which is non-codified and requires face-to-face interactions. Corrado et al. (2006) pointed that intangible investment, which is non-rival and non-excludable, is an important source of externality. Haskel and Westlake (2018) emphasised that two key characteristics of intangible capital are spill-overs and synergies, namely intangible investments have unusually high spill-overs and benefit from combining resources. Therefore, in an intangible economy, we would expect that intangible-intensive firms concentrate in the growing, diverse regions where they are more likely to benefit from spill-overs and synergy effects and enjoy high productivity. Meanwhile, as the “carrier” of knowledge and innovation, intangible capital could transfer knowledge to other industries and act as a catalyst for external economies of scale. Therefore, intangible capital is expected to fuel China’s diverse and growing coastal regions where large innovation hubs are located. Once the economies of scale are obtained, coastal regions in turn attract more intangible capital. By observing intangible distribution dynamics, our results imply that this type of “self-fulfilling” process worsens the existing disparity in intangible capital investment and will eventually lead to an increase in regional inequality in China.====This study contributes to the existing literature in several ways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines Chinese intangible capital distribution dynamics at the regional level. Utilising novel data, we provide evidence of the unbalanced development of intangible assets in Chinese regions, and predict steady-state distribution based on the current transition path. A large investment gap is detected between the coastal and interior regions, and coastal regions are expected to outperform the rest of China in terms of intangible investment in the long-run. Furthermore, intertemporal distribution dynamics are examined to analyse the impacts of global financial crisis. It is indicated that the global financial crisis exerts a significant impact on intangible investment in China, especially in intangible-intensive regions. Additionally, since geography can be a possible channel for intangible spill-over, we also study the distribution conditional on distances between regions. Knowledge spill-over is observed to be an important channel determining the convergence towards the average investment level exhibited by neighbouring regions. In terms of the research method, we apply a non-parametric approach to fully capture the complexity of the underlying distribution dynamics. The approach imposes no prerequisite assumption or restriction on the distribution function. Furthermore, we augment the mobility probability plot approach of Cheong and Wu (2013, 2014) by computing confidence intervals for the estimates of transition probabilities by using a bootstrapping method. The augmented method enables hypothesis testing and the computation of confidence levels in transition dynamic analysis.====The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on intangible capital globally and in China. The measurement of intangible capital and an overview of the shape of capital distribution are presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the non-parametric approach to distribution dynamics analysis. The results based on the full sample, sub-periods, economic zones, and spatial factors are reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper and provides policy implications.",Intangible capital distribution in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518305715,June 2019,2019,Research Article,127.0

We construct a new database on short- and long-term credit provided by commercial banks to the private sector in 85 countries over the period 1995–2014. We then analyze whether differences in entrepreneurship are related to the provision of short- and long-term bank credit. Data on entrepreneurship are extracted from two frequently used databases: the Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring dataset and the Entrepreneurship Database, each of which captures different aspects of firm creation. The econometric results indicate that long-term credit does not stimulate firm entry. By contrast, we find that short-term credit is positively related to firm creation, from birth to registration. Controlling for potential endogeneity by implementing an ==== approach does not affect our conclusions. Our findings suggest that better provision of short-term credit allows entrepreneurs to apply for formal loans instead of having to rely exclusively on informal loans or internal funds. The absence of impact of long-term loans can be explained by the difficulty entrepreneurs face in getting access to long-term credit.","Entrepreneurship plays a vital role in a country’s growth and overall economic development by creating new jobs, supporting the emergence of new products and sectors, introducing innovation, spurring competition and productivity, and fostering knowledge diffusion (Audretsch et al., 2006; Wennekers and Thurik, 1999). Understanding the institutional drivers of entrepreneurship is therefore of prime importance in designing effective policies. Existing papers have documented that alongside macroeconomic factors (Koellinger and Thurik, 2012; Wennekers et al., 2005) and business regulation (Djankov et al., 2002; Klapper et al., 2006), financial constraint is one of the crucial determinants of new firm creation (Evans and Jovanovic, 1989; King and Levine, 1993).====While better access to external finance is expected to spur entrepreneurship, short- and long-term credit may play differing roles in the development of new business ventures. We expect that some entry barriers, such as administrative fees, could be alleviated by short-term credit. The impact of the provision of long-term financing for entrepreneurs is more ambiguous. In theory, entrepreneurs may benefit from long-term financing to overcome entry costs, including those requiring long-term immobilization of capital (such as investment in projects with delayed returns). In practice, however, one might raise doubts about the positive impact of long-term financing if entrepreneurs are unable to get access to it. Loans with longer maturity may be oriented towards existing borrowers who have a previous relationship with a formal lender, to the detriment of new borrowers.====This paper empirically evaluates the impact of short- and long-term credit on entrepreneurial activity. We first compile a new database on short- and long-term credit extended to private sector borrowers relative to GDP. We focus exclusively on credit provided by commercial banks because data on other long-term finance sources are rarely available and not comparable across countries. Nonetheless, bank lending is the primary source of credit for entrepreneurs and young firms, especially in developing countries. We define short-term credit as credit with a maturity of one year or less and long-term credit as loans whose maturity exceeds one year. Our database on bank loan maturity includes all countries (both developed and developing) for which we could identify a consistent data source. The initial dataset covers 85 countries over the period 1995–2014 and includes 48 developing and 37 high-income countries (Léon, 2018b).====We combine our database on bank loan maturity with data on entrepreneurship at the country-year level. We consider two different datasets frequently used in the literature on entrepreneurship: the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) dataset and the Entrepreneurship database (ED). Each database captures a different aspect of entrepreneurship. The GEM database focuses on the early stages of entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur is defined as an individual who creates business (formal or informal; part-time or full-time). The ED captures business registration and concentrates exclusively on the formation of new limited liability companies.====We document that, contrary to short-term credit, long-term credit provision over GDP has no impact on the firm entry rate. Interestingly, while the GEM and ED databases often provide conflicting results (Acs et al., 2008), we find that the provision of short-term credit seems beneficial to spurring the creation of new businesses (GEM) and registration in the formal sector (ED). We apply an instrumental variable (IV) approach to control for the endogeneity issue. Our econometric results based on IV estimations confirm the positive impact of short-term credit and the absence of effect of long-term credit. Our econometric results are robust to a battery of additional sensitivity tests (additional control variables, sample sensitivity, alternative dependent variables).====Our paper directly contributes to the extensive empirical literature on the impact of banking development on entrepreneurship. While the theoretical literature is rather unambiguous, the empirical literature does not provide robust proof of the positive effect of banking development on entrepreneurial ventures. Some papers point out that banking development spurs entrepreneurial activity, while others fail to provide a positive relationship (see Section 2). We try to reconcile these divergent views. In this paper, we document that total credit does not impact the firm entry rate. However, this conclusion is challenged when we distinguish between short- and long-term credit. Short-term credit tends to stimulate firm creation, contrary to long-term credit (which has a negative, albeit statistically insignificant, impact on firm creation). The most plausible explanation is that short-term credit complements informal financing and internal funding and allows entrepreneurs to raise additional resources to finance their projects. The absence of impact of long-term loans can be explained by the difficulties entrepreneurs have getting access to them.====This work is also directly linked to the body of literature focusing on the real impact of long-term finance. The existing literature documents that firms with higher long-term debt ratios grow faster than their counterparts (Demirgüç-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1998), have lower growth volatility (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2017) and suffer less from credit contraction following financial crises (Duchin et al., 2010; Vermoesen et al., 2013). This micro-evidence is in line with macro-evidence underlining the positive effect of long-term credit on growth (Valev and Tasic, 2008). To our knowledge, we are the first to study the effect of short- and long-term bank credit provision on firm entry. By focusing on entrepreneurship, we challenge previous findings on the unconditional beneficial impact of long-term credit for firms. The provision of long-term bank credit does not help entrepreneurs create a firm, even if these loans may spur post-entry activity.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature and raises hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data and Section 4 the methodology, while Section 5 discusses the results.

Specifically, we empirically analyze the effect of different monetary policy variables on banks’ risk weights for credit risk. We present robust evidence of a strong, statistically significant relationship between monetary policy easing and lower implicit risk weights of banks using the internal ratings-based approach. Further, we show that the recent prolonged period of accommodative monetary policy has been instrumental in establishing this relationship. The presented findings have important implications for the prudential authority, which should be aware of the possible side effects of monetary policy on how banks measure risk.","In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the effect of a prolonged period of accommodative monetary policy on financial stability (see, for example, Gambacorta, 2009; Borio and Zhu, 2012; Adrian and Liang, 2014). In the short run, monetary policy easing usually enhances the stability of banks, as low interest rates improve the overall quality of their loan portfolios. In the long run, on the other hand, low interest rates may encourage banks to raise both the size and riskiness of their balance sheets in order to attain their original interest margins (the search-for-yield hypothesis; Rajan, 2005; Borio and Zhu, 2012; Jiménez et al., 2014; Dell’Ariccia et al., 2017). Accommodative monetary policy may also contribute to growth in asset prices (and, consequently, collateral value and firms’ income and cash flow), which inherently increases the risk tolerance of financial institutions (Adrian and Shin, 2008).====Another way accommodative monetary policy can influence the behavior of financial institutions, and potentially financial stability, is through its impact on the credit risk parameter estimates, which then enter the calculation of banks’ capital requirements and risk weights under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. Low interest rates may facilitate a decline in the values of these parameters either directly or indirectly through their impact on collateral value and firms’ valuation, income and cash flow (Gambacorta, 2009). For instance, low interest rates and increasing asset prices tend to reduce asset price volatility and increase collateral value, which, in turn, reduces risk perceptions and risk parameter estimates. Further, higher asset prices increase the value of a firm’s equity relative to its debt and thus reduce its leverage. Such a firm looks safer and the risk of holding its shares seems lower. Low interest rates can also affect the perceived riskiness of existing borrowers and new loan applicants, thus further reducing credit risk parameter estimates. In the case of existing borrowers, lower interest rates are reflected in a decline in their debt service costs and hence in their probability of default.==== As for new loan applicants, low interest rates can make them less risky (which may be reflected in a better credit rating), i.e., applicants who would not get a loan at higher interest rates may be seen as creditworthy. Consequently, a decline in credit risk parameter estimates translates into lower risk weights, leading, ceteris paribus, to a higher capital ratio. All in all, assuming an unchanged asset structure and constant risk, the bank can look safer and healthier without its level of capital actually increasing.====This article sets out to test empirically the impact of monetary policy on the implicit risk weights of banks using the IRB approach while controlling for different bank-specific and macroeconomic factors. The analysis draws on a supervisory panel dataset covering banks in the Czech Republic between 2007 Q3 and 2017 Q4. Using this dataset, we are able to distinguish between credit exposures under the IRB approach and the STA approach at a quarterly frequency. Such a distinction would not be possible using the BankScope database, for example.====Apart from the data granularity, the Czech Republic seems to be an ideal candidate for an analysis of the link between monetary policy and IRB risk weights for several reasons. First, the Czech banking sector is homogeneous, consisting mainly of universal banks with a business model focusing on providing loans to the private sector (risk-weighted exposures for credit risk accounted for almost 90% of total risk-weighted exposures as of 2017 Q4). Second, the IRB approach has been adopted by a large part of the sector (approximately 83% as of 2017 Q4) and the Czech Republic has one of the largest shares of capital requirements for credit risk originated by internal models in the EU (Resti, 2016).==== Third, there has been a significant monetary policy easing over a prolonged period of time using both conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools (see Section 4), especially compared to other non-euro area countries in the region. This combination of factors makes it possible to examine the transmission mechanism discussed above.====To our best knowledge, there is no other study for the Czech Republic or any other country in the region analyzing the impact of monetary policy easing on the implicit risk weights of banks using the IRB approach.==== In general, in the empirical literature little attention is given to analyzing this relationship (see Section 2). Moreover, the most closely related studies are conducted on samples of predominantly large publicly traded banks. This article aims to extend the existing literature with a study of a banking sector consisting of relatively small banks that focus primarily on providing loans to the private sector. The contribution of the paper lies not only in the empirical verification of the relationship, but also in the discussion of the implications for financial stability and central bank policies. The Czech National Bank is a monetary authority, a macroprudential authority and a supervisory authority, among other things. In other words, the same institution is responsible for setting monetary policy tools, analyzing risks to financial stability, verifying and approving banks’ internal models, and setting macro- and micro-prudential policy tools. Therefore, it seems to be a natural choice for this type of analysis, which may serve as an input to the ongoing discussion on the unintended side effects of monetary policy on financial stability or, in general, the impact of monetary policy on banks’ behavior.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review, Section 3 presents the econometric framework and Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 reports our main findings and provides a robustness analysis, while Section 6 discusses the implications for financial stability and central bank policy.

The paper also offers what is possibly the first investigation of how the interaction between the performance of loan portfolios and the new Basel III liquidity requirements might shape bank loan growth rates. Using a dataset of 361 commercial banks across 38 African countries over the 2005–2015 period, our static and dynamic panel analyses show that both the NSFR and the LCR exert significant positive effects on bank loan growth rates. The results also reveal that the NSFR reduces the impact of the negative effect of poor performance of loan portfolios on bank loan growth rates. Compliance with the Basel III liquidity rules in Africa is therefore likely to have beneficial impacts on policies intended to increase bank lending in the continent.","The problem of funding liquidity was cited as one of the major causes of the 2007–2009 global financial turmoil (Acharya and Merrouche, 2012; King, 2013). In response, the Basel Committee on Banking and Supervision (BCBS) introduced two separate but complementary liquidity standards. The first is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which requires banking firms to hold adequate high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in order to survive demands for liquidity during significantly stressed conditions lasting over a month. The second standard is the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which seeks to curtail maturity mismatches between bank liabilities and assets.====Although Basel III LCR and NSFR are aimed at strengthening the resilience of the banking system to liquidity shocks and curtailing banks’ maturity mismatches, in practice, these new liquidity requirements might stimulate changes in bank lending propensity. It is therefore important to examine, empirically, the effects of these new liquidity requirements on bank loan growth, since the shortage of stable funding and liquidity was cited as a key factor that limited the ability of banks to provide loans during the 2007–2009 financial crisis (BCBS, 2011; Kim and Sohn, 2017). Deli and Hasan (2017) point out that “more stringent capital regulation can be credit growth-enhancing if it successfully shields the banking sector against crises that have a negative impact on the economy”. From another view, Allen et al. (2012) suggest that the more stringent Basel III capital requirements could, for x-efficiency reasons, lead to lower bank lending rates, which could, in turn, lead to higher loan growth. However, the Institute of International Finance (2011) argues that higher liquidity and stable funding requirements will lead to an increase in the cost of bank funding and that banks will pass this higher cost on to borrowers in the form of higher lending rates, which, according to the author, can lead to lower demand for bank loans.====The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the potential impact of the Basel III NSFR and LCR on bank loan growth rates. The paper also examines how the interaction between loan quality and the Basel III liquidity requirements might shape bank loan growth rates. While there is a considerable amount of scholarship on the implications of bank regulatory measures, little is known about the potential impacts of the Basel III NSFR and LCR. It is hoped that this gap in the literature will be filled by this paper’s examination of the impact of the new liquidity requirements on bank lending growth in 38 African countries. While most African countries have not started implementing the Basel III NSFR and LCR requirements (Financial Stability Institute (FSI, 2015; BCBS, 2018), the literature suggests that the new liquidity measures can be estimated using existing bank balance sheet data and that their potential effects can be examined (Ashraf et al., 2016; Vazquez and Federico, 2015; Ly et al., 2017; Distinguin et al., 2013; Dietrich et al., 2014). The purpose of this investigation is therefore to anticipate the possible loan growth effects of the new liquidity requirement in Africa. We believe that this is the first empirical study of the impact of NSFR and LCR on bank loan growth in Africa.====To achieve the aim of this study, we first estimate bank NSFR following Vazquez and Federico (2015). Secondly, due to the limited granularity of the balance sheet information necessary to compute LCR, we use the ratio of liquid assets to deposits and short-term funding as a proxy for LCR, as suggested by Chiaramonte and Casu (2017). Finally, based on a dataset of 361 commercial banks operating in 38 African countries over the 2005–2015 period, we use panel regressions to examine the impact of NSFR and LCR on bank loan growth rates. The results show that both the NSFR and the LCR exert significant positive effects on bank loan growth rates. The results also reveal that the NSFR reduces the impact of the negative effect of poor performance of loan portfolios on bank loan growth rates. These findings suggest that complying with the Basel III liquidity rules in Africa will have beneficial impacts on policies intended to increase bank lending in the continent.====This investigation contributes to the literature on the effects of bank capitalization on lending. There have been many studies seeking to identify the lending effects of bank capital, particularly since the BCBS’s adoption of the minimum capital requirement regulation in 1988. These studies can be divided into two strands of literature. The first strand focuses on the impact of regulatory capital requirements on bank lending (see, among others, Aiyar et al., 2014; Bridges et al., 2014; Ediz et al., 1998; Labonne and Lamé, 2014; Osei-Assibey and Asenso, 2015). For example, using time-varying bank-specific minimum capital requirements imposed by UK regulators, Aiyar et al. (2014) seek to determine if changes in capital requirements have an impact on the loan supply of regulated banks, and show that regulated banks reduce lending in response to stricter regulatory capital requirements. In an earlier study, using confidential supervisory data including information about the profit and loss and balance sheets of all British banks over the 1989–1995 period, Ediz et al. (1998) conclude that regulatory capital requirements have significant effects on banks’ own internally generated capital targets, but that banks appear to adjust by directly boosting their capital rather than reducing lending. Osei-Assibey and Asenso (2015) examine the extent to which minimum capital requirements set by Ghanaian regulators affect bank lending using the gap between the minimum capital required and a bank’s actual capital position. They show that high minimum capital requirements and excess capital buffers stimulate credit expansion.====The second strand of literature on the lending effects of bank capital focuses on the impact of the observed bank capital ratios or levels on bank lending.==== There are several studies that analyze the relative impact of different types of capital ratios (such as the total equity capital ratio, the tier 1 capital ratio and the risk-weighted capital ratio) on bank lending. Cornett et al. (2011) find that banks that relied more heavily on equity capital (which is a stable source of funds) were able to continue lending during the 2008 financial crisis compared to other banks. Gambacorta and Marques-lbanez (2011), in a study using quarterly data of 1000 banks in 15 countries over the period 1999–2009, show that a tier 1 capital ratio has a significant positive effect on bank lending during the 2008 financial crisis. Using a cross-country bank panel dataset over 2000–2010, Kosak et al. (2015) examine the significance of the quality of bank capital to bank lending growth during the crisis. Confirming the findings of Gambacorta and Marques-lbanez (2011), they find a significant positive effect of the tier 1 capital ratio on bank lending during the period under consideration and suggest that high-quality bank capital is a competitive strength in times of crisis. Carlson et al. (2013) compare differences in loan growths to differences in capital ratios and find that U.S. commercial banks’ capital ratios have more significant effects on lending when capital ratios are relatively low. Their research also demonstrates that certain types of loans are more sensitive to capital adequacy than other types. The present investigation expands the existing literature by using a measure of stable capital introduced in the new Basel III accord.====This inquiry is also related to studies that investigate the effects of bank liquidity on bank lending. However, as Banerjee and Mio (2018) have noted, “there has only been limited empirical research which evaluates the impact of liquidity regulation on banks.” The reason for this may be that the Basel I and II accords focused on bank capital regulation and excluded liquidity regulation. Researchers usually use assets and liability ratios to account for the distinct lending impacts of bank liquidity levels (see, among others, Allen and Paligorova, 2015; Alper et al., 2012; Berrospide and Edge, 2010; Banerjee and Mio, 2018; Cornett et al., 2011; Gambacorta and Mistrulli, 2004). In this connection, Cornett et al. (2011) show that banks with more illiquid assets increased their asset liquidity and decreased lending during the recent financial crisis. Focusing on Italian banks, Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) find that banks with higher liquidity levels – measured by the sum of cash and securities to total assets ratio – can better shield their lending from the effects of a decrease in deposits on lending. In their study of the effects of bank capital on lending, Berrospide and Edge (2010) use the securities to total assets ratio to examine the extent to which US bank holding companies use their liquidity levels to adjust their loan growth. The authors find strong significant positive impacts of bank liquidity levels on bank lending. Similarly, Zulkhibri (2013) provides evidence that the ratio of liquid assets to total assets is positively associated with bank total loans in Malaysia. Kim and Sohn (2017) and Alfaro et al. (2003) also suggest a positive effect of bank liquidity on lending. Kim and Sohn (2017) find that the ratio of liquid assets to total assets is positively and significantly associated with the quarterly real growth rate of net loans in the US commercial banking sector. Using the ratio of liquid assets to total assets and data from both the banking and the corporate sector, Alfaro et al. (2003) utilize a vector autoregression (VAR) framework to investigate the influence of bank liquidity on bank lending in Chile. The authors establish a positive link between liquidity and growth of loans. Examining the effects of the US financial crisis on retail bank lending in Germany, Puri et al. (2011) observe that high liquidity-constrained banks reject substantially more loan applications throughout the financial crisis than low liquidity-constrained banks.====Using a panel dataset of 13 Turkish commercial banks, Alper et al. (2012) empirically examine whether monetary policies can have an impact on bank lending by changing the liquidity positions of banks. The authors find that any monetary policy that can affect the banking sector’s liquidity is potentially effective on bank lending. Altunbas et al. (2010) and Kashyap and Stein (2000) also find that banks with lower liquidity decrease their loan supply more rapidly in response to monetary tightening. By contrast, Banerjee and Mio (2018) do not find evidence that the tightening of liquidity regulation caused banks to reduce their lending. The present study contributes to these insights by employing a measure of bank liquidity levels inspired by the new Basel III accord.====The rest of this article is structured as follows. The next section provides a brief discussion of the implementation and relevance of the Basel accords in African countries and the third section outlines the study’s methodology, sources of data and preliminary analyses, while Section 4 contains the main results and robustness checks.

Applying the Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) model in a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) setting, the results suggest a strong causal relationship between mutual fund flows and measures of investors’ future expectations. In particular, fund flows are forward-looking and assist in forecasting real ","Mutual funds play a significant role for financial markets and hence economic growth. They represent a major portion of investors and influence the economy in three different ways. First, mutual fund investors incorporate macroeconomic information in their portfolios and reallocate their investments to safer investment avenues so as to safeguard themselves from expected (unexpected) losses (Flannery and Protopapadakis, 2002; Kaul and Phillips, 2008). Similarly, investment strategies such as holding more cash in a recession, lowering the portfolio beta and sector rotation (investing more in defensive industries during recession and in cyclical industries in boom periods) entail that mutual funds formulate investment modifications over the business cycle (Kacperczyk et al., 2013). Second, mutual fund flows predict economic conditions that help policymakers forecast macroeconomic conditions (Kaul and Phillips, 2008; Ferson and Kim, 2012; Jank, 2012; Kopsch et al., 2015). Third, mutual fund flows provide capital to the economy, thereby injecting liquidity into the capital market and the real economy while assisting diversification (Halim, 2007). The funds are invested in different securities (such as stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) in both domestic and international markets and thus influence the overall economy. Finance theory suggests that both economic information and news affect asset prices. Numerous channels highlight the relationship between macroeconomic variables (such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, unemployment and the interest rate) and financial market securities (such as stocks, bonds, money market and other market securities).====Early studies on fundamental macroeconomic variables and stock markets by Bodie (1976) and Fama (1981) explain the relationship between inflation and stock returns concerning real economic activity. Similarly, Kaul (1987) and Du (2006) consider the relationship between inflation and stock returns given the monetary policy effect (demand and supply shocks). Studies show that the macroeconomic risk is highly related to aggregate investments, employment and output dynamics (Bloom et al., 2007; Bloom, 2009). These potential links suggest that the price of financial securities is associated with changes in macroeconomic variables.==== Hence, the expected performance of market participants in financial markets is likely to be influenced by macroeconomic news. In this vein, Jank (2012) suggests that mutual funds react to new macroeconomic information, which is then reflected in both fund flows and market prices. He argues that the predictor variables can forecast variations in mutual fund flows better than market returns. Therefore, we expect that, as institutional investors, mutual funds are affected due to the funds’ sensitivity to macroeconomic dynamics.====Despite the extensive literature on the relationship between financial markets and the macroeconomy, studies on the linkage between financial market investors (e.g. mutual funds) and the macroeconomy are scarce and limited in scope. For instance, limited studies address the questions whether mutual fund flows affect economic conditions and whether fund flows contain information about future economic conditions.==== Some of the existing literature explains that investment by funds is mostly driven by investor sentiment rather than information about real economic fundamentals (Kaul and Phillips, 2008).==== In this vein, Oh and Parwada (2007) argue that it is controversial whether fund flows contain information about real economic activity or not. Several studies have been conducted on the flow-performance relationship of mutual funds at the micro level (Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferreira et al., 2012; Kacperczyk et al., 2013). However, there has been limited work on the performance of mutual funds at the macro level and the associated macroeconomic risk (e.g., Jank, 2012; Ferson and Kim, 2012; Bali et al., 2014). Although mutual funds have expanded globally, evidence of their flow-macroeconomic nexus is scarce and geographically limited. Previous studies have mostly been conducted in developed economies in single country settings (Cao et al., 2008; Jank, 2012; Alexakis et al., 2013; Aydogan et al., 2014; Bali et al., 2014). Studies addressing the relationship between mutual funds and the business cycle in emerging markets are nearly non-existent.====Our interest is to examine the relationship of equity, bond, balanced and money market mutual funds with the business cycle in BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) markets using measures of macroeconomic conditions. The BRICS economies are the chief beneficiaries of international investments and capital flows. International investors pay special attention to the co-movement of the BRICS stock markets with international economic factors and global economic financial conditions, given the opportunity of investment and risk diversification (Mensi et al., 2014). Studies suggest that integrated regional markets are more proficient compared to fragmented national markets (Click and Plummer, 2005). While many developed countries face severe adverse economic problems and recessions, emerging economies such as the BRICS countries are less affected by the economic and financial crunches and have maintained vigorous growth (Samargandi and Kutan, 2016b). Moreover, the financial sectors of the BRICS have developed noticeably over the last two decades. The growing international ties and financial trade among the BRICS economies have termed them potential economic superpowers (O’Neill, 2011). Given the progressive role of the BRICS countries as emergent developing economies, examining the role of mutual funds as institutional investors is relevant and interesting.====The contributions of this study are manifold. First, it extends the work of Jank (2012) and provides empirical evidence on four different types of mutual funds (i.e., equity, bond, balanced and money market mutual funds) and measures of investors’ future expectations in the BRICS countries. Unlike Jank (2012), who focuses only on equity funds and their association with market returns and macroeconomic variables, this study provides a comparative analysis of four mutual fund classes in relation to investors’ future expectations and business cycle variables. Moreover, the work of Jank (2012) is limited to the US financial market, whereas our study explores the relationship in multiple country settings where we believe the findings can differ from those of developed countries due to the well-developed financial markets, higher access to information, lower participation costs and highly secured regulatory systems of the latter (Ferreira et al., 2012). On the other hand, financial markets in developing economies are characterized by fragile market mechanisms, lesser access to information, higher participation costs, improper regulatory systems and high volatility (Khorana et al., 2005; Halim, 2007). Moreover, several studies==== have indicated that mutual funds are more sophisticated in their investment decisions and tend to be less behaviorally biased in developed countries. These features inspire us to examine the role of mutual funds in developing economies that lack proper information mechanisms and market structures to facilitate investment.====Second, this study analyses the behavior of risky mutual funds in comparison to less risky ones in different economic setups.==== This is particularly important given the risky and volatile nature of financial markets in developing countries, which entails comprehensive insights into asset allocation and forecasting decisions for portfolio managers, market analysts and policymakers. Third, we extend the Jank (2012) model by including additional variables such as money supply, the budget deficit to GDP ratio, the investment ratio and unemployment to provide further insights into the relationship of funds flows and business cycle variables. Finally, we apply panel data and thus take advantage of the cross-country dimensions of the dataset. Overall, the contribution of this study provides additional evidence from BRICS economies on the relationship between mutual fund flows, investors’ expectations and business cycle variables. The findings suggest that mutual fund flows and measures of investors’ future expectations are significantly interrelated. Furthermore, as risky securities, equity and balanced fund flows are more reactive to information related to macroeconomic variables compared to less risky securities such as bonds and money market fund flows. In addition, investors switch from equity based funds to fixed income type funds in times of economic crises.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The data and variables are discussed in Section 2. A description of the model and the estimation techniques is provided in Section 3. Section 4 proceeds with the empirical analysis and a discussion of the results.

Following the literature, the transition countries are divided into three groups – Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and the non-Baltic states of the former Soviet Union with Mongolia – based on the speed of their transformation. Regressions based on Andersen’s conceptual framework show no difference in public health care use between the three groups in 2010. By 2016, however, the share of households using the public health care system dropped by remarkable 17.1–22.2% points in Southern Europe and 13.5–27.1% points in the former Soviet Union with Mongolia compared to Eastern Europe. Moreover, by 2016, the probability of a household using the private health care system (with no use of public health care) in Southern Europe and the former Soviet Union was 7.5–18.7% points higher than in Eastern Europe, whereas it was 2.9–6.8% points lower than in Eastern Europe back in 2010. The analyses indicate that differences in household characteristics, as well as perceived ==== and quality of public health care, help to understand these diverging trends in health care use in the three groups of transition countries between 2010 and 2016.","Former socialist countries were characterized by high utilization rates of health care services that were almost exclusively provided by the state. Specifically, countries in the former Eastern Bloc relied on a centrally-planned “Semashko” health care system providing universal coverage and free (at least on paper) services at the point of use. Despite the advantage of free universal access to health services, the Semashko system suffered from an inefficient delivery of care, high numbers of non-health personnel, low salaries of health professionals and poor access to modern health technologies (Rechel and McKee, 2009).====After the collapse of communism in the 1990s, health care systems in transition countries suffered from two major shocks. Fiscal shocks reduced the ability of governments to spend on health while integration into the world economy increased relative prices, particularly for medicines and energy (Kutzin et al., 2010). These shocks forced governments to implement reforms in financing, organizing and delivering health care, particularly related to reducing overutilization and promoting a greater involvement of the private health care sector, which was virtually non-existent under communism.====As a result of these transformations, both features of socialist health care systems – high utilization rates and almost no private sector involvement – have been changing drastically. Specifically, in 2010, 70% of the population in transition countries had used public health care in the previous 12 months according to the “Life in Transition II” survey (Steves et al., 2011). By 2016, this rate had dropped to 56% of the population in the 12 months prior to the “Life in Transition III” survey (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2016), a share much closer to that found in developed European countries (55% for Germany and 62% for Italy). As for private sector involvement, in many transition countries, formal and informal out-of-pocket payments now account for a major part of total health expenditures (Rechel and McKee, 2009).====Previous studies also indicate that the process of transition may be far from uniform in different groups of transition countries (Gros and Suhrke, 2000; Habibov and Cheung, 2017). Specifically, the literature divides the countries of the former Eastern Bloc into the most developed group of Eastern Europe, the less reformed countries in Southern Europe, and the least transformed non-Baltic republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and Mongolia.====The purpose of the current study is to identify recent trends in health care use in the three groups of transition countries, focusing on overall utilization rates as well as on public and private health care use separately. To address this research question, the current paper explores trends in overall, public and private health care utilization using data on more than 60,000 households from the “Life in Transition” surveys II and III conducted in 28 transition nations in 2010 and 2016.====The analyses in the paper, based on Andersen’s (1995) conceptual framework of health care use, indicate a major shift in public health care use towards private, out-of-pocket expenditures in Southern Europe and the former Soviet Union relative to more developed Eastern Europe. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper to identify such a substantial divergence in health care use in the three groups of transition countries. The reported results should be trustworthy, as they are based on large, nationally representative samples for 28 transition countries. In addition, using household weights with robust standard errors clustered at the primary sampling unit (PSU) level provides the most reliable estimates.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes previous studies on mixed public and private provision of health services and determinants of health care utilization in the transition context. The third section outlines the “Life in Transition” survey and its methodology, defines outcome variables as well as included covariates, and describes the estimation approach.

To do so, we compose 15 different FSIs using 14 variables that will represent five different markets, i.e. the money market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market, the equity market and the banking sector. We aggregate these five different markets using a variety of techniques, including ","The burst of the 2008 global financial crisis has reignited interest in systemic stress and early warning indicators. The financial stress that culminated from uncertainties in the global financial markets and rippled through the real economy demonstrates the need for effective early warning systems. Despite the financial systemic stress originating in advanced economies, its spillover effects don’t discriminate between sound and unsound economies. While most emerging economies remained relatively stable during the 2008 global financial crisis and the global economic downturn that followed, monitoring systemic stress via early warning practices and FSIs have become indispensable tools for economic policymaking.====Detecting and quantifying financial stress and its systemic risk conduits have been some of the main concerns for regulatory authorities, especially after the 2008 global financial crisis. The intensified search for viable early warning systems is justified by the length and depth of the recessions that are followed by financial stress. As Claessens et al. (2010, 2012) empirically find, recessions associated with financial disruptions are often deeper and more destructive. Financial stress is generally coupled with reduced wealth, constrained credit and a reduction in firms’ collateral. Borio (2014) argues that banking systems not only provide real resources, but also change purchasing power and have a direct hit on the real economy. During recessions coinciding with episodes of busts, the macroeconomy usually displays sharper downturns partly due to negative wealth effects, reduced credit and widespread uncertainties.====Empirical investigation of financial crises generally rests on the development of tools that enable their precise dating and quantification. Binary codification is generally employed for dating and is based on subjective evaluation. However, as argued by Danninger et al. (2009), binary codification does not provide a measure of the intensity of stress and ignores the ambiguity of the “crisis” definition, e.g. the existence of a pseudo-crisis, which is very close to being defined as a crisis but is not actually considered one. Foreseeing a crisis prior to a tolerable time period is a success measure for early warning systems. It is, however, of at least equal importance to have a measure of “stress” that may result in a financial crisis. In that case, a binary indicator only defining the time boundaries of a possible crisis may not be adequate, particularly for policymakers who are mandated to formulate effective policies during the build-up of a possible crisis. To evaluate financial stress, the formulation of stress episodes is also critically important. A metric that solely accounts for banking, currency or the debt market may not be appropriate, as the interaction among different segments of financial markets may intensify and lead to a systemic crisis afterwards. Developing stress indicators for various segments of financial markets and aggregating them into a composite indicator enable one to monitor the propagation of a crisis and its channels. In this framework, an FSI will be an invaluable tool for measuring and monitoring the current state of financial stress and summarizing it as a continuous time series.====Although FSIs have the objective to foresee stress periods timely and accurately, the data selection, aggregation and calibration schemes of each indicator vary substantially. Most studies on FSIs develop high frequency indicators that utilize market data, while some employ a mixed dataset and a few use balance sheet data.==== Considering the aggregation schemes, the most popular one is equal variance weights, as it is easy to implement and comprehend.==== Some others consider factor analysis or PCA, which relies on extracting a common component among a number of variables. A recent approach employed by Holló et al. (2012) focuses on the correlations between various financial segments as indicating the likelihood of a systemic crisis, since, by definition, intensified interactions create greater damage on the real economy. The mentioned approaches to FSIs are relatively easy to implement and comment, however, some studies quantify financial stress via more complex and sophisticated approaches like dynamic factor analysis.====The endeavor of detecting a financial crisis and monitoring its build-up phase in a timely manner prompted academicians and policymakers to create FSIs for various countries. Several papers, including Lall et al. (2009); Blix Grimaldi (2010) and Melvin and Taylor (2009), investigate FSIs for a set of advanced economies, and others, like Danninger et al. (2009) and Park and Mercado (2014), examine transmission channels of financial stress between advanced and emerging economies. Although there are many single country studies, most of them focus primarily on advanced economies,==== with notable exceptions being Morales and Estrada (2010) and Cevik et al. (2013), who study Colombia and Turkey, respectively.==== Our paper, which is one of few studies on financial stress indicators in Turkey, differs from those in terms of the variety of model coverage, i.e. Camlica and Gunes (2016) and Cevik et al. (2013) use principal components and portfolio theory models to construct an FSI, while we use most of the models covered in the literature, make a model comparison and finally come up with an aggregated FSI. Indeed, our paper is the first in the literature to compare many varieties of aggregation methods and offer model averaging based on these methods. We illustrate that nearly every model captures basic global stress periods, yet they all differ with respect to their representation of local stress periods, which we believe is related to the weights given to different financial markets. In Turkey, local financial stress periods are conceived to be mostly related to volatility in foreign exchange markets by policymakers. However, our FSI covers five different markets where high stress periods of foreign currency can be offset by low stress in other financial markets, i.e. the stock market and the banking sector.====As emerging economies are rapidly integrating into global and regional markets, the cross-border effects of national crises are getting more destructive. The transmission of financial crises is often amplified by co-movements in asset prices and capital flows. Economies that share similar fundamentals and have strong macroeconomic interdependence are more affected by peer country crises. Herding behaviors also exacerbate crisis effects, as international investors present withdrawals without assessing the fundamentals of peer countries. In the past 30 years, the Turkish economy has experienced several episodes of financial stress, some having national characteristics and others resulting from spillover effects of global or regional crises. The crises in 1994 and 2001 have been the major ones that led to a successful restructuring of the economy. The successful implementation of various reforms has geared up the economy and the country recovered from crisis while achieving significant growth until the 2008 global financial crisis. However, Turkey has several linkages with its peer emerging countries and is a candidate country of the European Union. An instance of possible financial stress in Turkey is also a credible threat for these countries. We thus argue that monitoring and foreseeing financial stress in Turkey is not solely a national regulatory concern but has potential cross-country impacts.====This paper introduces an FSI for the Turkish financial system. We discuss various aggregation approaches to compute FSIs, including equal-weighting, PCA, basic portfolio theory and a Bayesian dynamic factor model, and eventually offer a single FSI averaging all different indicators via model averaging. Although there is some degree of disagreement between the variants of FSIs in terms of their forecasting power, all the variables quite effectively point to similar tension periods during the sample period. This result motivates us to benefit from the information content of all the indicators via a model averaging scheme. Therefore, we introduce a final FSI for Turkey by adopting a weighting scheme that computes rolling correlations between economic activity (industrial production index) and 15 different FSIs. This model averaging scheme, which employs weighting with respect to industrial production, allows us to include the information content of 15 different FSIs in proportion to its correlation with economic activity in a dynamic structure and increased accuracy.====The present paper is not the first to discuss an FSI for Turkey, but as far as we know, it is the first in the literature to discuss many FSIs and obtain a single one via model averaging. Although the papers in the literature generally propose a few methodologies to compute FSIs, we observe that the proposed methodologies may not overlap in quantifying financial stress. We believe that aggregating various FSIs addresses this caveat. It is encouraging that we find that the final FSI for Turkey successfully indicates well accepted tension periods.====This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the variables and the related transformation and aggregation techniques in computing the FSIs. Section 3 discusses the choice of FSIs by evaluating the performance of indicators in predicting economic activity. Section 4 presents a model averaging scheme based on weights with respect to an industrial production index to compute a final FSI.

We find a negative and significant relationship between bank integration and short-run fluctuations in output, consumption and investment, controlling for financial development, bank concentration and the real effective exchange rate. However, this relationship is found to be positive at high levels of financial development. We also explore the association at the regional level and show that the presence of foreign banks in Latin America is negatively and significantly correlated with macroeconomic volatility both in normal times and times of crisis. Despite widespread concerns in emerging Europe, which experienced greater financial vulnerability during the global financial crisis, we find no significant association between growth volatilities and bank integration.","The financial systems and economies of many emerging markets have benefited from financial integration through banks over the past two decades. Foreign banks have enhanced the financial expertise and contributed credit access in countries with underdeveloped banking systems (Giannetti and Ongena, 2012) and provided external financing even during episodes of local financial turmoil (Goldberg et al., 2000; Schnabl, 2012; De Haas and Van Lelyveld, 2014). However, there is also evidence that the entry of foreign banks has increased competition and adversely affected the availability of credit in some developing countries (Beck et al., 2004; Gormley, 2010, 2014). For example, Detragiache et al. (2008) document that the positive effect of foreign banks on cost efficiency and welfare is not valid for all economies. Relatively little is known as to why foreign banks have different effects on the economies of developing countries. We contribute to this literature by examining the relationship between banking integration and short-term macroeconomic fluctuations among emerging economies in different regions. It appears that the country’s level of financial development plays a significant role on the dynamics between volatility and bank integration.====There is a broad consensus in the theoretical and empirical literature that high macroeconomic volatility tends to depress investment, bias it toward short-term returns, reduce consumption levels and factor productivity, increase poverty and worsen income distribution (see e.g., Foster, 1995; Breen and García-Peñalosa, 2005; Laursen and Mahajan, 2005). Its harmful effects are more pronounced in emerging market economies (Hnatkovska and Loayza, 2005; Koren and Tenreyro, 2007). However, there are only a few papers that examine the association between the presence of foreign banks and macroeconomic volatility. For example, in their influential paper, measuring volatility with the deviation of the actual employment growth rate from the expected rate, Morgan et al. (2004) show that out-of-state banks (which can be considered “foreign”) had a stabilizing effect on economic activity among US states. However, using a sample of 102 countries, Morgan and Strahan (2004) find no association between foreign banks and real GDP volatility, but a positive association between foreign banks and real investment volatility. Their sample period, 1990 to 1997, coincides with the early years of foreign bank entry into host countries. The average share of bank assets controlled by foreign banks in the majority of their sample countries was small. Moreover, their sample period does not cover a large-scale financial crisis, which may compel foreign banks to reconsider their commitment to sustaining sufficient levels of external financing in the host countries.====Financial development is among the important variables smoothing economic volatility, as documented by several empirical studies in the literature (see e.g., Easterly et al., 2001; Braun and Larrain, 2005; Bekaert et al., 2006; Raddatz, 2007; Manganelli and Popov, 2015). Theoretically, Wang et al. (2018) explain this negative relationship by modeling the link between the financial development level of a country and firms’ investment demand through borrowing constraints and credit reallocations. However, to our knowledge, no previous papers have analyzed whether financial development plays any role in the association between the presence of foreign banks and macroeconomic fluctuations. In this paper, we argue that foreign banks may relax borrowing constraints and help smooth economic activities in countries with low financial development, whereas in financially developed markets firms have easy access to funding, thereby diminishing their dependence on domestic and foreign lenders.====There is considerable heterogeneity in foreign bank lending and bank behavior across countries, even within broad country groupings. For example, cross-border flow from parent banks is common in Eastern Europe but lower than ten percent in Latin America and Asia. Local affiliates distribute the majority of foreign bank lending in Latin America (Kamil and Rai, 2010). The dominance of intra-regional foreign banking reflects ties due to political, language, colonial, ethnic or geographic proximity. For example, Spanish and US banks are the dominant foreign banks in Latin America, whereas they have a low presence in Eastern Europe, where Austrian, Belgian, Swedish and Italian banks are more active. In both regions, German and French banks are also very active. Among European banks, UK banks have a particularly significant presence in Asia. To capture possible regional differences, in this paper, we explore the association between foreign bank presence and macroeconomic fluctuations across three regions, that is, Latin America, emerging Europe and Asia.====Using a sample of 24 financially integrated emerging economies,==== we examine the relationship between macroeconomic fluctuations and banking integration measured with the share of foreign banks in the banking sector for the period 1999–2011. We also analyze this relationship at different levels of financial development and investigate whether it changes during the global financial crisis, as Kose et al. (2011) underline that the damage in financial stability caused by the crisis has been particularly serious for some emerging economies, especially those that are highly dependent on foreign bank financing. The variation among global regions is investigated as well. Considering the different dynamics of foreign banks’ lending in emerging Europe during the last two decades, i.e., faster credit expansion followed by a deeper crunch (see, e.g., De Haas and van Lelyveld, 2014), the regional breakdowns seem to shed more light on understanding economic swings among these regions.====We observe that there is a significant and negative association between growth volatilities and bank integration. However, this relationship changes with the level of financial development in the country. The association between the presence of foreign banks and volatilities in consumption and output is found to be positive at high levels of financial development. The results show significant differences among regions. For example, a negative association between bank integration and short-term macroeconomic volatility is observed in Latin America regardless of the level of financial development and the measure of macroeconomic fluctuations, whereas almost no significant relationship is found in emerging Europe. The association is found to change in Asia depending on the level of financial development. To check the robustness of our results, we perform further estimations with different measures of macroeconomic fluctuations and estimation methods to eliminate possible endogeneity problems. The findings are found to be consistent with our main results.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the empirical model and the data. Section 3 reports the results and the outcomes of our robustness checks. Section 4 concludes the paper.",Foreign banks and short-term macroeconomic fluctuations: Do financial development and regions matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362519300019,March 2019,2019,Research Article,134.0

This paper estimates aggregate productivity losses from factor misallocation using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. We analyze the institutional background and provide some stylized facts on factor misallocation of capital and labor in China. Using an approximation method based on the estimation of input gaps, we find that aggregate productivity losses reach an average rate of 11.18 percentage points per year. On average, capital and labor misallocation account for 6.73 and 4.45 percentage points, respectively. State ownership plays an important role in generating factor misallocation and productivity losses. Our results imply that factor misallocation have become a major obstacle preventing China from moving to a more efficient economy.","Since the dominant role of productivity differences in explaining the fundamental question of why some countries are much richer than others was widely recognized among academics (Hall and Jones, 1999; Hsieh and Klenow, 2010; Prescott, 1998), growing efforts have been devoted to exploring the underlying causes of productivity differences across countries (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2013). The existing research has long focused on differences in the technologies of individual firms (Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Comin and Hobijn, 2010; Howitt, 2000; Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare, 2005). Recently, the literature has begun to adopt a new perspective by focusing on the allocation of resources across heterogeneous firms (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008). It points out that reallocation of resources towards firms with high marginal products can significantly contribute to aggregate productivity growth (APG), even to the point of keeping the technology of individual firms constant. However, resource misallocations will mechanically lead to aggregate productivity losses.====Over the past decades, China has captured world attention with its economic growth miracle. Although it has become the second largest economy in the world, that does not make China a rich country, as its per capita income is still less than one-fifth that of the US. Meanwhile, the rapid economic growth is largely driven by factor accumulation accompanied by massive inefficient investment and overcapacity, while it is less stimulated by productivity improvements. Moreover, the liberalization of factor markets still lags far behind the development of product markets, which greatly reduces the power of market forces in the allocation of production factors. While there is diminishing potential for boosting economic growth by factor accumulation, China has to rely on increasing productivity to sustain its economic growth (Laurenceson and O’Donnell, 2014; Wu, 2001; Zheng et al., 2009). Therefore, it is of significance to investigate whether factor misallocation has become a bottleneck in China’s productivity growth.====This study aims to investigate aggregate productivity losses from factor misallocation using a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. We employ the definition of APG from Petrin and Levinsohn (2012) as the change in aggregate final demand minus the change in the aggregate costs on primary inputs. The gaps between the value of marginal products and input prices are employed to recover a measure of firm-level factor misallocation. Then, an approximation method based on the input gaps is employed to quantify aggregate productivity losses. We also attempt to identify the role of state ownership in resource misallocation and productivity losses, since state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are considered to be less efficient. To address this issue, factor misallocation and aggregate productivity losses are estimated separately based on SOEs and non-SOEs.====Our study is related to the literature investigating cross-country differences in productivity and output per capita from the perspective of resource misallocation (Bartelsman et al., 2013; Chen, 2017; Greenwood et al., 2013; Restuccia and Rogerson, 2013; Ziebarth, 2013). The seminal work by Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) incorporates policy distortions into a neoclassical growth model with heterogeneous firms. The authors illustrate how policy distortions generate resource misallocation and lead to sizeable decreases in output and productivity, which can well explain the cross-country differences in output per capita. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) construct a framework to analyze the effect of resource misallocation on aggregate productivity. Their work suggests that the aggregate productivity differences between the US and the developing countries of China and India largely result from resource misallocation. Since the work of Hsieh and Klenow (2009), there has been a growing amount of research attempting to measure the reduction of aggregate productivity due to factor market distortions (Brandt et al., 2013; Busso et al., 2013; Dheera-Aumpon, 2014; Oberfield, 2013). In the context of China, increasing efforts have been devoted to understanding the dynamics of productivity (Chen et al., 2009; Jiang, 2011) and the role of resource misallocation (Chen et al., 2017a, b; Gong and Hu, 2016).====The theoretical rationale of this work is largely built on research seeking to explore the impact of the underlying sources of misallocation on aggregate productivity (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2017). The most studied factor is how misallocation arising from credit market imperfections determines aggregate productivity (Buera et al., 2011; Gilchrist et al., 2013; Moll, 2014). For instance, Midrigan and Xu (2014) solved a parameterized growth model and illustrated that financial friction generates dispersion in the returns to capital across existing producers and thus causes productivity losses from misallocation. Among others, the investigated factors also include policy distortions, regulations, trade barriers, taxation, firing costs (Boedo and Mukoyama, 2012; Petrin and Sivadasan, 2013; Waugh, 2010). Despite various settings, the findings all suggest that these policy or institutional factors and market imperfections can generate negative impacts on aggregate productivity via resource misallocation.====Based on the aforementioned studies, we focus on quantitatively estimating factor misallocation and aggregate productivity losses. We employ an approach of assessing misallocation using input gaps derived from the decomposition of aggregate productivity proposed by Petrin and Levinsohn (2012). The decomposition technique characterizes allocative efficiency, which makes it well-matched with the theory on reallocation and productivity. The approximation method, based on input gaps, enables us to distinguish aggregate productivity losses from labor and capital. We apply the approach to a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. This is interesting because China is such a large economy that it achieves rapid rates of economic growth but at the same time has fairly distorted factor markets. The empirical investigation of firm-level datasets will also provide comprehensive estimates of factor misallocation and enable us to identify productivity losses resulting from specific groups of firms.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the institutional background and provides some stylized facts of capital and labor misallocation in China. Section 3 introduces an approximation method to estimate aggregate productivity losses. Section 4 presents the data and a descriptive analysis. Section 5 analyzes the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 discusses the empirical findings and concludes the paper.",Aggregate productivity losses from factor misallocation across Chinese manufacturing firms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518300396,March 2019,2019,Research Article,135.0

Shadow income and shadow wages are also estimated. Moreover, to mitigate biases from unobserved individual and farm time-invariant characteristics as well as from sample selection, we apply a semiparametric approach for panel data. Our main findings suggest that shadow wages play a major role in off-farm labor decisions for both males and females. This implies that less labor is allocated to off-farm activities as the opportunity cost for agricultural work goes up. In addition, as the on-farm marginal productivity of households (i.e., shadow income) rises, both males and females reduce the hours they allocate to off-farm activities.","After 43 years of military dictatorship by the Somoza Dynasty (1936–1979) and 10 years of civil war under the Sandinista political regime (1980–1990), the Nicaraguan rural sector still exhibits a complex and challenging socioeconomic structure (IFAD, 2009). Approximately 42% of the total population of 6.2 million live in rural areas, and 71% of the rural population are subsistence farmers below the poverty line (ECLAC, 2015).==== These farmers face distorted labor and credit markets and a highly unequal distribution of land ownership; a significant number of farmers is landless or nearly landless (Deininger et al., 2003).====Most of Nicaragua’s rural poor live in the vast dry central region, where natural resources are limited, and the high population density has led to overexploitation of these resources (IFAD, 2009; ECLAC, 2015). In addition, lacking money to invest in their farms and unable to produce enough income from agricultural activities to meet basic household needs, poor farmers in developing countries are often forced to explore opportunities to sell their labor in off-farm markets (Lanjouw and Lanjouw, 2001). This off-farm income can be a significant source of cash to purchase inputs and make on-farm investments, which can lead to improved yields, more profitable farms and poverty reduction (Huffman, 1980; Oseni and Winters, 2009; McCarthy and Sun, 2009; Davis et al., 2009; Covarrubias et al., 2012; Dethier and Effenberger, 2012).====Off-farm labor income contributes up to 60% of total rural household income in Indonesia and Vietnam, and 50% in Latin America (Reardon et al., 2001; Haggblade et al., 2007; World Bank, 2008). Equally important is the participation of women in the labor market, which plays a major role in agricultural development by enhancing their bargaining power and status, while improving overall household welfare (Newman and Canagarajah, 2000; IFPRI, 2000; Haggblade et al., 2007; FAO, 2011). According to the World Bank (2008), about 25% of adult females in rural areas worldwide work off-farm. Many societies that traditionally have not allowed women to work either on-farm or off-farm markets have been liberalizing this restriction gradually (World Bank, 2008; FAO, 2011).====From a policy perspective, it is also critical to determine whether agricultural and rural off-farm sector activities are complementary or substitutes; particularly, if the potential of an agricultural region is low, then policies designed to promote non-farm activities might be a desirable and effective poverty reducing strategy (Matshe and Young, 2004; Dethier and Effenberger, 2012). By contrast, if higher returns from agricultural production are expected, the expectation is that more hours are spent on farming activities and less off-farm (Mathenge and Tschirley, 2015).====The aim of this paper is to investigate the participation of farm household males and females in off-farm activities in Nicaragua using an unbalanced panel dataset from the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) for the years 1998, 2001 and 2005. Two key features distinguish this study from others. (1) The empirical strategy addresses the well-known Heckman sample selection bias stemming from the opportunity cost of labor by using a semiparametric approach developed by Kyriazidou (1997) along with panel data. (2) Following the pioneering work of Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias (1994), we measure the impact of shadow wages and shadow income associated with on-farm activities on the decisions of men and women aged over 15 years to work off-farm. More specifically, shadow wages and shadow income are estimated from a production function and we account for the opportunity cost of working on-farm, which is determined by the household rather than by market forces, and might affect the hours of labor supplied off-farm (Jacoby, 1993).====Here we do not test if off-farm labor supply decisions between adult males (husbands) and females (spouses) are jointly determined, as done by Huffman (1980), Huffman and Lange (1989), Abdulai and Delgado (1999); Ahituv and Kimhi (2006) and Bjørnsen and Biørn (2010). The reason is that, to the best of our knowledge, there does not appear to be an empirical econometric approach designed specifically for panel data that is able to address joint decisions between males and females while also correcting for sample selection bias. Moreover, in this study we use the terms ==== and ==== interchangeably to refer to all income derived from wage-paying and self-employment activities executed outside the household’s farm (FAO, 1998). Thus, the income generated from off-farm includes all labor activities taking place either on other people’s farms or in other economic enterprises in rural or urban areas. This definition is important and should not be confused with the definition of Rural Nonfarm Income (RNI), which includes all economic activities taking place outside the agricultural sector (for a broad review of RNI, see Haggblade et al., 2007).====The literature covering nonfarm work in developing countries is quite rich, but analyses focusing on gender differences are limited. Studies of farmer’s participation in off-farm activities in many developing countries suggest that not only do women earn less than men, but they also work more (Abdulai and Delgado, 1999; Canagarajah et al., 2001; Matshe and Young, 2004; Atamanov and Van den Berg, 2012). In addition, off-farm labor, irrespective of gender, is positively associated with community participation, diminishing returns to farm inputs, market failures in land and labor markets, population density, higher education, access to credit and off-farm work experience. It is furthermore negatively associated with age, land productivity, tenure security, family size and being located in more remote areas or living without any household infrastructure (e.g., electricity and water services) (Lanjouw and Lanjouw, 2001; Barrett et al., 2001; Goodwin and Holt, 2002; Jolliffe, 2004; Zezza et al., 2007; Mccarthy and Sun, 2009; Bhaumik et al., 2011; Mathenge and Tschirley, 2015; Kumar et al., 2017).====There are only a few quantitative studies analyzing rural nonfarm income in Central America. Lanjouw (2001) analyzed data from 1994 and 1996 for El Salvador and found that women tend to earn around 30% less than men from nonfarm employment at a given level of education. In Honduras, the nonfarm sector employed 35.8% of the workers and provided 31.3% of the total income of rural households in 1998 (Isgut, 2004). In Nicaragua, Corral and Reardon (2001) and Malchow-Moller and Svarer (2005) examined rural nonfarm income using Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) data for 1998. They found that in areas with a relatively high population density where households have access to electricity, water and paved roads, 41% of farm household income comes from nonfarm activities. Moreover, most nonfarm income is earned from wage employment and declines as the farm size rises. Finally, younger and more educated individuals, as well as those who face land insecurity, were more likely to participate in off-farm labor than older, less-educated individuals or farmers with a secure title to their land.====The studies focusing on Central America provide useful insights but do not distinguish between the decisions made by males and females regarding their participation in off-farm labor either as wage workers or in self-employment. This study contributes to the literature by accounting for factors that influence the decisions, by males and females, to engage in off-farm employment in addition to on-farm labor. The analysis has implications for strategies to reduce gender inequality that can promote changes in rural economic conditions in poor countries like Nicaragua.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section briefly presents the economic background and the semiparametric approach adopted, while Section 3 describes the data used.

Yet, their management of resource endowment, a logical source of ====, also remains a challenge, alongside their characteristic weak institutions. We investigate the relationship between external indebtedness and welfare whilst considering the pervasive influence of both natural resource rents and the quality of institutions. Using a two-stage analysis, we find that the quality of institutions, mineral- and oil-resource rents negatively affect indebtedness, while rents of aggregated natural resources, which include agricultural commodities, increase indebtedness. In the second stage, we find that welfare is enhanced by the quality of institutions, mineral- and oil-resource rents. These sets of results are interestingly conditional on the degree of resource endowment and the income level of countries, alongside the interesting effects of external indebtedness on welfare, both of which, importantly, nuance past results on the “resource curse”. Furthermore, the proxy for welfare matters: the human development index proxy reflects more the theoretical expectations of unsustainable indebtedness on welfare, than does the GDP per capita alternative. These and other results of our paper, which hold useful policy guides for African countries, are robust to alternative estimation techniques and other checks.","The 2016 economic underperformance recorded by most big economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), on the heels of almost two decades of sustained economic growth, has reawakened the debate about the predominant role played by natural resources in many SSA economies and the need for deeper economic (structural) transformation. This poor economic performance stems from several factors, including low commodity prices, structural macroeconomic issues, external imbalances, weak external demand from developed and emerging economies outside the continent, and security and governance (institutional infrastructure) issues in many SSA countries.====Most of the literature on natural resource endowment dwells mainly on the “natural resource curse” phenomenon====, and, evidently, the resource curse manifests itself predominantly in developing countries that are characterized by weak economic institutions and a reliance on primary export commodities. This particular characterization has recently been confirmed by Melina et al. (2016), who showed that the resource curse arises from the volatility of commodity prices and a combination of mismanagement of debt and public investment. The current economic conditions of some resource-rich African countries (such as Angola, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria) further confirm this characterization. For a contrasting outcome with supportive evidence, we note that resource-rich advanced countries such as Canada and Norway historically report a good economic performance alongside an attendant enviable welfare status, as has also been found, albeit to a lesser extent, in a few resource-rich African countries such as South Africa, Botswana and, until recently, Libya.====In the 1970s, when commodity prices were high, resource-rich countries used their resources as collateral in accessing debt funds (Manzano and Rigobon, 2001). In fact, several empirical studies show that African countries accumulated extensive external debt immediately after commodity price booms. Specifically, Senhadji (1997) and Muhanji and Ojah (2011a) show that increases in world commodity prices contribute significantly to the external indebtedness of African countries. Theoretically, commodity booms should create a trade surplus that can be used to acquire capital for welfare-enhancing investment projects. Even though these countries acquired capital goods after booms, as evidenced by the increase in imported investments, they invested the boom’s proceeds in over-ambitious projects that either turned out to be “white elephants” or the boom’s proceeds were not enough to completely finance the projects. These countries therefore resorted to external borrowing to complete the projects, thus accumulating more debt (Muhanji, 2010). In order to stop this kind of debt-laden expenditure, African countries must seek out better ways of evaluating and financing welfare-enhancing investment projects. “White elephants” signify inefficient allocation and/or redistribution of benefits of resource booms (Robinson and Torvik, 2005).====The above can be surmised as reflective of the classic “resource curse”. Instructively, therefore, Collier and Goderis (2007) find that the “resource curse” can be avoided by countries with good institutions. Their argument is that resource rents create inefficiencies by enabling politicians to facilitate public employment provision in return for political support, but only in countries with weak institutions. In countries with strong institutions, the extent to which politicians can use public funds to bias elections is limited and, therefore, the resource curse does not occur or, is limited in the worst case scenario.====Taking a different perspective, Lane (2004) investigates the determinants of external indebtedness and finds that a high natural resource endowment may have ambiguous effects on the level of external debt. On the one hand, it may permit an increase in the credit ceiling of a country if natural resources serve as particularly good collaterals for international loans. On the other hand, natural resource endowment may reduce productivity by switching factors of production away from more dynamic sectors or stimulating an increase in distortionary rent-seeking activities, which, in turn, have the effect of lowering the potential credit ceiling of the country. This also engenders potentially unsustainable indebtedness.====From the foregoing and insights from particularly relevant literature (e.g., Strand, 1992, 1995; Watts, 2005; Sovacool, 2016), the available evidence suggests that either high external indebtedness leads countries to extract their natural resources faster than usual or resource booms lead countries to borrow heavily and invest in projects that may not yield sufficient returns for debt servicing. The question to ask is therefore: did the natural resource booms contribute to the indebtedness of African countries? Or did the unsustainable external indebtedness push countries to extract their natural resources faster than usual or strategically necessary? Our objective here is not to answer these questions directly. Rather, we seek to unearth clues that could enable a more productive use of SSA’s resource endowment and externally borrowed funds by examining the linkages between a fuller set of pertinent factors than have been considered in the past. That is, are there useful empirical guides that could assist these countries in devising better ways of using natural resource rents and externally sourced finance to advance their economies and, consequently, enhance their peoples’ welfare? We particularly expand an important, Africa-relevant, political economy nexus to include natural resource endowment, effective governance (institutions), external indebtedness and economic welfare.====There is scarce literature linking natural resource endowment to the external debt burden of African countries. Strand (1995) illustrates theoretically how donor conditionality affects the rate of natural resource extraction. In their study, Manzano and Rigobon (2001) show that the natural resource curse leads to debt overhang.==== Among the available related works, Lane’s (2004) study is closer to ours by virtue of the fact that he empirically investigates the determinants of external debt and includes natural resources as one of the considered antecedents (as did Muhanji and Ojah, 2016, in another related work). Lane uses data from 1970 to 1998 for 55 developing countries and documents that resource-rich countries have higher levels of external indebtedness.====We revisit Lane’s (2004) work by empirically investigating the tripartite relationship between natural resource endowment, quality institutional infrastructure and external indebtedness, and, importantly, the particular way(s) this relationship affects the welfare of African countries, using data that spans 1990–2014. Lane’s study covers a period in which countries had accumulated very high unsustainable debts. Instead, we use the post-1990s period, during which countries additionally implemented structural reforms as a prerequisite for external debt reduction and/or cancellation. This period witnessed a marked awareness of quality governance by most debt beleaguered countries, with 30 countries in Africa receiving some form of debt cancellation by the end of 2006 (Muhanji and Ojah (2011a, 2016).====Why revisit this nexus in an expanded form and especially in relation to Africa? It has long been observed that countries often experience significant negative saving-investment (S-I) gaps, which historically have been partly addressed by sourcing cross-border capital, primarily via external indebtedness (Kodongo and Ojah, 2017). Though external indebtedness can bridge this S-I funding gap productively, Muhanji (2010), Muhanji and Ojah (2011a) and others have shown that most African countries rather used external indebtedness in unsustainable and unproductive ways. Among key productively complementary factors, Muhanji and Ojah (2011a, 192–198) flagged institutional (i.e., governance) quality as one that could have enabled African countries to access and use external debt in a sustainable manner. More poignantly, natural resource endowment, which should have naturally enabled African countries to sustainably manage (service) their external borrowing, have instead been amply shown to be a major source of run-away indebtedness and economic retardation (Senhadji, 1997; Collier and Goderis, 2007; Muhanji and Ojah, 2011b, among others). Yet, should these three factors be appropriately used jointly in Africa, the possible significant and sustainable economic growth and development that can follow is not trivial (Al Faruque, 2006; Sovacool, 2016; Sovacool et al., 2016; Melina et al., 2016; and Araujo et al., 2016, among others).====So what is the evidence? Briefly, we find that resource-rich low-income countries have a low economic development (welfare) standing that is attributable to their high level of external indebtedness. For this group of countries, rents from oil and mineral resources mainly go towards debt servicing at the expense of welfare enhancement (a classic reflection of unsustainable indebtedness). However, for resource-rich, high middle-income countries, resource rents do not necessarily go towards debt repayment, with a resultant enhanced welfare that is reflective of the benefits of their resource endowment. More specifically, we find that the quality of institutions, mineral- and oil-resource rents negatively affect indebtedness, in that order of importance, while rents of overall natural resources, which include agricultural commodities, increase indebtedness. In the second stage of our tests, welfare is enhanced by the quality of institutions (governance), mineral- and oil-resource rents, in that order, with rents of overall resources relating negatively to welfare.====Importantly, these sets of results are conditional on both the degree of resource endowment and the income level. The debt regression outcome (first stage of our tests) is more reflective of resource-rich low-income countries than it is of less resource-rich middle-income countries. The welfare model outcome (second stage of our tests) is more reflective of resource-rich, middle-income countries than it is of less resource-rich, low-income countries. Joint effects of resource rents and indebtedness, and institutions and indebtedness, do not alter the independent effects of indebtedness and institutions on welfare, but joint effects of mineral/oil rents and indebtedness enhance welfare; however, joint effects of institutions and indebtedness on welfare are indeterminate. This is perhaps a reflection of the very low quality of the average institutional infrastructure across Africa. Interestingly, a deeper test of the direct and indirect effects of the tripartite factors on welfare shows that external borrowing and rents from resources can indeed enhance African countries’ welfare.====Worthy of note and particularly distinguishing findings flagged in this paper are: (1) different natural resource endowments affect economic welfare differently in Africa and, thus, nuance the extant massive findings from the “resource curse” literature; and (2) good governance (quality institutions) do, indeed, drive better management of resource endowment in resource-rich, high middle-income countries; and this better management, in turn, also translates into enhanced welfare for countries. Therefore, for a country to maintain sustainable indebtedness, it must be cognizant of the important differences between resource endowments and the deceptive allure of the rents; and the complementary importance of quality institutions; and, as such, consciously manage these efficiently.====In the next section, we map the cursory relations between natural resource endowment, external indebtedness and the economic development (welfare) status of selected African countries. In Section 3, we present the methodology used to assess the welfare effects of external indebtedness, institutional quality and natural resource endowment, and describe the relevant data. Section 4 presents the results of the conducted analyses alongside various robustness checks, whilst Section 5 concludes the paper.",How do natural resource endowment and institutional quality influence the nexus between external indebtedness and welfare in Africa?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518305661,March 2019,2019,Research Article,137.0

It is an established view that increasing credit risk (as widely measured in the literature by ==== loan losses)==== due to the accumulation of a huge pile of non-performing loans (NPLs) or impaired loans generally tends to increase the likelihood of a banking crisis (Laeven and Valencia, 2008; Claessens et al., 2014). Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) argued that a protracted deterioration in asset quality as indicated by a large increase in NPLs could be used to mark the onset of the crisis and economic downturn. Thus, a bank failure is imminent if NPLs are not held in check (Laryea et al., 2016). Salas and Saurina (2002) pointed out that the understanding of what drives credit risk or what causes problem loans helps to anticipate bank difficulties that can cause distress to the real sector of the economy, to the owners of banks, and to the supervisors of the financial system.====In the present study, we intend to seek the answer of a key research question: What drives credit risk in the Indian banking industry? The motivation of the present study stems from the fact that the credit quality of Indian banks has deteriorated substantially in the post-crisis years. This is evident from the official statistics released by the Reserve Bank of India (India’s central bank) that the ratios of gross and net NPLs to total advances rose to 4.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively in the year 2014/15, which is almost double relative to 2.3 percent and 1.1 percent as observed in the year 2007/08. This compelled us to look into the factors that cause loan losses in the Indian banking industry. In particular, the objective of this research is to identify the key determinants that drive credit risk in the Indian banking industry over the period from 1998/1999 to 2013/14. The extant literature highlights that, along with the regulatory and institutional factors, there are a wide range of bank-specific, industry-specific and macroeconomic factors that influence the formation of bank credit risk. In line with the contemporary literature, we make use of bank-level data on ==== loan losses and apply the system GMM based dynamic panel estimation approach to identify significant macroeconomic factors and microeconomic variables of credit risk along with testing for the presence of time persistence in credit risk.====The findings of this study are of immense significance for regulatory and supervisory authorities concerned with bank stability in India, since the study not only identifies the key systematic (external) and unsystematic (internal) factors that might be responsible for the formation of credit risk in the banking industry, but also quantifies the degree of persistence in the occurrence of loan losses. We feel that India as a case study is relevant because the Indian economy has a bank-based system like Indonesia and Pakistan, where banks play an important role in the financial system, and any shock to banks ultimately impacts the entire economy (Demirguc-Kunt and Levine, 1999). The empirical findings of such a study will have relevance in the current scenario due to the surge of bad loans on the balance sheets of Indian banks in recent years. Furthermore, Indian banks’ NPLs as a percentage of gross loans have consistently been found to be far above the levels seen in other Asian economies.==== The empirical outcomes of this study may facilitate us to list the representative factors that affect problem loans in the banking system of an emerging market economy. Overall, the present study aims to help regulators and bank managers in identifying the possible factors that may lead to a deterioration in credit quality and increase the burden of default risk. So far, such an analysis has received little attention with respect to the Indian banking industry, especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.====The present study aims to contribute to the literature on credit risk in two ways. First, it adds to the scant literature on the factors explaining credit risk in banks operating in developing and emerging economies. It is worth noting here that a great majority of the studies on this subject matter is focused on US and European banks (see Section 3 for more details). Second, in addition to macroeconomic, bank-specific and industry-specific factors, this study explores the impact of change in the regulatory environment, financial crisis and ownership structure on the credit risk in Indian banks. Therefore, the scope of the present study is much broader than earlier works on the determinants of credit risk or NPLs in Indian banks. For example, Rajaraman and Vasishtha (2002); Ranjan and Dhal (2003) and Das and Ghosh (2007) only included public sector banks (PSBs) in their analyses. In the present study, we have made use of four unique unbalanced bank-level panel datasets – one each for public, private and foreign bank groups and one combined dataset of banks across all ownership groups representing the industry as a whole. The use of these datasets helps us see whether the degree of persistence and key factors influencing credit risk differ significantly across the public, private and foreign bank segments of the Indian banking industry. Such an analysis is of immense relevance, as these bank groups differ from each other in terms of objective function, operating model, geographical coverage, lending behaviour, adherence of legal norms relating to priority sectoral allocation, level of ICT use, organisational form and incentive structure (Gulati and Kumar, 2016). These differences are likely to result in different appetites for credit risk across ownership groups. In addition, the time horizon of this study (i.e., 1998/99 to 2013/14) is much longer than the existing studies on the determinants of credit risk or NPLs in the Indian banking industry.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 deliberates on some stylized facts about NPLs in the Indian banking industry. Section 3 presents a relevant literature review on the subject matter. Section 4 discusses the dynamic panel estimation methodology used in the present study. The description of the database and the specification of the variables are given in Section 5.

"Näther Maria,Vollmer Uwe","University of Leipzig, Economics Department, Institute for Theoretical Economics, Grimmaische Straße 12, D-04109, Leipzig, Germany","Received 13 January 2017, Revised 20 April 2018, Accepted 8 May 2018, Available online 17 November 2018, Version of Record 3 April 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2018.05.004,Cited by (4),We ask how the structure of international banking affects the decision of a national regulator to join a ,"Parts of the current debate on financial regulation are about problems associated with multinational banks doing business outside the realm of national bank supervisors (de Haas and van Lelyveld, 2006; Allen et al., 2011; Beck et al., 2013). Such misalignment between banking structures and bank regulation causes coordination failures between national regulators, which may result in suboptimal regulatory decisions. Regulatory externalities are a major reason for this because national regulators do not take into account the possible spillovers of their own regulatory actions on foreign financial markets. In consequence, internationally active banks justify the transfer of national powers of supervision to a supranational regulator.====The European Banking Union (EBU) is a recent example for such a transfer of regulatory powers. Membership in the EBU is mandatory for all member states of the euro zone, but member states of the European Union outside the euro zone have the right to join on an “opt-in” basis and to establish “close cooperation” with the European Central Bank (ECB). In this case at least the three largest domestic banks will be subject to micro-prudential supervision by the ECB. In turn, the ECB also influences macro-prudential standards and has a large responsibility in the resolution of systemically important banks within the EBU.====The United Kingdom has already declared that it will definitively not participate. Sweden is currently considering membership, while Denmark and probably Bulgaria and Romania will join the EBU. The remaining four Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary and Poland, are taking a “wait and see” position and will only decide later whether to establish close cooperation or not.====While reservations against opting in partly reflect political reasons or legal constraints, we consider an economic reason why single countries may hesitate to join the EBU. Our starting point is the fact that the banking union takes a holistic view, i.e., it focuses on the soundness of the banking group as a whole and pays less attention to particular subsidiaries of multinational banks. Such a perspective is harmless as long as the cross-country differences between national banking systems are small and different units of multinational banks are distributed equally among member states. This, however, is not the case within the European Union, where foreign banks (mostly subsidiaries of multinational banks) dominate the banking sectors in most CEE countries (see Fig. 1) and parent banks are mainly located within the current EBU member states. Under such conditions, a transfer of supervisory powers from the national to the supranational level may be harmful to single countries even if all countries in total benefit from the transfer.====Our paper focuses on these distributional aspects and tries to understand how the structures of the domestic and foreign banking sectors influence the incentives for a national regulator to transfer regulatory powers to a supranational level. The focus is on bank supervision and bank resolution. We model multinational banks that conduct business in their home country through a parent bank and in the foreign country through a subsidiary. The parent bank and the subsidiary both raise deposits locally and invest funds in a risky local project. Deposits are fully insured by national deposit insured schemes.==== We model three major characteristics of multinational banks. First, a subsidiary’s profits are partly transferred to the parent bank. Second, a subsidiary is liable for the parent bank’s losses, i.e., if the parent bank is insolvent, not only a part but all of the subsidiary’s profit is transferred to the parent bank. There is no profit transfer in the opposite direction from the parent bank to the subsidiary and the parent bank is not liable for the subsidiary’s losses. Third, the failure of the parent bank affects financial stability in the foreign country, but again not vice versa. Note that the first two points both refer to a profit transfer from the subsidiary to the parent bank. In contrast, parent bank failure may harm financial stability in the foreign country for other reasons as well, e.g., a loss in the subsidiary’s reputation.====We compare two regulatory regimes, national regulation and supranational regulation. A regulator can monitor bank units to learn about the riskiness of their assets and decides whether or not to resolve the bank. Since monitoring is costly, the regulator chooses a monitoring level, i.e., a share of bank units that are monitored. Under national regulation, the parent bank and the subsidiary are supervised by the national regulator in the country in which they are active. This implies that a multinational bank, which consists of a parent bank and a subsidiary, is supervised by two different national regulators. Under supranational regulation, there is only one regulator who supervises all parent banks and subsidiaries.====In our model, national and supranational regulations differ because there are regulatory externalities that are internalized by the supranational regulator but not by national regulators. There are two reasons for regulatory externalities. (i) A share (or all) of the subsidiary’s profit contributes positively to the welfare in the home country where the parent bank is located. The remaining profit share and the subsidiary’s losses contribute to welfare in the foreign country in which the subsidiary is active. Consequently, the national regulator responsible for the subsidiary ignores the profit share that is transferred to the parent bank. In contrast, the supranational regulator accounts for expected payments in both countries. (ii) If the parent bank fails, financial stability in the foreign country where the subsidiary is active is endangered. In contrast to the supranational regulator, the national regulator supervising the parent bank ignores this spillover to the foreign country.====As a consequence of these regulatory externalities, the supranational regulator is less strict with intervention in subsidiaries because (in addition to the national regulator) he accounts for the subsidiary’s profit share that is transferred to the parent bank. The supranational regulator is stricter with intervention in parent banks because (in addition to the supranational regulator) he accounts for the cost of stability. Likewise, the supranational regulator chooses a lower monitoring level than the national regulator in countries hosting many subsidiaries but prefers a higher monitoring level in countries where many parent banks are located. Therefore, a country’s decision to join the banking union is determined by the number or size of parent banks and subsidiaries that determine the extent of the regulatory externalities. For example, in countries whose banking sectors are dominated by subsidiaries, the incentive to join the banking union decreases with the number (or size) of subsidiaries and increases with the number (or size) of parent banks.====With these results, our paper is related to previous studies that also analyze the relationship between multinational banking and supervisory coordination (for a survey, see Beck, 2016). A first strand of the literature discusses the welfare effects of national regulations if banks are internationally active and offer cross-border financial services through branches. Acharya (2003) and Dell’Ariccia and Marquez (2006) show that competition among regulators may lead to a “race to the bottom” if national regulators choose their banking policies non-cooperatively. A supranational regulator who has to set uniform standards is beneficial to all participating countries if the national banking sectors are not too heterogeneous. In our paper, supranational regulation is welfare-improving for all jurisdictions in total. Our main contribution, however, is to show that this is not necessarily the case for each single country and that participation in a banking union may thus not be incentive compatible from an individual country’s perspective.====In this respect, our paper is closely connected to Beck et al. (2013) and Beck and Wagner (2016), who also analyze situations where agreeing to supranational supervision may be inferior from a national point of view. They consider a stand-alone internationally active bank which directly invests parts of its funds into foreign risky assets. In Beck et al. (2013), the bank is partially financed by foreign equity and foreign deposits. Bank failure causes external stability costs that may differ across countries. Regulators may resolve a bank after the bank’s probability of success becomes publicly known. Since the regulator’s resolution decision is based on average external costs, a country with small external costs refuses to agree to supranational supervision if the bank’s foreign exposure is low. The superiority of supranational supervision also depends on the size of the banks.====Here, we also compare national and supranational supervision but model a multinational bank that consists of a parent bank and a subsidiary. Both bank units raise funds and only invest locally. We explicitly consider the payments that have to be made by a foreign subsidiary of a domestic parent bank and derive endogenous failure costs that depend on the supervisor’s actions. The size of external effects determines a country’s decision to join a banking union. However, in contrast to Beck and Wagner (2016), we identify the origins of external effects and bank failure cost. Moreover, we also model the size of the banking sector by using the number of parent banks and subsidiaries in the domestic and foreign bank markets.====A second strand of the literature discusses potential cooperation failures between single regulators. Holthausen and Rønde (2004) and Carletti et al. (2016) analyze the incentives of a local or national regulator to collect and transmit necessary information. Freixas et al. (2003) and Goodhart and Schoenmaker (2009) consider the incentives of national regulators to bail out or liquidate a bank and show that cooperation failures could occur if regulators negotiate ex post about burden sharing. Bolton and Oehmke (2016) and Faia and Weder di Mauro (2016) compare different resolution schemes for multinational banks and prove that regulators may refuse to cooperate in order to prevent transfers from subsidiaries to parent banks or vice versa. In Colliard (2015), there are cooperation problems between national and supranational regulators in the sense that the supranational regulator has a higher cost of inspecting banks than the national regulator. Besides national and supranational regulation, a mixed regulatory framework is also considered and it is shown that supranational regulation is optimal if cross-border activity is sufficiently large. In this paper we do not focus on ex post incentive compatibility of cooperation inside the banking union but on ex ante incentive compatibility of joining the banking union. Although there are no cooperation problems once supranational regulation is in place, national regulators may refuse to agree to supranational regulation from the outset.====A third branch of the literature asks how the organizational structures of banking systems or cross-country heterogeneity influence regulatory behavior. Calzolari and Loranth (2011) and Calzolari et al. (2016) distinguish between a branch structure and a subsidiary structure of multinational banks. Branches are regulated by the home country, subsidiaries by the country in which they are active. They show that intervention incentives are different for branches and subsidiaries. In addition, supranational supervision may incentivize more banks to choose a stand-alone structure or a branch structure instead of a subsidiary structure.====Here, we also focus on cross-country differences between banking systems, but we discuss the distributional aspects of supranational regulation, i.e., the incentives of a country to join a banking union. Additionally, the two countries considered differ in the number or size of parent banks and subsidiaries of multinational banks. Our contribution to this strand of literature is to show that this type of banking structure matters for welfare effects of bank regulation, and that countries where subsidiaries dominate the banking sector in particular may be reluctant to join a banking union.====A fourth group of papers analyzes the effects of international financial market integration on the welfare effects of national versus supranational regulation. Niepmann and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2013) focus on interbank market connections between banking systems and show that decisions by national governments to bail out failing banks are inefficient. This inefficiency increases in interbank market linkages. Górnicka and Zoican (2016) consider bank resolution policies in a two-country model setup with interbank market activities and cross-border exposures. They show that supranational bank resolution does not necessarily improve welfare. In contrast to this work, we do not consider interbank market activities and cross-border exposures because both parent bank and subsidiary are assumed to raise funds and invest only locally. However, we also model financial market integration, since we assume that subsidiaries are liable for the parent bank’s losses and that the subsidiary’s profits are partly transferred to the parent bank.====Finally, our paper contributes to the discussion why EU countries outside the euro zone hesitate to opt in to the banking union. Berglöf et al. (2012); Darvas and Wolff (2013); Kisgergely and Szombati (2014) and Belke et al. (2016) point out that, due to legal constraints, opt-in countries lack participation in the euro-system’s decision-making process and have only limited access to European financial backstops. Our analysis offers an additional explanation why EBU membership is disadvantageous for countries hosting many subsidiaries, which is independent from the current legal design of the European Monetary Union or from political reasons. This way the EBU by itself may form an obstacle to why non-euro EU countries hesitate to introduce the euro.====Besides joint supervision and resolution, a main element of the EBU is a common deposit insurance system such as the one proposed to become part of it by 2024. The literature on deposit insurances in banking unions stresses that common deposit insurance allows for better coinsurance than separate insurance schemes because the number of banks included is larger. In addition, harmonized deposit insurance may prevent national regulators from using deposit insurance levels as a device to compete for deposits and to protect their banking systems from the destabilizing impact of potential capital flight (Engineer et al., 2013). Finally, a European deposit insurance system makes decoupling banks from sovereigns easier (Gros and Schoenmaker, 2014). Although we do not model a common deposit insurance system, our analysis allows for the conclusion that a common deposit insurance scheme increases the attractiveness of supranational supervision and may thereby increase the incentive of a country to join the banking union.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the model setup. Section 3 analyzes the choice between national and supranational regulation, Section 4 applies the model to the EBU, and Section 5 concludes.",National versus supranational bank regulation: Gains and losses of joining a banking union,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518305272,March 2019,2019,Research Article,139.0

Employing a panel sample of conventional and Islamic commercial banks, it arrives at the following conclusions. First, the consolidation exercise, which has led to a significant reduction in the number of domestic commercial banks, has not stifled banking competition. Second, the paper provides empirical support for the competition-stability relationship, particularly for the conventional banking sector. Islamic banking sector risk appears to be neutral to market competition or market power, although there is limited evidence that it increases with overall market concentration. Finally, the analysis uncovers the risk-increasing effect of the Islamic banking market structure on the conventional banking sector. By contrast, conventional banking market concentration tends to reduce the credit risk of Islamic banks.","Malaysia is well known to be a frontrunner with its dual banking system, referring to the co-existence of an Islamic and a conventional banking system. Propelled by the aim to establish Malaysia as an international hub of Islamic finance and the need to have a stronger and more resilient banking sector in the aftermath of the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis, policy initiatives have been put in place to increase the number of Islamic banking service providers and to consolidate the banking sector, particularly the conventional one. As a result of the former, the Islamic banking sector now comprises 16 banks – 2 full-fledged domestic and 3 full-fledged foreign Islamic banks as well as 11 Islamic bank subsidiaries of conventional banks – a development that means Islamic banking has a significant presence in Malaysia’s banking scene. Meanwhile, the banking sector consolidation initiative witnessed mergers and acquisitions of existing banks, resulting in a substantial reduction in the number of conventional commercial banks in the market. Their number declined from 35 in 1998 to 22 in 2009 and then, with the addition of new foreign banks, increased to 27 at the end of 2016.====Against the backdrop of these developments, the following questions seem inevitable: what has been the competitive environment shaping the banking industry in Malaysia since the Asian crisis? Are Islamic banks losing market power in the presence of more Islamic banking service providers and a consolidated conventional banking sector? Have conventional banks gained more market power? How do changes in bank competition and banking market concentration affect the stability of Islamic and conventional banks? Are these two types of banks affected differently? The answers to these questions are not at all obvious in light of the contradicting competition-stability and competition-fragility views and the empirical evidence for both. Moreover, in the context of the Islamic banking sector, the understanding of how it is related to the environment in which it operates remains thin.====Motivated by these questions, the present paper analyses Malaysia’s changing banking landscape as characterized by banking consolidation and a fast-growing Islamic banking sector in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis and empirically assesses its risk/stability implications. Projecting its conventional and Islamic banking sectors into different trajectories as briefly described above, Malaysia serves as an interesting case study for the issue at hand, especially when it comes to whether bank types are relevant for the competition-stability relationship and whether the market structure of one banking sector bears implications on the risk performance of the other. Moreover, being at the forefront of Islamic banking development, we may draw lessons from the Malaysian experience for the development of the Islamic banking system in other countries with a dual banking system.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, while the present paper generally falls under the competition-stability research strand, it brings to the fore the recent emphasis that the relationship between competition and stability may depend on bank types or characteristics (Jeon and Lim, 2013; Liu and Wilson, 2013). In view of the enormous interest in the Islamic banking model, we focus on whether Islamic banks behave differently when facing increasing competition. Second, our study adds to the analysis of the competition-stability relationship by assessing the implications of conventional banking consolidation as well as Islamic banking penetration on both types of banks. The Islamic banking sector has evolved in an environment dominated by conventional banking. It faces competitive pressure not only from its own but also from the conventional segment. Thus, the consolidation process that has shaped the conventional banking sector may arguably have influenced Islamic banking performance. Conversely, the increasing penetration of Islamic banking may have affected the conventional banking sector as well. This aspect remains a gap in the Islamic banking literature, which we try to fill. Finally, we contribute to an emerging strand of the literature looking at the relative stability of the Islamic banking system. Existing empirical studies on Islamic banking perform largely comparative analyses of Islamic and conventional banking and, in certain cases, how they fare during crunch times. There has been less emphasis on the role of competition in shaping the relative stability of Islamic vis-à-vis conventional banks, an aspect that we seek to explore.====As a preview of our results, we find empirical support for the relationship between competition and stability for conventional banks. Regarding Islamic banks, market power does not seem to bear risk implications. While banking market concentration appears to have a limited effect on bank risk, our basic results suggest a one-way effect from the Islamic banking structure to conventional bank risk. More precisely, Islamic banking concentration seems to enhance conventional bank risk. Further analyses reaffirm the competition-stability relationship for conventional banks but unveil potential two-way effects between conventional and Islamic banks.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. To place our analysis in context, we present background information on Malaysia’s Islamic banking development and bank restructuring in the aftermath of the Asian crisis in the next section. Then, Section 3 reviews related literature. Section 4 explains our empirical approach and Section 5 presents the estimation results. Finally, Section 6 contains a summary of our main findings and provides some concluding remarks.","Structural changes, competition and bank stability in Malaysia’s dual banking system",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939362518305181,March 2019,2019,Research Article,140.0
