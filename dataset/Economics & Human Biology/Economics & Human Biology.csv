Once rarely used in Western countries, in the last two years they have become an object it is impossible to leave one’s home without. Italy made their use a legal requirement, even outdoors, from late 2020 to early 2022. The effectiveness of this policy in reducing COVID-19 cases has been widely debated. The recent cancellation of their mandatory use in Italy offers an interesting setting in which to test its impact, since one Italian region (Campania) extended the restriction for a further three weeks. We aim to shed some light on the real-world impact of mandatory use of face masks outdoors, identifying the effect of this policy on the spread of COVID-19. By means of a quantitative analysis, employing a synthetic control method approach, we find that Campania had statistically the same number of cases as its synthetic counterfactual, built from a donor pool formed from the other Italian provinces. Hence, results suggest that while it imposes a burden on the public, the use of face masks outdoors is not correlated with a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases.","Since early 2020 the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has pushed almost all national governments to adopt extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the virus, and to try to mitigate its negative effects among the public, striking a difficult balance between the need to safeguard public health and the necessity of avoiding the destruction of the economy. According to the literature, these measures may be classified into two principal branches. On the one hand, we have the kind of interventions that include all those health and pharmaceutical measures that aim to strengthen the capacity of the hospital system and treat people more quickly and effectively. On the other hand, there is a second kind of intervention, usually referred to by specialists as Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), which are predominantly measures based on imposing social distancing between citizens, and which have been adopted to reduce the probability of people contracting the virus, therefore reducing the pressure on health systems.====Among NPIs, policies imposing the use of face masks can be an effective tool to reduce the spread of the virus. The use of face masks to fight the spread of an epidemic was a common practice as early as the Middle Ages (====), a period that is also of interest because it was the first in which a public authority began imposing policies to safeguard public health and fight a pandemic (Alfano and Sgobbi, 2021). Wearing face masks was commonly considered one of the principal pillars “for planning a successful campaign” (====: vi).====The effectiveness of the measure has been investigated by various scholars (Chernozhukov et al., 2020; Karaivanov et al., 2021), but these analyses have mainly explored the effects of the indoor use of face masks. It is worth noting that in some cases the mandatory use of face masks at the community level has been expanded to the imposition of its use outdoors as well.====Such is the case of Italy, where the government, with decree number 125 of 7 October 2020,==== imposed the use of face masks both indoors and outdoors, with some exceptions, such as private residences, and exemptions for children below the age of 6 and people practicing sports. The mandatory use of face masks outdoors concerned the entire Italian national territory for several months. Only with the sharp reduction in the number of new cases in 2022 did a decree by the Health Minister on 8 February 2022 suspend the obligation of wearing masks outdoors for the general public, from 11 February onward.====Nevertheless, the local government of one Italian region, Campania, evoking the power to impose stricter policies to safeguard public health, decided not to comply with the decision of the central government and lift the requirement, and instead continued to enforce the mandatory use of masks outdoors up to 1 March. This meant that only one region in Italy – a country with a homogeneous set of laws regarding COVID, with people exposed to similar sets of incentives, and which exhibited a relatively homogeneous epidemiological situation at the time – kept a law obliging its citizens to wear face masks outdoors, while the rest of the country removed this requirement.====For this reason, we believe that this setting offers a very interesting natural experiment framework, and is therefore a valuable case study with which to investigate the efficacy of policies imposing the use of face masks outdoors. This would seem to be a worthwhile contribution to the literature on the efficacy of face masks: indeed, it is worth noting that, to the very best of our knowledge, there are no studies that focus specifically on the efficacy of policies that impose the use of face masks outdoors.====The aim of the present study is therefore to fill this gap in the literature, by means of an empirical analysis based on the use of a Synthetic Control Method (SCM). This methodology has been recently adopted in a number of different settings, (such as ==== on the environmental impact of lockdowns; ==== on the impact of lockdown on public transportation), and also in studies focused on the efficacy of NPIs in regard to COVID-19 (==== on school closures; ==== on the impact of movement restrictions).====More precisely, the present paper aims to address the following research question:====The hypothesis tested by means of our methodology can be formalized as follows:====It is important at this point to note that our investigation relies on provincial-level data. For this reason, we are testing a public decision related to a mandatory health policy using aggregate data; in our setting accurate information about individuals’ behaviour is unavailable, and to the best of our knowledge no relevant data exist for the time span and case analysed. There are reasons to believe, of course, that individual attitudes and decisions play a role in this dynamic. For example, wearing face masks was also compulsory outdoors at the time, but people may have overcome this limitation by an increase in indoor events (without wearing a face mask and hence possibly avoiding fines), thus contributing to the spread of the virus, which is more likely to be transmitted in closed spaces than in open air.====Nevertheless, despite such limitations, we believe that this is a very important topic for a number of reasons. The first is that the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant threat in 2023, and moreover the literature has suggested that epidemics and global pandemics will continue to be a significant threat in future (====, ====, ====). This implies that research devoted to understanding NPI effectiveness, and which focuses in particular on mandatory face masks, is likely to continue to be useful and necessary in the near future, as a way to help policymakers make the best choices. Second, most existing studies investigate the efficacy of face masks by means of laboratory investigation. Such methodology is very important because it allows researchers to control for a number of factors; nevertheless, laboratory experiments may fail to anticipate how individuals actually wear face masks in daily life. For this reason, investigations based on non-laboratory data may help to improve the robustness of results achieved by laboratory analysis. As already pointed out, to the best of our knowledge, although some studies have investigated the effect of mandatory indoor face masks, this is the first contribution where it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of mandatory outdoor face masks by looking at non-laboratory data, in a natural experimental setting. In more general terms, from a policymaker’s perspective we believe this research is important also because excessive use of mandatory schemes, which may not be supported by effective outcomes, could reduce the level of individual compliance with other NPIs where positive effects have been detected. As suggested by ====: “misconceptions and stigmatization towards the use of face masks may hinder the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic” (p. 2195). Finally, this is a very interesting setting in which to empirically assess the indirect effects of imposing mask usage. Indeed, it has been suggested that other than the direct effect of reducing the projection of droplets of saliva that help the spread of COVID-19, the use of masks also has an indirect effect. This effect can either be positive, helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by reminding people of the persistence of the pandemic and the need to take precautions, or negative, by creating a false sense of security that could nudge citizens towards neglecting other important measures, such as social distancing, as highlighted by Betsch et al. (2020), ====, and ====.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, the next section briefly reports the main background literature regarding the efficacy of NPIs, with a special focus on face masks, ==== describes the data and methodology used in the study, while ==== illustrates our main results. ==== concludes the paper.",Assessing the effectiveness of mandatory outdoor mask policy: the natural experiment of Campania,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000461,Available online 12 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

Data from a population representative household survey reveal that limited self-control is strongly associated with both unhealthy body weight and poorer subjective weight-related well-being. Those with limited self-control are characterized by reduced exercising, repeated dieting, unhealthier eating habits, and poorer nutrition. We propose an empirical method to isolate two facets of self-control limitations—high impulsivity and low restraint. Each has differential predictive power. Physical activity, dieting, and overall body weight are more strongly associated with restraint; impulsivity is relatively more predictive of when, where, and what people eat.","Nearly three quarters of all deaths globally are now attributable to noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes (World Health Organization, 2021). Many of the risk factors driving these illnesses (e.g., tobacco use, alcohol abuse, unhealthy nutrition, limited physical activity) are preventable, leading economists to view unhealthy lifestyle choices as a form of inter-temporal risk-taking (Cawley and Ruhm, 2011). This perspective—along with the enormous public health burden generated by these choices—has intensified interest in the behavioral foundations of health behavior as researchers strive to understand why some people make healthier choices than others. A great deal of work remains to be done. However, it is increasingly clear that healthy lifestyle choices such as not smoking, limiting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight are shaped, at least in part, by people’s personality traits, future orientation, time-preferences, and risk attitudes (e.g., Gruber and Kőszegi, 2001, Borghans and Golsteyn, 2006, Chiteji, 2010, van der Pol, 2011, Sutter et al., 2013, Cobb-Clark et al., 2014, Mendolia and Walker, 2014, Kang and Ikeda, 2014, Courtemanche et al., 2015, Stutzer and Meier, 2016, Stoklosa et al., 2018).====
      ====Our research examines the relationship between limited self-control and unhealthy body weight. Once viewed as an issue only in affluent countries, obesity has become a global concern following the dramatic increase in obesity in low- and middle-income countries (World Obesity Federation, 2020). Excess body weight not only harms people’s health by raising the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021), it also reduces economic well-being by constraining economic participation, decreasing productivity, and reducing income (e.g., Tremmel et al., 2017). Understanding the behavioral underpinnings of unhealthy weight has the potential to enhance public health efforts to combat the global rise in obesity and obesity-related noncommunicable diseases.====Self-control can be conceptualized as “the ability to override or change one’s inner responses, as well as to interrupt undesired behavioral tendencies and refrain from acting on them” (Tangney et al., 2004 p.275).==== Seen in this light, it seems almost tautological that for most people, maintaining a healthy weight must require a degree of self-control. Empirical evidence in support of this proposition is surprisingly limited, however. Economists have only recently begun to examine the relationship between time-inconsistent preferences and obesity (Stoklosa et al., 2018), while in psychology “surprisingly few studies have explored the intuitive connection between self-control and weight loss” (Crescioni et al., 2011 p. 750). Those that do produce mixed results. Although Crescioni et al. (2011) find that higher self-control is associated with improved results in a weight-loss program, others conclude that self-control is only a weak predictor of eating behavior (de Ridder et al., 2011) and exerting self-control through dieting may not result in weight loss (see Kuijer et al., 2008).====Our study makes an important contribution by using population representative data to analyze the relationship between self-control and both unhealthy body weight (e.g., obesity, BMI, waist-to-height ratio) and subjective weight-related well-being (e.g., weight satisfaction, ideal vs. actual weight). While much of the existing evidence relies on locus of control to proxy for self-control (Stutzer and Meier, 2016, Fan and Jin, 2014) or comes from small, selected samples, we exploit data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey which is a large household panel survey. The HILDA Survey is one of only two population representative data sources that now include a well-established measure of trait self-control—the Brief Self-Control Scale (BSCS) (Tangney et al., 2004). Psychologists define personality traits to be the “relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that distinguish individuals from one another” (Roberts et al., 2008 p. 375). The Self-Control Scale is the most widely used measure of trait self-control in psychological research on self-regulation and self-control. Most researchers use the scale to construct a single index capturing the general capacity to exert self-control.====At the same time, personality psychologists have long observed that there are behavioral distinctions between impulse vs. constraint in self-regulation (see Carver, 2005) which we discuss in detail below. Consistent with this, efforts to conceptually (de Ridder et al., 2011) and empirically (Maloney et al., 2012) differentiate between BSCS items suggest that, rather than being unidimensional, the scale may capture two forms of self-control which have been characterized as “control over impulses” vs. “capacity to initiate desired behaviors” (Hoyle and Davisson, 2016 p. 398). Drawing on this insight, we begin by proposing an empirical method that uses the 13 items in the BSCS to isolate two core factors shaping people’s self-control, which we refer to as ‘impulsivity’ and ‘restraint’. Empirically distinguishing between these conceptually different facets of self-control has several advantages. First, it provides a bridge between our work, that of other economists, and the vast literature on the psychology of obesity which is founded on more nuanced notions of self-regulation. Second, it allows us to contribute to the behavioral social science literature which is increasingly demonstrating the predictive power of multidimensional notions of self-control that account for sophistication (Cobb-Clark et al., 2021) as well as impulsivity and risk-seeking (Forrest et al., 2019). Finally, it provides a richer understanding of the behavioral origins of unhealthy weight and sheds light on new policy options for improving health outcomes.====In particular, we find that those with limited self-control have an unhealthier body weight and poorer subjective weight-related well-being. Thus, there may be beneficial population health consequences from supporting people’s capacity for self-control. The way that self-control limitations are manifested matters. High impulsivity and low restraint are only modestly correlated; each has differential predictive power. While physical activity and dieting are more strongly associated with people’s restraint, their degree of impulsivity is relatively more important in understanding their decisions about when, where, and what to eat. These insights have important implications for the specific policy tools we use to address unhealthy weight.",Self-control and unhealthy body weight: The role of impulsivity and restraint,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000448,Available online 9 June 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

In this paper, we investigate the evolution of average height and height dispersion in Poland based on full administrative data on body height (n = 36,393,246). Especially for the cohorts between 1920 and 1950, we discuss the caveat of shrinking. In the cohorts born between 1920 and 1996, the average height of men increased by 10.15 cm, while the average height of women rose by 8.18 cm. Height increase was fastest in the years 1940 – 1980. After the economic transition, body height stagnated. Post-transition unemployment had negative effects on body height. Height declined in municipalities where there were State Agricultural Farms. Height dispersion decreased in the first decades under investigation and increased after the economic transition.","Variation in height has two components: genetic and environmental. Genetic and paragenetic factors explain 70 % of the variation in height (Byard et al., 1993). The rest of the variation is driven by living conditions. Body height is a cumulative measure reflecting nutrition and health in the first twenty years of life (Kopczyński and Rodak, 2021). It is widely accepted that human height may serve as a proxy for public health and material well-being (e.g., Tanner, 1982; Komlos and Baten, 2004; Deaton and Arora, 2009; Baten and Blum, 2012; Cameron and Schell, 2021). Height is also an important determinant of the quality of life. The positive effects of height on earnings have been demonstrated in many diverse countries, for example, the United States (Case and Paxson, 2008), Germany (Rietveld et al., 2015), Pakistan (Bossavie et al., 2021), and Taiwan (Tao, 2014). The earnings height premium reflects higher cognitive and social skills and better physical capacity. However, a significant height premium is identified even after correcting for these factors. It arises because of the sorting of short people into low-paid occupations, which may reflect discrimination by stature (Lundborg et al., 2014). The height premium is not limited to labor market participation. Taller people tend to evaluate their lives more favorably, more often report positive emotions, and are less likely to report negative experiences (Deaton and Arora, 2009).====In this paper, we provide the first estimates of the height trends in Poland based on the administrative dataset covering the whole population. In the years 2001 – 2015, information on body height was given on all identity cards issued in Poland. Because identity cards in Poland are valid for only ten years, our data source (n = 36,393,426) covers the entire adult population of Poland. Based on this data source, which was not used by the researchers previously, we investigate the evolution of adult height in the cohorts born in 1920 – 1996. We measure the secular trend, assess height dispersion, investigate regional gaps, and estimate the econometric model to measure the impact of the economic transition on height.",The full distribution of adult height in Poland: Cohorts born between 1920 and 1996.

We combine population projections with micro-simulations of individuals’ health status that account for their demographic, socio-economic characteristics and their childhood circumstances. Model equations estimated on data from the SHARE survey and from several branches of Social Security provide a rich framework to study policy-relevant applications. We simulate public expenditure on healthcare and long-term care under different scenarios to evaluate the separate contributions of ","This paper studies how public expenditure on healthcare and long-term care responds to individuals’ evolving health status under alternative demographic projections. More precisely, we extend a theoretical model of optimal intertemporal consumption to simulate trends of health-related public expenditure that depend on individuals’ health status and health-related behaviour as well as their demographic, socio-economic characteristics and childhood circumstances.====Models of optimal intertemporal consumption are often used to study the impact of health status and other precautionary motives on saving behaviour. In the United States for instance, De Nardi et al. (2006) estimate and simulate a model based on Deaton (1991) to evaluate the role of health status and insurance on the consumption and saving behaviour of elderly singles. De Nardi et al. (2009) follow a similar approach to disentangle the effects of life expectancy on old age saving from other determinants, including medical expenditures, which also vary by gender, age, health status, and income. More recently, Ameriks et al. (2020) estimate the relative importance of bequest and precautionary motives for late-in-life savings. Nakajima and Telyukova (2018) analyse the determinants of wealth decumulation among older households in the United States compared with countries such as Sweden where gross medical expenses are lower and universal health insurance with higher coverage is available. Studies on European countries also use this theoretical framework to evaluate how old age saving relates to longevity risk awareness (Post and Hanewald, 2013) and to the availability of formal or informal health insurance contracts (Dobrescu, 2015), or to assess the link between subjective mortality risk and consumption (Bíró, 2013).====In this paper, we adapt this standard theoretical framework to better account for the specificities of the health system in Luxembourg, which provides wide access to high quality public healthcare but is among the most costly in Europe (OECD, 2017; European Commission, 2020). The major challenge it faces is from demographic change with ageing of the Luxembourgish population expected to accelerate from 2040, which might endanger the sustainability of the social protection system. In particular, the age-related expenditure ratio is projected to almost double by 2070, placing Luxembourg well above several other countries in the European Union with a currently more advanced ageing of their population (AWG, 2021).====Policies to meet this challenge need to affect individual decisions such as retirement age, saving rate, and health-related behaviour (e.g. physical activity, smoking and drinking habits). In this vein, Luxembourg has huge potential benefits from a reduction in the prevalence of behavioural risk factors (OECD-EC, 2022). In 2019, 37% of all deaths in Luxembourg were due to behavioural risk factors, such as smoking, dietary risks, alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity. In particular, 35% of adults reported heavy episodic drinking (the third highest in the EU, after the Denmark and Romania and almost twice the European average). One adult in six were obese, higher than in the Netherlands where only one in eight adults were obese. As in other countries, an unbalanced diet is the main factor contributing to overweight and obesity: 60% reported consuming less than one of the five recommended portions of fruits and vegetables a day (only Romania does worse with 74%, while 35% and 45% of adults in France and Belgium, respectively, are in the same situation). However, the lack of physical activity only concerns 37% of adults (similar as the European average) compared with 44% in Belgium.====To evaluate these policies, we developed a simulation tool for Luxembourg that allows individual economic decisions and health-related behaviour to affect public expenditure on healthcare and long-term care over long horizons. First, we extend the standard theoretical model to allow consumers’ health-related behaviour to affect current income and working time, as well as future health and expenditure. Second, we fit the model to Luxembourg by estimating most equations and calibrating the remainder, with particular attention to the role of health-related behaviour on each one of the sixty-one diseases estimated in the model. Finally, we use the resulting empirical model for a dynamic simulation exercise. The present version of this simulation tool focusses on individuals’ health and health-related behaviour and its impact on public expenditure. The study of consumption/saving paths as well as labour supply and retirement decisions is left for future research.====The richly specified model equations provide meaningful applications. In particular, we can decompose changes in aggregate health-related public expenditure (i.e., healthcare and long-term care) into contributions from different individual characteristics, such as demographic and socio-economic conditions as well as diagnosed diseases. In principle, the model can simulate ==== scenarios to evaluate the impact on specific diseases from new medical treatments, prevention or other health-related policies, and can map these effects to public expenditure projections. To our knowledge, this is the only simulation tool to allow such analyses for Luxembourg.====To estimate the model equations, we combine two types of data. First, micro data on individuals from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Second, aggregate data from several branches of the Luxembourg Social Security system. We base the empirical application on long-term demographic and macroeconomic projections from the European Commission and the Central Bank of Luxembourg. To assess the long-run effects of different determinants of health-related public expenditure, we design several health-related scenarios. These serve to disentangle the role of demography, costs of producing health-related services, and the distribution of health status across age cohorts. Results identify production costs as the main driver of per capita healthcare expenditure, while population ageing appears more relevant for public expenditure on long-term care.====To facilitate the reading of the paper, the theoretical model is presented in Appendix A. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and its sources. Section 3 discusses estimation strategy and calibration. Section 4 explains how we aggregate health-related public expenditure across individuals. Section 5 describes our simulation approach and the implemented scenarios, and presents the results.

However, few studies investigated whether the association varies by age group. Drawing on the economic environment that facilitated social mobility in South Korea, we postulate each age group had a different extent of social mobility, which would vary with the extent of economic growth and affect the association between social mobility and health. We used data from KDI National Happiness Survey 2018 and measured perceived mobility using respondents’ perceived social position and their parents’ social position. We examined whether social mobility was associated with self-rated health and psychological well-being. The upwardly mobile individuals were more likely than the stable ones to report ‘happy’. Such a positive association between upward mobility and happiness was consistently found when the sample was restricted to the ages 30–59 and 40–49. For self-rated health, the downwardly mobile individuals were less likely to report good health. However, no significant difference in self-rated health was found after the youngest and oldest age groups were excluded. We found that perceived social mobility was strongly associated with psychological well-being rather than self-rated health. Moreover, we found a stronger association between upward mobility and happiness among the aged 40–49, who had the largest proportion of upwardly mobile individuals and spent their adolescence during rapid economic growth. The findings underscore the importance of the economic and social context in which individuals perceive their social position and shape their well-being.","Individuals’ social position has been well-established as a fundamental cause of health disparities (Link and Phelan, 1995). Over the past decade, there have been a growing number of studies that examined the association between social mobility and health, paying more attention to variations in social position over the life course. Campos-Matos and Kawachi viewed social mobility as a driver of health disparities and found the relationship between social mobility and health varies by regime type (Campos-Matos and Kawachi, 2015). More recently, studies investigated the direct impact of social mobility, independently of childhood socioeconomic status (SES) (i.e., social origin) and adult SES (i.e., destination origin) (Kaiser and Trinh, 2021, Steiber, 2019) and used survey data from various countries and different measures of social mobility to identify the association (Gugushvili et al., 2022, Gugushvili and Präg, 2021, Präg et al., 2022, Präg and Gugushvili, 2021).====In regard to social mobility and health, most of the empirical studies analyzed the national survey data, including multiple age groups that might experience different macroeconomic conditions. Economic growth can contribute to the improvement of population health through an increase in per capita income, which accelerates individuals to have better access to nutrition, clean water, housing, and healthcare services, although the relationship between national income and population health is not universal (Subramanian et al., 2002). Studies found that economic growth commonly measured as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or GDP per capita had a positive impact on population health among developed countries over the past century and such income effect on health appeared to be stronger in developing countries than in developed countries (Linden and Ray, 2017, Swift, 2011). Campos-Matos and Kawachi used GDP per capita to account for the impact of economic development on social mobility and health at the country level and showed that evidence of the association between social mobility and health was more compelling in post-communist countries than in Scandinavian countries (Campos-Matos and Kawachi, 2015). In addition to the income effect on health, Yaish and Andersen suggested an indirect pathway where the dynamic changes in macroeconomic conditions may facilitate social mobility and in turn contribute to the improvement of health among individuals (Yaish and Andersen, 2012). Yet, little attention has been paid to the differentiated effects of macroeconomic conditions on an individual’s SES and health status within a country, and few studies examined whether the association between mobility and health varies with age group or generation.====The majority of studies on social mobility and health examined data from European countries. From a macroeconomic perspective, the economies of Western Europe have been in a steady state over the past half-century. Several studies used data from a single country in Western Europe, such as the UK, Switzerland, and Germany. Those countries have shown steady economic growth after the 1960 s (Fig. 1). The average GDP growth rates among the countries were 1.62%, 1.53%, and 1.31% respectively during the last 30 years, indicating the typical pattern of economic growth in high-income countries, whose GDP growth rate was 1.97% on average (World Bank Open Data, 2022). A couple of studies investigated data from North American countries, such as the US and Canada, both of which have shown similar patterns of economic growth to the countries of Western Europe above (Fig. 1).====Several studies focused on Eastern European countries, such as Russia, Poland, Hungary, and Belarus. Those countries had the economic transition from communism to capitalism after the early 1990 s. The transition led to larger variations in macroeconomic situations compared to the counterparts of Western Europe. The growth rate of Russia was − 14.53% immediately after the transition to a market economy in 1992. It increased to 10% in 2000 but fluctuated after the 2000 s ranging from − 5.42–8.5%. The period of such rapid economic growth was shorter than other transition economies, lasting approximately 4 years. Poland showed a negative growth (−7.02%) in 1991 but continued steady economic growth after 1993. Its economic growth rate ranged from 1% to 6.5%, converging to the range of other developed countries. Hungary’s growth rate has not been higher than 4.8%, indicating moderate economic growth, and Belarus did not show stable economic growth after 1990. Nevertheless, those countries had a relatively short history of transition economy (i.e., less than 30 years) to observe social mobility over multiple age groups.====Only a few studies used data from a couple of East Asian countries, including China and Japan. After the economic transition around the early 1990 s, China’s economic growth rate dramatically increased from 3.91% in 1990 to 14.22% in 1992 and continued to increase by 7% or higher. Japan had rapid growth in the 1960 s and continued to grow until the early 1970 s. Then, they showed a similar trend of economic growth to Western European countries according to the World Bank (2022) (Fig. 1).","Economic development, intergenerational mobility, and health in South Korea",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000412,20 May 2023,2023,Research Article,4.0

Many models of intergenerational transmission of advantage contain both a transmission channel through endowments (i.e. genetics) from parents to children as well as from parental investments and “luck”. Indeed, many scholars consider the intergenerational links due to the transmission of genetically-based advantage to place a lower bound on plausible levels of social mobility—genetics may be able to “lock in” advantage across generations. This paper explores this idea by using genetic measurements in the Health and Retirement Study to examine potential interactions between social environments and genetics related to attainments. The results suggest evidence of ====: children born in high mobility states have lower genetic penetrance—the interaction between state-level mobility and the polygenic score for education is negative. These results suggest a need to incorporate gene-environment interactions in models of attainment and mobility and to pursue the mechanisms behind the interactions.","Large literatures across several social science disciplines have been concerned with examining the magnitude and mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status (Black and Devereux, 2010). Key components of the process are often separated into an endowment pathway and an investments/luck pathway or “nature” and “nurture”. Within the endowment pathway, the core focus has been on genetics as a typically unobserved but important reason that the outcomes of children and their parents are positively correlated. To a large extent, understanding the importance of non-genetic pathways is challenging both because genetics is thought to operate across a wide range of domains and because it is often unobserved by the researcher.==== Emerging work has begun to challenge the traditional nature vs. nurture decomposition exercise to instead consider the interplay of nature and nurture (Heckman, 2007, Heckman, 2008, Conley and Fletcher, 2017), or gene-environment interactions. However, much evidence has not been able to separate gene-environment interactions from gene-environmental correlations (Fletcher and Conley, 2013).==== For analyses of attainments, gene-environment correlation occurs in part due to the positive relationship between children’s genetics, parents’ genetics, and parentally provided environments (Belsky et al., 2018).====This paper contributes to the literature on how genetics, environments, and their interaction are related to adult attainments in several ways. First, following a small but growing set of papers, this paper incorporates genetic measurements to the study of socioeconomic attainment (Belsky et al., 2018, Conley et al., 2015). In particular, I use a summary measure of genetic endowments, a polygenic score==== for education developed by a massive Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) by Okbay et al. (2016). Second, I contribute a new measure of social environments by estimating a measure of education mobility at the birth-state-by-decade level by leveraging the Health and Retirement Study. Combining these two measures then allows the key contribution of the paper: a novel examination of whether genetics are decoupled from attainments to a larger extent in socially mobile environments (i.e a gene-environment interaction).====The main results suggest evidence of gene environment interactions.

In this study, we investigate how an individual-specific factor – family size – affects the probability of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. To answer this research question, we focus on individuals above 50 years of age, who are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. The analysis uses the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Corona wave, conducted in the summer of 2021. To identify the effect of family size on vaccination, we exploit an exogenous variation in the probability of having more than two children, due to the sex composition of two firstborns. We document that a larger family size increases the probability of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine among older individuals. This impact is economically and statistically significant. We propose several potential mechanisms behind this result and document that family size can be related to the higher probability of being exposed to the disease. This effect can be by knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 or had symptoms similar to it, and by network size and frequency of contact with children, before the outbreak of COVID-19.","Vaccination against COVID-19 is crucial to protect oneself, contain the spread of the disease, and return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle (World Health Organization, November 2021).====We estimate the causal impact of family size on the probability of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Leaving aside the role of the ‘quality’ of children, we consider the role of the number of children. Therefore, we use data from the second wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Corona Survey, conducted in the summer of 2021.==== The Corona Survey is a part of SHARE and is designed to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals aged older than 50 years in Europe. The second wave asked the question about the revealed preferences about COVID-19 vaccination. We combine the information from the SHARE Corona Survey, with fertility history in the pre-pandemic survey waves, to investigate the impact of an individual’s number of children on their vaccination. Thus, we focus on the older population, which was targeted as a priority group for vaccination in many countries and by the timing of the interview, could have received the dose.====. Accordingly, the instrument is based on the sex composition of the individuals’ two firstborn biological children. Results show that the number of children has a significant positive impact on the probability of getting the COVID-19 vaccine.====Why does family size affect the decision of vaccination against COVID-19? First, a larger family size might lead to increased personal contact (e.g., ====) and, in turn, a higher risk of contagion. Therefore, the decision to get the COVID-19 vaccine can be interpreted as a preventive behaviour facing a greater risk of getting sick. In line with this hypothesis, before the COVID-19 pandemic, ==== showed that disease outbreaks increase vaccination rates. In line with the hypothesis but beyond respiratory diseases, ==== find a higher COVID-19 vaccination rate in places with more deaths in the UK. Further, the number of children could also affect the probability of possessing the needed information to receive the vaccination, such as the distance to the vaccination centre, the commuting mode, updates on eligibility criteria about vaccination, booking appointments on the online websites (e.g., for anecdotal evidence, see the Washington Post, 2021).====However, family size might also decrease the probability of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. A larger family size might lead to weaker parent-child social ties and, and fewer social interactions (e.g., ====). Furthermore, communicating with individuals who suffered from a mild form of COVID-19, may downplay the perception of the contagion (====, ====). Moreover, the negative externalities of not getting vaccinated might be lower for individuals surrounded by younger family members, as they are less likely to develop a serious form of the disease.====Accordingly, understanding whether family size has a positive or negative effect on vaccination decision remains an empirical question. Based on the SHARE Corona Survey and pre-pandemic information, we document a positive and statistically significant effect of family size on COVID-19 vaccination uptake. As for the mechanism, we show that having more than two children increases the probability of knowing someone who experienced the symptoms or had tested positive for COVID-19. Moreover, a larger family size directly leads to the following effects: 1) a larger network size; 2) a higher number of grandchildren; 3) the higher likelihood of being a great-grandparent; and 4) an increase in the pre-pandemic total number of contacts. All these variables imply that individuals with more than two children face a higher risk of COVID-19 exposure.==== are unlikely to be the drivers of vaccination decision. This is because the vaccine was distributed free of charge in the countries under analysis. We also find no evidence for cross-vaccine responses in the intake of vaccines against influenza and pneumonia. Thus, the effect of family size on vaccination choice could be attributed only to the pandemic-caused illness, likely driven by uncertainty and fear regarding the pandemic-related virus. The effect of family size on other preventive measures is also positive but not significant perhaps due to their relatively lower protectiveness compared to vaccination.====This study contributes to the growing literature about factors that shaped the behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more generally, about the individual determinants of vaccination and exposure to disease. The closest article to ours is ====, who showed that the individual intention to get vaccinated increases with the death rate at the local level. In our study, and differently from them, we directly estimate the impact of individual-specific factors that lead to an increase in exposure to disease rather than its proxy at an aggregate level. Moreover, our main hypothesis is in line with several studies documenting that self-risk perception is an important driver in determining the vaccination rate. ==== conducted a survey on the intention to get vaccinated before, during, and after the lockdown measures in spring 2020 in Italy. They show that a higher risk perception of the virus increases the willingness to get vaccinated. This is confirmed by ====, who used survey data from China to document that the risk perception of the virus increases vaccine acceptance. ==== documented that personal protection is the primary reason for increasing the willingness to get vaccinated. In this regard, we consider the vaccination decision instead of the intention to get vaccinated, given that these two effects can be distinct.==== (parental labour supply), ====, and ==== (quantity-quality trade-off); ==== (schooling); ==== (later-life depression); ==== (later-life loneliness); and ==== (later-life cognition). Accordingly, we contribute to the existing literature by showing that the number of children continues to impact individuals’ health decisions during the pandemic.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. ==== briefly presents the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Europe. ==== describes the dataset and shows the descriptive findings.

This study takes advantage of a new linkage between the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) and administrative tax data from the T1 Family File (T1FF) from Statistics Canada. The NLSCY includes rich longitudinal information on child development, while the T1FF includes administrative tax information on each child in adulthood (e.g., income, social assistance). The primary measures of child health relate to the diagnosis of a chronic condition, affecting the child’s physical or mental/developmental health. The results suggest that mental/developmental health conditions in childhood more negatively influence adult health and socioeconomic conditions, compared to physical health conditions. Interaction models reveal modest heterogenous effects; for example, there is some evidence of a cushioning effect from higher household income in childhood, as well as an exacerbating negative effect from lower birth weight for mental/developmental health conditions. Using a covariate decomposition approach to explore underlying pathways, the results reveal that associations between health in early life and outcomes in adulthood are partially explained by differences in cognitive skills (i.e., mathematics test scores) in adolescence (ages 16-17). Results may encourage policy investments to mitigate the occurrence of health conditions in childhood and to ensure timely access to educational supports and health services for children with chronic conditions.","Childhood represents a critical period for the acquisition of skills and stocks of health, important for both contemporaneous and future health and social outcomes. This perspective is aligned with the notion that health in early life represents an input for human capital development (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, Cunha and Heckman, 2008, Currie, 2020). Health and achievement gaps observed in early and late adulthood may therefore have roots in childhood.====This study examines the relationship between childhood chronic conditions and health and socioeconomic outcomes in early adulthood in Canada. Of particular interest to this study is the comparative examination of the long-run effect of different types of childhood health conditions, the identification of heterogeneous health effects due to child and parent characteristics, and the identification of underlying pathways between health in early life and outcomes in adulthood. This study draws on a new linkage between the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) and administrative tax data (T1 Family Files) from Statistics Canada; data from the NLSCY provide rich information on child health and the household, while the administrative tax data provide information on indicators of health and socioeconomic outcomes in young adulthood (e.g., education, income, social assistance).====We find that chronic mental health/developmental disorders in childhood negatively affect all adult outcomes of interest (e.g., income, health, educational attainment), while chronic physical ailments only affect the probability of reporting poor health in adulthood and the likelihood of social assistance take-up. Interaction models reveal modest heterogenous effects; there is some evidence of a cushioning effect from higher household income in childhood, as well as an exacerbating, negative effect from lower birth weight for mental/developmental health conditions. Using a covariate decomposition approach to explore underlying pathways, results suggest that the observed associations between health in early life and outcomes in adulthood are partially explained by differences in cognitive skills in adolescence (ages 16-17).====Results from this study are of interest to scholars working in the field of child human capital for a number of reasons. First, our study draws on a novel linkage between a child longitudinal survey and their administrative tax records in adulthood. The structure of the linkage implies that data on child health were collected in real time which reduces concerns around measurement error. This contrasts the approach of using retrospective accounts of health in childhood that much of the empirical literature has relied on in the past (Case et al., 2005, Smith, 2009).====Second, as most of the published literature on this topic stems from the US, our study provides findings from a country with a universal health care system and a relatively stronger social safety net. As expected, we find smaller point estimates compared to studies from the US (e.g.,(Smith, 2009)). In addition, we note that studying Canada more specifically is a compelling addition to the literature as its health care system is in fact ====, whereby drugs and mental health services are excluded from the universal basket, thus setting it apart from both the US and many other high-income countries with universal health care systems. This signals that while there are marginal improvements from a setting that stands between two welfare state archetypes (Olsen, 2002), further investments in children are necessary in this context.====Third, the study applies a novel covariate decomposition approach to unpack the underlying mechanisms at play. With the exception of one recent study (Viinikainen et al., 2020), this approach has not been employed in this area. Rather than relying on commonly used sequential covariate adjustments, which are prone to omitted variable bias (Gelbach, 2016), the approach relies on auxiliary regressions to decompose the overall effect of predictors by variables from an intermediary period. While this method has predominantly been used in the intergenerational income literature, we view the method as pertinent and suitable for this area of study.====Finally, while our results confirm what other literature has found regarding child mental/developmental health conditions, our study also examines physical conditions and thus provides comparative estimates. In addition, the data allow us to examine various measures of child mental/developmental health conditions, ranging from indicators of diagnosed conditions and behavioural scales of neuro-developmental conditions.====The remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections.

The data and empirical approach are presented in 3 Data and variables, 4 Empirical approach, respectively. Section 5 reports the results.

In this paper, we exploit a reform that took place in the Canadian province of Quebec to address that important topic. In 2006, Quebec opted out of the federal plan and established its own parental insurance plan, named the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP). This program has lowered the eligibility criteria, increased income replacement and introduced fathers’ quotas. Using three data sets, we investigate the impact of the QPIP on ","The availability and length of paid parental leave has increased substantially in most OECD countries over the last decades. From 1970 to 2016, the average number of weeks of paid leave available to mothers rose from 17 to 52.5 across OECD countries (OECD, 2017). Nevertheless, there is considerable variation within these countries. Indeed, some, such as Finland and the Slovak Republic, offer over three years of paid leave, whereas others, such as the United States, do not offer any paid federal leave.==== The objectives of parental leave policies are multiple and include protecting and encouraging workforce participation, providing financial security, promoting gender equity and improving the health and well-being of young children and their parents by allowing them to bond during the first year of the child’s life (Robson, 2017).====An extensive literature has examined short-term and long-term effects of these policies on maternal employment and earnings (Han et al., 2009, Lalive et al., 2013, Bartel et al., 2018) and child outcomes such as health and cognitive development (Ruhm, 2000, Tanaka, 2005, Baker and Milligan, 2008, Baker and Milligan, 2015). A moderate but growing number of studies also sought to investigate the effects of parental leave policies on parental health. Generally, the evidence shows that paid parental leave has beneficial effects on parental health, but there are diminishing returns to leave length (Aitken et al., 2015, Bütikofer et al., 2021).====In this study, we investigate the impact of a parental leave reform in the Canadian province of Quebec on parental health, breastfeeding, and parental behavior. More precisely, we study the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), introduced in Quebec on January 1, 2006. From 2001 to 2005, eligible parents in all Canadian provinces could claim parental leave benefits from the Employment Insurance (EI) program (federal plan). In 2006, Quebec opted out of the EI program and established its own parental insurance plan named the Régime Québécois d’Assurance Parentale (RQAP), or QPIP. The QPIP lowered the eligibility criteria for leave, increased income replacement, and introduced fathers’ quotas.====It is not clear, a priori, whether the QPIP will improve the parental outcomes. On one hand, the QPIP could have a beneficial effect on the health of mothers because this program reaches a larger proportion of mothers and has raised parents’ disposable income during parental leave. Furthermore, if a mother has breastfeeding difficulties, post-childbirth complications or severe fatigue and exhaustion, the father’s presence at home (because of fathers’ quotas) could allow the mother to rest (Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2019). Fathers may also reduce maternal stress and loneliness related to post-partum depression and anxiety (Cairney et al., 2003, Corwin et al., 2005).==== On the other hand, the EI system was already very generous and provided a total of 50 weeks of paid leave with a 55 percent wage replacement to eligible parents. Evidence shows that expansions in paid parental leave improve maternal health up to a certain point, after which they have little to no further effect, consistent with the assumption of diminishing returns to parental leave length (Bütikofer et al., 2021).====This study contributes to the literature on paid parental leave in several ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an empirical analysis of the impact of the QPIP on parental health (physical and mental, as well as post-partum problems). Previous studies on this program have focused on leave utilization, sex specialization, financial family resources and child development (Patnaik, 2019, Haeck et al., 2019). An analysis of the impact of QPIP on parental health and well-being is necessary and of great interest to policymakers. Second, in addition to studying parental health, we also analyze breastfeeding and parental behavior and thereby examine several mechanisms through which parental leave could affect children’s outcomes, such as (1) parental engagement, (2) parenting skills, (3) parental mental and physical health and (4) breastfeeding. We thus establish an overall picture of the reform’s effects on family outcomes. Third, this study is one of the first to investigate the effect on family well-being of a parental leave reform that changed the financial compensation provided during leave and added paternal quotas but did not extend the duration of parental leave. We also contribute to a small but growing body of literature that seeks to investigate the effects of fathers’ quotas and parental leave on parental health and parental involvement, a field of research that is underdeveloped in the existing literature on paid parental leave (Bullinger, 2019). For example, Baker and Milligan (2008) examined the effects of the expansion of paid parental leave in Canada in 2001 on breastfeeding, parental health, and behavior. This expansion did not have a father quota component, and parental benefits remained constant. Our article makes an important contribution in the sense that the QPIP includes quotas for fathers as well as an increase in benefits. Fourth, we study the short-term and long-term effects of the reform, that is, from the birth of the child until age five. Documenting the short and long-term effects of paid family leave on parents is crucial to our understanding of the overall impact of such reforms, both when the parent is eligible for leave and also once the parents are no longer directly affected by the program. Last, we exploit the richness of the data and use several data sets to estimate the causal effect of parental leave on multiple outcomes. They therefore have the advantage of containing a large amount of information, especially on birth variables (e.g., premature birth, prenatal care), the behavior of parents with their children (e.g., positive interactions, parental involvement, activities with the child) and post-partum health (post-partum depression and post-partum problems). They also have the advantage of including detailed information on breastfeeding (especially exclusive breastfeeding) and on many indices of physical and mental health. We thus analyze the effects of paid parental leave to determine whether there are differences among vulnerable parents, such as low-educated mothers or mothers who experienced complications at delivery. In sum, this paper contributes to the literature by utilizing richer data, as well as by investigating the short and long-term effects of fathers’ quotas, and parental leave more generally, on parental health and behavior, a field of research that is underdeveloped in the existing literature.====In this paper, we use three Statistics Canada data sets: (1) the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), (2) the Survey of Young Canadians (SYC) and (3) the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). To identify the impact of the QPIP, we use a difference-in-differences (DD) model. The treated group includes parents in Quebec, and the control group includes parents in the rest of Canada.====We find that the QPIP significantly increased breastfeeding duration. Our estimates also suggest that the reform has small significant and positive effects on parents’ health and behavior. The effects were larger for highly educated mothers and those who experienced complications at birth. There is little persistent effect of the reform on parental well-being as the child gets older. Finally, the results are robust to a series of robustness checks and consistent with existing evidence.====The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the QPIP reform. Sections 3 Data, 4 Methodology present, respectively, the data sets and the empirical strategy. In Section 5, we present our empirical results, and Section 6 concludes the paper.","The effect of paid parental leave on breastfeeding, parental health and behavior",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000291,3 May 2023,2023,Research Article,9.0

It is the main cause of preventable deaths, and its consumption is directly related to epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). According to the WHO (2021), smoking kills more than 8 million people worldwide each year, of which approximately 7 million are directly caused by tobacco use, while approximately 1.2 million are the result of exposure to tobacco through secondhand smoke.====However, the consequences of tobacco use go beyond its harmful effects on health, also bringing economic implications, as they lead to significant costs in the treatment of diseases caused by its use, and in the loss of human capital due to related morbidities and mortality. Despite being a global health challenge, the burden falls most heavily on developing countries, as around 80% of tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2021).====Brazil is one such country. Annually, more than 161,000 deaths are attributable to tobacco use, representing 443 deaths per day, and smoking is the third risk factor for disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) (WHO, 2021). Although the numbers are still impressive, the country has evolved significantly over time through multisectoral public policies aimed at tobacco control. These efforts began in the 1980 s and proved to be effective in combating smoking; estimates show that the prevalence of smoking among adults dropped from 35% to 18.5% between 1989 and 2008 (WHO, 2019). More recent data from the National Health Survey (PNS-2019) also showed this pattern of decline, as the prevalence of smoking in adults was 14.9% in 2013 and dropped to 12.8% in 2019, a reduction of 2.1% points (IBGE, 2013, IBGE, 2019).====Although there is extensive literature that seeks to analyze the behavior of the prevalence of use over time, few studies exist that seek to analyze inequality, that is, how tobacco use is distributed in the population (Barros et al., 2011, Dias-Damé et al., 2011, Kuhnen et al., 2009, Malcon et al., 2003, Malta et al., 2013, Malta et al., 2015, Menezes et al., 2008, Paes, 2016). The study of inequalities is mainly relevant in countries that face serious social inequality, as is the case in Brazil, one of the most unequal countries in the world. Income inequality in the country is marked by extreme levels. According to data from the latest World Inequality Report (WIR) of 2022, the wealthiest 10% of the population concentrates about 59% of the total national income, while the bottom half is left with only 10%. This high inequality has remained constant over time, even with the reduction in wage inequality evident since the 2000 s.==== Estimates suggest that the wealthiest 10% income share has always been higher than 50% (Chancel et al., 2021).====Given the high level of income inequality and evidence of a negative association between socioeconomic status and tobacco consumption (Barros et al., 2011, Dias-Damé et al., 2011, Kuhnen et al., 2009, Menezes et al., 2008), it is expected that there will be significant inequalities in its use, and the harmful effects on health, recognized by the literature, may be concentrated in a specific group of individuals. This study aimed to analyze income-related inequality in tobacco consumption in Brazil. It uses data from the National Health Survey at two points in time (2013 and 2019), thus allowing the analysis of the evolution of inequality over the period. The inequality measure is the concentration index (CI), and the analysis of its decomposition allows the identification of the factors that determine this inequality.====This study contributes to the literature from different perspectives. First, we analyzed income-related inequalities in tobacco use in a middle-income country with high levels of inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform this analysis using data from the Brazilian population. Second, we analyzed different types of tobacco use (total smoking, manufactured cigarettes, RYO, cigars, pipes, hookahs, and cloves), in addition use cessation. Although the literature predominantly focuses on cigarette consumption, all forms of smoking==== are considered to be harmful to health (WHO, 2021). For example, Carnazza et al. (2021) find different directions in inequalities depending on the type of smoking in their evidence for Spain, with most cases concentrating on the poorest, but for cigars and pipes, there is a concentration on the wealthiest. Thus, by analyzing different outcomes in Brazil, this study seeks to provide a more complete view of inequality in tobacco use.====Furthermore, unlike most of the literature, we sought to analyze the possible heterogeneities related to age and sex. Although estimates show a reduction in the prevalence of smoking among adults over time, the prevalence among young people remains stable (WHO, 2019). Studies that analyzed the association between socioeconomic status and tobacco use among young people showed a different pattern from that observed in the adult population. Most of the literature that focuses on analyzing this association in the adult population finds a negative relationship, while studies that focus on the younger population do not find a relationship or find a positive relationship (Malcon et al., 2003, Teixeira et al., 2017). These factors led us to hypothesize that the pattern of behavior distribution for smoking differs by age group.====Inequality analyses are important because they identify the most affected populations and have the potential to provide important information to support public policies aimed not only at reducing the prevalence of smoking but also at greater equity.

In this paper, we test for a specific type of family influence on education: genetic nurture. Specifically, we test whether a person’s educational attainment is correlated with their sibling’s polygenic score (PGS) for education, controlling for their own PGS. Models estimated using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) yield strong evidence of genetic nurture; a two-standard deviation increase in a sibling’s ==== to higher education is associated with a 13.6% point increase in the probability that the respondent has a college degree. Evidence of genetic nurture is robust to alternative measures of educational attainment and different measures of the polygenic score. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that omission of parental PGS explains no more than half of the estimated effect, and that the magnitude of the genetic nurture varies with the characteristics of the sibling.","A large literature documents a substantial and persistent correlation between education and good health (e.g., Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2008; Grossman, 2006). Educational attainment has even been described as ==== correlate of good health (Grossman, 2015, Grossman and Kaestner, 1997). As a result, there is great interest in understanding the factors that determine educational attainment, such as within-family influences (Black et al., 2011, Paloyo, 2020).====The educational attainment of siblings is highly correlated, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 (Lindahl, 2011, Raaum et al., 2006; Solon, 2000; Nicoletti and Rabe, 2013; Mazumder, 2008). Economists have advanced numerous possible explanations for this correlation (e.g. Griliches, 1979; Conley et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2023). For example, youths might tutor their siblings or help them with their homework. They might serve as role models or examples for their siblings (Benin and Johnson, 1984; Nicoletti and Rabe 2019). People’s beliefs about their own academic potential may be based in part on the achievements of their siblings (Altmejd et al., 2021). In addition, parents might reallocate family resources based on each child’s academic ability or performance (Griliches, 1979, Almond and Mazumder, 2013, Yi et al., 2015, Sanz-de-Galdeano and Terskaya, 2020 Sanz-de-Galdeano and Anastasia, 2022).====In this paper, we test for a specific kind of within-family influence on education: genetic nurture. Genetic nurture is defined as one individual's genes affecting another individual's outcomes (Wolf et al., 1998). Empirically, we use rich genetic data to test whether the focal person’s educational attainment is associated with their sibling’s polygenic score (PGS) for educational attainment, controlling for the focal person’s own PGS for educational attainment. A polygenic score (PGS) is an index of the number of alleles —specific forms of a gene — that are associated with a specific trait; in this case, educational attainment. In the absence of genetic nurture, the focal person’s educational attainment should not be associated with their sibling’s PGS after controlling for the focal person’s own PGS for that outcome.====Our study addresses some of the problems that confound empirical research on peer effects (Manski, 1993; Manski, 2000; Angrist, 2014). There is no issue of self-selection because the peers in question are full siblings (people who have the same two biological parents) and people do not choose their own full siblings. The “reflection problem” — the fact that it is hard to distinguish the effect of person A on person B from vice-versa (Manski, 1993) — is addressed because PGS is determined before birth (at conception).====This paper contributes to the growing health economics literature that uses genetic data (e.g., Biroli et al., 2022; Fletcher and Lu, 2021; Papageorge and Thom, 2020; Dixon et al., 2020; Böckerman et al., 2019; von Hinke et al., 2016; Wehby, 2016; von Hinke Kessler Scholder et al., 2011). In particular, we add to the findings regarding genetic nurture. Kong et al. (2018) test for genetic nurture in education from parents to children in an Icelandic sample. They find that parental alleles associated with education that were ==== transmitted to the child nonetheless are associated with the child’s education, and have 29.9% of the effect of alleles that ==== transmitted to the child. Domingue et al. (2015) find, in data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), that educational attainment is correlated with friends’ PGS for educational attainment, even after controlling for own PGS. However, because friends are selected, it is unclear whether this correlation is due to genetic nurture among friends or selection into friendships. Using the same data set, Cawley et al. (2019) found no evidence of genetic nurture among siblings with respect to body mass index or obesity.====This paper also contributes to the literature on peer effects, particularly as regards sibling effects in education. Previous studies of sibling effects in education have exploited admission thresholds for colleges (Altmejd et al., 2021), school entry policies (Landersø et al., 2019), school starting age (Karbownik and Ozek, 2019), or an unexpected policy change (Joensen et al., 2018). We use polygenic scores for education, which provide exogenous variation in peer characteristics and are unaffected by the reflection problem.====To foreshadow the results, we find evidence consistent with genetic nurture. Specifically, we find that individuals’ educational attainment is associated with their sibling’s PGS for education, controlling for their own PGS for education. We explore possible mechanisms for this genetic nurture, and find evidence consistent with it operating, at least in part, through parental expectations for college, which may be influenced by older siblings.====Although our data do not include information on parental PGS, we are able to put bounds on the potential resulting omitted variable bias, and find that, at the most, it can explain half of the estimated effect.",Genetic nurture in educational attainment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000205,20 March 2023,2023,Research Article,11.0

Yet, the empirical evidence on the relations existing between policies based on different degrees of economic liberalism and flu mortality is still scarce. This paper contributes to filling the gap by proposing an empirical investigation into the effects of various dimensions of liberalism, proxied by the different components of the Fraser Index of Economic Freedom, on deaths from seasonal influenzas in a sample of 38 ==== countries observed from 1970 to 2018. A dynamic panel System-GMM estimator is used to alleviate endogeneity concerns, while alternative models, specifications and subsamples check the robustness of findings. Findings show that: a) not every component of economic freedom has an effect on flu mortality; b) more economic freedom not always means less or more deaths from flu. In particular, stronger protection of property rights and smaller government consumption are associated with higher flu mortality, which is instead lower when people and capital are freer to move. Such results give rise to policy considerations and contribute to inform policymakers about actions that can limit the mortality of a globally widespread disease like flu.","The existence of different types of capitalism (Becker, 2009, Bruff, 2011) and the wave of liberalisations introduced by the ==== opened the door to the concept of ==== and its measurement (Gwartney et al., 2003, Lawson et al., 2020). This concept is multifaceted and includes different institutional and economic aspects that are related to liberalism. According to the Fraser Institute and its Economic Freedom Reports (Gwartney and Lawson, 2003; Gwartney et al., 2021), economic freedom is defined as: “how closely the institutions and policies of a country correspond with the classical liberal ideal of a limited government, where the government protects property rights and arranges for the provision of a limited set of “public goods” such as national defence and access to money of sound value, but little beyond these core functions” (Gwartney et al., 2021, p. 2).====With the subsequent development of composite indices by the Fraser Institute and the Heritage Foundation to assess countries’ degree of economic freedom, the economic literature has started to inquire about the relationships that this latter has with various socio-economic phenomena, including health and health outcomes. Indeed, the aforementioned indices are based on various dimensions of economic freedom that can be differently related to health, such as the size of government and public expenditure, on which the coverage of healthcare systems depends (Coates, 2005). In addition, the free circulation of goods, capital and people (which is another aspect included in the indices of economic freedom) may play a role in diffusing pathogens, but also in fighting them thanks to the imports of drugs and medical devices (Stevens et al., 2013). Similarly, labour market policies, whose degree of regulation is assessed by the aforementioned indices, may affect unemployment and, therefore, the availability of resources that people may invest in healthcare (Piton and Rycx, 2019). Finally, the rule of law and the protection of property rights may influence innovation and the development of new drugs and vaccines (Correa, 2009, Roberts and Olson, 2013).====The empirical literature, however, mainly focuses on the relationship between the size of public expenditure and general health outcomes (among others, Basu et al., 2012; Dickman et al., 2017; Di Novi and Migheli, 2017; Callison and Sicilian, 2018), while few works investigated how these latter can be also affected by other specific domains of economic liberalism (Stroup, 2007, McCartney et al., 2012, Razvi and Chakraborty, 2016, Hall et al., 2018a, Sharma, 2020, De Soysa and Vadlamannati, 2021a). Most important, only a limited number of studies explored the relationship between economic freedom and the capacity to mitigate the impacts of common diseases (Dayaratna et al., 2020, Hoekman et al., 2020, Geloso et al., 2021), although this issue is particularly relevant to identify policies limiting the adverse consequences of outbreaks globally. When it was done, the analysis was mainly descriptive (Dayaratna et al., 2020, Hoekman et al., 2020) and/or limited to specific historical or geographical case-studies (Hoekman et al., 2020, Geloso et al., 2021), while the multifaceted nature of economic freedom was rarely considered. As further discussed in the paper, measuring economic freedom as a mono-dimensional phenomenon does not allow to investigate how its several dimensions or components differently affect the health outcomes of specific diseases and, then, to inform policymakers about the proper mix of policies to implement in consideration of growing risk of global pandemics.====This paper contributes to filling the gap by empirically investigating how various dimensions of economic freedom, measured through the indices and sub-indices provided by the Fraser Institute, are associated with mortality from seasonal influenza in a sample of 38 OECD countries observed between 1970 and 2018. Seasonal influenza represents a case of a recurrent pandemic, which is generally considered minor, while yearly causing hundreds of thousands of casualties worldwide (Dattani and Spooner, 2022). As age represents a major risk factor of dying from flu (Quandelacy et al., 2014), policy considerations on this issue may be particularly relevant for countries characterized by an aging population such as the most of OECD countries are. The analysis at first uses a dynamic panel generalised method of moments (GMM) estimator to alleviate endogeneity concerns and, then, adopts alternative models and subsamples to verify the robustness of findings. These show that not every component of economic freedom has an effect on flu mortality; when an effect is detected - like for some components of government size, legal system and property rights, and freedom to trade internationally - not always more freedom means less (or more) deaths from flu.",Free to die: Economic freedoms and influenza mortality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000199,14 March 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

In addition to documenting a significant association between the various measures of obesity ==== and subjective well-being, especially among women, we show a significant increase in obesity inequality, particularly among females and those with low education and/or low income. This rising inequality points to the need to combat obesity through initiatives targeted at specific sociodemographic groups.","Between 1975 and 2016, obesity prevalence almost tripled, resulting in approximately 2 billion overweight (39% male, 40% female) and over half a billion obese (11% male, 15% female) adults worldwide (World Health Organization, 2020). In Germany, the obesity prevalence doubled from 1987 to 2016 (Ritchie and Roser, 2017) to over a quarter of German adults, with both men and women having a mean body mass index (BMI) in 2015 of over 26 (Ritchie and Roser, 2017). Yet despite wide documentation of obesity’s prevalence and serious health risks – including type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers (Kyrou et al., 2018), and raising the risk of severe pneumonia mortality after infection with Covid-19 (Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2020) – the measures used are too raw to capture the shifts in BMI distribution that drive changes in obesity prevalence and mean BMI. Knowledge of such shifts, however, is crucial to the development and assessment of interventions that successfully combat obesity. For example, an increased obesity rate and mean BMI when the entire population gains weight represents a rightward shift in BMI distribution that requires population-wide policies such as taxes on unhealthy nutrients (e.g., a “fat tax”) or labeling rules. The same increase in obesity rate and mean BMI when only part of the population (right end of the distribution) gains weight faster than others represents a left skewing of the distribution that calls for interventions targeted at specific groups (e.g., information campaigns). Should a combined right shifting and left skewing of the distribution occur, it would indicate a need for hybrid policies aimed at both the entire population and certain subgroups (Nie et al., 2019).====One particularly useful method for uncovering underlying changes in the BMI distribution is to quantify changes in obesity inequality, a tool recently employed in a small number of investigations for select countries (Nie et al., 2021, Nie et al., 2019, Pak et al., 2016, Madden, 2012, Sahn, 2009). Whereas one such study reports a 13.7% increase in the Gini coefficient of general obesity in China between 1991 and 2011 (Nie et al., 2019), another documents a 23.3% increase in the US between 1971 and 2014, with obesity inequality being particularly pronounced among women and blacks (Pak et al., 2016). This (left) skewing of the BMI distribution may have important welfare implications (Nie et al., 2019, Pak et al., 2016), particularly if, as obesity inequality suggests, overweight and obese individuals are gaining weight more rapidly than the remaining population, making them more prone to stigmatization and discrimination (Puhl et al., 2007, Puhl and Brownell, 2001). That is, even though societal perceptions of ideal body weight may adjust to the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the population (Burke and Heiland, 2018), a pronounced skewing of the distribution, rather than shifting perceptions, could widen the gap between the obese and those with ideal body weight. For instance, obese individuals might encounter fewer obese peers, resulting in the well-documented phenomenon of peer comparisons negatively influencing individual well-being (Pickett and Wilkinson, 2015).====This study paints a long-term picture of obesity inequality in Germany by first analyzing changes in the BMI distribution of German adults over two decades (2002–2018) and then using a series of measures to assess the level of obesity inequality and its trends in subgroups over time. Then, because many prior studies express concern over the implications of obesity inequality for subjective well-being (SWB) without actually testing them empirically, it employs empirical strategies to estimate the relation between these two factors. To the best of our knowledge, the study is the first to investigate obesity inequality in Germany and possibly even the first for continental Europe.",Obesity inequality and well-being in Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000175,24 February 2023,2023,Research Article,13.0

It is therefore not surprising that ,"On the face of it, there is an elegant complementarity between public health and economics: the former identifies a social ill, the latter provides a tool to quantify it. Public health policy makers can then use that tool to design interventions that will improve public health and boost social welfare.====Social stress is a social ill. Medical science tells us that stress arising from adverse social conditions can cause physical and mental harm. For example, with regard to physical harm, Cohen and Williamson (1991) present intriguing evidence for the influence of stress on infectious diseases. Segerstrom and Miller (2004) conduct a meta-analytic study that leads them to infer (p.==== ====619) that “stressful experiences alter features of the immune response as well as confer vulnerability to adverse medical outcomes that are either mediated by or resisted by the immune system.” Kivimäki et al. (2006) and Steptoe and Kivimäki (2013) conduct meta-analyses, demonstrating the significant influence of work-related stress on the risk of coronary disease. With regard to mental harm, Turner et al. (1995) find that exposure to stress is a significant explanatory variable of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder, and Hammen (2005) reviews studies that show a robust and causal association between stressful life events and major depressive episodes. Medical science differentiates between two types of stress factors: internal, where stress is caused by illness and medical treatment, and external, which arises from adverse social conditions. In this paper we are concerned with social stress.====The social stress that we have in mind is income related and caused by the dismay that arises from having low relative income. This perception of social stress is in line with Sen’s (1973, p.==== ====33) interpretation of the manner in which the Gini coefficient is constructed. Inter alia, Sen writes: “In any pair-wise comparison the man with the lower income can be thought to be suffering from some depression on finding his income to be lower. Let this depression be proportional to the difference in income.” For our current purposes, that Sen uses the term ==== rather than ==== is immaterial. We discuss the concept of social stress in greater detail later on in this section. In the next section we provide a formal definition.====Policy makers aiming to improve public health by keeping a contaminant in check quite often harbor little doubt about the correct policy prescriptions. In the recent past alone, addressing the infection and fatality rates of COVID-19, several studies noted a link between income inequality, social stress, and measures of infection and mortality, and recommended reducing income inequality by lowering the Gini coefficient. Examples of such studies include Elgar et al. (2020), Oronce et al. (2020), Liao and De Maio (2021), Tan et al. (2021), and Wildman (2021). In applying the prescribed reduction, these researchers claim, social welfare is likely to improve. For example, Tan et al. (2021, p.==== ====2/8) write: “Targeted interventions should . . . focus on income inequality measured by the Gini coefficient to . . . flatten the [COVID-19 pandemic] curve.” Wildman (2021), who identifies “a clear association between income inequality [measured by the Gini coefficient] and COVID-19 cases and deaths,” concludes (p.==== ====461) that “a goal of governments should be to reduce [income] inequalities and [thereby] improve the [COVID-19 outcomes and] underlying health of their populations.” The recent studies echo a view expressed 25 years ago by Lynch et al. (1998), who, having examined associations between income inequality and mortality in US metropolitan areas, concluded (p.==== ====1074) that “given the mortality burden associated with income inequality, public and private sector initiatives to reduce economic inequalities should be a high priority.”====The purpose of this paper is to challenge this apparently seamless line of reasoning. What harms public health and social welfare is not necessarily a high Gini coefficient but a high level of a ==== of the Gini coefficient. A lowering of the Gini coefficient can actually ==== the level of that component. Social stress will then rise, and so public health will not achieve its aims.====It is worthwhile to reemphasize exactly what this paper seeks to establish and to provide evidence that supports the argument of a causal link between a measure of social stress, which is a component of the Gini coefficient - as shown in what follows, this measure is aggregate relative deprivation - and adverse health outcomes.====A prevalent stance is that adverse health outcomes are associated - positively correlated - with an unequal income distribution, which is measured by the Gini coefficient, and that reducing inequality by lowering the Gini coefficient will lead to improved health outcomes. We contest this stance. Not only do we argue that reducing the Gini coefficient may fail to improve health outcomes, but we go further, arguing that reducing the Gini coefficient can harm public health. We reason as follows. Adverse health outcomes are associated - positively correlated - with inequality of the income distribution as measured by the Gini coefficient. According to evidence presented in what follows, the ==== link is between adverse health outcomes and ==== of the Gini coefficient. This component is social stress. To improve health outcomes, social stress should be reduced. Attempts to reduce the Gini coefficient can constitute a misguided policy response, not only because such a reduction need not reduce social stress at all, but because the reduction can actually coincide with raising social stress. The correct policy response is to address social stress directly. A reviewer of this paper made the following assertion: “A reduction of social stress is a positive policy outcome, and should be pursued by public authorities because the likelihood that it will do good is overwhelmingly high.”====Regarding a link between social stress as measured by relative deprivation - a component of the Gini coefficient - and adverse health consequences of relative deprivation, we draw on the following sample of research findings. Eibner et al. (2004) use data taken from the US national household survey component of HealthCare for Communities in order to evaluate the relationship between relative deprivation and mental health. They find that individuals who are more relatively deprived are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health disorders. Using data for males from the US National Health Interview Survey and from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Eibner and Evans (2005) report that in many cases, relative deprivation has a greater impact on health than a person’s absolute income, that high relative deprivation is related to an increased probability of smoking, and that relative deprivation is positively associated with cause-specific mortality, notably with deaths due to tobacco-related cancers and coronary heart diseases. Using longitudinal data for Sweden, Aberg Yngwe et al. (2012) find a significant association between relative deprivation and premature mortality. Using data on deaths by suicide in the United States to identify the importance of interpersonal comparisons and “relative status,” Daly et al. (2013) find compelling evidence that individuals care not only about their own income but also about the income of others in their local area: Daly et al. show that individual suicide risk rises with others’ income. This finding was obtained using two separate and independent data sets, suggesting that it is not the product of a particular sample design of either data set. (The finding is robust to alternative specifications and cannot be explained by geographical variation in suicide classification, cost of living, or access to emergency medical care.) The finding is consistent with the idea that relative deprivation, rather than a person’s absolute income, matters for wellbeing, and that the stress it causes can be severe enough to make people take their own life. Drawing on data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Balsa et al. (2014) find that relative deprivation is positively associated with substance abuse (heavy drinking and smoking) in adolescent males. Based on data from several countries, Beshai et al. (2017) find that stress arising from relative deprivation significantly predicts functional disorder symptoms such as fibromyalgia and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Gero et al. (2020, p. 665) find that in Japan “increased relative income deprivation [is] associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality independently of absolute income.”====The Daly et al. (2013) and Balsa et al.

In this study, I use administrative register data to provide a detailed picture of the financial situation of people with SMI in Sweden during a period of ","Schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and major depressive disorders are severe mental illnesses (SMIs) considered to be among the top-ten leading causes of disability in terms of years of healthy life lost due to disability (World Health Organization, 2001),==== and a large number of cost-of-illness studies have reported immense societal costs (e.g., Löthgren, 2004a, Löthgren, 2004b, Andlin-Sobocki and Wittchen, 2005, Fajutrao et al., 2009, Jin and McCrone, 2015, Chong et al., 2016, Jin and Mosweu, 2017, Coretti et al., 2019).==== These costs are mainly related to productivity losses and it is well documented that the employment rate of individuals with SMI is well below that of the general population (e.g., Marwaha and Johnson, 2004, Marwaha et al., 2013, Evensen et al., 2016, Hakulinen et al., 2019a). Not only do people with SMI face considerable persistent barriers to employment due to the chronic or recurrent nature of the disorders, but also due to stigmatising views of employers, educational disadvantage, etc.====Hence, that people with SMI experience a difficult employment situation is a stylised fact, but the exact implications for their own financial situation are not fully established. A few previous studies (e.g., Falk et al., 2016, Topor et al., 2019, Hastrup et al., 2020, Hakulinen et al., 2019a, Hakulinen et al., 2020) have documented the financial situation – in terms of earnings, social transfers, or total income – among people with first-time diagnosis of various SMIs. However, no single study has provided a comprehensive picture of the financial situation (i.e., including earnings, social transfers, and total income) of people with first-time diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, or major depressive disorders in a unified framework. The objective of the present study is to fill this gap in the literature by using administrative register data to provide a detailed picture of the financial situation – in terms of earnings, social transfers, and total income – of people with SMI in Sweden during ±10 years surrounding first-time hospital in-patient diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and major depressive disorders. The inclusion of social transfers and total income, not only earnings, is important given that a considerable percentage of people with SMI are unlikely to earn their own living. Hence, social transfers have also been disaggregated into sickness, disability, and unemployment insurance, as well as means-tested social assistance.====Previous studies have provided estimates of the average financial situation of people with SMI, but no study is likely to have provided unbiased estimates of the counterfactual case; that is, their financial situation had they not become ill. Although the onset of a psychiatric disorder is likely to weaken the position on the labour market and worsen the financial situation, the reverse is also true (Paul and Moser, 2009). Hence, there is a situation of causal pathways going in both directions, which are difficult to isolate. In addition, there are factors, typically unobserved to the researcher, that independently affect both individuals’ likelihood to become ill and their labour market situation, which leads to selection, or omitted variable, bias. Poor cognitive ability and substance use are prominent examples of such factors. What complicates the situation further is that the onset of disease cannot be observed with certainty but only when a particular diagnosis is received for the first time in psychiatric in-patient care. There are several reasons to believe that, in at least some cases, the onset of disease may have occurred much earlier. The approach taken here is rather pragmatic: Even though it may not be possible to estimate an unbiased causal effect of becoming severely mentally ill, that is not to say that we cannot, or should not, ask how the financial situation of people with SMI evolves, surrounding their first-time diagnosis of these disorders, in comparison to individuals that do not have such a diagnosis but are comparable in other dimensions. I attempt to answer this question using exact covariate matching, i.e., matching of each individual with any of the psychiatric diagnoses to a number of individuals discordant to that particular group of disorders but with the same (arguably) pre-determined sociodemographic characteristics. These matched individuals are not likely to provide an accurate measure of the counterfactual case of becoming severely mentally ill and receive an in-patient diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, or major depressive disorders, but I will nevertheless argue that they serve as informative contrasts.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, I give a very brief account of the three categories of psychiatric disorders, followed by an equally brief review of related studies. In Section 3, the data are introduced, including definitions of study populations and outcome measures. In the same section, the empirical strategy is described. This section concludes with summary statistics of the samples. In Section 4, the results are presented. These include comparisons of the trajectories of various income measures (i.e., mainly earnings, total social transfers, and total income, but also sickness, disability, and unemployment insurance, as well as means-tested social assistance) between those diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, or major depressive disorders and (to some extent) comparable individuals (i.e., individuals with the same basic pre-determined sociodemographic characteristics) without such diagnosis. Moreover, also the results from four supplementary analyses are presented: The first analysis quantifies to what extent the measure of first-time in-patient diagnosis of a particular disorder correspond to onset of the same disorder. The second analysis examines how sensitive the main results are to the presence of psychiatric comorbidity. The third analysis examines how sensitive the main results are to using a discordant sibling-pair approach instead of exact covariate matching. The fourth analysis gives a sense of the magnitude of the problem associated with attrition (here due only to premature death and emigration). In Section 5, the strengths and limitations of the study are discussed, and thereafter Section 6 concludes.","The financial situation before and after first-time psychiatric in-patient diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and major depressive disorder",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X23000126,1 February 2023,2023,Research Article,15.0

Furthermore, using evidence from past, pre-pandemic years, we argue that this positive, sizeable and significant association is somewhat specific to the Covid-19 pandemic.","This research enquires into the impact of intergenerational coresidence on the mortality from Covid-19.====A specific aspect of Covid-19, which is common across countries worldwide, is the fact that it is particularly deadly for older persons (====). For instance, as of February 10th 2021, persons aged 65 or more accounted for 81% of the overall number of deaths from Covid-19 in the United States (====).====, ====, ====, ====, among others). In this article, we argue that one aspect of the family structure, namely intergenerational coresidence – defined as families in which at least one elderly lives with at least one adult son/daughter – is relevant for the diffusion of, and the mortality from Covid-19.====, ====). This implies that coresiding elderly might have more indirect social contacts – i.e. social contacts through their family members – than non-coresiding ones. Second, since preventive measures like masks and social distance are typically not implemented in the household (====, ====), those indirect social contacts will be unprotected.==== All this suggests that intergenerational coresidence might foster contagion for the elderly. Since the fatality rate of Covid-19 is disproportionately huge for the elderly, we expect intergenerational coresidence to be associated with higher mortality, in particular for the elderly.====Using the available Census sample of 426 U.S. counties that represent 65% of the total American population in 2019, we show that intergenerational coresidence positively correlates with mortality for the elderly from Covid-19 in 2020. Quantitatively, a one percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence is associated with more than 25 additional deaths from Covid-19 per 100,000 old persons, or, in absolute terms, 14,109 old individuals.====This association is robust to controlling for several confounders, such as population density, ====In order to assess if the positive correlation with intergenerational coresidence is specific to mortality from the Covid-19 pandemic, we perform several other exercises. To start with, we show that intergenerational coresidence does not have a positive, sizeable and significant impact on the overall mortality rate in previous, non-pandemic years. We do so in two settings. First, in a cross-section analysis for 2019, that is more directly comparable to our benchmark. Second, in a balanced-panel of yearly data for 329 U.S. counties from 2005 to 2019 that represents 56% of the American population in 2019.====Our paper is closely related to the brand new literature on Covid-19 and intergenerational coresidence. The socio-economic determinants of intergenerational coresidence have been discussed by ====, ==== and, more recently, ====, ====, ====, ====, among others. ==== expand on their study by using a larger sample represented by 79 geographical units (E.U. countries and U.S. states). They show that there is a positive association between the fraction of young adults living with their parents and the cumulative number of deaths from Covid-19. In their analysis, this association is arguably stronger and more significant when the E.U. countries are excluded from the sample and the analysis is restricted to the U.S. states only. That intergenerational coresidence does not seem to be an important determinant of case fatality rates in the European Union is maintained also by ====.==== analyse cross-country variation in the E.U. cumulative deaths between March and April 2020 and find that it is positively associated with social and/or cultural ties, including intergenerational coresidence, the average household size and the proportion of people having frequent social contacts.====Cross-country comparisons suffer from several known problems, going from how mortality and contagion are measured, to idiosyncratic differences like policy, culture, institutions and the like, to the trivial but significant complication represented by the reduced size of the sample. A first contribution of our paper is to overcome these problems by focusing on a more disaggregated geographical unit, the county, belonging to a single country, the United States. This way we reduce the heterogeneity of confounding factors that may pollute cross-country analysis, and avoid the small sample bias that makes results from a cross-state analysis in the United States less compelling.==== A similar approach was followed by ====.====A second contribution of this paper is to use past, pre-pandemic years to show that the positive correlation between mortality and intergenerational coresidence is somewhat specific to the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we do not fully venture into causal inference, we interpret this as a kind of ==== test suggesting that the positive correlation we find is not a statistical artefact.====The outburst of Covid-19 has determined a renewal of interest for the economics of pandemics. As stressed by ====, ====, ====, ====, ==== and the papers in the special 2021 issue on the economics of epidemics in the ==== surveyed by ====. Although we do not contribute explicitly to this literature, our work suggests that successful integrated models should take the family structure into account.====Understanding the interplay between family structure and a pandemic episode might have significant policy implications. For instance, our work is relevant in the debate brought about by the ==== in October 2020 on the “focused protection” of the elderly. In the light of our results, age-targeted lockdowns, as proposed for instance by ==== to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, might be more or less effective depending on the degree of intergenerational coresidence.====On the whole, our work suggests that the explicit consideration of family structure might result in more accurate economic and epidemiological models of pandemics, thereby contributing to better inform policy decisions.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section ====, we provide a theoretical discussion of the link between intergenerational coresidence and mortality, explaining the specificity of Covid-19. In Section ====, we present our empirical analysis on Covid-19. In Section ====, we discuss the relationship between intergenerational coresidence and all-causes and cause-specific mortality in past, pre-pandemic years.

To identify the causal effect, we exploit ventilation coefficient as the instrument for urban air pollution. We find that a 10 μg/m==== increase in annual PM","Air pollution continues to plague the developing countries, such as China and India, and imposes both health and economic burden on billions of people living in regions with air quality lower than the safety standards set by the World Health Organization. For example, the recent report ====, released by Heath Effects Institute, notes that in 2019 nearly 476,000 neonates die prematurely of air pollution within the first month after birth, most of whom are from the developing countries. Yin et al. (2020) estimate that in 2017 nearly 124 million deaths in China could be attributed to PM====, an ambient fine particulate pollutant less than 2.5 µm in size.====The documented evidence of mortality due to air pollution, included in Yin et al. (2020), is mainly from the epidemiological literature. A number of studies in epidemiology have documented strong negative correlation between air pollution and birth outcomes with time-series analyses and cross-sectional studies or cohort-based studies (Karimi and Shokrinezhad, 2020). Yet the associations obtained from epidemiologic literature most likely suffer from endogeneity issues, resulting from people’s avoidance behavior to protect themselves or omitted variables that cofounding with both air quality and health outcome. Economic studies play a distinct but complementary role in investigating the effects of air pollution on newborns. To identify the causal relationship between relationship between air pollution and health outcomes such as infant mortality, economists in general use a panel data model with location fixed effects or individual fixed effect or exploit exogenous sources of variation that mimic randomized controlled trial (RCT).====The economic literature has produced plenty of studies uncovering the causal effect of air on child heath, and most of the research on this issue comes from the US (Chay and Greenstone, 2003, Currie and Neidell, 2005, Currie and Walker, 2011, Currie et al., 2009, Knittel et al., 2016, Lleras-Muney, 2010) and a few other industrialized countries (Coneus and Spiess, 2012, Inoue et al., 2020, Lavaine and Neidell, 2017, Lee et al., 2018, Luechinger, 2014). An emerging literature has turned the attention to the developing countries, including Indonesia (Chakrabarti, 2021, Jayachandran, 2009), Mexico (Arceo et al., 2015, Gutierrez, 2015), Turkey (Cesur et al., 2017), India (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014, Sankar et al., 2020) and sub-Saharan African countries (Pongou, 2013, Pongou et al., 2017). However, there is little evidence from China on the examination of air pollution’s effect on infant mortality. The existing studies in the context of China mainly focus on the effect of air pollution on cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and respiratory diseases (Chen et al., 2018, Fan et al., 2020, He et al., 2016) or life expectancy (Chen et al., 2013, Ebenstein et al., 2017).====The studies on the adverse effect of air pollution on infant mortality of China is scant. The only exception is Tanaka (2015), which exploits the exogenous change of environmental regulation throughout China to identify the causal relationship between air pollution and infant mortality indirectly and the sample is very limited. The studies for other countries, including Arceo et al. (2015) and Burnett et al. (2018), acknowledge the non-linear dose-response relationship between air pollution and health, which means that the magnitude of hazard on infant survival rate induced by air pollution may vary at different levels. Estimates derived from the countries with much cleaner air and high incomes, may not be a proper reference when estimating the health effects of air pollution in China, which is one of main focuses in this paper. Our study estimates the marginal adverse health effects of air pollution on the newborns in China, using the city-level panel data. Our findings provide new empirical evidence to the related literature.====We are the first to compile a child mortality (unbalanced) panel dataset for 288 prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2015, based on hundreds of scattered, high-quality official and academic sources. We employ the two-way fixed effect model to estimate the causal effect of air pollution on child mortality using ventilation coefficient as the instrumental variable for air pollution. We find that a 1 μg/m³ increase in the annual average PM==== concentration leads to 0.163 point increase in the mortality rates of infant, implying a pollution elasticity of 0.83; while no solid evidence of such negative effect is found on the child mortality (1–4 years of age).

Some countries (among others, in Europe, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain) adopted austerity policies and made large cuts to public spending, especially for healthcare.====An extensive literature has examined changes in health outcomes subsequent to the GR and cuts to healthcare spending. Some of the papers perform a systematic literature review (Suhrcke et al., 2011, Quaglio et al., 2013, Stuckler et al., 2017) or contribute to the general discussion by reviewing the background to the crisis (McKee et al., 2012, Arie, 2013b, Arie, 2013a, Karanikolos et al., 2013, Quaglio et al., 2013, Kentikelenis et al., 2014) and assessing how austerity measures have affected population’s health and access to public health services (Karanikolos et al., 2013, Quaglio et al., 2013, Kentikelenis et al., 2014) or analysing the association between austerity measures and mortality rate (Toffolutti and Suhrcke, 2019), suicides (De Vogli et al., 2013) or potential years of life lost (Almendra et al., 2019, Watkins et al., 2017). Others explicitly identify a causal framework to explore whether the GR and subsequent cuts to healthcare spending worsened health outcomes, such as general mortality rate (Franklin et al., 2017, Golinelli et al., 2017, Depalo, 2019, Lomas et al., 2019, Arcà et al., 2020, Bordignon et al., 2020, Borra et al., 2020); suicides (Branas et al., 2015, Franklin et al., 2017); road traffic injuries (Franklin et al., 2017); infant mortality rate (Franklin et al., 2017, Bordignon et al., 2020); stillbirths (Vlachadis and Kornarou, 2013); life expectancy (Franklin et al., 2017, Vallejo-Torres et al., 2018); mortality rate by specific causes, such as heart and liver diseases (Franklin et al., 2017), respiratory diseases (Franklin et al., 2017), alcohol and drug mortality due to misuse/abuse (Stuckler et al., 2009a, Franklin et al., 2017) and infectious diseases such as HIV (Franklin et al., 2017).====To identify causal effects, some of these studies use national data (Vlachadis and Kornarou, 2013), others exploit cross-national variation (Stuckler et al., 2009a, Franklin et al., 2017). As regional data have the advantage of relying on less heterogeneous measurements than national and cross-national data, a number of studies have used regional panel data (Golinelli et al., 2017, Vallejo-Torres et al., 2018, Depalo, 2019, Lomas et al., 2019, Arcà et al., 2020, Bordignon et al., 2020, Borra et al., 2020). These studies either adopt fixed effects (FE) models to explain variation in health outcomes with a large number of explanatory variables (Golinelli et al., 2017, Borra et al., 2020) or combine an instrumental variable (IV) approach with a two-way FE model (Vallejo-Torres et al., 2018, Lomas et al., 2019, Arcà et al., 2020) or a difference-in-differences (DID) model (Bordignon et al., 2020) to control for time-varying heterogeneity and deal with the endogeneity deriving from it. While Vallejo-Torres et al. (2018) and Lomas et al. (2019) use the percentage of total expenditure assigned to health in each region/authority as an IV, Arcà et al. (2020) use an IV that exploits the temporal and geographical variation induced by the Italian austerity policy ==== (PdR) (Ministero della Salute, 2021). Finally, in order to control for potential biases associated to pre-trend characteristics that may have affected enrolment in the austerity programme, Bordignon et al. (2020) use the percentage of citizens in each region complaining for the presence of waste in city streets in 2005 as an IV to generate exogenous variation in selected regions subject to the austerity policy.====To the best of our knowledge, for Italy evidence of the effects of austerity measures on health and healthcare is provided by Golinelli et al. (2017), Depalo (2019), Arcà et al. (2020) and Bordignon et al. (2020). Golinelli et al. (2017) and Arcà et al. (2020) both address the relationship between healthcare spending and mortality. Golinelli et al. (2017) run a FE regression model on a panel of 15 years (1999–2013) for 20 Italian regions in an attempt to explain to what extent public healthcare expenditure is related to the total mortality rate. Their results show that higher spending on directly provided services is associated with a lower general mortality rate, while other expenditure variables are not significantly associated with the general mortality rate. Arcà et al. (2020) instead exploit the PdR reform as an instrument in identifying the spending effect on avoidable mortality in a two-way fixed effects (FE) approach on a panel of 11 years (2004–2014) for 20 Italian regions. Their results show that PdR leads to a reduction in healthcare spending, which in turn increases the avoidable mortality rate. Depalo (2019) applies a bounds inference method to estimate the causal effects of the PdR reform on total mortality rate and hospitalisation rate in the period 2007–2012 and finds a decrease in mortality rate and an increase in hospitalisation rate, but only in some regions. Finally, Bordignon et al. (2020) estimate the effect of the PdR reform on healthcare spending, healthcare supply, use of healthcare services, health outcomes, patients’ satisfaction. Using an IV-DID approach on a panel of 15 years (2000–2014) for 15 Italian regions, they do not find any significant effects on health care utilisation and citizens’ health.====It is evident that austerity measures have affected healthcare, health and social well-being, but views differ as to how (Appleby et al., 2015) and some results (e.g., on general mortality rate) appear to be contradictory, with some authors claiming that health effects have been “overly exaggerated” (Tapia Granados and Rodriguez, 2015). A possible explanation of such conflicting results is offered by Franklin et al. (2017) and Atella et al. (2018). Many European countries undertook structural long-term changes to their health systems to contain costs in the short term (Franklin et al., 2017 p. 41). As individual responses to these changes take time to emerge, it is only during prolonged exposure to healthcare cuts, as it was during the GR, that individual health deteriorates and individuals are more likely to be affected by a disease, which could potentially translate into death in the long-term (Atella et al., 2018 p.5). Moreover, while financial or economic data are available with a short delay, epidemiological data such as those related to morbidity and mortality can only be collected with an intrinsic delay (de Belvis et al., 2012). Therefore, articles published in the years immediately following the GR or using data very close to the beginning of the GR may not be able to detect these responses.====Our paper departs from this issue and enlarges the existing literature on the health effects of austerity measures in several directions, by analysing the indirect effects of the PdR programme on the human organism at population level.====From a methodological perspective, we exploit the staggered adoption of the PdR programme to assess its impact on health outcomes (as in Depalo (2019), Arcà et al. (2020) and Bordignon et al. (2020). However, as the exposure to the PdR programme is not random but dictated by the degree of budgetary deficits incurred by a region, enrolment in the austerity programme may be endogenous and estimates based on a standard FE approach may be biased. We thus combine an IV approach with a two-way FE model to control for this potential endogeneity (as in Arcà et al. (2020).====From an health outcome perspective, we expand the empirical literature and study the effects of the PdR programme not only on general mortality rates (as in Depalo (2019) and Bordignon et al. (2020)), but also on amenable and preventable mortality rates. Among Depalo, 2019, Arcà et al., 2020 and Bordignon et al. (2020), only Arcà et al. (2020) focus on amenable mortality rates, but none of the cited contributions analyses preventable mortality rates. According to Eurostat (2018), a death can be considered as amenable if it could have been avoided through optimal quality health care, while the concept of preventable deaths includes deaths which could have been avoided by public health interventions focusing on wider determinants of public health, such as behaviour and lifestyle factors, socioeconomic status and environmental factors. As it is evident from the international literature review, the GR has not only pauperised the quality of the healthcare systems through cuts to healthcare spending (that would justify an analysis of amenable mortality rates), but has also resized lifestyle and impoverished socioeconomic status (that would justify an analysis of preventable mortality rates). A complete analysis of the effects of the GR requires therefore to investigate both amenable and preventable mortality rates. Specifically, among the causes of amenable mortality (similarly to Arcà et al. (2020)), we account for disaggregated disease-specific mortality rates, such as cancer mortality rates, respiratory or heart disease mortality rates, as during recessions adverse effects on vulnerable groups in the population (e.g., people affected by heart diseases) might be masked by improvements in another group (e.g., people affected by cancer) (Karanikolos et al., 2013). Among the causes of preventable mortality, analysed for the first time for Italy to the best of our knowledge, we account for suicide rates, murder rates and road traffic injuries, linked to psychotic behaviours and depressive conditions peculiar to economic recessions (Karanikolos et al., 2013, Kentikelenis et al., 2014). In addition, we complete our analysis with mortality rates by age groups (partly, similarly to Bordignon et al. (2020) who analyse infant mortality rates), such as potential years of life lost (PYLL, as far as we know, never used before in this literature for Italy), an explicit measure of premature death that assigns more weight to injuries and infectious diseases; on morbidity, measured as the incidence of the infectious disease; and on the use of health services, measured as HIV discharge rates and discharge rates for psychological diseases, both used to gauge psychological fragility and social distress.====Using a two-way IV-FE model on the panel of 21 Italian regions (19 regions plus 2 autonomous provinces) observed for 17 years (1999–2015), we find that enrolment in the austerity programme PdR negatively affects both physical and social distress. The PdR programme leads to an increase in general mortality rate, suicide rate, PYLL, the mortality rate associated with cancer and heart diseases; to an increase in the incidence of measles and chickenpox, but a decrease in the incidence of aids/HIV; to an increase in discharge rate due to psychological diseases, but a decrease in discharge rate due to HIV.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

To investigate these complex links, studies have often used survey data that combine information on social and economic circumstances with self-reported health measures. This is mostly due to the limited availability of datasets that combine more objective health measures with a wide range of socioeconomic data, along with the simplicity that self-reported health measures may offer. Among self-reported health measures, self-assessed health (SAH) is widely used in economics (e.g., Aoki and Santiago, 2018; Contoyannis and Jones, 2004; Contoyannis et al., 2004; Currie et al., 2015; García-Gómez et al., 2010; Johnson, 2010; van Doorslaer et al., 2000), and in social research (e.g., Monden, 2010; Monk, 2015). Moreover, SAH measures are commonly used in epidemiological and medical research where an association with mortality has been demonstrated (e.g., Jylhä, 2009; Kaplan and Camacho, 1983; Kunst et al., 2004; Mossey and Shapiro, 1982; Hu et al., 2016).====Studies have sought a better understanding of the extent to which SAH can be interpreted as a good proxy of underlying health between respondents of different socioeconomic backgrounds and in general (e.g., Au and Johnston, 2014; Bago d′Uva et al., 2008; Dowd and Zajacova, 2010; Etilé and Milcent, 2006; Lindeboom and van Doorslaer, 2004). A related issue to whether or not SAH is a good proxy of people’s health is the reliability of SAH it terms of consistency to responses to SAH questions from the same individuals in a short time interval where genuine changes in people’s health are not practically feasible. For example, a reliable proxy of people’s health measure should be consistent in the case of repeated collection of the same measure when people’s actual health doesn’t change – i.e., in the context of our research, there should be consistency in responses to SAH within the same interview.====A short literature has tested the consistency of responses to SAH questions, by comparing repeated SAH questions for the same individuals collected over a short time (e.g., Black et al., 2017, Black et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021; Clarke and Ryan, 2006; Crossley and Kennedy, 2002). Differences in capacity to respond to survey questions or in reporting behaviour may depend on respondents’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills, which may explain why some individuals tend to provide inconsistent response about their self-assessed health and others do not (Black, Johnston, Shields, Suziedelyte, 2017). Moreover, individuals may respond inconsistently because they assess their health with some uncertainty or they have “learned” more about their health status because of the other questions that are asked between the first and the second SAH questions ─ for example, specific health or disability questions can influence subsequent responses about people’s health status (Black et al., 2017, Black et al., 2017, Clarke and Ryan, 2006, Crossley and Kennedy, 2002).==== Strategic reporting may be another reason of reporting inconsistency ─ for example, the broader literature on measurement error in well-being indicators argues that individuals may exhibit a ""justification bias"" when they overstate their poor health condition in order to rationalize their economic inactivity (e.g.,Black, Johnston, Suziedelyte, 2017; Bound, 1991; Kapteyn et al., 2007; Kerkhofs and Lindeboom, 1995). Mode of data collection may be relevant here; some of the existing literature has argued that self-completion, as opposed to open interview, mode may be more reliable in eliciting accurate responses to sensitive questions especially in the presence of other household members (e.g., Conti and Pudney, 2011).====The few studies that test the consistency of responses to SAH questions, and estimate misclassification by assessing repeated SAH questions for the same individuals over a short time frame, mainly use Australian data (Black et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2021, Clarke and Ryan, 2006, Crossley and Kennedy, 2002). These studies often compare responses from SAH questions with different wording and/or SAH measures that are asked within a wider time window (up to 30 days) rather than within the time window allowed at the same household interview (Black et al., 2017, Clarke and Ryan, 2006). For instance, a wider time window between SAH questions may introduce time-varying unobservable influences which may affect actual people’s health and/or affect people’s responses revising their responses regardless of whether or not their actual health may have changed. Consequently, comparisons of repeated SAH questions collected after a wide time interval may produce misleading results and uncertainty on whether or not this is driven by changes of peoples actual underlying health. In our study, respondents report their SAH using different collection modes in a short time window within the same UKHLS wave. Furthermore, often these studies are based on cross-sectional data and even when longitudinal data on duplicate responses to different SAH questions within each wave is available, they are often based on unequally spaced panels, which may limit analysis of persistent patterns in inconsistency SAH reporting behaviour (Black et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2021, Clarke and Ryan, 2006, Crossley and Kennedy, 2002).====Moreover, none of these studies have used more objectively measured health indicators, such as nurse-administered and blood-based biomarker data, and do not analyse whether individuals’ biological health status is reflected differently across the two SAH measured administered using different survey modes (open interview and self-completion). Particularly, the scope of this approach is to validate individual responses to SAH questions from different interview modes by using measures of biomarkers as proxies of people’s true underlying health regarding certain dimensions. Biomarkers are objective health measures that not only capture pathogenic processes but also reflect clinical condition and pre-symptomatic perception of individuals (Colburn et al., 2001). Some biomarkers (e.g., obesity) may capture conditions that are more visible than others (e.g., cholesterol), which may be associated with different response for the same SAH question from different modes of collection. For instance, social desirability, i.e., when respondents tend to take social norms into account in the case that interviews involve social interactions that is more likely to happen in the open-interview mode (Bowling, 2005), may be a driving force behind potential differences in the association between more objective measures of health and reporting behaviour to SAH questions by mode of administration if people face a more visible health condition.====Our paper contributes to this literature in a number of ways. We capitalise on the rare opportunity provided by UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) which asks respondents the same SAH question with identical wording twice (one with a self-completion mode and one with an open interview mode), mainly within the same household interview at UKHLS Waves 2, 3, 4 and 5.==== Descriptive analysis of the data show considerable inconsistency in reporting of the SAH questions within each wave. We estimate multivariate models to explore the profile of those individuals who reported inconsistently to SAH questions between the open interview and the self-completion mode within each UKHLS wave.====Second, we implement analysis to explore the frequency of reporting inconsistencies. Specifically, we study inconsistent reporting within a time frame that does not justify changes in their actual health status. Although these results do not provide guidance on whether the self-completed or the open interview mode provides more reliable SAH measures, they do provide evidence on whether the observed patterns are systematic and persistent.==== It should be noted that in this paper we do not aim to disentangle any potential role of true state dependence (if any), i.e., that inconsistent response to the two SAH questions in the past may have a structural impact on the probability of inconsistent SAH responses in the future, from spurious state dependence, which may be attributed to time invariant (or serially correlated) individual-level characteristics, in explaining the observed persistence. Besides, unlike Chen et al. (2021), our paper does not aim to assess which of the two SAH measures (the self-completion versus the open interview) is more accurate or the type and incidence of response errors associated with each of the two measures. The results suggest that reporting inconsistencies are a systematic behaviour that repeats over time for certain population groups. Non-random measurement error in SAH, that is associated with socioeconomic variables, may contaminate existing research using SAH measures as outcome or explanatory covariate.====Third, the richness of our data allows us to use a detailed set of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, cognitive and noncognitive skills as well as proxies of the micro-social environment during the household interview, such as the presence of other adults or children. The nature of the questionnaire content within the two SAH questions does not allow us to explore whether any potential “learning” effects, or “justification biases” may explain the observed inconsistencies in SAH within each wave.==== Instead, our analysis allows us to identify the profile of those who are more likely to report SAH inconsistently as well as those who repeat this inconsistent reporting SAH behaviour most frequently. Investigating the frequency of inconsistent responses help us to characterise the profile of those individuals who reported SAH without consistency more persistently. The latter suggests that reporting inconsistencies are a systematic behaviour that repeated over time for certain population groups and not simply a snapshot of a certain time (when focusing on modelling the probability of reporting SAH inconsistently at a particular wave). Our results show that the same individual profile that predicts the probability of inconsistent response to SAH questions also explain the high frequency of inconsistent responses. The potential implications of this measurement error are relevant when SAH is used as an outcome of interest.====Many datasets collect SAH measures, and researchers may pay limited attention to the collection mode (self-completion as opposed to open interview). SAH data have been routinely collected in many datasets, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) in the UK. For example, SAH measures are collected using an open interview mode in the case of both the NHANES and the BHPS; however, most existing studies do not explicitly consider the potential implications of the SAH collection mode and the survey design for the SAH collection on their analysis (e.g., Contoyannis et al., 2004; Fichera and Gathergood, 2016; Li Donni et al., 2014). Often, even when multiple measures of SAH questions with the same or similar wording are available in a dataset (at least for some waves, such as in the case of HILDA in Australia, NHANES in the USA, and UKHLS in the UK), researchers do not use all available information and often consider responses to a particular SAH question despite concerns about the consistency of responses within repeated SAH questions (e.g., Au and Johnston, 2014; Davillas et al., 2019; Nesson and Robinson, 2019). If socioeconomic status (SES) plays an important role for reporting of SAH collected with different interview modes (self-completion versus the open interview),==== this may be a concern for the robustness of the existing studies that use SAH as an outcome and where measurement error is part of the error structure of the SAH regression models.====We provide evidence on whether the SAH interview mode affects results for the income-health gradient ─ a popular topic in the socioeconomic determinants of health literature, where self-reported health measures are often used as health outcomes (e.g., Davillas et al., 2019; Foverskov and Holm, 2016; Fuchs, 2004; Frijters et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2009; Larrimore, 2011; Ziebarth, 2010). Separate linear regression models on household income are estimated using the self-completion and the open-interview SAH measures as outcome. The analysis of income-health gradient is an attempt to shed light on the role of the mode of collection. Assuming that the parameter of interest is estimated with measurement error in both specifications, part of the potential difference between gradients should be attributed to the mode of SAH collection. The reason is that unobserved reporting behaviour depend on the interview mode (see List et al., 2004). Despite the implications of measurement error in both linear regression models, the absence of differences suggests that the interview mode plays little role in the income-health gradient.====Finally, we use a detailed set of nurse-collected blood-based biomarker data. Unlike the self-reported health measures, biomarkers are more objective health measures and, beyond pathogenic cases, they also provide information on pre-disease stages that may be below clinical diagnosis thresholds. Certain dimensions of physiological and biological health may be reflected more strongly in responses to SAH self-completion questions as opposed to the open interview mode. Individuals without visible health conditions (e.g., obesity) may strategically report their health status in the open interview mode (see Black et al., 2017, Black et al., 2017), while the self-completion mode may lead them to provide more reliable or honest responses to sensitive survey questions such as their health status (see List et al., 2004). Moreover, the presence of interviewer in the open interview mode can trigger a general “put on a good show for the visitor” effect, which may lead respondents to overstate their true health status relative to the more private self-completion interview mode (see Conti and Pudney, 2011).====Testing whether the relationship between SAH and biomarkers differs depending on the interview mode contributes to the literature on better understanding SAH as a health outcome (e.g., Au and Johnston, 2014; Jylhä, 2009). A finding that different dimensions of health have differing patterns of association with the two SAH measures may explain why econometric results may differ between the open interview and self-completion SAH measures they are used as outcomes or explanatory variables. On the other hand, if there are no differences, other mechanisms on how individuals translate and report their actual health using SAH measures may be relevant (Jylhä, 2009).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and describes the UKHLS dataset. Section 3 presents our econometric methods. Analysis of the observed inconsistent responses to SAH questions over time and the relevant longitudinal patterns are presented in Section 4. Multivariate analysis of the association between inconsistent reporting and socioeconomic factors as well as an analysis of the potential implications for measurement error in SAH for research on the income-health gradient are presented and discussed in Section 5.

Obesity rates among adults and children in the U.S. are at an all-time high at 42% among adults and 19% among children ages 2–18 years (Fryar et al., 2020, Hales et al., 2020). The thinking behind what drives obesity, and consequently how to address it, has evolved considerably over the last four decades. Obesity prevention efforts have shifted from their initial focus on individual-level factors, such as lifestyle choices, to place-based environmental factors. The shift was due, in part, to evidence of limited effectiveness of behavior modification interventions focused at the individual level (Minkler, 1999). Since then, a large literature has studied the role of place-based factors, such as built, social, economic and policy environments, on obesity and related behaviors (Diez Roux and Mair, 2010, Diez Roux, 2001, Arcaya et al., 2016, Tseng et al., 2018, Lam et al., 2021, Kim et al., 2019). However, this literature too has found limited effectiveness even among efforts to alter the built, policy, and economic environments through, for example, the introduction of supermarkets and green spaces, taxation of sugary beverages, or through other community- and school-based interventions (Dubowitz et al., 2015, Bleich et al., 2013, Lam et al., 2021, Mayne et al., 2015, Fletcher et al., 2010a, Fletcher et al., 2010b).====The apparent limited success of obesity prevention efforts may be attributed, at least in part, to two empirical challenges. First, our understanding of the causal effects of place-based environmental factors on obesity remains limited due to the methodological challenges resulting from self-selection of individuals into places. It is difficult to disentangle correlation from causation in observational data – an issue that has been highlighted most recently in surveys of the literature on place effects on health (Couillard et al., 2021, Deryugina and Molitor, 2021; Chyn and Katz, 2021). These surveys have highlighted a subset of studies that leverage movers to assess the causal effects of place, although they focus primarily on adults and non-health outcomes. Moreover, with the exception of the Moving to Opportunity housing mobility experiment, the concern regarding potential endogeneity of moving itself, and of moving to specific places, remains a hurdle in this literature.====The second challenge is that the focus on “one size fits all” strategies ignores potential heterogeneity in place effects on obesity. In other words, place-based factors may not influence all individuals equally and this heterogeneity may explain the small or null effects observed at the population level. Correlational studies suggest heterogeneity with respect to sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, race-ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. These studies often find stronger associations of place with obesity in females versus males but find few consistent patterns with respect to other socio-demographic characteristics (Tcymbal et al., 2020, Duncan et al., 2012, Kranjac et al., 2021, Kranjac et al., 2019, Daniels et al., 2021, Galvez et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2019, Jia et al., 2019). However, efforts to assess heterogeneity are absent from causal studies, and consequently, we have little understanding of how the effects of place might vary by individual. Identifying the sources of heterogeneity within a causal framework can offer insights into developing tailored interventions for obesity prevention instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.====In this paper, we assess whether time preferences represent an important source of heterogeneity in understanding the effect of place on obesity. Healthy behaviors typically involve intertemporal tradeoffs. For example, eating healthy often means forgoing tempting, unhealthy foods in lieu of more healthy options today, but the health benefits of such choices often accrue later in life. Indeed, research suggests that individuals who are more patient are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors and have better health outcomes, such as lower body mass index and/or obesity (Golsteyn et al., 2014; Seeyave et al., 2009; Courtemanche et al., 2015; Sirois, 2004). The intuition is that less patient individuals, who place relatively greater weight on immediate gratification, may be less likely to engage in the healthy choices offered in their environments because those choices provide largely delayed benefits. If time preferences influence how individuals respond to their environments, this may help explain more generally why interventions, programs and policies designed to increase healthy behaviors may not appear to be successful at the population level.====We use a natural experiment in combination with data on adolescents’ time preferences to assess heterogeneity in place effects on adolescent obesity. To our knowledge, this paper provides the first quasi-experimental evidence on this issue. Adolescence represents a particularly compelling age to study this question. It is a crucial stage for developing a sense of self and identity and their preferences, goals, motivations, and behaviors evolve towards independence and autonomy (Becht et al., 2016, Meeus et al., 2005). Further, adolescent obesity rates have quadrupled during the past thirty years, making the study of how to reduce adolescent obesity particularly policy-relevant (Ogden et al., 2014, NCHS, 2012).====To identify the causal effects of place on adolescent obesity, we leverage the plausibly exogenous assignment of military families to different locations. Specifically, we measure adolescents’ exposure to obesity-related environments using the obesity rate in the county where their military parent’s assigned installation is located. The county obesity rate (COR) is a summary, or realized, measure of all environmental influences on obesity in that county. We combine this natural experiment with data we collected on time preferences from adolescents using a validated survey scale. Taken together, these data provide novel empirical evidence on whether adolescents with less patient time preferences face a greater risk of obesity as a result of exposure to obesogenic environments relative to their more patient counterparts.====Our data come from the Military Teenagers Environments, Exercise and Nutrition Study (M-TEENS), a cohort study of adolescents in military families. In prior work, we analyzed baseline data from this cohort at ages 12–13 years and showed that adolescents in military families “assigned” to counties with higher obesity rates were more likely to be overweight or obese, although this effect was small (Datar and Nicosia, 2018). In a related study with the same baseline data, we also found that some environmental features, specifically the neighborhood food environment, were unrelated to adolescents’ dietary behaviors or BMI (Shier et al., 2016), suggesting that food environments may not matter for obesity prevention. One explanation for these small and null effects, both in our studies and in the literature more broadly, is that average effects may mask heterogeneity. Therefore, we examine heterogeneity on the basis of time preferences using newly-collected data from the same cohort in a subsequent wave.====Our results indicate that the adverse impacts of obesogenic environments are amplified for less patient adolescents. On average, a 10 percentage point increase in the obesity rate of the installation county is associated with a 5 percentage point higher probability of being obese. As predicted, this effect is larger among adolescents with less patient time preferences despite their higher underlying rates of obesity relative to more patient adolescents. Specifically, the estimated effect is 7 percentage points for adolescents at the 25th percentile of the time preference distribution (36% increase, given 19% obesity in this group). In comparison, the corresponding estimated effect is only 2 percentage points for those at the 75th percentile of the time preference distribution (25% increase, given 8% obesity in this group). In fact, patience almost completely offsets the adverse effects of obesogenic environments for adolescents near the 90th percentile of the time preference score distribution. These findings are robust to several sensitivity analyses, including alternate measures of exposure to obesogenic environments, instrumental variables estimation, and corrections for bias in self-reports of height and weight. Finally, in exploratory analyses decomposing the overall place effects into those attributable to the built, social and economic environments separately suggest that heterogeneity based on time-preferences may be strongest for place-based features relating to the built environment.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literatures, including neighborhood effects on obesity, and the link between time preferences and health.

Robust empirical research to either refute or confirm these concerns, however, is lacking. To evaluate the causal impact of lockdowns on fertility, we exploited a large sample of Australians (aged 18–45) from a nationally representative household panel survey and leveraged variation from a unique natural experiment that occurred in Australia in 2020: a lockdown imposed in the state of Victoria, but not elsewhere in Australia. Difference-in-differences models were estimated comparing changes in fertility intentions of persons who resided in Victoria during lockdown, or within four weeks of the lockdown being lifted, and those living elsewhere in Australia. Results revealed a significantly larger decline in reported intentions of having another child among women who lived through the protracted lockdown. The average effect was small, with fertility intentions estimated to fall by between 2.8% and 4.3% of the pre-pandemic mean. This negative effect was, however, more pronounced among those aged over 35 years, the less educated, and those employed on fixed-term contracts. Impacts on men’s fertility intentions were generally negligible, but with a notable exception being Indigenous Australians.","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of human life. There are the obvious health impacts, reflected in more than 400 million persons infected and around 6 million deaths world-wide over the first two years following the initial outbreak. However, the impact of the pandemic extends well beyond mortality and morbidity, with a large body of research documenting impacts on, among other things, mental health (====), body weight (====), educational achievement (====), employment and job security (====, ====; ====, ====), loneliness (====, ====), and domestic violence (====). Another outcome that may have been affected by the pandemic is fertility (====, ====), with findings from survey-based research reporting evidence that many fertile people delayed or ceased trying to have children because of the pandemic (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====). This is potentially of large significance given predictions that health pandemics will become more frequent in the future (====).====The existing evidence on the relationship between the COVID-19 and fertility or fertility plans is, however, far from convincing. Most of the studies cited above involved small convenience samples, and all employed cross-sectional designs where respondents were asked how fertility plans had changed because of the pandemic. Responses may thus be affected both by recall bias and priming. Very differently, while there is evidence of an acceleration in the long-term decline in fertility rates in high-income countries beginning late 2020 (====), this pattern did not apply to all countries and the decline was only statistically significant in a minority.====).====While the channels through which the pandemic might influence fertility are numerous and varied (====). Increased economic uncertainty (especially when accompanied by job loss), school closures and reduced access to child care (both formal and informal), for example, are all factors that would have placed families under greater strain and potentially adversely affected couple functioning. For some families, and especially those with young children, lockdowns increased the amount of household labor and care work, with typically more of the burden falling on the women in those families (====, ====, ====). Working in the other direction, lockdowns, and more specifically stay-at-home orders, by leading couples to spend more time together, could have strengthened relationships (====).====). This study, however, is notable for its quasi-experimental design, which, by exploiting cross-country and (in the case of the USA) cross-state differences in the timing of lockdowns, was able to derive estimates of the impact of lockdown that could be defended as causal.====Our study also involves a quasi-experimental design, but where the outcome is a more direct indicator of fertility plans – the expected likelihood of having another child. We exploit household panel survey data collected in Australia in the second half of 2020 when residents of one state of Australia – Victoria – were subject to a highly restrictive lockdown involving curfews and compulsory stay-at-home orders for all but essential workers. We estimate difference-in-differences (DiD) models to test whether and how much the lockdown changed fertility intentions. A feature of our experimental setting is that there was an extremely low incidence of COVID-19 infection in Australia during 2020. The nexus between the introduction of lockdowns and very high ==== rates of COVID-19 cases was therefore weaker in Australia than in most other countries, and thus we can be more confident that our estimates reflect the impact of lockdowns rather than some other channel, such as the health effects of the virus.====We also test whether the impact of lockdown on fertility intentions varies with selected individual characteristics. As already discussed, it is generally believed that women, and especially mothers, bore much of the increased care burden associated with lockdown and thus impacts on fertility plans might differ between men and women and, among women, between mothers and the childless. Slightly differently, we also examine whether impacts vary with household income, education, employment status, age, race, and immigrant status, given the economic hardship associated with lockdowns are often thought to have had greater impacts on the most economically vulnerable (e.g., ====; ====).====This study contributes to the emerging pandemic literature in two major ways. First, it provides new empirical evidence about whether and how much policy responses to the pandemic (as distinct from fears about contracting the virus) dampened intentions to have children. Second, by examining the differential fertility impact of lockdowns on different socioeconomic and demographic groups, our study uncovers whether lockdowns have generated a change in ‘who’ may have children in the future, and in particular whether such a shift is more pronounced among disadvantaged populations.====.",The impact of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility intentions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X22001101,19 December 2022,2022,Research Article,21.0

Accounting for income endogeneity in the life-satisfaction equations and adjusting for individual random effects, we found the CIV estimates to range from $3184 for moderate headaches (women) to $100,066 for severe fatigue (men). Individuals with severe conditions needed to be compensated about three times more than those suffering less. Across the five conditions with two severity levels explored for adaptation, individuals only adapted to moderate headaches and severe sleep problems. In conclusion, not only does the value of health conditions vary greatly, but within each health condition its value on average triples when severe condition is reported as opposed to moderate. Adaptation plays a minor role in CIV estimates for the five health conditions explored.","Efficient resource allocation is a challenge within health-care systems. An important part of tackling this challenge is knowledge of the value of health itself together with the more easily measured costs and benefits of health interventions, such as medical expenses and productivity changes. Relief from suffering related to health interventions is likely to weigh heavily in many cost-benefit or cost-utility analyses, leaving studies that exclude or miscalculate such benefits severely biased. Furthermore, continuous demands of increased allocation of resources to health care highlights the importance of efficiency comparisons, not only within health-care systems, but also between health care and other uses of resources.====One way to determine the value of health is to calculate the willingness to pay (WTP) for health improvements or the willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for losses. That is, to estimate how much money individuals would be willing to give up (or receive) in exchange for such improvements (losses). Studies aiming to determine the monetary value that individuals place on health are scarce due to methodological limitations to traditionally used approaches for this purpose. This has led researchers to focus largely on non-monetary measures (e.g., health-related quality of life (HRQoL)), limiting efficiency evaluations to cost-effectiveness analyses that then act mainly as prioritization mechanism within health systems, rather than cost-benefit analyses that allow for evaluation of efficiency in general.====A promising method to calculate willingness to pay (WTP) for health and thus facilitating efficiency comparisons between health care and other uses of resources is the compensating income variation (CIV) method. The method is firmly rooted in economic theory (Hicks, 1939) and has been used to estimate the monetary value of various non-marketed goods, although health only to a limited degree. Applications to health include migraine (Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2004), cardiovascular disease (Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2006), pain (Ferrer-i-Carbonell and van Praag, 2002, McNamee and Mendolia, 2014, Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020), body composition (Asgeirsdóttir et al., 2020, Baldursdottir et al., 2021), depression and anxiety (Buason et al., 2021) problematic alcohol use (Ragnarsdottir et al., 2022), and a few studies examining a set of different health problems and diseases (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2017, Powdthavee and van den Berg, 2011, Howley, 2017). In addition, recent studies use the method to estimate the dollar value of a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (Huang et al., 2018) and changes in HRQoL (Mcnamee and Mendolia, 2019).====A benefit of the CIV method is that it can be applied to already available data and is thus economical. Individual responses to questions about life-satisfaction as well as health and income are used to estimate a life-satisfaction equation. The estimation results are then used to calculate the income-health trade-off that keeps life satisfaction constant. The calculated CIV amount does not distinguish between WTP and WTA, but for simplicity we refer to it hereafter as WTP. The CIV thus represents the monetary compensation an individual with a sub-optimal health condition is willing to forgo to have the same level of well-being as without that health condition, ceteris paribus. We calculate CIVs for five health conditions using the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), which includes 21 waves and is well suited for estimation of CIVs, for example including a commonly used instrument for income. The five health conditions are: headaches, back problems, sleep problems, fatigue, and chronic illness. Previous research has found negative effects on well-being for individuals suffering from headaches and migraine (Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2004), chronic diseases (Ferrer-i-Carbonell and van Praag, 2002), chronic pain (McNamee and Mendolia, 2014), pain (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020), as well as backache and chronic fatigue syndrome (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2017) and sleep difficulty (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2020) To our knowledge CIVs have not been calculated for any of these conditions within the Swiss context.====Due to our use of individual-level panel data with a rich set of variables, we can account for endogeneity of income in the well-being equations and individual heterogeneity using instrumental-variable random-effects models (IV-RE) with mother’s education as an instrument, thus avoiding upward biases in the CIV estimates (Powdthavee, 2010, Howley, 2017, Ólafsdóttir et al., 2020). To facilitate comparison with previous studies, we also calculated CIVs using ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effects (FE), and random effects (RE) models. With carefully estimated CIVs, we first explore the sensitivity of the CIVs to the severity of the health conditions. Ólafsdóttir et al. (2020) showed that the value of pain relief increases with pain severity. Secondly, we explore whether adaptation influences the relationship between the five sub-optimal health conditions and life satisfaction and the potential effects on CIV measures. Life satisfaction may improve as time passes from a negative health shock, although it may depend on the health condition (McNamee and Mendolia, 2014, Oswald and Powdthavee, 2008, Cubí-Mollá et al., 2017, Lucas, 2007a, Anusic et al., 2014). Furthermore, Easterlin (2005) noted that adaptation is more prominent in monetary situations, but less so when it comes to non-monetary situations.

The rising life expectancy and the declining birthrate in these countries are putting pressure on social security funds and thus imperilling their viability. Given that the increasing life expectancy is accompanied by improvement in average population health, raising the qualifying age for pension (and thus retirement) may be a promising avenue to explore. This being said, the suitability of such policy reforms hinges on three assumptions. Specifically, it posits that the reform is primarily based on the population’s mean lifespan regardless of its dispersion. It also implicitly assumes that delaying retirement has no negative impact on one’s health and that no spillovers are occurring within the family. However, these assumptions are not always satisfied. Some people may not be in a position health-wise to work longer. Besides, retirement can have effects beyond the individual spheres of retirees. Indeed, spillovers are ubiquitous within the family; thus, the impact of a reform that increases the qualifying age for pension may affect not only the eligible person but also their family members (Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Bonsang and Van Soest, 2020, Fischer and Müller, 2020, Atalay and Zhu, 2018, Müller and Shaikh, 2018, Bertoni and Brunello, 2017, Stancanelli and Van Soest, 2016), particularly those who are in vulnerable health. The objective of this paper is to assess these health spillover effects on individuals who are in vulnerable health. Our underlying assumption is that entry into retirement will increase the retiree’s available time for home production and informal care provision (Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Bonsang and Van Soest, 2020, Fischer and Müller, 2020, Stancanelli and Van Soest, 2016), which matter most for those who are in vulnerable health.====A large body of literature has investigated the average health impacts of retirement; however, conclusions remain mixed. On one hand, some evidence indicates that retirement positively affects a person’s subjective health (Johnston and Lee, 2009), life satisfaction (Gorry et al., 2018), psychological well-being (Latif, 2011), physical activity (Kämpfen and Maurer, 2016), and health in general (Coe and Zamarro, 2011). On the other hand, there is evidence that retirement increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and metabolic syndrome (Behncke, 2012), as well as obesity (Godard, 2016) and cognitive impairment (Bonsang et al., 2012). Regardless of whether retirement has positive or negative effects on health, empirical evidence suggests that the impact of retirement on health outcomes cannot be ignored and thus should be carefully considered in pension reforms. In fact, the health impact of pension reforms could be different if there are spillover effects from prospective retirees to other family members, such as spouses.====The interdependence of health outcomes within a couple is well documented in the literature====; however, the studies assessing the impact of an individual’s retirement decision on their spouse’s health outcomes remain limited. In a recent paper, Müller and Shaikh (2018) analyse the impact of retirement decisions on the spouse’s health behaviours such as alcohol consumption and physical activity. The authors find that a person’s retirement has a statistically significant negative impact on their spouse’s health-related behaviours. However, the authors do not consider the impacts on a population segment that has great importance for social policy: spouses in vulnerable health. In addition, they do not stratify these effects by gender. Using a gender-based perspective and Japanese data, Bertoni and Brunello (2017) assess spillovers arising from husbands’ retirement. They find evidence that the husband’s retirement decreases his wife’s mental health and increases her stress levels. In contrast, in the Australian context, Atalay and Zhu (2018) find that the wife’s retirement has a beneficial impact on the husband’s mental health, suggesting the presence of gender-based heterogenous effects. Similarly to Müller and Shaikh (2018), the work of Atalay and Zhu (2018) and Bertoni and Brunello (2017) do not consider the potential for heterogeneous impacts for those who are in vulnerable health. Thus, the current literature investigating these spousal spillovers has overlooked the unintended effects of retirement on spouses in vulnerable health, namely, spouses with long-term health conditions (LTHCs).==== Indeed, retirement may allow potential caregivers to provide valuable (and needed) support to their frail partners that otherwise would have not been possible (Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Bonsang and Van Soest, 2020). Thus, if retirement has a positive effect on the health outcomes of spouses with LTHCs, and as long as having a spouse with LTHCs does not qualify the partner for early retirement, increasing the qualifying age for pension will only be detrimental for this part of the population.====Motivated by this critical policy issue and building on the work of Müller and Shaikh, 2018, Bertoni and Brunello, 2017, and Atalay and Zhu (2018), the objective of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on a reference group for which spillovers are likely to matter most from a policy perspective: spouses with LTHCs. In such a context, the health impact of a policy reform that is deemed neutral for the average person may reveal a non-negligible negative impact on the vulnerable population. In addition, this paper explores the mechanisms through which spillovers occur. There is growing interest in uncovering the mechanisms for the health effects of retirement. Most of this literature has pointed towards an increase in healthy habits such as increasing exercising and sleep duration, and reducing smoking and work-related stress (Insler, 2014, Kämpfen and Maurer, 2016, Eibich, 2015) as potential channels through which retirement influences health. Another possible channel through which retirement spillover can occur is through a change in the quantity of informal care provided (Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Fischer and Müller, 2020) or through the home production within a couple (Bonsang and Van Soest, 2020, Stancanelli and Van Soest, 2016). To investigate if this channel plays a role in the retirement health spillover effects on people with LTHCs, our analysis focuses on retirements that are likely to generate a significant change in the time constraint within a household namely, males’ retirements. In Australia, while female labour market participation has been increasing in the past four decades, females still have a lower labour market attachment than males.==== Female participation rate drops continuously with age after 45 years of age (Warren et al., 2020), indicating that females tend to retire much earlier than males. Indeed, in our sample, married females are 11 percentage less likely to be employed compared to married males. In addition, conditional on being employed, married females work on average fewer hours. Compared to their males’ counterpart, females are 25 percentage points more likely to work less than 30 h a week. Given the weak female labour market attachment, it is unlikely that changes in the retirement age cut-off will lead to any substantial change in the women’s time constraint. We thus focus on the effect of men’s retirement on their wife’s health outcomes.====This paper complements the aforementioned literature by examining whether changes in a couple’s time use after one spouse retires can possibly explain any observed spousal health spillover effects. Furthermore, focusing on the impacts of retirement on spouses with LTHCs allows us to get some insights (or indirect evidence) into the extent to which informal support supplied by partners is valuable.==== The medical literature has emphasised the importance of the presence of significant others on the well-being of patients as well as pain processing (Younger et al., 2010, Eisenberger, 2012; and Master et al., 2009, among others). Although our data do not provide direct information on informal care, our evidence can shed light on this as a possibility. If retirement has a positive effect on the health outcomes of spouses with LTHCs, then identifying and quantifying these effects are of significant policy relevance and value for future research. Therefore, from this perspective, we contribute to the debate on the importance of informal care.====This paper is closely related to the paper by Müller and Shaikh (2018), which also focuses on the impact of spillovers of one’s retirement on the spouse’s health outcomes. Nevertheless, this paper differs in four respects. First, this paper is interested in a specific population segment: people who have LTHCs.==== Our focus on this population segment amounts to substantially more than a heterogeneity check because, as shown later, we find evidence of retirement spillover effects ==== among the people with LTHCs and not among those without LTHCs, meaning that such spillover effects arise in specific (yet important) circumstances. This also means that findings based on samples of a more general population actually are not applicable to, and thus misleading for, the majority of those samples.==== Second, given the population segment of interest, this paper focuses on a specific measure of health outcome not previously considered in the literature: quality adjusted life year (QALY), as compared with self-reported general health status or mental health. Although self-reported health status is widely used in the literature and has its merits, its limitations are well-known, and it does not account for the quality of life, a dimension of crucial importance when focusing on a population with LTHCs.==== Third, health policy deliberations and cost-benefit analyses are often cast in terms of quality of life.==== Fourth, using each component of health outcome as a distinctive outcome measure, this paper investigates the dimensions of health in which these spillover effects manifest most, providing insight on the aspects of health that retirement is most likely to affect.====Assessing the impact of an individual’s retirement on their partner’s health outcomes presents some identification challenges. First, retirement decisions may not be exogenous, because a person’s retirement decision can be affected by their spouse’s health status. Second, spurious correlations between a person’s retirement decision and their partner’s health outcomes could result from either the presence of assortative matching or the couple’s sharing the same environment. Specifically, if both spouses chose each other based on their preference for unhealthy lifestyles, then it is possible that the retirement decision and the partner’s quality of life are affected by the couple’s lifestyle choice. Further, living in the same house implies that they are exposed to the same physical environment. To address these issues, we first need to have rich health data on the individual level and, preferably, over a long period, and second, some exogenous trigger of an individual’s retirement that is not related to their partner’s health outcomes. For the first requirement, we exploit information available in the rich set of covariates from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey from 2002 to 2018. For the second requirement, we exploit the pension eligibility cut-off age in Australia as an instrument for retirement. The Australian age pension program is similar to old-age social security programs in some other countries.==== The pension eligibility cut-off age differs by gender and by the year of birth. Given that the cut-off age is determined only by the year of birth (besides gender), it provides an arbitrary cut-off that serves as a useful source of exogenous variation in the retirement status. Our empirical evidence confirms that for couples, reaching the cut-off age is a strong predictor for men’s retirement status. Building on this finding, we then identify spillover effects of a husband’s retirement on the wife’s health outcome using an instrumental variables (IV) approach.====Our results suggest that a husband’s retirement has a positive impact on his wife’s health outcome ==== when the latter has LTHCs. Specifically, we find that for women who have LTHCs, their husband’s retirement, on average, improves their QALY by 0.77 standard deviations, their physical health 0.52 standard deviations, and their mental health 0.64 standard deviations. We also find that intra-household reallocation of domestic tasks is a key transmission mechanism of the identified spousal spillover effects: women with LTHCs see their health improve only if their husbands spend more time on domestic tasks after retirement.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data and offers an overview of the Australian policy context. Section 3 introduces the empirical framework and the identification strategy.

Deteriorating sanitary conditions and a reduced food supply were likely caused by a growing urban population and overcrowding. Thus, inhabitants of capital cities were shorter than their rural counterparts in numerous countries (Heyberger, 2014). However, the apparent effect of urbanization on height was not observed in Japan (Kouchi, 1996; Schneider and Ogasawara, 2018).

Still, there is limited evidence of their effects in low and middle-income countries. We explore the case of Colombia, a country that introduced a business-supported smoking ban in bars and restaurants and all public indoor spaces in 2010. This paper investigates the effect of smoking bans in bars and restaurants on smoking prevalence in Bogotá, Colombia. In this paper, we use the matching with triple-differences technique in analyzing household consumption data from the 2007 and 2011 ==== surveys. This is done by exploiting their geographical proximity and variation in the density of commercial areas. We found that after the smoking ban implementation, smoking prevalence reduced in households near high-density commercial blocks compared to households near low-density commercial blocks (−10.8 pp.). The impact is larger for households with children and older household heads. Since households near high-density commercial blocks are more frequently exposed to smoking than households near low-density commercial blocks, the former would be more willing to internalize the smoking de-normalization process.","Noncommunicable diseases related to tobacco consumption kill more than 8 million people every year (World Health Organization, 2017). Governments worldwide tackle these public health threats with a set of tobacco control policies aimed at reducing smoking prevalence and its health consequences (World Health Organization, 2004). Tobacco control policies are among the current strategies in emerging economies, but their effects on smoking habits and health outcomes are less known. Policies range from excise taxes to public smoking (smoke-free environments) and advertising bans, discouraging take-up habits, promoting smoking cessation, and enhancing healthy habits (Chaloupka and Grossman, 1996, Douglas, 1998, Farrelly et al., 2001). These sorts of command-and-control policies related to tobacco use have been studied in high-income countries (Czart et al., 2001, Gruer et al., 2012, Lewit et al., 1981, Mayne et al., 2018), but there is limited evidence of their effects in low and middle-income countries (Gruer et al., 2012, Sebrié et al., 2008; Ko, 2020). Understanding policies aimed at low-income countries is essential as there is a threat that additional income results in an increase in 'temptation goods' consumption (Banerjee and Mullainathan, 2010; Evans and Popova, 2016; White and Basu, 2016).====Besides direct health externalities related to second-hand smoking, smoking bans might directly impact smoking behaviour (Adda and Cornaglia, 2010, Bharadwaj et al., 2014, Catalano and Gilleskie, 2021). While evidence of the reduction of the intensity of smoking prevalence in the general population is not clear (Goodman et al., 2009, Jones et al., 2015; Ko, 2020), smoking bans can reduce the prevalence of smoking among those individuals who are typical users in places where the ban is implemented (Anger et al., 2011, Borland et al., 2006, Catalano and Gilleskie, 2021, Chapman et al., 1999; Evans et al., 1999; Shopland et al., 2001). These expositional differential effects are well known in the literature, and the spatial dimension plays an important role (Berg and Lin, 2022; Ko, 2020). Density around and proximity to tobacco outlets are known to be associated with the intensity of teenagers' smoking and the reduced odds of smoking cessation. There have even been proposals to limit retailer density in urban areas (Finan et al., 2019, Halonen et al., 2014, Luke et al., 2017, Pearson et al., 2015). While the standard argument is associated with travelling costs, an alternative approximation is based on social norms and the social cognitive theory. Under this idea, an individual's ability to maintain habit changes depends on the practices of the social system (Bandura, 2007).====In this article, we explore the role of geographic exposure in introducing smoking bans in public indoor spaces, such as bars and restaurants. We study the effect of the tobacco control policy on the smoking behaviour of the population of Bogotá. We intend to shed light on the effects of a non-pecuniary policy intervention on smoking, providing evidence of the policy's impact on the extensive margin by analyzing the possible mechanisms through which households might change their smoking behaviour.====Furthermore, it is of great importance to understand the effect of the policy at an aggregate level when one considers that parents, peers, and siblings act as role models, influencing attitudes toward smoking (Meier, 1991, Otten et al., 2007, Wilkinson et al., 2008). It is also pertinent to note that the availability of purchases within a household positively impacts initiation (Dunbar et al., 2018, Lewit et al., 1981). This research measures the effect of tobacco consumption exposure on household smoking prevalence, taking into account the decision-making within the household as it may be affected by each household member. This study uses data on household smoking prevalence, as information on household members' smoking habits could not be obtained.====An in-depth analysis of how people internalize the de-normalization of smoking will also be undertaken. It has been shown in other contexts (Bicchieri and Chavez, 2010; Krupka and Weber, 2013; Krupka and Weber, 2009) that social norms play a fundamental role in the internalization of socially desired behaviours. The literature presents several mechanisms through which social norms affect social behaviour. Two of them correspond to focusing and informational effects of norms on individuals' actions; they consider adaptative conduct under prescriptions of appropriate actions and imitation behaviour (Krupka and Weber, 2009).====We also analyze three sociodemographic results that the literature has presented. The literature has shown that a longer smoking duration makes the cessation processes more difficult, as it becomes an addictive behaviour (Becker and Murphy, 1988, Douglas and Hariharan, 1994). Thus, we explore whether older people (assumed to have lasted longer in cigarette consumption) respond to the ban less than young people. Second, we explore the presence of children, as it has also been shown that household composition is crucial in tobacco consumption decisions. Parents consider their children's well-being when deciding to smoke as children learn healthy or harmful behaviours from their parents. Third, the literature has also shown that higher socioeconomic status leads to lower tobacco consumption (Chaloupka et al., 2011, Farrelly et al., 2001). However, the evidence on the relation between smoking bans and inequalities in cigarette consumption persists (Tchicaya et al., 2016). While in some developed countries smoking bans have significantly reduced smoking prevalence among low-income individuals to a greater extent (Wissmann, 2022), other studies find no significant effect on closing the gaps (Tchicaya et al., 2016). In this sense, this research considers impacts separately for white-collar and blue-collar household heads.====Section 2 of this research presents the context within which the law was settled, describes the data and shows the empirical strategy that will be used to understand the effect of the law.

A one-standard-deviation increase in mobility is associated with a 6 to 20 percent increase in the cases growth rate; a mask mandate can offset about one third of this increase with our most conservative estimates. Also, mask mandates are more effective in states with higher compliance. Given realized mobility, our estimates imply that total infections in the US on November 15, 2020 would have been 23.7 to 30.4 percent lower if a national mask mandate had been enacted on May 15, 2020. This reduction in cases translates to a 25 to 35 percent smaller decline in aggregate hours worked over the same period relative to a 2019 baseline.",", ====We condition our analysis of the public health benefits of mask wearing on observed mobility and use a variety of cellphone-based mobility indexes to comprehensively summarize several dimensions of human movement (e.g., visits to businesses, contact with others). Importantly, we quantify the extent to which mask mandates and mask wearing offset the effects of mobility on the numbers of Covid-19 cases and related deaths early in the pandemic, from March 15, 2020 to November 15, 2020. We first show that during those 8 months mobility is associated with a higher rate of growth in Covid-19 case counts—a relationship that is documented in other studies (see, for example, ====, ====The strong positive link between mobility and the growth in Covid-19 cases appears to be mitigated to a certain extent by mask mandates. This result is relevant because required mask wearing is a relatively inexpensive policy intervention compared to mandated reductions in mobility. Importantly, we find that mask mandates combined with higher levels of compliance in a given state (measured using survey data on mask wearing) are associated with larger reductions in the growth of Covid-19 cases. By offsetting some of the effect of mobility on the case-count growth rate, mask mandates and mask wearing ultimately reduce the death-count growth rate as well.====Based on our results and given realized mobility, we conduct a series of counterfactual exercises which show that if a national mask mandate had been enacted on May 15, 2020, total infections in the US on November 15, 2020 would have been about 23.7 to 30.4 percent lower. The reduced incidence of the virus due to the national mask mandate would have also had potentially relevant economic benefits. In particular, we find that the reduction in cases associated with our counterfactual mask mandate would translate into a 25 to 35 percent smaller decline in hours worked over the same period relative to a 2019 baseline.====There is extensive research examining the public health issues and economic effects of Covid-19. Several papers study the relationship between mobility and Covid-19 cases in the United States—by looking at a variety of factors that likely impact cross-location differences in infection rates, such as income, inequality, weather, debt burdens, the ability to work from home, and population density, to name a few (see, for example, ====, ====, ====). Related epidemiological papers that also study factors affecting the spread of the virus include ====, ====, and ====.====Relative to existing research, we incorporate additional relevant controls including the persistence in the growth rate of cases/deaths, a feature of some structural epidemiological models, by including the lagged growth rate in our regressions. This practice is not common in the recent studies that use reduced-form ====. Indeed, the lagged case growth rate is quite important in explaining the variation in infection rates across locations and over time, as it helps capture the exponential effects of changes in mobility and mask policies that occurred early on in the pandemic. We further consider specifications that control for other relevant factors that potentially impacted infection rates, including differences in testing across locations, and we also discuss the conditions needed for a causal interpretation of our estimates.====Studies on the effect of mask mandates and actual mask wearing on the growth in Covid-19 cases early in the pandemic are more limited. ==== use an event-study approach to analyze how state-level mask mandates affected daily county-level Covid-19 infection rates from March 31 through May 22, 2020. The authors find that mask mandates reduced the growth rate of cases, and that the mitigating effect increased with the number of days following the mandate’s implementation. In another related paper, ==== show that policies and information regarding transmission risk are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths. The authors conduct counterfactuals examining the potential effect of a national mask mandate early in the pandemic and find that such a mandate would have limited case growth in April and May 2020. Similar analyses of the effects of mask mandates in other countries such as Germany (====) and Canada (====) also show significant reductions in case counts after mandates were introduced.==== Compared to these studies, we use a different estimation procedure and different counterfactuals, and we consider the effect of mask mandates and mobility restrictions on the Covid-19 case counts over a much longer time period, which includes a time when mobility was higher than after the initial lockdown period. Moreover, unlike these existing studies, we consider the fact that actual mask wearing is not guaranteed even when mask mandates are in place and importantly that the degree of compliance varies across locations. Therefore, we supplement our mask mandate analysis with data on actual mask wearing and attitudes toward masks collected by Dynata for the ==== in early July 2020. These data proxy for differences in compliance with the mandates across geographies. While there is some analysis examining the relationship between mask wearing and the Covid-19 case count (see, for example, ====, ====, ====, ====), to our knowledge our analysis is unique in combining data on mask mandates with data on mask usage to gauge the impact of compliance on the effectiveness of the mandates. Finally, we estimate the counterfactual employment benefits of fewer Covid-19 cases.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section ==== discusses our data.

Controlling for population size, we find that more people died from Covid in countries or states with higher rates of intergenerational co-residence. This positive correlation persists even when controlling for date of first death, presence of lockdown, Covid tests per capita, hospital beds per capita, proportion of elderly, GDP per capita, government’s political orientation, percentage urban, and rental prices. The positive association between co-residence and fatalities is led by the US.","Covid is a relatively deadly epidemic (====). It is also very contagious (====; ====). Tests are performed using data from 29 countries associated with the European Union (EU) as well as the fifty states of the USA, which adds up to 79 areas (countries or US states).====By studying 79 geographic areas associated with only two federations (the EU and the USA) we add to previous cross-country or cross-region studies of the association between intergenerational co-residence and Covid fatalities in multiple ways. First, we expand on Bayer and Kuhn’s (2020) study based on data from 24 countries from four continents; our sample is a more homogeneous set of 79 countries associated with the EU or part of the USA. ==== Second, our period of observation is longer than most other studies, including ====: we collected number of deaths from February 15 (first death in France) to August 3 2020, one hundred and twelve days after the first Covid death was reported in Wyoming. Third, as pointed out by ====, Bayer and Kunz pull together countries at different stages of their epidemic curve. In contrast, we analyze cumulative fatalities attributed to Covid measured at fixed intervals after an area’s onset of the epidemic: 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 days after the area’s first death. We investigate not only whether intergenerational co-residence contributes to deaths from Covid-19 but also whether such contribution (if positive) varies with the timing of the epidemic’s onset.====Many cross-country studies of fatalities from Covid such as ==== and ==== have used variation in CFR (case fatality rate) as their measure of mortality. This requires data on both Covid cases and fatalities. Our fourth contribution is that we use cumulative fatalities as our principal COVID outcome. We complement it using cumulative confirmed cases but we place more emphasis on explaining cumulative deaths, as it minimizes measurement error coming from differences in country data publishing methods and testing behavior. In our sample number of tests per capita after 86 days ranged from 0.01 in Bulgaria to 0.18 in Rhode Island and New Mexico.====Fifth, we make a methodological contribution to the literature on fatalities and intergenerational co-residence by controlling for the following variables: test rates per capita measured 14 days prior to the dates at which fatalities are measured, number of days separating the first death in France ====We find that intergenerational co-residence, defined as the share of 18−34 years old living with their parents, is associated with more cumulative deaths after 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 days. For example, an extra one percentage point in such co-residence is associated with 4% more cumulative deaths from Covid 40 days after the area’s onset of the epidemic, 3.5 % more cumulative deaths 60 days after onset and 3% more Covid deaths at either 80 or 100 days after onset. We find that the association between co-residence and cumulative deaths is larger for US states than for EU countries. ==== have suggested that in the USA the association between co-residence and deaths is related to a urban/rural divide, with multi-generational co-residence being more common in rural areas. We don’t find that.====We also explore whether one of the channels that links intergenerational co-residence and cumulative death rates is an association between intergenerational co-residence and number of cases. We find that co-residence rates are also positively associated with cumulative cases, a proxy for the number of infected individuals.====Even though it was not our primary goal, our study also offers a more sophisticated comparison of fatalities due to Covid in the US and the EU than a simple comparison between European countries and the USA as one country.

We find that being moderately & vigorously physically active at least once a week increases memory status by 0.282 and 0.552 ==== for men and women respectively. We find different effects for varying physical activity intensity.,"This paper uses standard health economics theory and longitudinal data to investigate the relationship between physical activity and cognition. Cognitive impairment and memory loss are forerunners of dementia. Dementia is a progressive brain syndrome that disturbs cognitive function and is characterized with a deterioration in memory and the ability to perform everyday activities. The chances of being diagnosed with dementia increase steadily after the age of 65 and although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not an inevitable consequence of aging (Word Health Organisation, 2019). The current economic burden of dementia is greater than that of most chronic conditions, such as heart disease and cancer, and is predicted to become a leading public health problem as the prevalence is anticipated to triple by 2050 (Prince et al., 2016, Martin et al., 2015, Kelley et al., 2015). To date there is no cure for dementia or therapies to alter its progressive course. This augments the critical need to identify potential preventive health strategies (Word Health Organisation, 2019).====Our hypothesis that physical activity is a potential protective action against cognitive decline is based on economic theory; the Grossman model, that predicts physical activity and other lifestyle factors, e.g. a healthy diet, to be an investment in good health (Grossman, 1972). While it has long been established that physical activity is associated with better health outcomes, especially for chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes (Humphreys et al., 2014, Sarma et al., 2014, Sarma et al., 2015, Cawley, 2004), the scientific evidence of the effect of physical activity on cognition and dementia is inconclusive to date. Some research suggests that lifestyle contributes to cognitive function and that around 35% of the occurrences of dementia in older people are attributable to lifestyle factors including physical inactivity, whereas a number of observational studies identified that a negative relationship exists between physical activity and the risk of dementia (Young et al., 2015, Livingston et al., 2017).====Complementing the health economics theory, our hypothesis is supported by neurological literature. Research has shown that Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia, begins many years before symptoms arise and is due to an accumulation of ====-amyloid (A====) in a patient's brain (Jack et al., 2018). In addition, gray matter volume diminishes in late adulthood, often leading to cognitive impairment (Erickson et al., 2011). Gray matter contains most of the brain's neuronal cell bodies. It includes those regions of the brain that are involved in sensory perception such as seeing and hearing as well as memory, emotions, decision making, and self-control. This preclinical stage hence provides an opportunity to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Studies suggest that greater engagement in physical activity may preserve cortical gray matter volume and slow the accumulation of A====, but so far these are associations only (Erickson et al., 2014, Rabin et al., 2019).====To fill this gap in the literature, our paper analyses the preventive nature of physical activity on cognitive function in later age. We distinguish between moderate and vigorous physical activity and its impact on a person's memory status, measured in word recall tasks. Our analyses use longitudinal data from 6 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) between 2004 and 2017. This allows us to measure the impact of changes in physical activity on a person's memory status while controlling for individual's fixed effects and lagged levels of cognition. We use a system – generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, using lagged levels and differences of physical activity and lagged cognition as instruments, while transforming out the fixed effects. Our dynamic system-GMM estimates shows that those who are physically active score significantly better on memory tasks than those who are not regularly active.====In previous research, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in epidemiological and sociological science have found a positive correlation between physical activity and cognition (Abbott et al., 2004, Aichberger et al., 2010, Barnes et al., 2013, Christelis and Dobrescu, 2013, Van Gelder et al., 2004, Hamer et al., 2018, Laurin et al., 2001, Lautenschlager et al., 2008, Richards et al., 2003, Rovio et al., 2005, Sabia et al., 2017, Singh-Manoux et al., 2005, Weuve et al., 2004, Yaffe et al., 2001, Verghese et al., 2003). However, cross-sectional studies as well as RCTs are not ideal for modelling long-term effects of physical activity on cognition due to their short time frame. In addition, researchers are often dependent on small and study specific sample sizes to limit costs and this reduces the population validity (Barnes et al., 2013, Sink et al., 2015).====In longitudinal studies there are several reasons why reported associations may not be causal. First, the cognitive status of an individual is very likely to be determined by his or her past cognitive status while previous cognition is also correlated with current physical activity behaviour, i.e. reverse causation (Daly et al., 2015). Second, once controlling for lagged cognition, the estimation of dynamic models needs to take into account the problem of initial conditions: i.e. the fact that the value of the dependent variable at the initial observed time point is not randomly assigned. It is very likely that the initial state and unobserved effects are correlated, resulting in inconsistent parameter estimates (Heckman, 1987). Third, the decision to be physically active may be endogenous. Reasons for potential endogeneity of physical activity include the decision to exercise being correlated with unobserved factors, such as an individual's lifestyle, time preferences, opportunity costs of time, enjoyment of exercise and other behaviours, which may also directly relate to cognition. Some of these factors may vary over time, and so would not be captured by individual fixed effects. Therefore, endogeneity due to time-varying omitted variables also needs to be addressed. Finally, measurement error due to self-reported physical activity behaviour as well as different perceptions of the definitions of ‘moderate’ and ‘vigorous’ physical activity intensity can bias estimates.====There is a paucity of economics literature addressing this collection of issues with appropriate econometric techniques. Some studies have addressed the endogeneity of physical activity with respect to health outcomes using instrumental variables (IV) (Humphreys et al., 2014, Sarma et al., 2015, Christelis and Dobrescu, 2013, Huang and Humphreys, 2012). Christelis and Dobrescu (2013) use spouse's physical activity behaviour as an IV for own physical activity to model the effect of physical activity on the preservation of cognition at older ages. However, the authors do not account for the dynamics of cognition and after performing the C-test of exogeneity, the authors conclude that the fixed effects estimator is their preferred model, hence leaving it still possible that time-varying measurement error and reverse causality may bias their estimates. In addition, spouse correlations for cognitive functions have been found in previous literature, suggesting that their IV could be improved on (Dufouil et al., 2000). Humphreys et al. (2014) use a variable reflecting the ‘sense of belonging to the community’ as an instrument to estimate the effect of physical activity on health outcomes. However, Sarma et al. (2015) criticize Humphreys et al. (2014) IV, they suggest that the sense of belonging to the community influences people's health directly. Instead they use the average local temperature surrounding the respondent's interview month as an IV to find the effect of physical activity on obesity. Finally, Huang and Humphreys (2012) estimate the relationship between physical activity and self-reported happiness in the US, using county level data on sport/fitness facilities as an IV for physical activity.====Due to privacy policy in Europe, information on respondents’ postal codes are not available for our data, so unfortunately the use of these identification strategies is not applicable in this analysis. Consequently, it is very challenging to find a valid and strong external IV for physical activity in an equation predicting cognition. Hence, our method follows that of Arellano and Bond (1991) by deriving a model that uses lags of endogenous variables as well as exogenous variables as instruments. This is the first methodological application using their econometric model to find the effect of physical activity on cognition.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the data and variables. Details of our econometric methodology are explained in Section 4.

Using rich longitudinal data, we show that experiencing a loss is associated with a modest decline in cognitive function. Our results show that on average the effects are more pronounced for males and the strongest effects are associated with the loss of the spouse or a close friend. These events have significant effects on working memory and speed of information processing. We show that the decrease in cognitive functioning is accompanied by decreases in engagement in cognitive activities and declines in socialization. Our results are suggestive that programmes to support grieving individuals, including support for socialization activities, and extending active aging programmes could be important for promoting successful cognitive aging for the growing population of older adults.","Losing someone you care about has been considered the most stressful and emotionally devastating event an individual can experience in their lifetime (====). Throughout increased stress and depressive episodes, grief following the loss might have substantial impacts on an individual’s mental health and physical health (====; ====). This inevitable event can also change an individual’s socialization, daily routines and activities. Although there has been a great deal of research on the effects of depression on cognitive functioning (====; ====). Hence it is of interest to examine the association between bereavement (which potentially impact individual’s social interactions) and crystallized intelligence.==== We highlight the differences between men and women in estimated bereavement effects. Few studies in the recent literature focus on the relationship between bereavement and cognition with a gender focus, and the results are inconclusive (====).==== Finally, our results highlight that establishing the link between bereavement and cognitive functioning is important for public policy. Given that spousal bereavement is associated with an excess risk of mortality (a well-documented phenomenon known as the ‘widowhood effect’, ====), and in light of the recent COVID-19-related death tolls, more substantial preventive policy measures addressing bereavement-induced cognitive declines are needed.====We uncover a substantial heterogeneity in the effect of bereavement on cognitive functioning depending on the loss type and according to the cognitive domains. Experiencing the death of a partner or a close friend was found to have a significant impact on individual’s ‘fluid intelligence’, whereas no effect we observed in individual’s ‘crystallised ability’.

GDP growth has averaged 6.42% between the beginning of this program in 1986 and 2017, with annual per capita GDP growth averaging 5.04% (The World Bank, 2018). This growth has been attained in part through infrastructure development throughout the country. For example, household electrification has increased from less than 50% in 1993 to including nearly all households in 2014 (World Wildlife Fund, 2016).====As a country develops, dietary shifts towards lower amounts of starchy staple foods and greater quantities of protein-rich and higher-fat foods have been demonstrated (Umberger et al., 2020, Rupa et al., 2019, Thang and Popkin, 2004). While this linkage is well-established, the specific mechanisms enabling these shifts are understudied, including the presence of refrigeration. This study assesses the relationship between household refrigerator ownership (as an indicator for development in the country) and the consumption of food types in Vietnam, filling part of this research gap.====Refrigeration plays a transformative role in food system development, and is interconnected with changes in what foods are consumed and can be supplied (Heard and Miller, 2016). The presence of refrigeration is connected with diets containing more perishable food items (Garnett, 2007), with a connection to increased meat consumption explicitly noted in China’s development (Garnett & Wilkes, 2014). Perishable foods have the potential to improve health outcomes in developing countries (International Organization for the Development of Refrigeration, 2009), but the availability of refrigeration in conjunction with income increases may also promote diets which increase obesity and related health burdens (Popkin, 2001). The relationship between refrigeration, diet, and development has been addressed in the academic literature either largely qualitatively (Garnett, 2011, 2007; Parfitt et al., 2010) or modeled more-abstractly, carrying an assumption of dietary convergence reflecting diets in Western countries (Heard and Miller, 2019).====Refrigerator ownership is tied to income, with sufficiently high household income being a necessary precursor for purchasing a refrigerator. Income increases have been empirically connected with decreased starchy staple food consumption and increases in fruit, vegetable, meat, dairy, and refined grain consumption; with the degree of these shifts dependent on the relative cost of these food types (Godfray et al., 2018). Due to the technological and logistical requirements of supplying perishable foods, shifts towards their consumption is in part enabled by refrigeration as a technology, and in part enabled by income used to purchase these products and a refrigerator. The extent to which diet shifts with development are attributable to refrigeration, wealth, and/or the interaction between these factors is relatively unassessed in the academic literature (Heard and Miller, 2016).====The unbroken refrigerated supply chain, or “cold chain,” provides the capacity to robustly supply perishable foods, and its presence is a characteristic of a developed, industrialized food system (Parfitt et al., 2010). Cold chain services have developed in Vietnam in recent years due to an increase in international investment and an increase in the presence of supermarkets, with sales from modern grocery retailers growing from 30.9 trillion VND in 2011 to 69.2 trillion VND in 2015 (Euromonitor, 2017). The cold chain also plays a key role in agricultural development and in the transition towards Vietnam becoming an agricultural product exporter (Arita and Dyck, 2014). Despite these changes, cold chain development in Vietnam still faces several challenges including the need for improved training at the professional and farmer levels, a lack of supporting information technology, and high costs of installation and operation (Gligor et al., 2018). While development of cold chain services is gaining traction, the introduction of refrigerators enables the integration of households to the value chain; with this analysis assessing the influence of household refrigerator ownership on diet.====The presence, forms, and effects of refrigeration and the cold chain are influenced by intrinsic, direct, and external factors as described by Heard and Miller (2016). These factors include the specific elements outlined in Fig. 1, ranging from the food environment to its effect on consumer behavior, and resulting dietary outcomes (including nutrition, health, and social impacts). These elements are also influenced by demographics, socioeconomics, cultural and the natural environment, all of which are also connected with the presence of refrigeration. This analysis examines refrigeration’s effect on dietary outcomes, a process influenced by consumer behavior, the food environment, demographics, social, economic and cultural drivers. These elements are shaped by the natural environment, technology and infrastructure present, both of which are also connected to the presence of refrigeration. This analysis connects with the multifaceted elements determining dietary outcomes and situates them in the broader systems context surrounding the cold chain, refrigeration, and food system development.====The expected influence of refrigerator ownership on diet can be summarized in two hypotheses. First, household refrigerator ownership is hypothesized to have a positive and statistically significant relationship with the consumption of the more-perishable food types assessed: flesh foods (meat and fish), eggs, vegetables, fruits, and dairy. Second, refrigeration is hypothesized to have a negative and statistically significant relationship with the consumption of the less-perishable foods studied: starchy staple foods, nuts and seeds, and pulses.====These hypotheses are investigated through the empirical analysis of causal linkages between refrigerator ownership and household nutrition. First, the chosen estimation strategy must consider that refrigerator ownershipis likely notnot the only variable influencing a household’s consumption of different food types. Socio-economic variables including income, household location, education level, and household size (among others) can be expected to affect food consumption. Variables accounting for these elements are included in the estimated regression model as control variables. Second, the availability of panel data on Vietnamese household consumption allows for an explicit treatment of unobserved individual heterogeneity by adding individual fixed effects to the estimated regression model (Stock and Watson, 2015). Unobserved individual heterogeneity can be a source of endogeneity to the explanatory variable of interest, i.e. owning a refrigerator. This variable can be correlated with individual, non-time-varying factors that are not observed and that also influence diet. The introduction of individual fixed effects makes it possible to control for this source of endogeneity of owning refrigerator. Third, the issue other potential sources of endogeneity of owning a refrigerator, due to reverse causality between nutritional outcome and owning refrigerator or some unobserved time-varying factors impacting these two variables, is addressed using an instrumental variable approach, namely control function approach (Wooldridge, 2015).====The proposed estimation strategy is implemented using data from Vietnamese Household Living Standard Survey, or VHLSS, over the 2004-2014 period. Consumption data are converted into energy intakes and normalized using per capita calorie intakes, allowing comparison between households. Nutritional outcomes under consideration include a dietary diversity measure, total per capita calorie intake, per capita calorie intakes for major food items, and the ratio between the shares of calories coming from food items with high nutrient intake and food items with low nutrient intake. This empirical analysis provides a snapshot of the causal effect of owning refrigerator on nutritional diet seen from different angles.====The paper is organized as follows.

The tallest and shortest female partners accepted by men with strong traditional gender-role ideology are 2.37 cm shorter and 2.21 cm taller, respectively, than men who disagree with gender norms. In marriage, gender-role ideology is not relevant to partner height, regardless of sex.","Although men are on average genetically taller than women, human mate selection reinforces that men are taller than their female partners more than can be explained by chance. This phenomenon is referred to as the “male-taller norm” (Beigel, 1954; Gillis and Avis, 1980). This effect seems to be driven by women, who prefer tall men much more than men prefer short women (Stulp et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d). Some studies postulate that the male-taller norm evolved in ancient times, when men’s physical strength and violence determined resource allocation, mate access, and thus reproductive success (Murray and Schmitz, 2011; Puts, 2010; Puts et al., 2015; Salska et al., 2008). Moreover, men’s secondary sex differences—such as body size, muscularity, and aggression—are evidence of sexual selection (Andersson, 1994; Puts et al., 2015). These traits endowed men with the ability to compete for resources and protect their families and tribes in ancient times.====Apart from physical dimorphism, psychological traits also differ by sex, notably empathy (Baron-Cohen et al., 2005; Geschwind and Galaburda, 1985; Lutchmaya et al., 2002a, 2002b; Moir and Jesse, 1992). In addition to their ability to breastfeed newborns, women’s empathy is key to the intense care they provide to babies. In contrast, men are less empathetic and more aggressive (Baron-Cohen, 2004), characteristics that were crucial to fighting and killing their competitors and enemies and, in so doing, protecting and seizing resources to support their families (Puts, 2010; Salska et al., 2008). Cooperation between the two sexes improved the survival rate of offspring. Sexual dimorphism and psychological differences between the two sexes establish a biological explanation for the traditional division of household labor in ancient times, which led to the formation of traditional gender-role norms (Philipov, 2011; Udry, 1994).====Some anthropological studies do not support this stereotypical perspective. After reviewing 45 natural fertility populations, Sear and Mace (2008) concluded that the resources provided by relatives contributed more to children’s survival than resources provided by fathers. However, Hewlett (2000) pointed out that ecology and productive modes are substantially associated with the proportion that fathers contribute to their children’s diet. For example, in cold environments with fewer edible plants, food provided by men accounts for a greater proportion of families’ diets than in other environments (Marlowe, 2001). Although in our ancestors’ times, there were substitutes for fathers in raising offspring, fathers’ inputs are important—and sometimes crucial—to the survival of their offspring. This explains why women consider men’s foraging capabilities the most important trait in mate selection in hunter-gatherer societies (Marlowe, 2004).====Even though allocated resources and mate access are no longer determined by physical strength and violence in modern societies, ancient customs still influence the division of household labor in the modern world. This is the biological foundation of the gender-role norms that implicitly and explicitly define the responsibilities of men and women within their families. These norms dictate that men are the household’s primary breadwinners while women are the primary housekeepers. It is therefore important for that men are capable of accessing resources to attract potential mates. Dominance, competitiveness, and masculinity could help a man fulfill his responsibilities in ancient times. These traits can be signaled by the man’s physicality: Studies have shown that height is positively associated with masculinity, dominance, authority, prestige, and leadership (Blaker et al., 2013; Knapen et al., 2019; Murray and Schmitz, 2011; Stulp et al., 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d). Furthermore, recent figures show that tall men, on average, benefit from relatively high income, social status, and educational attainment (Böckerman et al., 2017; Case and Paxson, 2008; Cinnirella et al., 2011; Deaton and Arora, 2009; Yamamura et al., 2015). This indicates that tall men are on average better able to access resources.====Classical and contemporary studies have demonstrated that it is common to judge other people’s social status and prestige on the basis of their height (Knapen et al., 2017, 2019; Wilson, 1968). High social status ensures resource access. To enhance their offspring’s survival rate, women evolved to be attracted to tall men. By contrast, men did not evolve to be attracted to short women. That is to say, women’s height preferences are more fixed to gender-role ideology than men’s. Consequently, the prevalence of gender-role norms might play a stronger role for men than women in terms of height-based assortative mating.====Gender-role ideology refers to attitudes regarding the appropriate roles, rights, and responsibilities of women and men in society (Davis and Greenstein, 2009; Kroska, 2007). Industrialization and increased educational opportunities for women have blurred the steadfast notion of the man being the breadwinner for families, continuously challenging traditional gender-role norms in modern societies. The older generation has a stronger traditional gender-role ideology than the younger generation. This might be explained by an emphasis on egalitarianism resulting from a prevalence of liberalism following expanded education opportunities (Cotter et al., 2011). Educated individuals are less inclined to comply with traditional gender roles, although men maintain a higher motivation to conform to traditional gender norms than do women. Based on interest-based explanations, Bolzendahl and Myers (2004) suggested that women tend to support egalitarianism and oppose traditional gender-role norms because they have a less vested interest in traditional gender roles than men. Marriage, in particular, is seen as a highly gendered institution. According to Gupta (1999), married men behave in a more traditional way than when they were single. Thus, marriage can be said to produce, maintain, and reinforce the traditionalizing effect (Davis, 2007).====This study employs data from a survey conducted in Taiwan to investigate the relationship between gender-role ideology and height preferences in assortative mating. It is well known that, compared to Western societies, Eastern societies are more conservative in terms of gender roles. It is therefore more appropriate to use data from Eastern populations to explore the association between traditional gender-role norms and height preferences. Given that men and women display different attitudes to traditional gender-role norms, this study will investigate whether gender-role ideology affects the sexes differently in assortative mating in terms of height. Section 2 introduces the data and provides statistical information about the samples. Sections 3 and 4 investigate the relationship between height preferences and gender-role ideology for unmarried people and married people, respectively.

Taking height-for-age z-score (HAZ) as a proxy for health, the paper exploits the fact that different ","Conflict is often accompanied by displacement of individuals within and across national borders. In the host regions, the immediate aftermath of such forced migration shocks is typically characterised by pressure on existing resources. Of the 70.8 million forcibly displaced individuals globally, a majority live in refugee camps in developing countries (UNHCR, 2019a). These camps are intended as an emergency response, allowing humanitarian organisations to deliver emergency shelter, food, water and medical care. However, owing to the increasingly protracted nature of conflict, these camps often evolve into long-term settlements, lasting for several years and becoming loci of continued resource inflows such as humanitarian aid, infrastructural investments and evolving local trading.====Previous micro-level analysis has found that proximity to camps has an effect on local labour market outcomes, household consumption, human capital and the wealth of host communities (Alix-Garcia and Saah, 2009; Ruiz and Vargas-Silva, 2015; Maystadt and Verwimp, 2014; Maystadt and Duranton, 2019; Baez, 2011). Of these studies, however, only a few have looked at the long-term impact (Maystadt and Duranton, 2019; Ruiz and Vargas-Silva, 2015). Even so, even these studies tend to focus on cohorts that were alive at the beginning of the refugee influx and are also based on a sample of camps that were in operation for a relatively shorter period.====Other long-term impacts on host communities, including the impact on cohorts of individuals born in the period the camps were in operation and thus exposed to the later evolution of the relationship of camps to local communities, and indeed those born after camps closed, are still under-researched. This paper contributes to this gap in the literature using data arising from the refugee influx from Rwanda and Burundi into Tanzania in the period 1993–2012.====The paper uses height-for-age z-score (HAZ) as a proxy for health, to explore one impact of the fact that different birth cohorts were exposed to different stages of refugee camps. The temporal variation through birth cohorts is coupled with variation in distance to refugee camps to create a difference-in-difference estimation approach.====This paper is closely related to the work of Baez, 2011 who studies the impact of exposure to refugee camps on human capital in Tanzania. However, the perspective and methodology of this paper differ in two important respects. First, whereas Baez, 2011 solely examined the effect on the health of individuals aged 10–15 who were exposed to the refugee influx in their childhood, this paper examines whether the effect of childhood exposure, if any, lasts into adulthood i.e. age 20 and above. Qualitative evidence shows that, in the immediate aftermath of the refugee influx, the increase in population was associated with an increase in deforestation, communicable diseases and pressure on resources. However, in subsequent years, there were some positive spillovers. Locals are reported to have benefitted from roads and healthcare services provided to camp populations (Whitaker, 1999). Other studies also found that locals around refugee camps experienced an increase in consumption levels and assets, although the effects are heterogeneous across economic activities (Alix-Garcia and Saah, 2009; Maystadt and Verwimp, 2014; Ruiz and Vargas, 2015). In light of these possible positive spillovers, and because poor health in childhood may still be recouped in the growth window, the first objective is to establish whether the effect of camp exposure is discernible in later life.====Secondly, while previous research has focused on the initial phases of refugee arrival, this paper considers another juncture that is crucial for host regions – the departure of refugees and closure of camps. By comparing the generation of local children that were born after the refugee influx to those born after camps closed, I examine the effect of having been exposed to the camps relative to being born in a post-camp era. These later cohorts have not previously been studied. The closure of the camps could have led to a loss of positive spillovers which may have negatively affected those born after the camps closed. On the other hand, the departure of refugees and closure of camps could have alleviated pressure on local resources to the benefit of those born after camps closed. This paper seeks to examine what the effects were.====Another difference of the present paper to other studies is the use of a different dataset (the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) rather than the Kagera Health Demographic Survey (KHDS)), which, combined with new data on camps in the Kigoma region, improves upon the geographic scope of previous studies.====The paper finds a negative, albeit localised, effect of exposure to camps discernible through to adulthood, for individuals that were children at the time of the refugee influx. The effect is a reduction in HAZ of 0.29 between those who lived within 50 km of a camp and those that were more than 50 km away. The result is comparable to a 4.3 % difference in adult hourly earnings. However, those that were exposed for a longer duration were less affected. These results are robust to different measures of exposure and provide evidence that the negative effect of camps may have dissipated over time. Among the later generation who are still children (at the end of the period of study), the results indicate that there is no observable difference in the HAZ between those born during camp operations and in the post-camp period.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 discusses the contextual background, section 3 provides an overview of the pertinent literature, section 4 describes the data used and section 5 outlines the empirical methodology.

We demonstrate that rank-order regression provides a robust metric of health equity, revealing differences in opportunities for each child to reach their own growth potential. We estimate four indicators of nutritional mobility and test for associations between nutritional mobility and various local economic and ====. Nutritional mobility has improved over time, and the nutrition environment contributes about 2.86 times as much as a mother’s height to her child’s expected rank in height-for-age. Populations with the least mobility are in Latin America, and the most mobility is in more urbanized areas of Africa and Asia. Rank-order mobility is an important aspect of health equity, offering valuable insight into the role of socioecological factors in nutrition improvement across generations.","Human development depends on improvements in socioecological conditions, giving children better health outcomes than their parents (Case et al., 2005; Martorell and Zongrone, 2012; Thompson, 2014). This study explores the individual, local, and national factors associated with whether the children of mothers with shorter stature face the same constraints on linear growth, indicating persistent disparities in access to nutritional and other determinants of attained height. The use of rank-order mobility to measure equality of opportunity across generations was pioneered by Chetty et al. (2014), and has been widely used since then regarding income, wealth and educational attainment. This paper applies the concept to human health, using attained height to measure the degree to which socioecological constraints preserve a population’s rank order from generation to generation.====We define ==== as the probability that mothers ranked low in their cohort’s height distribution will have children who attain a higher rank order. Families that migrate from poorer to wealthier countries are known to experience rapid increases in attained height (Alacevich and Tarozzi, 2017), thereby achieving a higher rank order in the global distribution. This study measures the degree to which similar intergenerational mobility occurs within countries. Each child’s genetic potential is inherited from the parents’ genetic potential plus their own random mutation, and attained height is then determined by interaction with environmental factors (Emanuel et al., 2004). Transmission of maternal genes implies some transmission of attained height, but populations with more nutritional mobility have had a greater improvement in ==== from one generation to the next, lifting environment constraints related to diet and disease as well as assortative matching of shorter mothers with shorter fathers (Stulp et al., 2017).====Nutritional mobility in rank order allows us to identify change in health equity from one generation to the next, complementing past work on intergenerational transmission of many different health outcomes such as Johnston et al. (2013). By health equity, we mean differences among people in the magnitude of barriers to achievement of their genetic potential. By ==== in health equity, we mean greater reductions in a society’s more severe barriers, focusing in this study on constraints that limit a person’s linear growth. Attained height is well suited to rank order analysis since it varies continuously over a wide range, and rank order mobility is helpful to distinguish changes in health equity from the many factors that drive improvements in a population’s average height (Fogel, 2004; Deaton, 2013). Previous work on population heights typically focuses on national averages or prevalence of extremes such as stunting rates, defined as the fraction of children whose height falls below two standard deviations below the median height-for-age of a healthy reference population (HAZ<-2). Many studies also use attained height to identify differential impacts of socioecological conditions, such as sex-specific vulnerability to climate shocks (Maccini and Yang, 2009; Mulmi et al., 2016). Our goal is to measure change in health equity, as a distinct dimension of interest to many policymakers (Ottersen et al., 2014), and to do so regarding a health outcome known to be closely associated with many diverse aspects of human development including cognitive ability and future earnings (Case and Paxson, 2008).====In our framework, ==== is the expected height-for-age rank of children whose mothers have a low rank, such as the 25th percentile, and ==== is the expected difference in rank between children whose mothers are at the bottom and the top of their cohort’s distribution. These indicators should be interpreted in the context of other indicators of well-being, because being taller is not itself a sign of good health; height is of special interest only because it offers a way to measure a kind of deprivation relative to genetic potential which is associated with many other outcomes (e.g. Dewey and Begum, 2011; Bhalotra and Rawlings, 2013; Frongillo et al., 2019). In this case, mobility in attained height could be an important indicator for the intergenerational transmission of well-being in general. Height data also offers some advantages relative to income, expenditure, wealth, or education to quantify a society’s equality of opportunity. First, measurement techniques have been subject to a high degree of scrutiny and improvement over successive survey years since Sommerfelt and Boerma (1994), and the data we use were collected using highly standardized methods producing high-quality data (Assaf et al., 2015; Pullum et al., 2020). Second, potential height is known to have no significant differences across racial or ethnic groups, making it a useful benchmark for health equity (WHO, 2006; Garza et al., 2013). Third, heights are measured using continuous variables which helps mitigate empirical challenges with coarse data such as years of schooling (Asher et al., 2020). Fourth, there is no censoring at zero or need to impute values as might arise when studying income or wealth (Chetty et al., 2014). Finally, the mother’s measured adult height fully reflects her lifelong attainment (Dewey and Begum, 2011), whereas income and wealth fluctuate and have many other measurement issues (Emran and Shilpi, 2018, 2019).====Using rank order of height to measure intergenerational mobility has some advantageous features but also has limitations of its own. Most importantly, data quality in the surveys we use does vary somewhat across countries and years (Assaf et al., 2015; Pullum et al., 2020; Finaret and Hutchinson, 2018), so for this study we use only within-survey differences in rank order between mother and child, and do not merge surveys to examine health equity at the global level. Also, the surveys we use are nationally representative but may face selection bias and low power among the most under-served populations (Comandini et al., 2016), so for this study we use only the overall national distribution and do not focus on subgroup differences as in Asher et al. (2020). Third, there remains the possibility of statistical artifacts associated with the birth dates needed to compare child heights (Agarwal et al., 2017; Larsen et al., 2019; Finaret and Masters, 2019), so for this study we pool all birth months to ensure no effect of artifactual seasonality. One contribution of our study is to test the robustness of rank-order regression compared to direct tests of intergenerational transmission in the level of each variable, as in Alesina et al. (2019) for education in Africa, and other ways of measuring intergenerational transmission, as done by Chetty et al. (2016) in their work on incomes and life expectancy in the United States. Focusing on intergenerational change provides insights into health equity beyond horizontal inequality between groups at any one point in time (Canelas and Gisselquist, 2018), and focusing on individuals’ rank in their national distribution is helpful in the context of multiple disparities, taking account of each child’s circumstances at the intersection of their demographic identity, geographic location, parents’ education and many other factors (Krishna et al., 2015).====To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate rank order mobility in height. The work is purely descriptive, as any causal analysis would require a source of exogenous variation in the child’s growth environment as in Bevis and Villa (2020). Our aim is to establish stylized facts about the empirics of rank-order correlation in attained height. The highest potential correlation we might observe would be in countries with extreme and persistent inequities between groups, each facing different degrees of harm that limits the attained height of each mother-child dyad. In those high-transmission societies, if barriers are lifted the correlations would decline over time and could go below zero to become negative. The lowest correlations would therefore be in places where extreme inequities had recently been removed, so that children of low-ranked mothers also reach their genetic potential and may be taller than the children of high-ranked mothers. Over time, such a population would see an increase in intergenerational transmission as more mothers achieve their own genetic potential, leading to positive correlation especially if shorter mothers choose assortative mating. Comparing across populations, the potential gradient in transmission associated with reduced disparities over time could be an asymmetric U, with lower correlation as disparities are removed followed by an upturn in transmission once the mothers’ generation has reached its full potential height. The possible range of variation in nutritional mobility reveals it to be a dynamic phenomenon, with implications beyond that of average heights.","Can shorter mothers have taller children?

A latent variable structural equation model is used to analyse the predictive role of latent baseline biological health, indicated by a rich set of biomarkers, and other personal characteristics, in determining the individual’s disability state and health service utilisation five years later. We find that baseline biological health affects future health service utilisation very strongly, via progression to functional disability channel. We also find systematic income gradients in future disability risks, with those of higher income experiencing a lower progress to disability. Our model reveals that observed pro-rich inequity in ","Health care costs have risen substantially over time in all OECD countries and are projected to continue rising faster than the rate of economic growth (OECD, 2015). In the United Kingdom (UK), about 10% of GDP is spent on the National Health Service (NHS), in line with the OECD average. Public health spending accounts for more than four-fifths of this spending. The proportion of the UK public spending allocated to the NHS has risen steadily since the establishment of the NHS in 1948 and had more than doubled by 2013/14 (Charlesworth and Bloor, 2018). As a result, almost 20% of UK government spending goes to the NHS (OECD, 2015).====In addition to technological innovation and rising expectations as factors increasing health care demand, population ageing and associated disability put further pressure on health care demand (Brilleman et al., 2014; Carreras et al., 2018; De Meijer et al., 2011; Howdon and Rice, 2018). For example, in the UK, the number of disabled people aged over 65 is projected to increase by 25% from 2015 to 2025, with a quarter of post-65 projected life expectancy involving disability (Guzman-Castillo et al., 2017). These projections imply large future rises in health service utilisation and associated costs. In this setting, it is important for policymakers to be able to identify population groups that are of higher risk for increasing health care demand, to establish priorities for resource planning and preventive policy.====Much recent research explores individual-level determinants of the demand for health care services and consequent costs with a particular focus on the role of ageing and time-to-death (e.g., Brilleman et al., 2014; Carreras et al., 2018, De Meijer et al., 201, Howdon and Rice, 2018; Zweifel et al., 1999). It has been shown that simple age-health expenditure curves may not yield an accurate picture of current and future health care expenditures, highlighting the importance of accounting for individuals’ morbidity and disability status. Many existing studies (Brilleman et al., 2014; Carreras et al., 2018; Howdon and Rice, 2018) reveal contemporaneous associations between the morbidity profile of the population and health care demand and costs, but do not aim to identify pre-symptomatic individuals at risk of future high rates of health service utilisation. The majority of these studies use data accumulated from the health care system, relating to selected patient groups or older people, without adequate coverage of people with latent health conditions not yet at the stage of diagnosis. Most also have limited information on the range of confounding personal and socioeconomic characteristics. Associations between impaired health, disability and intensive health services utilisation are often explored separately (e.g., Davillas and Pudney, 2020a, 2020b; Crimmins, 2004; Fried et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2010; McColl et al., 2011; Spillman, 2004), and studies exploring the full interplay between baseline health impairments and subsequent functional disability and increased demand for health care are much more limited. Joint prediction of future health service utilisation and disability is potentially important for forward-looking policies, particularly if we take a broad view covering needs for both medical treatment and social care.====In this paper, we build on existing research on the predictive role of biomarkers for progression into disability (Davillas and Pudney, 2020b) to examine jointly the predictive power of baseline biological health for both disability and health care utilisation outcomes in the future. We use data from wave 2 of the nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS, also known as Understanding Society) to measure baseline ill health and wave 7, five years on, to observe subsequent disability and health service utilisation for the same individuals. For the analysis, we develop and implement a structural equation model of the service utilisation and functional disability outcomes, conditional on health and demographic and socioeconomic status at baseline. Analysis of the demand for health care using structural models is not new and we build on a long tradition of modelling health as a latent variable that is not directly measurable (Van de Ven and Van Der Gaag, 1982; Wagstaff, 1986).==== We are able to exploit the advances in social science datasets made since those pioneering studies, capitalising on the availability of longitudinal data and more objectively measured health indicators (biomarkers).====We make a number of new contributions to the literature. First, although it has been shown that biological ill-health at baseline increases the risk of future disability (e.g., Davillas and Pudney, 2020b), less is known about the interrelationship of disability and health service utilisation at that future time. We use data on consultations at general practitioners (GP) and outpatient or day clinics (OP) and the length of inpatient (IP) hospital stays collected alongside disability as outcomes five years after baseline. Analysis of disability and service utilisation as joint outcomes reveals the important role of disability as a factor in the growth of treatment costs and suggests the possibility of large economic benefits if it is possible to design effective public health and social policy interventions that can prevent or slow the progression to functional disability. Of course, such interventions, if feasible, would have important impacts in the reduction of human suffering as well as public resource costs. The evidence presented in this paper is in line with with recent UK policy agendas that see disability as a largely preventable public health priority (Department of Health and Social Care, 2019).====Second, we develop a latent variable structural equation approach in which we allow for the possibility that our biomarker measures are noisy markers of an individual’s biological health at baseline, rather than direct observations on the relevant biological concept. Part of the existing literature uses composite measures that combine a number of biological measures (biomarkers): either by summing dichotomous variables indicating values below or above predetermined cut-points for each of these biomarkers; or by transforming them into comparable measures (z-scores) which are summed to produce a composite measure; or by constructing principal components of the set of biomarker (for example, Nesson and Robinson, 2019; Seeman et al., 2004). These methods have various disadvantages: the use of arbitrarily determined biomarker thresholds; lack of weighting of the different biomarkers; and reliance purely on internal correlations. None of them deals explicitly with the problem of random measurement error (‘noise’) inherent in the laboratory and field measurement processes. We instead develop a latent index for baseline biological health that incorporates all available sample information and combines the selected biomarkers optimally in way that takes account of the predictive power of each biomarker for disability and service utilisation outcomes five years after baseline. This advantage of our methodology, together with the availability of a large set of biomarkers (spanning adiposity, grip strength, blood pressure, heart rate, lung functioning, inflammation, stress hormones, cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, liver function and anaemia) gives us an unusually full picture of individuals’ baseline health states. Although biomarkers are the most objective health indicators available in social science surveys, they are still subject to measurement error (Davillas and Pudney, 2020b; Zang et al., 2015), and our method deals with measurement error to avoid the attenuation bias that would otherwise affect the estimated impact of biomarkers on the outcomes of interest. We use a similar multi-indicator latent disability approach to exploit the range of survey indicators measuring different facets of disability and to deal with random response error in the survey measurement of disability found in previous research (Morciano et al., 2015b).====Third, the paper contributes to the literature on horizontal equity in health service utilisation, using an approach different to the concentration indices typically employed in that literature. In most existing empirical work, horizontal inequity is measured as the degree to which individuals’ own socio-economic status is associated with health services utilisation after accounting for differences in health care need (Cookson et al., 2016; Van Doorslaer et al., 2004, 2006); typically, need-related differences in health care utilisation are proxied using self-reported general health, morbidity and disability measures in addition to demographic indicators. Instead, we use a latent biological health component based on large set of objectively measured biomarkers, and a disability component reflecting different facets of disability. Thus, unlike most existing studies we can explore the association between socioeconomic status measures and health services utilisation, allowing for health and disability latent components which are arguably more firmly based.====Our results are striking: we have found that the predictive role of baseline biological health on service utilisation is almost entirely channelled through disability progression, which has a large, positive and highly significant association with concurrent health care demand measured by GP, OP consultations and IP days. This underlines the potential importance of policy designed to delay or prevent progression to disability. Baseline personal characterises have a strong influence on baseline biological health. We also found systematic SES gradients in future disability risk, which is lower for those with higher baseline income among individuals with no reported disability history. For GP consultations, OP consultations and IP days, health care utilisation is found to favour those on higher incomes, after conditioning on baseline biological health, particularly for GP and OP consultations.====Importantly, we find that the appropriate predictive concept of baseline biological health loads more heavily on lung functioning, grip strength, anaemia status, stress-related hormones and liver functioning and to lesser extent on indicators that are the current focus of the public health screening programs, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and adiposity. As indicators of disability, physical difficulties with lifting/carrying, mobility, personal care, co-ordination and manual dexterity are found to be much more strongly associated with utilisation of health services than are indicators of sensory and cognitive difficulties.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

Debates have been fuelled by evidence on improved health and reduced poverty, and concerns over adverse labour market effects; concerns that are, to date, only supported by mixed empirical findings. This article examines whether publicly provided healthcare influences the decision to migrate. The spatial and temporal variation in the expansion of a non-contributory health insurance programme in Mexico, combined with the panel dimension and the timing of household survey data allows causal identification of the effect of increased coverage on migration. Difference-in-differences estimates reveal that accessing healthcare for free raises internal migration. The effect on ====, costlier by nature, is statistically insignificant. Potential mechanisms include better health, the alleviation of financial constraints and a greater propensity to work. Results point to the relevance of including household members who have migrated in assessing the impacts of social health policies. They suggest that publicly provided healthcare could have multiplier effects on economic development and welfare by enabling labour force detachment of working-age members in affiliated households.","Publicly provided healthcare has received growing attention in the academic and policy sphere; it is claimed to be one of the most effective ways of reaching universal health coverage (Jamison et al., 2013). While positive impacts on health and poverty are acknowledged (Finkelstein and McKnight, 2008, Finkelstein et al., 2012), adverse labour market effects, such as disincentives to work or switching from formal to informal work, have fuelled debates (Gruber and Simon, 2008, Levy and Schady, 2013). However, empirical evidence on labour market outcomes remains mixed. In Mexico, the setting of this study, Azuara and Marinescu (2013) find that publicly provided healthcare has no effect on informality in the overall population. In contrast, Bosch and Campos-Vázquez (2014) evidence a decrease of almost 5% in the number of employers and employees formally registered in small and medium firms, highlighting the need to weigh gains of greater healthcare coverage against labour reallocation costs.==== ====This paper investigates whether publicly provided healthcare influences the decision to migrate. By providing (near-)poor households with the means to deal with risk, non-contributory health insurance might affect labour market behaviours, and simultaneously alter household livelihood strategies.==== Assuming that household members share their resources, accessing alternative sources of livelihood through social health policies could relax financial constraints, and enable (healthier) working-age household members to migrate. It could indirectly influence migration through local labour markets by inducing them to reallocate time from care giving to working outside their households, which might involve working elsewhere. Examining beneficiaries’ migration response is policy-relevant since an increase in migration might suggest that publicly provided healthcare expands their labour market prospects across space. That affiliates migrate could also explain the mixed evidence on the links between publicly provided healthcare and labour market behaviours often found in the literature. By enabling migration, household access to publicly provided healthcare would induce them to ‘drop out’ from estimation samples. Not accounting for the potential effects of social health protection programmes on migration might thus question the reliability of results obtained when evaluating their impacts.====In addition to potential bias due to self-selection into programme affiliation and migration, a major empirical challenge in studying the relationship between publicly provided healthcare and migration is the existence of endogenous migration. Variations in health insurance coverage across space could incite low-income families to migrate, if they were not provided with similar benefits in their current places of residence, as posited by the welfare magnet hypothesis (Moffitt, 1992). If individuals migrated to municipalities where non-contributory health insurance was introduced to access healthcare, migration would be the result of individuals pulled to migrate to benefit from the programme, rather than healthcare affiliation enabling them to migrate. This paper exploits the expansion of a publicly provided healthcare programme initiated in Mexico in 2003, ==== (hereafter, ====), to identify the causal effect of social health policies on the likelihood to migrate. This initiative aimed at ensuring access to healthcare to improve financial strength through health services by guaranteeing subsidized, publicly provided basic universal healthcare services, to those not covered by any social security institution. Offered to some 50 million Mexicans without social security, it institutionalised a pilot programme, ====, running from October 2002 to December 2003, that gradually expanded across Mexico.====Several features make this setting particularly suitable for studying migration responses to welfare programmes. First, combining administrative with longitudinal household survey data allows drawing on the timing of the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS), a three-wave household panel conducted in 2002, before the start of ==== pilot phase, 2005 and 2009, during its expansion phase. By observing respondents’ municipalities of residence at the beginning and at the end of each time period, the panel structure of the MxFLS allows controlling for reverse causality by assigning changes in healthcare coverage to individuals based on their municipality of residence at the beginning of each time period. Second, the plausibly exogenous variation in ==== coverage change across municipalities and over time in the middle of its roll-out, arising from its staggered expansion, enables causal identification of the effect of publicly provided healthcare on migration in a difference-in-differences setting. I compare working-age respondents among post-pilot municipalities, before and after this measure, from municipalities where publicly provided healthcare expanded a lot and municipalities with little or no increase in coverage.==== This yields two key estimates: (i) an intention-to-treat (ITT) effect, the full policy effect; and (ii) the treatment-on-the-treated (TT) effect, which reflects the size of ==== expansion in treated areas. Third, examining the link between social health reforms and migration in Mexico should lessen concerns related to self-selection in international migration – immigrants’ eligibility constraints, linguistic or cultural barriers – that might affect the identification of this relationship in destination countries.====Results show that social health policies might have unexpected effects. The estimated ITT effect indicates that publicly provided healthcare increases the propensity to migrate by 2.39 percentage points. This is equivalent to a 5.27 percentage point TT effect, that is a 0.28 standard deviation effect. Exposure to a major change in healthcare coverage is found to raise internal migration, but to have a statistically insignificant and close to null effect on international migration. To interpret results, I investigate a number of potential mechanisms. Accessing publicly provided healthcare appears to play a role in increasing labour supply, limiting health shocks and alleviating financial constraints. Combined with descriptive statistics, estimates imply that, as Mexico successfully expands social health policies that raise disposable income, internal migration has increased, and the quality of internal migrants worsened, as such policies relax financial constraints for the least able to afford migration, likely with the lowest skills.====To improve confidence in the identification strategy, I use available pre-pilot data and run several robustness checks. They suggest that the propensity to migrate was lower in treated municipalities prior to the intervention, and that the expansion of publicly provided healthcare might have cancelled out an ==== downward trend in migration in Mexico at the time of the survey. This indicates that baseline estimates do not reflect the existence of any positive selection into migration nor pre-programme positive migration trend in treated municipalities.====This analysis contributes to a growing literature estimating the impacts of social policies on migration in developing economies.==== Conditional cash transfers were found to have an insignificant effect on internal migration, but to increase international migration in Mexico (e.g. Angelucci, 2015, Stecklov et al., 2005). In South Africa, Ardington et al. (2009) evidenced greater labour migration of working-age individuals living in households benefiting from unconditional cash transfers – old-age pensions. In Bangladesh, direct health service provision (family planning and childhood vaccination) was shown to decrease internal and international migration (Barham and Kuhn, 2014). Conclusions on welfare intervention-induced migration thus remain mixed, despite a need to better understand what prevents migration, and whether welfare policies influence the decision to migrate in developing economies (Ardington et al., 2009, Barham and Kuhn, 2014). While the value of these works is evident, they are very different from the Mexican reform. This article is the first to assess whether publicly provided healthcare, granted to individuals not already covered by employment-based insurance, triggers migration. In contrast to contributory insurance that tends to crowd out migration by constraining affiliates to formal employment and a particular area, non-contributory healthcare might complement, rather than substitute for, alternative coping strategies, such as migration. I contribute to this literature by providing well-identified estimates of a positive migration response to increased publicly provided healthcare coverage.====While the precise magnitudes of these results might not be valid beyond the study context, they offer two general lessons applicable elsewhere. First, this analysis clarifies the migration decision-making process. Findings suggest that social health policies could have multiplier effects on economic development and welfare through migration. Accessing healthcare for free might enable those particularly vulnerable to adverse shocks, who could not afford migration otherwise, to relocate labour available within a household across the country. Publicly provided healthcare might not worsen their labour market outcomes. Given the documented effects of migration on development,==== findings give insight into what prevents migration. This is necessary to improve the design and target of policies seeking to remove impediments to mobility for those who could benefit from welfare gains, and to leverage the contribution of migration to the development of origin communities. Second, in showing that non-contributory healthcare increases the propensity to migrate, results shed light on some unexpected effects of publicly provided healthcare. They suggest that any analysis of social health policies should consider the possibility of beneficiaries to migrate as a result of similar schemes. In assessing such initiatives, it is necessary to include recipients, household members living with them ==== who have migrated. Not accounting for the possibility of migration responses might question estimate reliability when evaluating their impacts, and explain contrasting evidence on the effects of publicly provided healthcare found in the literature.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

This is despite high prevalence rates in many LMICs like China, Mexico and South Africa, which have reached levels of over ten percent among the adult population, partly overtaking high-income countries like the United States (International Diabetes Federation, 2019). The severity of diabetes, once it is diagnosed, as well as the potential for complications, and the economic impact of diabetes strongly depend on individual patient behaviour. This is the case in particular for the most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes, whose development may also be related to health behaviours. Previous research shows that behaviour changes such as increased physical activity, dietary changes and reduced alcohol consumption after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis are related to health and reductions in the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (Long et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2016). Thus, a diabetes diagnosis may present an important opportunity to reduce risk factors for complications (De Fine Olivarius et al., 2015) and to alleviate the resulting economic burden, raising the question what the impact is of a diabetes diagnosis on these outcomes.====Diabetes, economic outcomes and behavioural risk factors are likely interrelated, making it difficult to establish causal pathways. For example, transitioning from unemployment to employment may reduce physical activity by decreasing available leisure time; or may promote risk factors such as smoking and higher energy intake by changing the available income, thereby affecting the probability of developing diabetes and its complications (Colombo et al., 2018). Similarly, unemployment can lead to weight gain but also reduce smoking and fast-food consumption (Colman and Dave, 2014).====Nevertheless, existing research on the impact of diabetes on labour market outcomes has so far assumed that diabetes is unaffected by prior employment outcomes, or has used instrumental variable (IV) strategies (Brown et al., 2005, Latif, 2009, Seuring et al., 2015b) with at least questionable instruments (for a discussion, see for instance Seuring et al. (2019)). It has also not been possible to credibly control for the independent effect of BMI or hypertension on employment outcomes, as both are likely affected by diabetes themselves, leading to biased estimates of the effect of diabetes on employment in standard regression models (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). Studies investigating behaviour change after a diabetes diagnosis remain scarce and focus primarily on high-income countries and the elderly population (Gaggero, 2020), without accounting for the selection into a diabetes diagnosis based on prior behaviour change (Slade, 2012). Evidence stratified by gender is also missing, even though differences in health behaviours between men and women may help to explain gender differences in the complication risk of diabetes (Kautzky-Willer et al., 2016; Huebschmann et al., 2019; Harreiter and Kautzky-Willer, 2018; The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, 2017; Kautzky-Willer and Harreiter, 2017).====To assess the impact of a diabetes diagnosis on both employment probabilities and behavioural risk factors, this study uses longitudinal data from China, a country where about 13% of adults between the age of 40 and 60 have diabetes,==== and over 50% of those remain undiagnosed (Wang et al., 2017). We take various sources of confounding into account, first by estimating marginal structural models (MSMs) to account for any time-dependent confounding (Robins et al., 2000). Second, we complement this strategy with fixed effects (FE) models to account for any time-invariant unmeasured confounding. Apart from this methodological innovation, the study extends the scarce evidence base for the impact of diabetes on employment in LMICs and provides, as far as we are aware, the first longitudinal evidence for the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on behavioural risk factors in a LMIC.","Diabetes, employment and behavioural risk factors in China: Marginal structural models versus fixed effects models",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301957,15 September 2020,2020,Research Article,41.0

To do this we exploit differences in the timing of introduction of recreational marijuana laws among states and find that they are complements. Specifically, in counties located in RML states monthly sales of high calorie food increased by 3.2 percent when measured by sales and 4.5 percent when measured by volume when using our preferred identification strategy. Results are robust to including ==== effective dates for RMLs in treated states and products as well as when using Synthetic Control Methods as an alternative methodology.","The notion that marijuana consumption inspires appetite is widespread and accepted according to the conventional wisdom. This is illustrated by the fact that in the popular culture many movies related to cannabis are related to plot lines around what is typically known as the “munchies” namely, an irresistible urge to consume increased amounts of high calorie snacks foods including, chips, ice cream, cookies, and the like.==== Interestingly, however, there is limited research available on the potential role of marijuana consumption on snack food consumption. From a human biology perspective there are some studies that indicate that a link may exist between a key active ingredient in cannabis and the body system in such a way that psychological and physical changes may follow as a consequence of their interaction (Patel and Cone, 2015; Baggio et al., 2020a).====However, there is very limited causal evidence that may help support any actual behavioral change and, in fact, the few studies that exist show contradictory results. Very early evidence is provided by Foltin et al. (1988) who study the case of six adult male research volunteers in a residential laboratory for thirteen days. In this limited study, these adults are allowed to smoke marijuana actively and by the end of the thirteenth day these researchers report an increase in total daily caloric intake of around 40 percent in the form of consumption of high calorie snack foods, including potato chips and candy bars. Moreover, they find that in body weight during periods of active marijuana smoking were greater than predicted by caloric intake alone. Another relevant study is Sabia et al. (2017) who provide mostly correlational and indirect evidence using self-reported measures and focuses on the effects of medical marijuana laws (MMLs) on body weight, among others. They employ data from the 1990 to 2012 and find that the enactment of MMLs lead to a 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent decrease in body-mass index scores and a 2.1 percent to 6.0 percent decline in the likelihood that respondents report being obese. In addition, these researchers also find some evidence of age‐specific heterogeneity in mechanisms and argue that their findings are consistent with the idea that cannabis consumption may be more likely to induce marijuana use for health‐related reasons among older individuals, and cause substitution toward lower‐calorie recreational ‘highs’ among younger individuals.====From a policy perspective, a clear understanding of the role of cannabis on appetite is rather important. With the recent push to legalize recreational marijuana there has been growing interest in understanding the direct and indirect effects of cannabis consumption and in particular any undesired impacts of recent marijuana laws. In fact, with Canada and Uruguay already having legalized recreational marijuana consumption and with several states in the Union having done so, it is rather important to understand not only the direct impact of cannabis use, but also any unintended behavioral spillover effects (Baggio et al., 2020a, 2020b).==== In the particular case of the United States issues related with weight are considered of primary concern, as more than one third of the population in the country is currently considered obese.==== In this regard, Blouin et al. (2009); Offer et al. (2010); Ritzer and Malone (2000) and Courtemanche and Carden (2011), among others, argue that a major factor in promoting poorer quality foods that lead to changes in tastes and obesity is the rapid growth of fast food chains and big retailers.====In this context, our paper focuses on the causal link between recreational marijuana laws and consumption of snack foods using micro data in the form of retail scanner data on monthly purchases of products in grocery, convenience, drug, or mass distribution stores in over two thousand U.S. counties over the period 2006–2016 and that until recently had not been previously used to study these issues (Baggio et al., 2020a, 2020b). Since the data come from retailers, our measures of consumption do not suffer from potential bias resulting from underreporting issues of self-reporting frequent times present in surveys. In addition, the retail scanner data offer a broad and detailed coverage of both sales and volume across counties in the United States, which allow us to also apply a contiguous-county estimation approach across RML and non-RML states along the lines of recent work by Dube et al. (2010) and Baggio et al. (2020a, 2020b) who show that this approach greatly increases precision and reduces bias by allowing for a finer control for spatial heterogeneity. From a methodological perspective, we exploit differences in the timing of the change in recreational marijuana laws among states and compare both the non-contiguous approach along with a contiguous method (Baggio et al., 2020a, 2020b). In addition, we test the robustness of our findings by applying placebo tests and, in particular, applying a synthetic control method, that appears to confirm our findings.====We find very strong evidence that marijuana consumption measured by RMLs causally impact the consumption of high caloric snack foods and may likely contribute to an increase in body-mass index rates in the population a rather relevant finding from the perspective of policymakers. This, regardless of whether we focus our analysis to contiguous counties, all counties, states, or when employing a counterfactual using synthetic methods. In the specific case of our preferred method, the use of contiguous counties, we find that RMLs causally increase the consumption of high caloric snack foods.====Our paper is organized as follows.

Exogenous variations in students’ home-to-school distance are exploited to address potential endogeneity in their boarding status. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that while boarding has little impact on students’ physical health (measured by height-for-age and BMI-for-age z-scores and hemoglobin concentration levels), it has a significantly detrimental effect on their mental health status, amounting to 0.455 standard deviations (SDs) of the distribution of scores on a Mental Health Test (a modified version of the Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale). The effect of boarding is more pronounced for students with relatively advantageous backgrounds. For example, boarding boys scored 0.544 ","China’s population control policies, along with its rapid economic development, have greatly reduced Chinese parents’ demand for children. As a consequence, the total fertility rate in rural China has declined by more than 60 % since the late 1970s.==== The number of children under age 17 also dropped rapidly from 410 million in 1982 to 345 million in 2000 (National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC, 1982, 2000). The shrinking population of school-age children since the early 1990s has led to substantial reductions in school enrollment in rural China (Chen et al., 2015). Small-scale enrollments and the resulting high teacher-to-student ratios have, in turn, caused substantial waste of the already-scarce educational resources in rural China (Ministry of Education, 2010).====In reaction to this problem, the Chinese government launched a national school merger program in 2001 (State Council, 2001; Liu et al., 2010). The key part of this program involved plans to close small primary schools in remote villages, especially non-complete primary schools and teaching points that had only 3 grades, and merge them with larger, complete primary schools (with all 6 grades) (Ministry of Education, 2010). Approximately 300,000 rural schools were then merged to bigger and better-equipped schools during the first decade of the new Millennium (Wang, 2017). While also accommodating nonboarding students, boarding schools have become the major platform of education provision and management in rural China since 2004: by 2015, the numbers of boarding students in rural primary schools had reached 9,550,000, accounting for 14.4 % of the total enrollments of rural primary schools (Ministry of Education, 2016).==== The 19th Congress of China, held in October 2017, further stressed the key role boarding schools ought to play in the development of China’s rural education system in the foreseeable future.==== Yet to better serve their mission, boarding schools need to first overcome a series of problems plaguing China’s rural education system, the most pressing one being poor child health (Yue et al., 2018).====While it is relatively easy to monitor students’ physical health status through more frequent and regular checkups, it is much more difficult to detect their mental health problems. Worse yet, if not discovered in time, mental health problems can lead to more serious consequences. A series of devastating suicide incidents stemming from students’ mental health issues occurring the early 2000s have since induced the Chinese government to devote considerable efforts to reducing mental health problems at all levels of schooling (Hesketh et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013). A question naturally arising in this context is: How does boarding, the new platform for education provision and management in rural China that may last for decades, affect students’ mental well-being?====The answer to this question is theoretically ambiguous. On the positive side, the collective living environment supervised by designated student-care staff at school may help ensure boarding students’ health and safety (Wang et al., 2017). School rules and teachers’ instruction may also help boarders develop more living skills and form healthier living habits (Liu, 2005). For students with disadvantaged backgrounds, living away from their disadvantaged home environment may improve their subjective well-being (Child, 2016; Martin et al., 2014). On the negative side, however, boarding implies a lack of close parental care, without which boarding students’ personalized emotional need may not be easily met. Homesickness, schooling-related stress, and lack of constant and continuous support from parents may also incur psychological costs (e.g. Fisher et al., 1986; Cookson, 2009). Since the relative strengths of these boarding-related effects are unclear in theory, how boarding affects students’ mental health is ultimately an empirical question.====Unfortunately, existing empirical evidence from China also fails to provide a conclusive answer. While some studies found significantly negative associations between boarding and students’ mental health outcomes (e.g. Du et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016), others found virtually no association between them (Zhou et al., 2018). As recently pointed out by Wang et al. (2016), the lack of a consensus in existing findings may be due to two methodological drawbacks: relatively small sample size and lack of exogenous variations to identify boarding effects.====To overcome these drawbacks, the present study employs a large dataset on 7606 students collected from 74 rural primary schools in two northwestern provinces of China (Ningxia and Qinghai) to estimate the causal effect of boarding on students’ mental health status, including subdimensions such as study anxiety, social anxiety, and loneliness, etc. (− effects of boarding on students’ physical health outcomes, including height, weight and hemoglobin concentration levels, are also examined for comparison and interpretation purposes). To address potential endogeneity in students’ boarding status, we exploit exogenous variations in their home-to-school distance to create an instrumental variable (IV) for it. Admittedly, this IV is not free of concerns, a major one being that home-to-school distance may capture the level of prosperity of one’s home village relative to his/her school location, thereby confounding the effect of boarding. For instance, students who grew up in well-developed villages may be physically and mentally healthier than those who grew up in remote and less-developed villages, regardless of their boarding status. We address this concern by (1) controlling for school fixed effects, and (2) restricting our analysis to the sample of students with a relatively short home-to-school distance (≤ 3 km). The rationale is that, conditional on the school being attended, identification of boarding effects comes from ====-school variations in students’ home-to-school distance, which are unlikely to capture the influence of home-village prosperity when the focus is placed on students with a short home-to-school distance. Our IV estimates suggest that while boarding has a negligible effect on students’ physical health, it has a significantly negative effect on their mental health status.====Our study makes two contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to identify causal effects of boarding on students’ mental health outcomes in the context of (rural) China. To measure students’ mental health status, we administered a mental health test, adapted from the widely-used Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale originally developed by Reynolds (1980), to all sampled students, assessing their mental well-being in eight subdimensions including study anxiety, social anxiety, loneliness, self-punishment, physical anxiety symptoms, sensitivity, fear and impulsiveness. This test helps to depict a comprehensive profile of students’ mental health status in rural northwestern China and assess how boarding affects it. Second, our analysis provides new evidence on the education-health nexus from an often-overlooked angle. The majority of previous studies on this nexus have mainly focused on estimating the impact of the ==== of education (e.g. years of schooling or the highest degree earned) on one’s health behavior and outcomes (e.g. Arendt, 2005; De Walque, 2007;Groot and Maassen van den Brink, 2007; Albouy and Lequien, 2009; Braakmann, 2011; Zhong, 2016; Parinduri, 2017).==== Our study, in contrast, examines how boarding, as a ==== for education provision and management, affects one’s (mental) health.

Given the long-lasting consequences of poor infant health over the life cycle, our findings call for global efforts in the prevention and mitigation of conflict. Extra attention should be directed to children and women from disadvantaged backgrounds.","Armed conflict remains a threat not only to global peace but also to sustainable development. The world has witnessed an overall upward trend in the number of armed conflicts (Dupuy and Rustad, 2018). Approximately 90% of current conflict-related casualties involve civilians, which mostly consist of women and children (World Bank, 2011). Moreover, Alamir et al. (2018) estimate that, between 1960 and 2014, the global economic loss due to armed conflict accumulates to approximately US$26.8 trillion (in 2010 constant prices), representing 33% of the 2014 global Gross Domestic Product (GDP).====Previous studies show that the costs of armed conflict are atrocious and far-reaching. The apparent cost is the loss of lives and permanent injuries (Dunne et al., 2013). By impeding capital accumulation, armed conflict can also depress production capacity and lower economic growth (Sachs, 2008, Dunne et al., 2013). Conflict can further worsen health outcomes, decrease educational attainment, as well as reduce future earnings for exposed individuals (Bundervoet et al., 2009, Bruck et al., 2019, Le and Nguyen, 2020a). To make matters worse, it is possible for the negative ramifications of armed conflict to be passed on to the second generation. In particular, by imposing acute physical and psychological distress on pregnant women, armed conflict can imperil the babies in utero, leading to poor birth outcomes (Mansour and Rees, 2012, Bruck et al., 2017).====This paper investigates how intrauterine exposure to armed conflict affects infant health proxied by birth weight outcomes for 53 developing countries experiencing conflict during the period of 1990–2018. By examining the intergenerational effects of armed conflict, the study makes three contributions to the literature. First, we estimate the hidden yet persistent cost of conflict, the cost to human capital formation of the future generation, whereas much focus has been placed on individuals directly affected by conflict (Bruck et al., 2017). Second, instead of targeting one single country, we explore the intergenerational consequences of armed conflict in the context of 53 developing countries across five continents over nearly three decades. The wide coverage in both spatial and temporal dimensions lends external validity to our estimated cost of conflict to early human capital. Finally, given the mixed evidence on the relative importance of the exposure timing, we further contribute to the literature by accounting for the timing of utero exposure to armed conflict. Our findings support the importance of the first trimester.====In terms of identification, we adopt the difference-in-differences (DiD) approach across districts and conception months-years to estimate the impacts of utero exposure to armed conflict on birth weight outcomes. In other words, we compare the birth weight outcomes of children born to mothers exposed to armed conflict during pregnancy with those born to mothers unexposed to such events during pregnancy within the same district, relative to the analogous differences for mothers residing in a different district. Our primary data sources are the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Geo-referenced Event Dataset (UCDP-GED) and the Demographic and Health Surveys supplemented with GPS datasets (DHS-GPS). The UCDP-GED is a comprehensive dataset on armed conflict worldwide. The DHS-GPS provides us with rich information on mothers and children as well as their geographic locations.====Our study reaches the following findings. Intrauterine exposure to armed conflict in early pregnancy imposes adverse ramifications on newborn health proxied by birth weight outcomes. Specifically, exposure to armed conflict during the first trimester in utero reduces the child's weight at birth by 2.8% and raises the probability of the infant having low birth weight by 3.2 percentage points.==== Besides, infants born to poor and low educated mothers are especially vulnerable to the detrimental repercussions of armed conflict. Particularly, poor mothers exposed to armed conflict during the first trimester are more likely to give birth to low birth weight infants by 5.7 percentage points while the effect on non-poor mothers is much smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant. The incidence of low birth weight is 4 percentage points higher for women with low education (educational attainment is below the secondary level) whereas there is no such negative effect for higher educated women. The results demonstrate the vulnerability to armed conflict of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.====The paper offers meaningful implications for policy. Our findings represent the serious but less visible cost of conflict. Specifically, the deteriorating impacts on birth weight outcomes underline the detrimental ramifications of armed conflict on long-term human capital since poor infant health can leave persistent consequences over the life cycle such as higher susceptibility to diseases, lower educational attainment, and worsening labor market outcome (Reyes and Manalich, 2005, Black et al., 2007, Oreopoulos et al., 2008, Xie et al., 2019). As a result, the paper calls for global efforts in the prevention of conflict. Intervention measures to mitigate the impacts of on-going conflict and post-conflict reconstruction initiatives are also important to deal with the cost of conflict. Extra attention should be directed to children and women from disadvantaged backgrounds since this is the most vulnerable group.====The paper proceeds as follows.

We estimate the impacts of shifts in school nutritional standards on dietary quality as well as dietary quantity of children’s food intakes from school and away-from-school food sources. We find the average effect of consuming school food, rather than away-from-school food, on children’s overall dietary quality significantly increased from the pre- to post-HHFKA implementation period. This effect was solely driven by substantial improvements in the dietary quality of foods acquired at school, mainly among older and higher-income children. Our indirect effect analysis indicated that children shifted towards consuming lower-quality diets at home in the post-HHFKA period, thereby partially offsetting the positive effects of the HHFKA on their overall dietary quality. Indirect impacts were primarily driven by a subset of children consuming more than a third of their daily calories from school food. Additionally, we find suggestive evidence of a modest decrease in daily ==== intake, particularly among older and higher-income children. Together, our findings imply that the HHFKA, despite its unintended negative indirect effects, led children to consume more-nutritious, less-energy-dense diets.","Healthy dietary quality in childhood is essential for proper physical and cognitive development of children (Glewwe and King, 2001; Marshall et al., 2014; Frisvold, 2015) as well as for preventing a variety of adverse health outcomes such as childhood obesity (Epstein et al., 2001, 2008; Nunn et al., 2009). To promote adequate nutrition among school children, particularly those from low-income households, federally subsidized school lunch and breakfast programs serve about 30 million lunches and 15 million breakfasts to students each school day (USDA, 2019).====The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010 marked the most sweeping changes to the school nutritional standards in 15 years. The new rules officially went into effect in the 2012−13 school year for school lunches and in the 2013−14 school year for breakfasts, resulting in the increased availability of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, while decreasing sodium and saturated fats and allowing only fat-free/low-fat milk (Marcason, 2012; USDA-FNS, 2012). The primary purpose of this paper is to examine how changes in school nutritional standards affected dietary quality (measured by the Healthy Eating Index 2010) as well as dietary quantity (i.e., calorie intake) of school children’s food intakes from different food acquisition sources (e.g., school vs. away-from-school food sources).====Previous evaluations of the dietary impacts of the HHFKA, typically small localized studies, showed that the new nutritional standards were associated with improvements in the quality of school foods offered (Terry-McElrath et al., 2015), selected and consumed (Bergman et al., 2014; Cohen et al., 2014; Cullen et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Cohen et al., 2019), while not having an adverse impact on the plate waste (Schwartz et al., 2015) or school meal program participation rates (Johnson et al., 2016; Vaudrin et al., 2018). Recently, using national-level data, Gearan and Fox (2020) documented significant improvements in the quality of school food ==== after implementation of the HHFKA.==== However, they did not investigate the impact on the dietary quality of children’s food ==== (the amount and kinds of foods children actually eat at school). More recently, Smith et al. (2020) estimated the effects of the HHFKA across the distribution of the overall dietary quality of students’ food intakes and found significant gains were made across the entire spectrum from low- to high-quality diets.====Yet, earlier studies have not examined whether the improvements in the overall dietary quality of students were merely driven by direct effects of HHFKA on the quality of foods obtained at school or whether the away-from-school dietary quality of students was also affected. On any given school day, children consume 30 %–50 % of their daily calories from school foods (Schanzenbach, 2009). As such, the school food environment accounts for a major part of the overall food environment that children experience (Frisvold and Price, 2019). Thus, substantial changes in the quality and types of foods offered at school may influence the away-from-school consumption behaviors of children or their parents. For instance, the dietary habit formation that can occur through repeated exposure to school food may lead children to be more receptive to some foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) at home (see, e.g., Birch, 1999; Benton, 2004; Dovey et al., 2008). Alternatively, children may choose to lower at-home consumption of some foods (e.g., whole grains) that have already been consumed at school. It is also possible that parents may let their children consume less-healthy foods when they eat healthy school foods. Therefore, it is essential to examine changes in dietary quality of children across food acquisition sources.====Additionally, no study has examined the differential effects of the HHFKA on dietary quality of children acquiring different shares of their daily calories from school food. Allowing for this kind of heterogeneity is important because some children rely more heavily on school food than others. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no national-level study has investigated the impacts of the HHHKA on children’s calorie intake. This is a limitation because, as we will discuss below, the HHFKA, among other changes, specified new calorie guidelines for schools to further address concerns about childhood obesity (USDA-FNS, 2012).====This study advances what we know about the HHFKA in three ways. First, using a nationally representative sample of children from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examine the ====, ====, and ==== effects of the HHFKA on dietary quality of children’s food intake. The overall effect analysis explores the impacts on the dietary quality of food intakes from ==== food acquisition sources (i.e., both school and away from school). The direct effect analysis focuses on the dietary quality of foods obtained from the school cafeteria. The indirect (spillover) effect analysis investigates the impacts on the diet quality of foods acquired from the away-from-school food sources (e.g., home, restaurants, fast food establishments). Although Smith et al. (2020) analysis of changes in the overall dietary quality accounts for the notion of indirect effects, their approach can neither identify the presence nor the direction (i.e., positive or negative) of potential indirect effects.====Second, we allow for heterogeneity in the effects of HHFKA based on the share of daily calories received from school foods, to assess if there was a “dose-response” relationship. Here, we explore if children consuming less than one-third of their daily calories (roughly one meal) from school food were affected differently from those receiving more than one-third of their daily calories, compared to those not consuming school foods.==== Third, we examine changes in caloric intake. To draw a more comprehensive picture of the extent of the nutritional effects of HHFKA, in addition to analyzing the full sample of school children, we explore heterogeneity by school grade (i.e., K-5 vs. 6−12) as well as income status (i.e., low income vs. high income).====Our main identification strategy focuses on comparing the effects of consuming school food, rather than away-from-school food, on children’s dietary outcomes before and after the HHFKA implementation. To account for endogeneity of school food participation (Bhattacharya et al., 2006; Millimet et al., 2010), we use two-day dietary intake data from the 2009–2016 NHANES and exploit within-child variation to control for fixed unobserved and observed confounders associated with school food consumption and dietary outcomes (e.g., food preferences, parental characteristics, school environment, income, age, gender), as done elsewhere (Gleason and Suitor, 2003; Bowman et al., 2004; Mancino et al., 2009; Powell and Nguyen, 2013; Smith, 2017; Smith et al., 2020).====Consistent with Smith et al. (2020), we find that the average effect of consuming school food, relative to away-from-school food, on the overall dietary quality of students significantly increased from the pre-HHFKA (2009−12) to post-HHFKA period (2013−16). This improvement was solely driven by HHFKA’s direct effects on the quality of foods acquired from school, primarily among older and higher-income students. The indirect effect analysis indicated a shift towards the consumption of lower quality diets at home in the post-HHKA period, mostly among children eating more than one school meal. However, the negative indirect effects were not large enough to completely offset the direct impact of the HHFKA. We also find suggestive evidence of a reduction in daily calorie consumption, mainly among older and higher-income children. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite its unintended negative consequences, the HHFKA helped children consume more-nutritious, less-energy-dense diets.",The New school food standards and nutrition of school children: Direct and Indirect Effect Analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X2030188X,29 July 2020,2020,Research Article,45.0

By beverage type, price increases were highest for energy beverages and soda and lowest for bottled coffee and juice drinks. Prices of some non-taxed beverages also increased while the prices of select healthy foods generally did not. The sweetened beverage tax in Seattle is higher than beverage taxes in most other cities, and nearly the full cost of the tax is being passed through to consumers for many beverage types and stores types.","Sugar-sweetened beverage taxes have been implemented in seven U.S. cities and in approximately 35 countries (Healthy Food America, 2020). These taxes are hypothesized to affect consumption by raising prices, thus prompting decreased demand for sweetened beverages. The majority of the beverage taxes in U.S. cities have been excise taxes levied on distributors (Change Lab Solutions and Healthy Food America, 2016). The only legal requirement of these excise taxes is that the distributor remit the tax to the tax collector. Distributors and retailers decide how much, if any, of the tax is passed onto the consumer via higher prices. It is therefore important to examine the degree to which prices of beverages increase in response to the tax in order to determine whether consumers are experiencing increased prices for taxed products (Powell et al., 2013).====Distributors may handle beverage taxes differently depending on the local consumer base, and distributors’ strategies may change over time, depending on consumer response. Previous studies have found a wide range of impacts on beverage prices from beverage taxes (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017; Cawley et al., 2018a, 2018b; Falbe et al., 2015; Grogger, 2017; Roberto et al., 2019). Estimates suggest that the tax “pass-through,” or how much of the tax is passed on to consumers, was approximately 40–70 % in Berkeley, CA (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017; Falbe et al., 2015), 60 % in Oakland, CA (Cawley et al., 2020), 120 % in Cook County (Powell et al., 2020), 80 % in Boulder, CO (Cawley et al., 2018a, 2018b), and 40–100 % in Philadelphia, PA (Cawley et al., 2019; Roberto et al., 2019). Additionally, one recent study evaluated pass-through in Seattle using point-of-sale purchase data and found an average of approximately 60 % pass through (Powell and Leider, 2020).====The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax on prices of taxed and non-taxed beverages using data from in-person audits of a variety of stores and eating places. Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax went into effect on January 1, 2018; it is an excise tax levied on distributors and is one of the largest taxes among U.S. cities at 1.75 cents per ounce and affects only sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition to the tax affecting the price of beverages subject to the tax, distributors or retailers may respond to the tax by spreading it across non-taxed beverages and other food items as well (Brand, 2018). To assess this, we collected prices of taxed and non-taxed beverages, as well as prices of a sample of fresh and packaged foods, through audits of 407 stores and eating places in Seattle and a comparison area, both before tax implementation (2017) and 6-months post-tax (2018). Our sample includes supermarkets and superstores, medium-sized grocery stores, chain and non-chain convenience stores, drug stores, chain and non-chain quick service restaurants, and coffee shops.","Impact of a sweetened beverage tax on beverage prices in Seattle, WA",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301878,23 July 2020,2020,Research Article,46.0

Children born to young mothers (child brides in Bangladesh) suffer from higher mortality in the first year of life than their siblings born later. The survival chances of children born to mothers aged 15−49 years are 48–81 % higher in infant period as compared to their siblings born in mother’s early adolescence (10−14 years). In poor households, these survival effects extend up to the fifth birthday, especially in the poorest households or among uneducated mothers. This evidence points towards a biological channel, probably low birth weight, as the main contributing factor in the first year of life. In the post-infant period, favorable socio-economic factors (wealth, education) seem to compensate the biological disadvantage of adolescent births. Adolescent pregnancies lead annually to estimated 18,700 under-5 deaths in Bangladesh.","Elevated rates of adolescent childbearing remain a pervasive problem in developing countries even in the 21st century. In some contexts, such as South Asia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a large share of teenage pregnancies is a direct consequence of child marriages. According to UNFPA (2012), an estimated 34 % of young women in developing countries aged 20−24 were married before reaching 18 years of age, which corresponds to approximately 67 million women. As pregnancies and childbirths at an early age were shown to be negatively associated with mother’s and child’s health (Senderowitz, 1995), this paper focuses on the effects of adolescent pregnancies on early childhood mortality. The objectives are to estimate this relationship using a different method than previous studies, to consider different periods of early childhood separately, and to examine if important factors, such as maternal education and household wealth, could counteract the adverse effects of teenage pregnancies on child survival in different periods of child’s early life.====This research question is particularly relevant in Bangladesh, a developing country where adolescent pregnancies are frequent and are a direct consequence of child marriages, as 99.7 % of births to ever-married women take place in wedlock (own calculation using 2004 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data). Despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act from 1929, which established a minimum legal marriage age of 18 years for women (and 21 years for men), Bangladesh has the highest rate of child marriages in Asia and the third highest rate worldwide: 66 % of women aged 20−24 marry as children or adolescents (UNFPA, 2012). At the same time, Bangladesh has also relatively high rates of early childhood mortality, even though they have been decreasing: infant and under-5 mortality decreased from 66 to 52 and from 94 to 65 deaths per 1000 live births between 2000 and 2007, respectively (NIPORT, 2001, 2009). In the same period, the share of 20−24-year-old women who married at an extremely young age – before the age of 14 – decreased from 24.9% to 18.5% (Raj et al., 2012). Given these concurrent decreases in early childhood mortality and child marriages, it is of interest to investigate to which extent, and through which channels, early pregnancies impact children’s survival.====Previous literature has established that adolescent pregnancies and childbirths are associated with negative health outcomes for both the mother and the child. The mother faces an increased risk of premature labor, complications, and death during delivery (Senderowitz, 1995). Maternal mortality is substantially higher among adolescent mothers than among adult mothers (Zabin and Kiragu, 1998), and pregnancy-related deaths are the leading cause of mortality among adolescent girls (UN, 1991). If the girl survives the delivery, there is a high chance that she will suffer an injury, an infection or a serious health limitation, such as obstetric fistula (UNICEF, 2001). These problems are caused by both physical immaturity and poor socio-economic conditions that young mothers face, part of them being lack of antenatal and obstetric care (WHO, 1999). The children of adolescent mothers are at higher risk of low birth weight (Restrepo-Méndez et al., 2015) which is mainly associated with poor maternal nutrition of adolescent mothers during pregnancy (UNICEF, 2001). Low birth weight is, in turn, a frequent cause of infant deaths (McCormick, 1985; Sohely et al., 2001). Apart from bio-medical reasons, complementary channels linking adolescent pregnancies to higher early childhood mortality include insufficient access to maternal health care services and lack of experience in taking care of children among adolescent mothers.====Building on this literature and applying a different estimation method, this paper analyzes the relationship between adolescent childbearing and early childhood mortality in Bangladesh. If children born to young mothers suffer from higher mortality in early childhood due to biological factors, such as physical immaturity of mothers and the resulting low birth weight of children, then we should observe differential mortality rates not only between children born to adolescent and adult mothers, but also among siblings born to the same mother in her adolescence and adulthood. In the empirical model, this idea is implemented through regressions with mother fixed effects (i.e. “within” transformation at mother level) and other relevant controls such as birth order. Thus, I compare mortality outcomes of siblings born at different maternal ages, while controlling for all sibling-invariant characteristics. I show that children born to young mothers (i.e. child brides in the context of Bangladesh) suffer from higher mortality in the first year of life than their siblings born later on. In poor households, these effects extend beyond infancy, up to the fifth birthday. Maternal education can eliminate these extended effects in relatively poor but not in the poorest households. The effects are substantial in magnitude: for instance, the survival chances of children born to mothers aged 20−24 years are 64 %, 60 %, and 24 % higher in the neonatal, postneonatal, and child (1−5 years) period as compared to their older siblings who were born in mother’s young age (10−14 years). These effects either persist or become even larger when comparing adolescent maternal age (10−14) to older ages (25−29 up to 45−49). Importantly, the results are robust to inclusion of different cohorts of mothers and different parity children. In addition, the effects are the strongest among the youngest adolescents (10−12 years) and decrease in magnitude for older adolescents (13−15 and 16−18 years).====The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, I quantify the adverse effects of adolescent pregnancies on early childhood survival in a developing country context, using a large sample for better precision and eliminating multiple sources of endogeneity bias. I show that the eliminated bias is substantial among adolescent births and that my results are robust to sample choice.====Second, I provide suggestive evidence about underlying channels, and factors that could counteract the adverse survival effects of adolescent pregnancies. While household wealth and maternal education do not alter the negative relationship between adolescent births and child survival in ====, they counteract it in the ==== period. These results are in line with the hypothesis that adverse effects of adolescent pregnancies on child survival in the first year of life are of biological nature, e.g. related to the immaturity of young girls’ bodies and to low birth weight of their children. Beyond infancy, these negative effects seem to be offset by richer households or more educated mothers in relatively poor households, but not in the poorest households. This is consistent with a hypothesis that compensatory material investments into child health are effective in counteracting biologically induced, worse starting position of children born to adolescent mothers, but they become effective only in the post-infant period. Additionally, maternal knowledge seems to compensate for lack of such investments to some extent (in relatively poor households) but not completely (in poorest households).====Third, I estimate that approximately 9500 neonatal, 12,900 infant, and 18,700 under-5 deaths could be prevented ==== in Bangladesh if adolescent pregnancies were avoided. Since the vast majority of births in Bangladesh takes place within a marriage, the effects of adolescent childbearing on early childhood mortality estimated in this paper can be directly attributed to the practice of child marriages.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Next section presents the data and section 3 describes the empirical model.

Data from the 2013 National Health Survey (==== - PNS) were used and the inequality was calculated using the concentration index, which was decomposed to analyze the contribution of different factors (demographic, schooling, lifestyle, sanitation, among others). The analyses were stratified by gender and region, in order to identify some heterogeneity. The results for gender showed that the inequality in overweight and obesity in men is concentrated in the richest ones, whereas, for women, the indices did not show inequality. In the analyzes per region, the results showed the same pattern for men, and differences were found for women, suggesting that overweight is more concentrated in rich women in the less developed regions (North and Northeast) and in poor women in more developed regions (South, Southeast and Midwest). Income, demographics, schooling, and lifestyles are the factors that contributed most to the observed inequality. Public policy strategies should aim to reduce such persistence of overweight and obesity, but also seek equity and equality in health.","One of the largest public health problems that society faces in both developed and developing countries is excess weight, particularly overweight and obesity. From 1975 to 2016, global obesity increased nearly 3-fold (WHO, 2016). In 2016, approximately 39 % of the world's adults (18 years and over) were overweight (39 % of men and 40 % of women), and 13 % were obese (11 % of men and 15 % of women). Globally, overweight and obesity lead to the deaths of approximately 2.8 million adults annually (WHO, 2016).====Concern regarding the increased prevalence of excess weight is primarily due to its health consequences, because it represents an important risk factor for chronic noncommunicable diseases and behavioral and psychosocial morbidities (Lavie et al., 2018; WHO, 2016). However, the consequences go even further, by also affecting economic and social status, increasing health care costs, and reducing labor productivity, quality of life and social integration (Aizawa and Helble, 2017; Bhattacharya and Sood, 2011; Hammond and Levine, 2010; Rössner, 2002).====While the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is a public health problem worldwide, it is an even greater concern in developing countries, which have experienced the highest growth in recent years. According to Ng et al. (2014), approximately 62 % of overweight people in the world live in developing countries. Another concern is the distribution of these prevalence rates within these countries. The evidence shows that these rates are not evenly distributed among socioeconomic groups. In the vast majority of countries, poor health conditions, such as being overweight or obese, tend to be more concentrated in more vulnerable groups (Costa-Font and Gil, 2008; Stunkard and Sobal, 1989).====There is an extensive literature that seeks to analyze the association between socioeconomic status and overweight and obesity. The results observed for developed countries mostly suggest a negative association for the different measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, and occupation), i.e., the prevalence of overweight and obesity tends to decrease as socioeconomic status increases (Costa-Font and Gil, 2008; McLaren, 2007; Nayga, 2003). In developing countries, the result is different; according to Stunkard and Sobal (1989) and McLaren (2007), the association would be positive, namely, people with a higher socioeconomic status would be more likely to become obese or overweight.====In recent years, the prevalence of overweight has increased greatly in Brazil, affecting 43 % of the population in 2006 and reaching 53.8 % in 2016, for a 25 % increase. Regarding obesity, the increase is even greater, going from 11.8 % in 2006 to 18.9 % in 2016, a 60 % increase (Brasil, 2007, 2017).====Several studies have sought to analyze the problem of excess weight in Brazil. They have reported the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Brazilian population and its evolution over the years (Gigante et al., 2011; Lima et al., 2015; Malta et al., 2014, 2016).====There have been studies that analyzed the association between socioeconomic status and obesity, and they have shown different results by gender; there was a direct association for men and an inverse one for women (Gigante et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2015; Veloso and Silva, 2010). These studies provide some evidence of socioeconomic differences in the prevalence of excess weight, suggesting the existence of socioeconomic inequality. However, to the best of our knowledge, little attention has been paid to this issue to date, and few studies have sought to measure socioeconomic inequality in association with obesity in Brazil.==== To contribute to this line of inquiry, this study is intended to quantify socioeconomic inequality in overweight and obesity by calculating the concentration indices. The concentration index (CI) provides a more accurate and detailed picture of socioeconomic inequality than the regression analyses found in the literature (Aizawa and Helble, 2017). Moreover, we performed a decomposition with the aim of identifying the factors that contributed to the observed inequality. These analyses help to clarify the extent of the problem and can provide valuable information to support public policies aimed at reducing the prevalence and socioeconomic inequalities in excess weight (Brasil, 2017; Nikolaou and Nikolaou, 2008). Brazil is an interesting case study, given its broad income inequality, which reflects different levels of economic development in the five regions of the country. Studies have indicated that there are distinct patterns of health inequality between rich and poor communities, even within the same country (Marmot, 2007; Emamian et al., 2017). Therefore, in addition to the primary analysis, we also performed an analysis that was stratified by region, with the aim of testing whether the pattern of socioeconomic inequality is associated with the regional level of development.",Socioeconomic inequalities in obesity in Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301763,12 July 2020,2020,Research Article,48.0

Our findings suggest that the intergenerational transmission of parent’s overweight differs by children’s sex and is statistically different for fathers and mothers. Gender assortative overweight is stronger among pre-school age and school-aged children. The parent-child associations are large and precisely estimated, heterogeneous by children’s age and sex and stronger among white children and children of older parents. These results suggest there is a gender assortative intergenerational association of overweight.","The prevalence of overweight children is a growing health and socio-economic concern with far reaching consequences. Estimates from the International Association for the Study of Obesity indicate that the rates of overweight (including obesity) children aged 5–17 years in the United Kingdom (UK) are among the highest in Europe. Fig. 1 suggests that the prevalence of overweight children in England has increased dramatically between 1991–2009 decades, with the trend tailing off around 2005. Although this figure suggests a higher obesity rate increase among children aged 11–15 than among those that were younger, the trends are comparable.====Studies reviewing the heritability of overweight suggest that at least 50% of the variation is environmental (Herrera et al., 2011). Given that children, especially at younger ages, do not make autonomous health and food related choices, it is reasonable to hypothesize that that their caloric intake and level of physical activity correlates with that of their parents’ (Costa-Font and Gil, 2013). As early as three or four years of age, children’s eating patterns are already sensitive to environmental cues about food intake (Nicklas et al., 2001).====Nonetheless, we still have limited knowledge about the mechanisms underlying transmission of overweight. Currie and Moretti (2007) document evidence of the intergenerational transmission of birth weight from mothers and their children, even when controlling for sibling fixed effects. However, we do not know whether this effect remains at later ages, and whether maternal and paternal influences are systematically different for their male and female offspring. Evidence of ‘gender assortative’ transmission of overweight is relevant for the design of policy interventions, as parents might exert parental role modelling influences, and, more generally, spillover effects on child overweight. Empirical evidence can help disentangle how sensitive children’s overweight is to changes in parental overweight.====The main purpose of this paper is to provide evidence of gender specific inter-generational transmission of overweight (and obesity). To do so, we classify obesity and overweight of children based on the gender-age specific body mass index(BMI) cut-off points (Cole et al., 2000) and we run a comprehensive series of tests. Previous studies provide some evidence that the probability of obesity in adolescence increases when one of the parents is obese, and the effect is strengthened when both parents are obese (Coate, 1983; Hebebrand et al., 2000; Martin, 2008). The estimates of the intergenerational correlations typically range between 0.15 and 0.38 (Ahlburg, 1998; Classen, 2010; Classen and Thompson, 2016; Dolton and Xiao, 2015, 2017). However, the mechanisms underpinning the child –parent weight association are still largely ignored, and most comprehensive datasets are limited by the way they measure overweight (self-reported vs clinically measured), sample size and time span, as well as the information available to parents. Further, most research focusing on such mechanisms does not examine child obesity as a measure of interest (Coneus and Spiess, 2012).====A clear challenge for this line of research is that both parents often exhibit similar characteristics due to assortative mating. That is, individuals with similar genotypes and/or phenotypes (such as body size, cognitive abilities, age, education, etc.) are more likely to get together (Silventoinen et al., 2003). Thus, it is not always possible to truly distinguish the influence of the mother from that of the father. Our strategy to attempt to circumvent this problem is to distinguish parents that both are overweight from those that only one of them is. If the BMI association overweight among both parents is larger than the sum of estimates when only the father or only the mother are, this would be an indication that the combined overweight exhibits a multiplicative effect. Note, however, that the verification of this hypothesis would require controlling for which parent has the leading role in taking care of children. As the data we use does not have a time-use section specifying the involvement of each member of the household, we cannot bring add this extra layer of analysis. That said, in 90% of English households, women are the primary carers (ONS, 2017). Hence, in the majority of our sample, differential gender effects are not just measuring sex effects but carry the effect of gender culture.====To date, the evidence on gender assortative transmission of overweight is limited with some exceptions (Mostazir et al., 2014 and Ajala et al., 2011). A study using Danish data shows that the intergenerational transmission of overweight (BMI) remains stable in terms of mother to child whereas this correlation for father and child has increased over time (Ajslev et al., 2015). In contrast, a study using Finnish data for children born at the onset of the obesity epidemic revealed that paternal and maternal effects were stronger for daughters than for sons (Jääskeläinen et al., 2011). Other studies find that mother–child weight association is higher than the father-child equivalent (Whitaker et al., 1997). Finally, recent research suggests again that there has been an increase in the correlation of father and child obesity and even a reduction of the maternal link (Ajslev et al., 2015). Hence, the evidence is mixed and, for the most part, is based on a short time frame, not always converging the steeper rise in the obesity and overweight, and most studies fail to account for a rich enough set of relevant socio-economic controls that could mediate the effect. This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature.",Is the intergenerational transmission of overweight ‘gender assortative’?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301775,10 July 2020,2020,Research Article,49.0

We find that laterborns trust on average 5% less than their older siblings, independently from personality traits, family ties, risk aversion and parental inputs. Family random- and fixed-effects estimates suggest that the variation in trust is mostly explained by within- rather than between-family characteristics. The effect of birth order is mediated by education outcomes only for women, while it is moderated by mother’s education for the entire sample, thereby leading to relevant policy implications.","Trust in others is offered as an explanation for why societies succeed in many dimensions including growth (Algan and Cahuc, 2010; Zak and Knack, 2001), financial development (Guiso et al., 2004), economic exchange (Guiso et al., 2009), institutional quality (La Porta et al., 1997), innovation (Gulatim and Wang, 2003), and happiness (Bjørnskov, 2003; Helliwell et al., 2017; Conzo et al., 2017). While these studies mainly focus on the outcomes of trust, only a few number of papers look at its determinants. The inquiry into the roots of trust is nonetheless important since it can drive policy-makers towards interventions that ultimately raise societal trust, e.g. by identifying dimensions (e.g. education) and groups (e.g. women) for which these policies might be more effective. The present study contributes in this direction by focusing on the long-term effects of birth order on trust.====The economic theory of the family has traditionally framed fertility choices as a trade-off between ‘quality’ and ‘quantity’ of children (Becker, 1960). We deem trust an additional quality dimension that is worth exploring in a lifecycle perspective. In this regard, research in psychology has shown that trust is formed in the early stages of life (Erikson, 1950; Allport, 1961), depending on responsive caregiving (Crain, 2005) and on the type of attachment between infants and caregivers (Bowlby, 1979; Ainsworth and Bowlby, 1991). Mostly transmitted by parents during childhood (Dohmen et al., 2012), trust becomes an integral part of personality, and tends to change slowly thereafter as a result of experience (e.g. Uslaner, 2000). The importance of the household environment is further underlined by the growing evidence showing that two characteristics of the family where children grow old, i.e. family size and birth order, can predict their future success (e.g. Black et al., 2005a). To the best of our knowledge, for the first time in the literature, we examine whether the order of birth of a child predicts his/her future level of trust.====To this purpose, we draw hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms from diverse social disciplines, which drive us along four possible pathways from birth order to trust. First, the birth-order effect would originate from time or financial constraints leading to unequal parental investment in children’s human capital, of which trust might be a particular dimension or a separate, though complementary, outcome. The presence of more equal and better allocation of resources (proxied by the socio-economic status of the individuals both in childhood and in adulthood) may mediate the lower outcome obtained by later-born children. Second, in the psychological literature birth order is shown to produce differences in the personality traits that positively correlate with trust (openness and agreeableness). For instance, Sulloway (1996) hypothesizes that firstborns score higher than laterborns in conscientiousness and neuroticism, while rate lower on agreeableness, openness, and the sociability aspect of extraversion. This is might be a possible channel underlying the relationship between birth order and trust. Third, laterborn children tend to be more open to experience and ‘rebellion’ than firstborns, because the search for a valued family niche that is not occupied by older siblings makes them more prone to exploration (Sulloway, 1996, 2007). Hence, laterborns may develop a higher propensity to take risks and trust unknown persons. The fourth channel is the strength of family ties. Individuals without strong family ties may have more opportunities and a stronger motivation to deal with strangers in order to fulfill their need for social interactions, which is not satisfied within the family. Indeed, evidence that the strength of an individual’s family ties is inversely correlated with his trust in strangers has been provided (Ermish and Gambetta, 2010), suggesting that in presence of strong family ties individuals may develop a higher sense of security within such relations that compromise trust in strangers (Yamagishi and Yamagishi, 1994). Provided that birth order influences familial sentiment and that strong ties endanger generalized trust, having strong family ties therefore may mediate the relationship between birth order and trust. These potential explanations lead to alternative hypotheses about the sign of the relationship between birth order and trust, which we test in this paper.====We assess the birth-order effects on trust and the mechanisms outlined above by relying on retrospective information from the 13th wave of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We ascertain to what extent the birth-order effect on trust can be accounted for parental inputs or by other children’s outcomes. Through measures of risk aversion, personality traits and family ties retrieved from other waves, we also assess if any of these forces drives the birth-order effect, and investigate heterogeneous effects by gender. Since sibship size is likely correlated with unobserved parental attributes and children’s outcomes, we use a measure of birth order that is independent from sibship size and allows for parsimonious estimates.====We find that birth order is negatively associated with trust, i.e. respondents born later report lower levels of trust. While parental investments partially account for the birth-order effect on trust, other channels play a negligible role. Family fixed- or random-effects estimates highlight that what matters in explaining the birth-order effect on trust has to be searched for in the individual differences within the family or in the change in parenting style across siblings, rather than in the stable characteristics of the familial environment. Furthermore, results are mainly driven by male respondents, while the effect of birth order for women seems to be mediated by education outcomes. High mother’s education offsets the negative birth-order effect, thereby leading to relevant policy implications.",Blessed are the first: The long-term effect of birth order on trust,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301751,8 July 2020,2020,Research Article,50.0

We study this question in the context of a French reform that reduced the standard workweek from 39 to 35 hours, at constant earnings. Our empirical analysis exploits arguably exogenous variation in the reduction of working time across employers due to the reform. We find that the shorter workweek reduced smoking by six percentage points, corresponding to 16% of the baseline mean. The reform also appears to have lowered BMI and increased self-reported health, but these effects are imprecisely estimated in the overall sample. A heterogeneity analysis provides suggestive evidence that while the impact on smoking was concentrated among blue-collar workers, ==== decreased only among white-collar workers. These results suggest that policies which reduce working time could potentially lead to important health benefits.","Does working time affect workers’ health? Data from employee surveys suggest so: for example, in a recent study of European workers, the share of respondents who stated that their work negatively affects their health rose monotonically from 19% for those working less than 30 hours per week to 30% for those working at least 40 hours per week.==== Perceived negative health impacts from work also motivated the change to a 6-hour workday, at constant earnings, by some Swedish employers, a decision that received extensive international media coverage.==== From a theoretical point of view, working time may affect health because of potential direct impacts on the job, such as physically strenuous work leading to exhaustion, or because of potential indirect impacts due to the effects of working hours on income and the time available for health production at home.====Empirical studies of the effect of working time on health face two fundamental challenges. First, working hours are not randomly assigned, introducing bias into any naive regression estimate of the impact of hours. This bias may be due to omitted unobserved factors that influence both hours and health, or due to reverse causality, whereby health affects hours rather than the other way around. Second, estimates of the impact of working time are usually confounded by the influence of hours on income, which has an important independent effect on health (e.g. Frijters et al., 2005, Lindahl, 2005). Both for determining the importance of working time as an input into health production and from a policy perspective, however, the effect of working hours on health keeping income constant is particularly relevant.====In this paper, we study the impact of working hours on health behavior and health in the context of a French workweek reform which allows us to address both of these challenges. Introduced by the socialist government in 1998, the reform reduced the standard workweek from 39 to 35 hours, at constant earnings. Importantly, the laws mandating this reduction included different deadlines for implementation for firms of different sizes, which led to substantial employer-level variation in working time in subsequent years. These policy-driven, exogenous changes in working time, together with the absence of income effects, make the French context uniquely suited to study the impact of working hours on health.====Our empirical analysis draws on data from a longitudinal health survey, which allows us to follow a sample of male workers from the pre-reform to the post-reform period, namely from 1998 to 2002. For each worker, we observe whether his employer had implemented the shorter workweek by the year 2002, and we use this information to create our binary treatment variable. Our main outcome variables are self-reported measures of smoking behavior, body mass index (BMI), and health status. Notably, smoking and high BMI are among the leading preventable causes of death, and both outcomes have been widely studied in the medical literature on the impacts of working time, yielding mixed results (e.g. Lallukka et al., 2008).====We first estimate the impacts of the workweek reform in a difference-in-differences framework, comparing the evolution of health outcomes of workers in treated and control firms. Our regressions control for individual fixed effects and assume that working in a treated firm in 2002 is orthogonal to changes in other determinants of health between 1998 and 2002. As a complementary strategy, we also present results from lagged dependent variable models, which directly exploit the longitudinal dimension of the data. These regressions instead rely on the assumption that conditional on pre-reform health and controls, the treatment is as good as randomly assigned. Finally, we also run difference-in-differences and lagged dependent variable regressions in which we instrument actual hours worked with our treatment variable; under the additional assumption that the workweek reform affected health only via its impact on working time, these specifications identify the causal effect of working hours on health.====The results show that the reform reduced smoking among treated workers by six percentage points, corresponding to 16% of the baseline mean. Under the exclusion restriction mentioned in the previous paragraph, this translates to an increase in smoking by 1.6–2.4 percentage points per additional hour of work in our instrumental variable estimates. The results further suggest that the reform slightly lowered treated workers’ BMI and improved their self-reported health, but these effects are imprecisely estimated in the overall sample. Finally, a heterogeneity analysis provides suggestive evidence that while the impact on smoking is concentrated among blue-collar workers, the reform significantly lowered BMI only among white-collar workers.====A potential concern with our results is that they might be due to selection of healthier workers into treated firms or that they are otherwise confounded by unobserved differences between treated and non-treated workers. We address this issue in two main ways. First, we show that our estimates are similar when we concentrate on a matched sample of workers with comparable socio-demographic and job characteristics. Second, using the method developed by Oster (2019), we show that selection based on unobserved factors would need to be at least eight times as large as selection based on observed control variables to explain away the impact on smoking. The results from these sensitivity checks thus support a causal interpretation of our estimates.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and discusses the contribution of our study. Section 3 describes the institutional background. Section 4 presents the data and Section 5 outlines our empirical strategy. Our main results are discussed in Section 6, with robustness analyses presented in Section 7.

The 2SLS results are robust to a wide range of robustness tests. Potential mechanisms explaining the strong joint welfare effect of conflict and adverse shocks are the failure of economic coping strategies in areas of violence and restricted access to public goods and services.,"Households in developing countries have to cope with a myriad of uncertain events, some of which may happen simultaneously. One important example is the interplay between climatic shocks and violent conflict, which has received increasing attention in the last few years. Events such as the floods in Pakistan in 2010–2011 and the 2011 drought-induced famine in east Africa have raised awareness about potential interactions between political insecurity, economic vulnerability and the impact of natural disasters (Harris et al., 2013). In the period between 2005 and 2009, more than 50% of people affected by natural disasters lived in conflict-affected countries. This number was around 80% in 2006 and 2008 (Kellett and Sparks, 2012).====Although the extent to which conflict and disasters interact differs across countries and contexts, in general, people living in fragile and conflict-affected states find it harder to cope with natural disasters given the impact of violence and instability on health, basic service provision, social cohesion, mobility opportunities and livelihoods (Buchanan-Smith and Christoplos, 2004, Christoplos, 2004, Eriksen and Lind, 2009, Jaspars and O’allaghan, 2010, UNDP, 2011). Existing evidence on how individuals, households and communities cope simultaneously with violence, natural disasters and other covariate and idiosyncratic shocks is, however, largely anecdotal and descriptive. This is partially due to lack of data, but also to challenges in identifying empirical causal effects when endogeneity biases may be potentially large.====The objective of this paper is to address this gap in the literature by analyzing the combined effect of exposure to political violence to a household covariate climatic shock (drought) and an idiosyncratic shock (illness) on child nutrition. The context of the analysis is the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, which was for several decades affected by a left-wing (Naxal) guerrilla insurgency. Households in Andhra Pradesh face in addition cyclical climatic shocks and routine health shocks that affect the nutrition levels of their children, often quite severely (Krishna, 2006).====The empirical analysis makes use of the Young Lives longitudinal survey conducted in the state of Andhra Pradesh in 2002 and in 2006–2007. We match this data to an original conflict event dataset at the sub-district (mandal) level we have compiled. Our main identification strategy is based on an instrumental variable approach that makes use of the fact that Naxal insurgents use forest cover in order to avoid detection from state troops.====We find that household exposure to drought and illness in areas of violent conflict exerts a strong long-term adverse impact on children's nutrition outcomes. We also find that political violence negatively affects short-term nutritional status of children but exposure to conflict does not affect long-term nutrition outcomes significantly on its own. Further analysis on potential mechanisms suggests that the adverse combined effect of conflict and negative shocks on child nutrition outcomes may be explained by the levels of isolation faced by households in insurgency areas, which affect the portfolio of coping strategies (use of savings, sale of productive assets, temporary migration etc) available to them and restricts access to public goods and programs during periods of drought.====These results offer a new important contribution to a well-established literature in development economics on the welfare effects of individual covariant and idiosyncratic shocks (Dercon, 2004, Dercon et al., 2005, Christiaensen et al., 2007). This paper also speaks to an emergent literature on multiple shocks (Lazzaroni and Wagner, 2016) and on the role of social protection in mitigating the effect of adverse shocks in early childhood (Gunnsteinsson et al., 2014, Adhvaryu et al., 2016, Duque et al., 2017, Garg et al., 2016). This literature has for its large part remained firmly within the economics domain, without much discussion as to how the determinants of household vulnerability and poverty, as well as the ways in which households cope with economic shocks, may depend on political constraints. Notably, political conflicts drastically change the institutional environment of contested areas (Justino, 2012, Justino et al., 2013). In this paper, we show how political violence may affect the ability of households to cope with other shocks due to isolation and fear leading to failures in common economic coping strategies and restrictions to the provision of public goods.====The paper complements also what amounts now to a substantial literature on the effects of political violence on human capital outcomes, including child nutrition. Overall, evidence shows that this impact has been largely negative (Bundervoet and Verwimp, 2005, Akresh et al., 2007, Bundervoet et al., 2009, Guerrero-Serdan, 2009, Minoiu and Shemyakina, 2014) and persistent (Alderman et al., 2006, Akbulut-Yuksel, 2014, Akresh et al., 2012, Domingues and Barre, 2013). Most of these studies have suggested that the adverse effects of violent conflict on child nutrition outcomes may be largely caused by the inability of households to cope with second-order effects of the conflict, including the imposition of economic embargoes (Bundervoet and Verwimp, 2005), famine (Alderman et al., 2006, Akresh et al., 2012), the spread of disease (Bundervoet and Verwimp, 2005) and the rise of food prices (Minoiu and Shemyakina, 2014). The precise identification of these mechanisms has remained elusive because it is usually difficult to clearly attribute the causal effects of conflict at the micro-level to precise wider institutional and economic changes that may take place simultaneously. Our paper complements this literature in that we are able to make use of original, detailed information on political violence at a very disaggregated level, and to make use of an instrumental variable strategy to illustrate the causal effect of conflict on child nutrition outcomes through its impact on the ability of households to cope with adverse shocks.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the Naxal insurgency in India and in Andhra Pradesh. In Section 3, we discuss the datasets and variables we use in the paper and Section 4 present the empirical strategy. The main results of the paper are presented and analyzed in Section 5. Section 6 further establishes the robustness of the instrumental variable estimates. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying our results in Section 7.

Using data collected before and after the tax increase from a novel smoker survey (DEICS-Col), the impact is estimated as the change in the probability that a smoker has illicit cigarettes. The methodology follows a difference-in-differences strategy, measuring the year-to-year variation of the proportion of illicit cigarettes between smokers who report buying low-priced cigarettes (the highest treatment intensity) and those who bought high-priced cigarettes (lowest treatment intensity). Estimations of the impact show an average increase of 4–5 percentage points on the proportion of illicit cigarettes relative to an initial penetration of low-priced illicit cigarettes of nearly 5.1 %.","Substantial excise taxes on cigarettes can be justified as efficient Pigouvian taxes because they help consumers to internalize the external costs on individual and public health (Gruber and Koszegi, 2004; Hines, 2007). As higher taxes increase prices, price differentials between licit and illicit goods raise the issue of potential increases of illicit trade in discussions of consumption-based tax policies. In tobacco control, Illicit Cigarette Trade (ICT) is an area of concern for policymakers because it limits the effects of packaging regulation and makes cigarettes more affordable, stimulating higher consumption and undermining the public health goal of reduced exposure. It also reduces the tax revenues derived from tobacco taxation (Merriman, 2010; Chaloupka et al., 2012; Chernick and Merriman, 2013; DeCicca et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016).====Policymakers’ concerns about ICT are even broader in economies where shadow markets play an important role in economic activity (Schneider and Enste, 2013) through both legal (informal sector) and illegal activities (money laundering) because shadow markets can expedite availability and affordability of illicit cigarettes. Scientific evidence on the effect of tobacco taxes on ICT is pivotal evidence to support further tax increases, as the risk of enormous increases of ICT is one of the countervailing effects normally cited against these policies during parliamentary debates (Chaloupka et al., 2012; Van Walbeek et al., 2012; Chaloupka, 2014; Kleiman et al., 2016).====Despite the need for evidence to support further progress on tobacco tax increases, the literature on this area is rather scarce, especially for developing countries where fears of increases of illicit cigarette trade are pervasive in policy discussions due to the prominence of shadow markets. Current research on this area for low and middle income countries focuses on estimations of Penetration of Illicit Cigarettes (PIC) and a description of changes of PIC when tax reforms are implemented (Iglesias et al., 2017; Szklo et al., 2018; Paraje, 2018).==== This paper estimates the portion of the increase on consumption of illicit cigarette trade that can be related to Colombia’s tobacco tax hike in 2016. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to fill the gap in the literature by providing an estimate of the link between tobacco taxes and illicit cigarette trade. Colombia is a relevant case because is a country where the shadow economy represents nearly half of the GDP (Schneider and Hametner, 2014) and it has relatively low cigarette prices, giving it substantial space for further tax increases (Fig. 1).====In 2016, the average price of a 20-cigarette pack was around $2,950 Colombian pesos -COP- (around US$1), including an excise tax of COP$700, and Law 1819 of December 2016 increased the excise tax to COP$1,400 in 2017. We use information from the Demand for Illicit Cigarettes Survey in Colombia (DEICS-COL) (Maldonado et al., 2018), a novel data source that surveyed smokers before (2016) and after (2017) the tax increase in the five largest markets (cities) for cigarettes in Colombia==== to estimate the demand for ICT. Thus, our estimates of PIC are based on observing smokers’ cigarette sticks or packs, their brands and price (Maldonado et al., 2018). To control for the potential selection of smokers, the place and time of the interviews and the gender and age range of respondents were kept constant between both surveys.====In Colombia tobacco taxes, as well as other tobacco control policies such as smoke-free areas and bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, are implemented at the national level. Therefore, year-to-year differences in PIC may result from an on-going trend, or macroeconomic shocks as well as changes in tobacco taxation. For that reason, we cannot exploit exogenous tax differences within county borders to study illicit trade as is done in many studies of the U.S. (Merriman, 2010; Chernick and Merriman, 2013). Instead, our estimates are based on treatment intensity: as this is an excise tax, it increases the relative prices of low-priced cigarettes more than it does on high-priced cigarettes. In other words, the per pack tax increase represented a much larger percentage increase in after-tax prices of low-priced cigarettes as compared to high-priced cigarettes. For instance, for a low priced 20-cigarette pack (0.5 times the mean price) whose price is around COP$1,500, the tax increase from COP$700 to COP$1,400 is expected to increase price in 46%46 % to 2,200 ( = 1,500 + 700); meanwhile, for a high-priced pack (1.5 times the mean price) whose price is around COP$4,500 the tax is expected to increase price in 15.5 %–5200 ( = 4,500 + 700). Since the tax increase caused a higher percentage increase in the price of low-priced licit cigarettes, it is expected to see greater reactions in low-priced markets. We exploit this fact to construct a difference-in-differences (DiD) estimate of the impact of the tax increase. One possible reaction to a price increase is an expansion of ICT, and differences in treatment intensity suggest that a higher increase in illicit trade is expected for low-priced relative to high-priced cigarettes. The estimates presented in this paper represent the impact of the tax as the difference in the year-to-year variation of the proportion of ICT of low-priced relative to high-priced cigarettes.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, the data and descriptive statistics are presented. Second, the empirical strategy is described. Third, the results are presented.

This epidemic proportion makes obesity the most common chronic disease among children with short and long-term adverse effects on both affected children and society. This research examines the effect of the extensive and intensive margins of parental employment on children’s body mass index (BMI) z-score and likelihood of belonging to different weight status categories in Scotland. We also investigate some mechanisms driving the relationship. The results suggest that there is a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI or the probability that a child is overweight or obese. Our analysis of the channels shows that this is attributable to the less time children spend doing physical activity and the more time they watch TV, the more the parents work. The findings are useful for the design of policies whose goal is to improve children’s weight outcomes given parental employment.","Pediatric obesity is a growing public health concern. One in three children in the European WHO member states is overweight or obese (World Health Organization, 2020). In Scotland and in the US, one in five children suffers from obesity (NHS Health Scotland, 2019; CDC, 2018), and about a third of the children living in the most deprived areas in Scotland have the disorder (NHS Health Scotland, 2019). In addition, the prevalence of this health issue has more than tripled worldwide since the 1970s causing an obesity epidemic (CDC, 2018). Obese children are more likely to be obese as adults, which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, type two diabetes, some types of cancer, mental disorders, orthopedic, social and psychological problems (World Health Organization, 2020, CDC, 2016).====The labor force participation rate of mothers has been increasing since the 1970s (BLS, 2010). Between 2000 and 2019, the employment rate of mothers and fathers in Scotland has increased from 66 % to 77 %, and from 89 % to 93 %, respectively. In approximately 73 % of the families, both parents were in the labor market in 2019, and about 30 % of both genders report difficulties with fulfilling adequate childcare responsibilities while working (Office of National Statistics, 2019).====With both childhood obesity rate and parental employment rising, it is important to examine whether there is a relationship between the two tendencies. Understanding the potential consequences of working more and an analysis of the mechanisms driving the relationship might help prevent and manage obesity at an early age.====This paper addresses the question of whether parental employment and hours worked are associated with children’s body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity. We also investigate several mechanisms which are likely to drive the above-mentioned relationship with an emphasis on physical activity and activities contributing to a less sedentary lifestyle. Specifically, we extend the body of literature on obesity and parental employment by estimating the impact of working and hours worked by both parents on the BMI of the child and the likelihood that (s)he has healthy weight, or suffers from overweight or obesity. We base our analysis on Scotland, a country which has not been previously examined in the context of childhood weight status and offers a rich data set which gives a stronger claim of causality than much of the prior literature. We finally discuss the policy implications of the findings.====The results suggest that the more a mother works, the less likely it is that her child will have a healthy BMI. We find a statistically significant positive association between maternal hours worked and the likelihood that a child is overweight, obese or morbidly obese. We also find evidence that the primary channel driving this result is that children of working parents walk less and watch more TV. These findings can help governments develop, monitor and evaluate policies aimed at preventing childhood obesity by encouraging active lifestyle and physical activity of children at an early age.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on childhood obesity and parental employment. Section 3 provides background information on childhood obesity and parental employment in Scotland. Section 4 presents the identification strategy. Section 5 discusses the data and provides summary statistics of the variables used in the empirical analysis.

The study allows for differential relationship between mother's education and infant health outcomes across localities based on income status by using birthweight and low birthweight as health measures. The results show that mother's education– infant birthweight relationship is more concentrated at relatively poor geographic areas. This can partially be explained by increases in utilization of health services among educated mothers residing in poorer areas compared to mothers with lower levels of education. Although the magnitude of education–health gradient has decreased in recent years, the gradient is still more pronounced in poorer localities. ==== during pregnancy, measured by adequacy of care, has improved particularly among less educated mothers living in poorer areas. However, smoking participation during pregnancy has declined substantially among less educated mothers across all geographic localities in recent years. Additionally, mother's education–infant health gradient is similar across black and white race groups.","A positive relationship between education and health outcomes has been widely documented in health economics, with formal years of schooling completed being the most important correlate of better health (Grossman and Kaestner, 1997). Grossman (1972) provides a theoretical framework to understand the effects of schooling on the demand for health. Following his study, a substantial amount of empirical evidence points to the consensus that educated individuals are more likely to have better health outcomes, including improved birth outcomes given by reductions in infant mortality rate and increased birthweight (Currie et al., 2003; Abrevaya and Dahl, 2008; Chou et al., 2010; Breierova and Duflo, 2004), higher life expectancy (Richards and Barry, 1998; Lleras-Muney, 2005; Elo and Preston, 1996, Mustard et al., 1997, Kunst and Mackenbach, 1994), and better health behaviors often measured by a reduction in smoking and heavy drinking (Kenkel, 1991; Jensen and Lleras-Muney, 2012; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010).====Similarly, it is well established at the national level that parents' lower socioeconomic status is associated with poor health outcomes among children, with income being one of the main drivers, giving rise to income-health gradient (Case et al., 2002, Currie et al., 2003). Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional disparity on infants' birthweight across geographic areas based on poverty ranking.==== The figure indicates that relatively affluent areas (the first group) has a reduced probability of low birthweight by more than 2 percentage points compared to poor areas — a huge improvement given the base probability of 0.07. Although education–health and income–health gradients are well-established in isolation, it is unclear as to how education-health gradient varies based on income status of localities.====Education allows individuals to self-select into better neighborhoods. But locality itself can induce positive effects on health (Chetty and Hendren, 2018, Chetty et al., 2018). Currie and Schwandt (2016) suggest that the locality of residence can pose significant differences in health outcomes, mainly due to specific “features of particular areas (for example, air pollution)” and spillover effects. In fact, Chetty et al. (2016) show that low income individuals live longer if they reside in rich areas with high proportion of educated people.====Theoretically, education can interact with environmental factors to produce varying extent of education-health relationship across localities. At one instance, higher education can reinforce the availability of external inputs such as better healthcare providers in relatively rich neighborhoods — educated individuals can be more efficient producers of health, given the same health inputs. On the other hand, a certain threshold of education may contribute to an equal level of “productive efficiency”==== across neighborhoods, regardless of income status. For example, a college graduate living in a relatively poor neighborhood can be equally as efficient in processing information from a single doctor visit compared to a college graduate from a richer neighborhood. For households in low-income areas with poor resources, education may induce a protective shield as knowledge may compensate for lack of adequate health inputs to an extent.====Can mother's education– infant health gradient vary across localities based on income? Answers to such a question can shed light regarding the interactive relationship between education and other inputs that enter the health production function. I use birth data from the National Vital Statistics System to evaluate the effects of mother's education on infant health, which is proxied by birthweight and low birthweight — arguably the most widely used measures to attest infant health.==== It is important to highlight that the health production function that are linear in years of education are commonly used in the literature when exploring the education–health gradient.==== In such studies, the marginal effect of one more year of schooling on health outcome is assumed to be similar throughout the entire education distribution and ignores the possibility of non-linear effects at certain levels of education. “Sheepskin effect” — additional benefits attached to completion of a degree (e.g. high school, college) due to positive signaling, is widely documented in labor economics. This effect can potentially trickle down to health measures through access to better insurance provision (employer sponsored insurance), job-related stress and positive peer effects,==== which further validates specifying a health production function with distinctive educational landmarks.====To evaluate health returns associated with maternal education across geographic areas, I rank mother's county of residence based on poverty rates by using county-level poverty measures from the Census. The counties are grouped into ten (twenty) county-groups with each county-group comprising a share of almost 10 (20) percent of the total number of births in the sample. Then I evaluate the relationship between mother's education and infant's birthweight for each county-group. Rather than specifying education linearly in the health production function, I allow for the marginal effects of an additional year of schooling to vary at different levels of education by using a more flexible model specification. One main challenge that I incur is that natality files do not report labor market information. It is important to control for income in model specifications as income tend to increase sharply following the completion of educational landmarks. By using individual level data from CPS Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORG 1990 and 2000) and CPER Uniform Extracts (2015) combined with several publicly available county-level data sets, I compute per-capita income for sub-groups in a county adjusted by education, race and age.==== I carefully include income indicators based on this per-capita income measure in model specifications to adequately control for income.====Four distinct findings arise from the analysis. First, I show that mother's education and infant's health relationship is stronger in relatively poorer geographic areas compared to affluent areas. This finding can be supported by dramatic increases in utilization of prenatal care (measured by both initiation of visit in the first two months of pregnancy and adequacy index) associated with educated mothers residing in poor geographic areas compared to mothers with low levels of education, whereas less educated mothers residing in richer areas still benefit from better prenatal care. The former finding is consistent with higher levels of allocative efficiency among educated individuals regardless of locality based on income and the later finding is not surprising as individuals with relatively low levels of education but residing in rich neighborhoods are still exposed to better health infrastructure and medical services. Second, the gradient has decreased in recent years, although it is still statistically significant and stronger in poorer localities. Third, such decreases in gradient can be explained by: (1) a substantial reduction in smoking during pregnancy among less educated mothers across all localities, and (2) disproportionate improvements in prenatal care among less educated mothers living in poorer localities in recent years. Among mothers with less than high school attainment, the share who did not smoke while pregnant increased from ==== percent in ==== to ==== percent in ====. Fourth, the magnitude of the gradient is similar among non-Hispanic black and white mothers.====The main limitation of this study is that years of schooling may be associated with other third factors not accounted in the model, which can simultaneously affect birth weight of an infant. This disallows me from making causal interpretations. However, rather than focusing to establish a causal relationship between mother's education and infant's health outcome, the main objective of the paper is to evaluate the possibility of differential relationship between mother's education and infant health across geographic areas based on poverty levels by allowing for a more flexible model specification to capture potential non-linearity. Such analyses provide guidance to several queries that arise when evaluating mother's education–infant health relationship, and can benefit future work in this area. Particularly, the findings of the study shed light on the matter of whether maternal education acts as a substitute for external inputs or reinforces the benefits through better health-inputs available in relatively richer neighborhoods (e.g. access to better quality service providers).====The study is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework of the study. This is followed by the discussion of data (Section 3), model specification (Section 4), results (Section 5), and possible mechanisms (Section 6).

Drawing on individual level panel data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) we exploit variation in the timing and location of these bans to establish their overall effect on smoking outcomes, and how this differs by personality. We measure personality using the Big Five personality traits. We are particularly interested in conscientiousness, given the evidence that it is a good proxy for self-control. Overall, we find that a one ==== increase in conscientiousness leads to a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the probability of smoking after the ban. Notably, this is the only Big Five personality trait that interacts with the smoking ban. This finding is very robust to different specifications.","Smoking remains a major global public health concern. In the United Kingdom (UK), approximately 100,000 preventable deaths can be attributed to smoking (Office for National Statistics, 2016). Smoking also imposes high costs on publicly funded health systems and may be viewed as exacerbating health inequalities given that smoking is concentrated among those of low socio-economic status (Jones et al., 2011). Several policy interventions have targeted smoking in the past decades in the UK including, a ban on smoking in public places. These bans were implemented primarily to reduce the health damage from second-hand smoke and to increase the opportunity cost of smoking to smokers (Bauld, 2011). Notably, increases to opportunity cost serve to directly reduce smokers’ utility (Christiansen and Smith, 2012). Smoking bans also act as a commitment device for individuals trying to quit smoking but failing due to limited self-control (de Bartolome and Irvine, 2010).====The effects of public smoking bans on smoking cessation has been well explored in the literature with ambiguous results across countries==== . The major lesson from this literature is that there is a potential for differential responses to public smoking bans depending on individual characteristics (Kuehnle and Wunder, 2017). Intuitively this raises the possibility that personality can be important. In this study we explore the extent to which responses to a public smoking ban vary in intensity depending on a smoker’s level of conscientiousness. Notably conscientiousness has already been shown to be a proxy for self-control and inversely related to smoking behaviour (Terracciano and Costa, 2004; Ameriks, 2007).====Conscientiousness is one of the Big Five personality traits frequently used in personality psychology (John and Srivastava, 1999); the others being extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness and openness==== . Our study is complementary to work by (Fletcher et al., 2009) who find that individuals with low levels of conscientiousness are less responsive to tobacco taxes. The authors argue that taxes fail to fully reach individuals who are most likely to be smokers. They highlight that this finding is in line with the cue-triggered model of addiction in which addicted smokers become price insensitive when triggered by cues. It also complements work by Ah et al. (2005) who show that conscientious youths in the US have a lower propensity to start smoking and smoke less on average. Also related is research by Pluess and Bartley (2015) who find that childhood conscientiousness explains approximately 5% of the social gradient in smoking. In addition to smoking behaviour conscientious has been linked positively to the propensity to seek preventative care (Bogg and Roberts, 2013), adhere to health guidance (Heckman, 2007) and consume alcohol Hagger-Johnson et al. (2012).====Our study contributes uniquely to the health policy literature in the following ways:====Our empirical analysis draws on the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), a UK individual-level panel data set from 1991 to 2008 in which households were followed yearly for 18 waves between 1991 and 2009. The BHPS has previously been used to study effects of the UK public smoking ban on smoking cessation, self-assessed health, and well-being (Jones et al., 2011; Wildman and Hollingsworth, 2013; Leicester and Levell, 2016).====Using a fixed effects regression model this study empirically tests the impact of the UK public smoking ban on smoking cessation for smokers with different levels of conscientiousness. It addresses the question of whether the public smoking ban served as a commitment device for individuals with low levels of conscientiousness. It finds that a one standard deviation increase in conscientiousness leads to a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the probability of smoking after the ban. This conclusion is very robust to different specifications. We also demonstrate that the biggest effects of the ban were experienced by smokers on the lower end of the conscientiousness distribution, with those at the very bottom not being reached.====This study also finds that for conscientious individuals of cohorts that were born before the dissemination of information on adverse health impacts of smoking, a one standard deviation increase in conscientiousness reduces the probability of smoking after the ban by 2.6 percentage points. This finding supports the hypothesis that the interaction between smoking and public smoking bans matters more for the smoking behaviour of conscientious persons who initiated their habit before the health effects were well known.",The interaction between personality and health policy: Empirical evidence from the UK smoking bans,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X20301696,17 June 2020,2020,Research Article,56.0

The estimated upper bounds are consistent with the conclusions from the IV estimates.,"Mental health is an important public health issue in the US due to its high prevalence and associated economic and societal costs. For instance, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, in 2017 approximately 19 % of US adults suffered from a mental illness (about 46.6 million adults), 4.5 % experienced a serious mental illness (i.e., one that substantially interfered with major life activities), and 7.1 % had at least one major depressive episode. In 2014, $186 billion was spent on mental health treatment, representing 6.4 % of all health spending (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016). This figure does not include other costs, such as from lost earnings, which can also be substantial—for example, Insel (2008) estimates such cost to be $193.2 billion for serious mental illnesses. An association between poor mental health and obesity has been found, the latter usually defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 (Carpenter et al., 2000; Luppino et al., 2010; Ha et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2000; Rosen-Reynoso et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2008; Simon et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009). However, the causality of the relationship is still unclear. We study the effect of BMI on mental health for European-ancestry young adults (aged 25–34) and the elderly (aged 50–89) using a genetic index of risk for high BMI as an instrumental variable (IV) for BMI.====There are theoretical reasons why BMI and obesity may affect mental health. Biologically, obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in peripheral tissues and blood circulation (Gregor and Hotamisligil, 2011). Inflammation in turn affects brain physiology, and alters mood and behavior leading to depression (Miller and Raison, 2016). It has also been hypothesized by Markowitz et al. (2008) that BMI and obesity are associated with mental health through behavioral (functional impairment), cognitive (body image dissatisfaction, poor self-reported health), and social (stigma) mechanisms. There is a stigma associated with obesity. Obese individuals are viewed as being lazy, unintelligent, unsuccessful, and lacking self-discipline (Puhl and Heuer, 2010). These stereotypes can lead to actual and/or perceived discrimination, low self-esteem and depression (Kessler et al., 1999). Discrimination stemming from obesity can also lead to depression through the labor market, to the extent that obesity is associated with worse labor market outcomes, which in turn can lead to financial stress and depression.==== Poor self-reported health can contribute to depression through a cognitive mechanism, as individuals who believe their health to be poor may also hold other depressive beliefs. In terms of functional impairments, obesity is associated with a higher probability of experiencing limitations in carrying out activities of daily living (Himes, 2000). Functional limitations affect one’s ability to undertake physical exercise, which is associated with better mental health (Paolucci et al., 2018). Thus, it is theoretically possible for BMI to have a causal effect on mental health. Moreover, we hypothesize that the importance of the mechanisms above may be different for young adults and the elderly (e.g., Himes, 2000; Willage, 2018), which motivates us to analyze these two groups separately.====Although there are theoretical reasons for BMI affecting mental health, drawing empirical causal conclusions is difficult since BMI is not randomly assigned but rather is determined by several factors (some unobserved to researchers). In particular, it is hard to interpret standard estimated associations from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions as causal effects because they are likely to be confounded by unobserved factors (e.g. time preference, genetic endowments, innate ability) that affect both BMI and mental health, and because of reverse causality insofar poor mental health may increase the likelihood of being obese. To tackle these issues, some recent studies have employed genetic information in the form of a polygenic score (PGS) for BMI as an IV.==== A PGS is a summary measure of an individual’s genetic predisposition for a given trait, and is constructed using results from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). In a GWAS, hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are tested for associations with an outcome.==== For example, Speliotes et al. (2010) conducted a GWAS on a sample of 123,864 individuals, where they examined associations between 2.8 million SNPs with BMI. They identified 32 SNPs that reached genome-wide significance (p<5 × 10====), which explain approximately 1.45 % of the variation in BMI. A PGS for BMI is constructed by aggregating the SNPs identified in Speliotes et al. (2010) and weighting them by the strength of their association with BMI.==== Under the assumptions employed by IV methods (to be discussed in section 3.1), the IV estimates represent causal effects.====Previous studies using a PGS for BMI as an IV in the context of the US indicate that there is no statistically significant effect of BMI on mental health. Hung et al. (2014) estimate the effect of BMI on the probability of having a major depressive disorder in young adults (average age of 26 years) using data from RADIANT (a case control study of major depression); Walter et al. (2015) estimate the effect of BMI on depression for women (with an average age of 56 years) using data from the Nurses’ Health Study; and Willage (2018) estimates the effect of BMI on depression in young adults (18–34 years of age) using the siblings sample in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.==== In all three studies, the OLS estimates showed a statistically positive association between BMI and poor mental health, whereas the IV estimates were statistically insignificant.==== In contrast to US results, Jokela et al. (2012) find that BMI has a statistically significant negative effect on mental health in adolescents and adults in Finland, while Tyrrell et al. (2018) find a statistically significant positive effect of BMI on depression for individuals (average age of 57 years) in the UK.====We contribute to this literature by estimating the effect of BMI on mental health (measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; CES-D) for European ancestry individuals from two important groups: young adults (aged 25–34 years from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) and elderly individuals (aged 50–89 years from the Health & Retirement Study).==== Estimation of the effect of BMI on mental health for different age groups is important because this effect may differ over the life cycle as different mechanisms may be relevant for different age groups, and the impacts of such mechanisms on mental health may also differ.==== As a result, polices aimed at reducing BMI (and obesity) may have different effects on mental health for different age groups.====To estimate the effects of interest, we exploit variation in a PGS for BMI employing two related methods that differ in the assumptions they employ. By providing results from both, we hope to offer a more complete analysis of these effects. We first build upon the existing literature using genetic markers as IVs. There are three innovations in the way we perform our analysis relative to previous work. First, the PGS we employ is based on the more recent GWAS by Locke et al. (2015), which includes all SNPs and thus has more predictive power for BMI. Second, IV estimates represent causal effects under certain assumptions (discussed in section 3.1) that include the critical requirement that the BMI PGS affects mental health only through its effect on BMI (the “exclusion restriction” assumption). One concern is that the BMI PGS may violate the exclusion restriction because of pleiotropy (von Hinke et al., 2016; van Kippersluis and Rietveld, 2018; DiPrete et al., 2018; Fletcher, 2018). That is, the PGS for BMI may affect mental health independently of its effect on BMI because genes associated with BMI may be related to other genes or traits that also affect mental health. Unlike previous studies, we attempt to lessen this concern by using PGSs for depression and educational attainment as additional control variables. Using a PGS for depression as an additional control variable is in the spirit of the genetic instrumental variables (GIVs) framework developed by DiPrete et al. (2018), who argue that is possible to block pleiotropic pathways by including the PGS for the outcome conditional on treatment as a control variable. The educational attainment PGS is used to proxy for innate ability, which is an unobservable factor that can confound estimates.==== Third, we empirically characterize the subpopulation for which the IV estimates identify the effects of interest; this characterization has been missing in the literature. In the presence of heterogeneous effects, IV methods identify a local average treatment effect (LATE) for those individuals whose treatment (BMI) is affected by the IV (PGS for BMI)—the so-called “compliers” (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). This is in contrast to OLS estimates, which under strong assumptions, such as unconfoundedness, identify the population average treatment effect (ATE). Using unconditional quantile treatment effects estimates of the effect of the BMI PGS on BMI, we document that IV estimates using a BMI PGS as an IV largely identify the effects of interest for compliers on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. This characterization of the relevant subpopulation for which the effect is estimated is critical to understand the external validity of the estimated effects and the possible incidence of policies.====We employ a second, related method that regards the PGS for BMI as a potentially “imperfect IV”—one that is allowed to violate the exclusion restriction—to estimate an upper bound on the ATE of BMI on mental health for the corresponding population (young adults or the elderly), following Nevo and Rosen (2012). While controlling for the PGSs for depression and education can block pleiotropic pathways (DiPrete et al., 2018), it is not possible to guarantee that the exclusion restriction is satisfied (Angrist et al., 1996; von Hinke et al. 2016). By not relying on this crucial assumption, regarding the PGS for BMI as a potentially imperfect IV is not subject to the criticism that pleiotropy may be present—at the cost of providing only a bound rather than a point estimate of the effect of interest. Nevo and Rosen (2012) combines the use of an imperfect IV (in our case, the BMI PGS) with relatively weak assumptions about the direction (and in some cases relative magnitude) of (1) the correlation between the imperfect IV and unobserved factors in the OLS model for mental health, and (2) the correlation between those same unobserved factors and the endogenous regressor (BMI). Moreover, under their corresponding assumptions, each approach makes inference about a different parameter: IV methods estimate a LATE on compliers, while Nevo and Rosen (2012) imperfect IV approach bounds the population’s ATE. By providing these two sets of results, we hope to offer a more complete picture of the effects of interest and allow the reader to put more weight on the estimates she deems more credible if she has concerns about the corresponding assumptions used by them.====The results from the two related methods are consistent with each other, even though they rely on different assumptions. For young adults, the IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant effect of BMI on mental health, while the estimated upper bound for the ATE is consistent with, at most, a small economically insignificant effect. In contrast, the IV estimates for elderly individuals indicate a positive and statistically significant effect. In particular, the effect of a 5 kg/m==== (a difference equivalent to moving from overweight to obese) increases the CES-D score by 20 % and the likelihood of depression by 29 %. Again, the estimated upper bounds on the ATE for the elderly population are consistent with the magnitude of the IV estimated effects. As previously indicated, our results also suggest that the effect (LATE) estimated in the IV method likely reflects a weighted average of effects for compliers on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Lastly, we find no statistically significant gender differences using the IV estimates.====Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of BMI on mental health in several ways. First, we provide estimates of these effects for two important groups, young adults and the elderly, which is relevant as it can increase our understanding of the effects and of policies aimed at decreasing BMI/obesity. Second, we employ a more recent PGS for BMI with more predictive power relative to the previous literature (an exception is Tyrrell et al., 2018). Third, we add as controls in the IV regressions the PGSs for depression and education to increase the plausibility of the exclusion restriction assumption in this setting (DiPrete et al., 2018; Fletcher, 2018), which is important since otherwise IV estimates may overestimate the effect of interest. Indeed, we document that the IV estimates for the elderly are likely overestimated if we do not control for those PGSs. Fourth, we analyze the first-stage effects of the BMI PGS on BMI to inform the characterization of the subpopulation for which the IV methods estimate an effect. Within this literature, we appear to be the first to illustrate how this can be done. We document that IV estimates likely reflect a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health for complier individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. From a policy perspective, having such a characterization of the subpopulation for which the effect is estimated is critical. Finally, we complement our IV estimates by using the bounding approach in Nevo and Rosen (2012). This approach uses the PGS for BMI as an imperfect IV that does not need to satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption, thus addressing a common critique of using genetic markers as IVs (von Hinke et al., 2016; Fletcher, 2018). To our knowledge, we are the first to illustrate the use of the Nevo and Rosen (2012) bounds in this context.",The impact of BMI on mental health: Further evidence from genetic markers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19303090,13 June 2020,2020,Research Article,57.0

I define a treatment group of children affected by the outbreak, and compare them with a control group of earlier-born children who are unaffected. Twelve months after the outbreak, the vaccination rate of the treatment group is 2.5 (first dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) and 4 (second dose) percentage points higher than the corresponding rates of the control group. The results do not indicate that families at increased risk respond more strongly, suggesting that the outbreak changed the perceived value of vaccinations across the whole population. Findings also reveal heterogeneity in the response of families based on the parents’ level of education, indicating that parents with higher education levels absorb new information more rapidly.","Measles outbreaks continue to occur in a number of European countries. Between July 2016 and June 2017, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) registered more than 10,000 cases, and 22 deaths were attributed to measles in the European Economic Area (ECDC, 2017). Vaccination is an effective way to prevent the spread of the disease. However, vaccination coverage in many countries is suboptimal, and below the World Health Organization's (WHO) target rate of 95%. Achieving this rate would ensure interruption of transmission chains and herd immunity in the population (WHO, 2014).====One reason for low vaccine uptake is safety concerns. In surveys, parents who decline vaccinations for their children frequently state as reasons their fear of adverse side effects such as asthma, allergies, and autism (Brown et al., 2010, Yaqub et al., 2014). Related concerns include worries that combination vaccinations, such as the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, lead to an ‘immune overload’ on the child's developing immune system, leaving the child susceptible to other infections (Hulsey and Bland, 2015). A second reason for non-vaccination is the perceived value of immunisation. A lack of general awareness about childhood diseases, low perceived severity of the illness, and an underestimated risk of infection are factors that make parents decline vaccinations (Brown et al., 2010). In this context, outbreaks of childhood diseases can be interpreted as information shocks, as corresponding media coverage is expected to increase public awareness substantially. Epidemics also affect the objective risk of contracting the disease, as the likelihood of encountering an infected person increases in such situations. Outbreaks may therefore increase vaccination coverage by changing families’ actual risk.====I explore the effects of a measles outbreak in 2008 on vaccination uptake in Austria. Using administrative data with individual-level information on childhood vaccinations allows for a precise assessment of the decisions on whether vaccination is necessary, and when. I find that the measles outbreak substantially increases the uptake of the MMR vaccine. While the effect is strongest immediately after the outbreak, the coverage rate of affected children is 2.5 (first dose of MMR) and 4 (second dose) percentage points higher than that of unaffected children even after 12 months. Under rational protection behaviour, one would expect a stronger effect on families at increased risk, because a higher risk provides greater incentives for susceptible individuals to vaccinate (Philipson, 2000). However, I do not find stronger effects on families in communities that actually contracted measles. Furthermore, I do not find significant differences between the effect on first and higher order births, as larger families may be at greater risk due to increased interaction with other children.====Existing empirical evidence on the effects of outbreaks on vaccination uptake is rare. Philipson (1996) provides the only known evaluation concerning measles, investigating the effect of measles cases with focus on the age at which children receive their first MMR vaccine. Philipson uses variation in cases during the 1989–1991 epidemic across the United States and data from 1991 National Health Interview Survey to show that an increase in disease incidence reduces this age significantly. Additional evidence on disease outbreaks comes from the analysis of aggregate data on pertussis epidemics, but uncovers mixed results. Wolf et al. (2014) do not find statistically significant effects of a pertussis outbreak on infant vaccinations in Washington State. In contrast, Oster (2018) uses county-level variations on disease incidence and vaccine uptake across the United States, and finds that outbreaks decrease the share of unvaccinated children entering kindergarten.====Related literature on measles explores vaccination decisions in the wake of a controversial study linking the MMR vaccine to the development of autism in children.==== If families trade off the value of vaccines against safety, such a controversy can also be interpreted as an information shock that may influence vaccine uptake behaviour. Contrary to disease outbreaks, controversies regarding vaccine safety can be expected to decrease uptake. Accordingly, Anderberg et al. (2011), and Chang (2018) find significant declines in MMR uptake in the United Kingdom and the United States as a consequence of the autism controversy. Both studies also analyse differential responses based on parents’ education, suggesting a faster decline in vaccinations among highly educated populations.",Effects of a measles outbreak on vaccination uptake,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301595,24 May 2020,2020,Research Article,58.0

This suggests that a father’s death during a child’s adolescent years may be associated with positive adaptive behavior.","Nearly 140 million children under 18 years of age had lost one or both parents due to any cause of death in 2015 with around 37 per cent from Africa (UNICEF, 2016). Children who lose one parent (‘single orphans’) or lose both parents (‘double orphans’) are a vulnerable group with outcomes such as schooling and earnings when adults all potentially more negative compared to those of non-orphans (Beegle et al., 2009; Evans & Miguel, 2007). The gender of the parent that died can be very important to these outcomes. For example, Case and Ardington (2006) show that the loss of a child’s mother is a strong predictor of schooling outcomes in South Africa. Similar results are found for Taiwan (Chen et al., 2009; Gimenez et al., 2013). However, no evidence is found of maternal death reducing primary school completion rates in North Western Tanzania (Ainsworth et al., 2005). With regard to fathers, Cas et al., 2014 who investigate children orphaned by the 2004 boxing data tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia find that in the longer term (i.e., five years later) the loss of only the father has negative impacts on school enrolment and years of completed schooling for older males aged 15-17 at baseline than similar males whose parents survived the tsunami. There was little evidence that parental death affected human capital accumulation of those who were aged 9-14 in 2004. Maternal death had little impact on schooling outcomes of children but did affect their time allocation. Shenk and Scelza (2012) find that the loss of a father later in a child’s teenage years can have significant negative impacts on various outcomes in India including education, income and high quality spouses, as investments by fathers are particularly important in adolescence in that specific social context. Thus gender of parents who died, the age of child at the time of death and the social and developmental context seem to be important in influencing outcomes later in life. Moreover, orphanhood need not inevitably result in negative outcomes if suitable care-giver arrangements, economic assistance and other protective factors are prevalent as noted by Abebe and Aase (2007) in a qualitative study of 42 Ethiopian orphans.====In spite of such investigations, little empirical evidence exists -especially for developing countries- regarding how the loss of the father may matter to ==== skills and how these impacts may vary according to the time in a child’s life-course during which the father died. Non-cognitive skills can be defined as the ‘patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours’ (Borghans et al., 2008) that are socially determined and can be developed throughout the lifetime to produce value. They include psychosocial skills such as self-esteem and self-efficacy, personality traits such as conscientiousness and motivation and more broadly soft skills particularly useful in the labour market such as teamwork and perseverance (Heckman & Kautz, 2012). These attributes are not adequately measured by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests or achievement tests. If orphans ==== step into adulthood with significantly poorer non-cognitive outcomes they are likely to perpetuate into persistent inequalities in other spheres as well, such as standard of living as non-cognitive skills are a conduit for success in the labour market (Heckman & Kautz, 2012).====The main aims of this article therefore are to investigate empirically, using the case of Ethiopia, how (a) non-cognitive outcomes at age 15 can be different depending on whether a child becomes a single orphan by losing a father in middle childhood (between ages 7-12) or early adolescence (between ages 12-15) and (b) how non-cognitive outcomes at age 22 can be different depending on whether a child becomes a single orphan by losing the father in middle childhood or adolescence defined more broadly (between aged 12-22)==== . As far as the author is aware, the issue has not been investigated empirically previously for developing country contexts. The focus is on paternal death rather than maternal death mainly due to data constraints, as explained in more detail later on in the paper. The data come from five rounds of the Young Lives longitudinal survey, conducted in 2002, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016 tracking a sample of around 3000 children from poorer households across 20 sentinel sites in Ethiopia==== . The data set allows for the investigation of various non-cognitive outcomes at ages 15 and 22 and control for a rich set of pre-orphanhood characteristics.====The paper uses the potential outcome framework to extract the average treatment effect on the treated using the inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment (IPWRA) estimator as described in (Cattaneo, 2010; Wooldridge, 2010). The treatment is multivalued rather than being binary as it depends on the time during a child’s life-course during which the father died. A key empirical challenge is to disentangle correlation from causality as parental death is not an entirely random event. If a father’s death is correlated to unobserved characteristics such as attitudes to health or omitted variables then a comparison of observed outcomes between single orphans and non-orphans will not necessarily reflect the true effect of orphanhood. For example the effects of being orphaned may be over-estimated if fathers’ unobserved health problems or risk preferences affect children’s development as well as contribute to the parent’s death. On the other hand if becoming a paternal orphan lead to the child dying or being attrited in-between rounds of a longitudinal survey, the measured impact could be an underestimate. We address the issues of sample selection and omitted variable bias, to some extent at least, by using a rich set of observed pre-orphanhood characteristics in the analysis and estimations. Even so, if paternal death was not unanticipated and preceded by ill health, it could have affected outcomes prior to death (through unemployment, hospitalisation, requiring care at home or changes to the quality of parenting during the survival time). This would mean the estimates are biased. In our sample, around 16 per cent of the households that report a father’s death in a particular round also report that the parent was seriously ill between that round and the preceding one- a number not so small that it can be safely assumed that paternal death was sudden across the entire sample==== . Moreover, even if death was sudden, attributing causal effects is difficult as there could still be unobservables that are correlated with both child outcomes and parental death. Thus the more modest claim this paper makes is that it identifies correlations and patterns associated with death rather than strictly causal relationships.====The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The next section discusses the conceptual framework while section 3 looks at data and descriptive statistics, section 4 looks at the empirical strategy and section 5 discusses the results taken from the baseline and alternative specifications. Section 6 considers the results in the context of evidence from other studies using qualitative data from the Young Lives project. Section 7 concludes.",Sweet are the fruit of adversity?

Drawing on data from three surveys, I show that male height in Puerto Rico increased at more than twice the average rate for Latin America and the Caribbean between 1890 and 1940. I also show that ==== at mid-century were among the tallest Latin Americans outside of Argentina and Uruguay. The evidence supports the conclusion that conditions improved substantially after US annexation, in contrast to the prevailing view in the literature.","Puerto Rico is the most populous unincorporated territory of the United States, and Puerto Ricans have been US citizens for more than a century. After World War II, Puerto Rico experienced one of the world's fastest growth rates for GDP per capita and labor productivity (Baumol and Wolff, 1996), became in 1967 the first country in Latin America to be classified as a “developed nation” by the World Bank (Duchesne, 2000), and remains one of the richest economies in Latin America. Nonetheless, the economic value of political association with the US has been historically, and is presently, a matter of considerable debate. US annexation in 1898, in particular, is perhaps the most controversial topic in Puerto Rican economic history. Scholars of early 20th century Puerto Rico have reached a broad range of conclusions about US annexation, from “extreme denunciations of US imperialism and its purported ruthless exploitation and impoverishment of the island...” to “unabashed praises of the US invasion for having saved Puerto Rico from the tyranny of Spanish colonialism, for building a modern economic infrastructure, and for eventually ushering in an era of democracy, relative prosperity, and social mobility...” (Ayala and Bergad, 2002, p. 65).====A key challenge to resolving the academic debate on conditions in early 20th century Puerto Rico has been a lack of quantitative evidence to measure living standards. In this paper, I draw on anthropometric evidence from three surveys of Puerto Rican men to comment on economic development. I exploit cross-sectional variation in birth year to identify differences in average height over time and compare age cohorts across surveys where possible. Increases in height have been found to be associated with rising living standards, and height data have been used in various other historical contexts to demonstrate the material benefits of colonialism (Brennan et al., 1997, Komlos, 2001, Moradi, 2009, Morgan and Liu, 2001, Olds, 2001). Likewise, I show that there was a significant rise in the height of Puerto Rican men following US annexation: adult men born in 1940 measure about 4.2 cm. taller than those born a decade prior to US annexation. Additionally, I show that Puerto Ricans at mid-century were among the tallest Latin Americans outside of Argentina and Uruguay.====Lacking an adequate control group and sufficient observations predating US rule, I do not argue that US annexation is responsible for changes across birth cohorts; after all, the 20th century witnessed improvements in living standards and stature across the West (Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), 2016).==== Rather, I more narrowly contend that widespread beliefs about impoverishment caused by US policy, or even stagnant economic conditions in the immediate aftermath of annexation, are incorrect. Such claims have been shaped in large part by failing to consider the realities of Spanish colonialism—and, therefore, blaming all problems on the US—and by observing that living standards in Puerto Rico were much lower than those of the US and Western Europe without properly comparing Puerto Rico's present conditions with the conditions that prevailed at the commencement of US rule (Ayala and Bergad, 2002, Chamber of Commerce of Puerto Rico, 1945). My findings are supportive of a marked improvement in the biological standard of living and are not attributable to selection into the sample or shrinking in old age.====Evidence of an improvement in the material well-being of Puerto Ricans stands in stark contrast to the prevailing view that US rule led to stagnant or even worsening conditions for most Puerto Ricans before World War II. For instance, D’Estefano (1968, p. 21) alleges that “Yankee colonialism” had produced “unemployment, exploitation, disease, hunger, and 400,000 illiterates.” Renowned historian Arturo Morales Carrión (1983, p. 153) describes Puerto Rico in this era as a “poorhouse... foundering in despair”, while political scientist Gordon Lewis (1963, pp. 89-90) insists that the revamped economy worked for the “interests of the colonial producer and not for those of the consumer”, most of whom were reduced to “a starvation diet of the very simplest of ground provisions.” Even the most widely cited economic history of Puerto Rico contends that there is “little evidence” of “improvements in the standard of living of the mass of working and nonworking people” (Dietz, 1986, p. 133).====My results also contradict the conclusions of Godoy et al. (2007), the only empirically grounded study with a somewhat negative appraisal of changes in living standards in the early 20th century. Despite using data from the same 1965 health survey analyzed in this paper, the authors find no statistically significant increase in height, which they ascribe to “the offsetting role of improved health and a stagnant rural economy during the first half of the 20th century” (p. 82). I argue that their result is the product of an overspecified regression model, which includes birth year fixed effects along with an age variable, generating severe collinearity and without adding meaningful information to the model. Furthermore, they include educational attainment and an urban/rural dummy as explanatory variables, diminishing the magnitude of the estimated effect of birth year. Including these variables purges the birth cohort fixed effects of variation attributable to rising levels of education and urbanization, which are correlated with time and are part of, not distinct from, the development process. A simple correction renders evidence of a clear rise in height and, therefore, the biological standard of living.====The results in this paper are, however, consistent with recent quantitative analyses that suggest that the early 20th century was a period of economic growth in Puerto Rico. Most importantly, Devereux (2019) and de Jesús Toro (1982) estimate that real income in 1940 was about two and a half times higher than in 1900. The results hold after adjusting GDP estimates for fluctuations in the terms of trade and are corroborated by per capita consumption data: food intake increased by more than 50%, and clothing consumption doubled. Additional evidence in support of economic growth is presented by Marein (2020a), who finds that economic activity began concentrating in urban areas at the turn of the 20th century, and municipal growth was positively correlated with several indicators of development from 1899 to 1970. Height provides additional information about development because it captures how living conditions changed throughout the entire population; economic growth can fail to translate to improvements in living conditions for vast sections of the population if income inequality rises as well.====In what follows, I first provide a broad overview of economic changes in the early 20th century as well as interventions made under US rule that may have affected the standard of living. I subsequently evaluate height data for Puerto Rican men from three surveys and determine that the economic standard of living rose substantially in the immediate aftermath of US annexation. I also show that Puerto Ricans at mid-century were among the tallest Latin Americans outside of Argentina and Uruguay and were nearly as tall as white Cubans, at which point Cuba was a prosperous, middle-income country. Finally, I summarize and conclude.",Economic development in Puerto Rico after US annexation: Anthropometric evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302813,19 May 2020,2020,Research Article,60.0

Smoking and physical activity are both strategies for weight management, and exercise may be a way to reduce some of the ill effects of smoking. These different links suggest that cigarette taxes could either increase or decrease physical activity. We explore this relationship using repeated cross-sectional 1991–2017 data from the national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), combined with state-level policies and controls. Our smoking participation results confirm past work; cigarette taxes have a negative effect on smoking that has waned in recent years. The estimated effects of cigarette taxes on physical activity echo those of smoking; cigarette taxes decrease physical activity and, like smoking, these effects have waned recently. However, one likely avenue – sports participation – is unaffected. These results suggest that increased cigarette taxes lead to modest declines in teen physical activity, a finding consistent with youth using exercise to compensate for the health effects of smoking.","One goal of tobacco control policies such as cigarette taxes is to improve the health of teenagers by affecting their smoking behavior. Past research suggests that taxes and other tobacco policies have been effective in reducing youth smoking (e.g. Gruber and Zinman, 2001, Powell et al., 2005, Tauras et al., 2005, Carpenter and Cook, 2008, Tworek et al., 2010, Nonnemaker and Farrelly, 2011, Lillard et al., 2013, Hawkins et al., 2016). However, research into the unintended effects that these policies have on other behaviors in teenagers is limited. Research into spillover effects of tobacco policies primarily focuses on obesity (e.g. Chou et al., 2004, Courtemanche, 2009, Mellor, 2011), and studies that consider the effects on physical activity are limited to adults (Courtemanche, 2009, Wehby and Courtemanche, 2012, Conway and Niles, 2017). To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate how tobacco control policies, especially cigarette taxes, affect physical activity and associated behaviors in adolescents.====The benefits of physical activity to the overall health of teenagers are numerous and well established (e.g. Sothern et al., 1999, Hallal et al., 2006, Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010), although most teens fail to get the recommended amount of exercise. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines (US DHHS 2008) recommends that children and adolescents aged 6–17 get at least 60 min of physical activity per day. This report lists health benefits such as improved cardiorespiratory, muscular fitness, bone health and body composition, and reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Yet, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that only 27.1% of high school students meet those recommendations.==== To the extent that smoking and exercise have habit-forming tendencies (Chaloupka, 1991, Aarts et al., 1997), the choices made as a youth likely carry over well into adulthood. Smoking, in particular, is a habit typically initiated during adolescence (e.g. DeCicca et al., 2002). Evidence, including animal studies (Acosta et al., 2015), suggests that physical activity in childhood is likewise strongly predictive of subsequent physical activity and overall health as an adult (e.g. Curtis et al., 1999, Yang et al., 1999, Perkins et al., 2004, Telama et al., 2005, Dohle and Wansink, 2013). Adolescence presents unique opportunities for physical activities, through physical education classes and sports team membership for example, which could in turn shape exercise and recreational habits as an adult. The relationship between teen smoking and physical activity and the effects that anti-tobacco policies have on both behaviors therefore has potentially long-run implications.====As revealed by the theoretical framework of Conway and Niles (2017), the spillover effects of cigarette taxes on the exercise behavior of adults are theoretically ambiguous. A tax-induced reduction in smoking, for example, may increase one's capacity for and enjoyment from exercise; any weight gain that results could provide an additional motive to increase exercise. Conversely, if smokers are using physical activity to compensate for the harms caused by smoking (Xu, 2002, Radtke et al., 2011), they may exercise less if cigarette taxes cause them to smoke less. Cigarette taxes could also have income effects on exercise, even if smoking behavior is not affected. Because teens have less disposable income, the income effects could be especially strong. We use this framework, noting that adolescents differ from adults in that they (1) may be required to take physical education classes (i.e. not all physical activity is a choice), and (2) have greater ability to join a sports team, which is an avenue for physical activity but also contains other benefits and costs such as social interaction and fixed time commitments.====Past empirical findings for adults are decidedly mixed. Xu (2002) provides evidence that adults use exercise to compensate for smoking, which aligns with Conway and Niles (2017)'s finding that cigarette taxes have a negative effect on exercise. Courtemanche (2009) and Wehby and Courtemanche (2012), however, provide limited evidence that cigarette taxes may increase exercise. We estimate the effects of tobacco control policies, especially cigarette taxes, on the smoking and physical activity behaviors of teens using repeated cross-sectional data from the 1991–2017 national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) combined with state level policies and controls. Consistent with past work, our smoking results suggest a strong negative effect of cigarette taxes on smoking participation in teens. However, we find this effect has waned in recent years, consistent with the recent null results of Hansen et al. (2017). Our results for physical activity mirror those of smoking; cigarette taxes have a modest negative effect on teen physical activity that has also waned in recent years. An exception to this waning effect for both smoking and physical activity, however, are young teens. This negative spillover effect is consistent with teens using physical activity to compensate for the harmful effects of smoking, although income effects could also be responsible. Our findings therefore suggest that the health benefits from cigarette taxation may be diminished by its unintended effects on physical activity and that efforts to increase the physical activity of young teens, in particular, is warranted.",The effect of tobacco policies on youth physical activity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302886,19 May 2020,2020,Research Article,61.0

The latter exerts an independent contribution to excess adiposity over and above the potential mediating role of individual-level lifestyle and socio-economic position (SEP). Overall, the relative contribution of demographics (age and gender) becomes less evident moving to higher quantiles of the BMI distribution, while that of obesogenic environment, individual-level lifestyle and SEP measures becoming more relevant. The neighbourhood obesogenic environment is also much more relevant in the tails of the WC distribution. The role of the obesogenic environment on excess adiposity is more pronounced for women than men. Overall, our results highlight that policies that aim to tackle excess adiposity should address both people and places.","Although progressive improvements in life expectancy and the health of the population have been evident over recent decades, preventable inequalities in health (including obesity) persist between regions within England (Baker, 2018; Newton et al., 2015; NHS Digital, 2018a; Shelton, 2009). Evidence for the period between 2008 and 2010 shows that England has some of the largest regional health inequalities in Europe. For example, the life expectancy difference for women between the poorest English regions (the North East and North West) and the more affluent (London and the South East) was similar to the life expectancy gap between the former West and post-communist East Germany in the mid-1990s (Bambra et al., 2014). Understanding the geography of health is complex, given the regional variations and interactions of the different underlying health determinants at the individual, contextual and environmental level. The importance of mitigating regional differences in health is emphatically stated in the recent study by Newton et al. (2015): “if levels of health in the worst performing regions in England matched the best performing ones, England would have one of the lowest burdens of disease of any advanced industrialised country”.====Excess adiposity is one of the leading risk factors for preventable ill-health and disability (Davillas and Pudney, 2019; Newton et al., 2015), being associated with several chronic conditions (GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators, 2017; Must et al., 1999). Existing evidence shows significant regional differences in adiposity across the English regions. For example, obesity prevalence, defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m====, is about 23 % in London as opposed to 33 % in the West Midlands (NHS Digital, 2018b). Regional inequalities in excess adiposity are of interest themselves, given the important socio-economic ramifications of obesity and the implied clustering of the health risks and disadvantage at the regional level. They are also important because they may influence resource allocation and to infer the success of area-based policies to tackle obesity. From the perspective of health policy, better understanding of the underlying sources of the regional inequalities in excess adiposity are useful for local authorities, given their enhanced role as leaders for local population health.====We use a nationally representative dataset for the UK, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) to examine the relative contribution of the neighbourhood-level obesogenic environment and individual-level characteristics to adiposity variations in England. We use two measures of adiposity: BMI and waist circumference (WC). We contribute to the literature in a number of ways.====First, we explore the presence of regional differences in adiposity at the nine Government Office Regions (GORs) of England. The GOR-level inequalities in obesity are frequently monitored in public health policy reports (e.g., NHS Digital, 2018a), with recent research aiming to explain regional-level health (including obesity) inequalities (Newton et al., 2015; Vallejo-Torres and Morris, 2010). Measurement of inequalities at GOR level has been of interest and policy relevance because these regions mostly coincide with administrative structures aimed to address English regional imbalances (i.e., the Strategic Health Authorities), up to their abolishment in favour of smaller scale and more local units of governance (Bambra et al., 2014; DHSC, 2013).==== These inequalities between regions are attributed to within region differences in the obesogenic environment at the small-area neighbourhood level is a timely issue, given the recently enhanced role of local authorities as leaders for local population health (DHSC, 2013). The legal duty for local authorities to commission care and support services is stated by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC, 2013): “they use their knowledge of their communities to tackle challenges such as smoking, alcohol and drug misuse and obesity.”====In this study, we use a detailed set of individual-level characteristics along with small-area level proxies of the obesogenic environment to explore their relative contributions to the observed variations in our adiposity measures. We use multilevel analysis to explore the relative contribution of the neighbourhood-level effects, capturing the role of unobserved obesogenic characteristics. Beyond this analysis, we also employ a Shapley decomposition to directly decompose the contribution of our rich set of observed neighbourhood-level obesogenic characteristics and understand their relative role, over and above individual-level characteristics. This complements existing research exploiting the US institutional context on regional variations in food prices and taxes (Powell and Chaloupka, 2009; Rahkovsky and Gregory, 2013) or availability of detailed data on neighbourhood-level “food deserts” to better understand inequalities in health and nutritional status (Allcott et al., 2019). Other studies aiming to explore the role of the neighbourhood social conditions and “built” environmental factors on adiposity are often limited to specific geographical regions and selected population groups and, thus, do not provide nationally representative results (for example, Booth et al., 2005; Drewnowski et al., 2016; Lovasi et al., 2009). We focus on local (small-area level), modifiable obesogenic characteristics here, such as proxies for geographical barriers, air quality, criminality, local levels of anxiety, income and education deprivation levels. These latter may affect adiposity via their direct and indirect effects on the energy imbalance that causes excess adiposity (Papas et al., 2007; Stafford et al., 2007; Swinburn et al., 2011).====Although certain aspects of the built environment may affect obesity via direct biological mechanisms (such as, for example, the association between air pollution and metabolic disorders (An et al., 2018)), the role of obesogenic environment on adiposity is mainly behavioural via affecting consumption and energy expenditure (An et al., 2018; Carroll-Scott et al., 2013; Santana et al., 2009). Our analysis allows us to explore the extent to which its role is mediated by the individual-level lifestyle and other characteristics, given the interplay between individual-level and environmental characteristics in affecting adiposity (Costa-Font and Gil, 2008; Raftopoulou, 2017; Santana et al., 2009), as well as the potential direct role of the obesogenic environment on adiposity. Identifying that the neighbourhood environment plays a systematic role for excess adiposity is of particular importance, indicating that a hypothetical movement of an individual from a less to a more obesogenic neighbourhood may put them at higher risk of excess adiposity. This information is also relevant for the design and planning of interventions to target aspects of the obesogenic environment at the neighbourhood level to tackle the obesity epidemic.====Second, beyond our analysis “at the mean”, we also focus at quantiles of the distribution of adiposity. “Beyond the mean” estimation techniques allow us to explore the potentially heterogeneous patterns in the contribution of the explanatory variables across quantiles of the distribution with a focus on the right tails, where higher health care risks and costs are concentrated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines Shapley decomposition techniques with unconditional quantile regression techniques (UQR) to explore regional inequalities in adiposity and the underlying individual and neighbourhood-level factors that may contribute to variations in adiposity. Analysis “at the mean” may mask important information in other parts of the adiposity distribution (for example, Green et al., 2016; et al., 2016; Stifel and Averett, 2009). Dichotomising (or categorising) our adiposity measures using conventional clinical thresholds may also result in loss of information (Jolliffe, 2011).==== For example, assuming one of the most extensively used dichotomous indicators, i.e. obesity defined as BMI≥30mk/m====; does not explicitly explore the distribution of BMI above or below the threshold but treats those who fall into (or out of) obesity homogenously. By categorising BMI using thresholds, masks the fact that people with values well above any chosen threshold may experience significantly higher health risks compared to those close to the threshold. It has been shown that the latter matters when it comes to exploring the association between socioeconomic measures and adiposity (Jolliffe, 2011). Third, in contrast to many previous studies, we use nurse-collected adiposity measures. It has been shown that reporting errors in body weight (or BMI) are non-classical, meaning that they depend on individual characteristics and may create misclassification biases in obesity prevalence (Cawley et al., 2015).====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

This is a significant limitation of the extant literature, since fringe benefits are increasingly acknowledged as an integral part of the employees’ compensation, and a main indicator of job quality. Using the Canadian General Social Survey of 2016, the present paper examines how a self-rated measure of attractiveness associates with both labour earnings and fringe benefits. Employing a rich set of controls, no evidence for a beauty premium is found for men, while there is some evidence for a beauty penalty for women. However, attractiveness is found to positively predict the number of fringe benefits of both men and women. Therefore, at equal level of earnings, more attractive individuals appear able to secure higher quality jobs, as measured by the number of fringe benefits. The results, hence, suggest that the effects of attractiveness on labour market outcomes cannot be fully captured by a separate examination of earnings and the hiring process.","Since the seminal work of Hamermesh and Biddle (1994), the effects of physical attractiveness on earnings have been examined for various labour markets, generally resulting in the finding of a “beauty premium.” These studies span numerous countries (Harper, 2000; Hamermesh et al., 2002; Fletcher, 2009; Johnston, 2010; Gehrsitz, 2014; Borland and Leigh, 2014; Mavisakalyan, 2018) and diverse occupations (Frieze et al., 1991; Biddle and Hamermesh, 1998; Berri et al., 2011; Salter et al., 2012; Arunachalam and Shah, 2012; Islam and Smyth, 2012; Guéguen, 2012; Parrett, 2015; Hamermesh and Parker, 2005; Babin et al., 2019). To date, the reasons for the observed earnings gaps related to physical appearance have remained unsettled (Liu and Sierminska, 2014). Aside from discrimination and unobserved heterogeneity of individuals by their physical appearance, beauty may be a productivity-enhancing trait in certain occupations (Stinebrickner et al., 2019). However, the evidence of discrimination based on physical appearance has also emerged from a number of correspondence audit studies (López Bóo et al., 2013; Maurer-Fazio and Lei, 2015; Ruffle and Shtudiner, 2014; Patacchini et al., 2015).====Therefore, the cumulative weight of evidence suggests that more attractive individuals are likely to have advantages in the labour market, because of their physical appearance. In general, a labour market advantage can manifest itself in the quality of the job an applicant succeeds to secure. One of the essential indicators of job quality is the number of fringe benefits it offers (Cabral Vieira et al., 2005; Galanaki, 2019). Fringe benefits, such as pension, paid vacation, and parental leave, are increasingly viewed as an integral part of worker compensation (Galanaki, 2019). For instance, according to the American Bureau of Labor Statistics, fringe benefits make up for about 30 % of total compensations granted to the US civilian workers (Artz, 2010). Moreover, fringe benefits have been shown to increase job satisfaction (Artz, 2010; Nazir et al., 2016), and to reduce employee turnover (Akerlof et al., 1988; Baughman et al., 2003; Dale-Olsen, 2006; Galanaki, 2019). In parallel, there is compelling evidence for the greater bargaining power of more attractive individuals in interaction games (Solnick and Schweitzer, 1999; Andreoni and Petrie, 2008; Rosenblat, 2008; Eckel and Petrie, 2011). In light of the extant literature, physical appearance is likely to be consequential for the number of fringe benefits. However, the association between physical appearance and job quality, as measured by the number of its fringe benefits, has not yet been investigated in the literature.====The present study, using the Canadian General Social Survey of 2016, examines the link between physical attractiveness and labour market outcomes, inclusive of wages and fringe benefits. The data include a self-rated measure of attractiveness, alongside a rich set of information about the respondents’ labour market outcomes. This dataset allows to control for a number of variables generally omitted from the analyses, such as self-confidence. Therefore, the present paper contributes to the literature in at least three ways. First, it updates the literature on the association between physical appearance and wages in the Canadian labour market, not studied since the paper by Hamermesh and Biddle (1994), which used 1981 data. Second, the implications of physical attractiveness for the enjoyment of fringe benefits, such as pension, paid sick leave, paid vacation, parental leave, and disability insurance, is examined in this paper for the first time. Third, the present study employs a more comprehensive set of controls than that used in most previous studies. No association between attractiveness and wages is found for men, while there is some evidence for a beauty penalty for women. Moreover, attractiveness is found to significantly associate with the number of fringe benefits the workers enjoy. Further analysis indicates that the uncovered gaps are likely due to differentiated treatment. Overall, the findings suggest that the examination of earnings gaps alone may produce an incomplete picture of the effects of attractiveness on labour market outcomes. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the related literature. Section III presents the data and the methodology. The results are reported in Section IV.

Height has been positively associated with the propensity to marry, length of marriage, and the education and economic outcomes of marriage partners. These associations are most commonly identified for male samples. Studies using female samples are few in number and mixed in their findings. This study uses a pooled sample of national surveys from 64 countries to evaluate how women’s height may relate to the timing of marriage and partner characteristics. The findings suggest that women’s height shows modest associations to the timing of marriage, partner education, and partner occupation status. The strongest effects from height occur toward the extremes of the height distribution. There is some variation in these relationships across three major developing regions (Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia), and for education in particular, the association is shown to be stronger in countries with shorter average female height.","In both historical and contemporary populations, height has been shown to positively associate with a number of desirable outcomes. Taller individuals tend to be healthier and more educated, earn higher wages, and show higher scores on cognitive assessments (see Steckel (2009) for a review of recent literature). Explanations for these associations often refer to height as being a marker for the nutritional and disease environments in early-life that affect physical and cognitive development. Constrained growth in early-life – particularly during the first years of life when height-growth is fastest – has been shown to correlate with lower cognitive test scores and shorter adult height (Case and Paxson, 2010; Murasko, 2013; Perkins et al., 2011; Silventoinen, 2003). These traits affect adult health and economic outcomes, so if perceptions of height are sufficiently linked to these outcomes in a population, then it can be surmised that taller height would be seen as more desirable.====Perhaps as a result of these associations, taller men have been shown to fare better in marriage markets. Height has been positively associated with the propensity to marry, length of marriage, and the education and economic outcomes of marriage partners. Examples from historical data include Hacker (2008) for Union soldiers during the US Civil War, Murray (2000) for men enrolled in Amherst College (Massachusetts, US) between 1832 and 1879, and Manfredini et al. (2013) for Italian men around the turn of the 20th century. Examples of studies that evaluate more contemporary samples include Herpin (2005) for French men, Marco-Gracia (2018) for Spanish men, Sohn (2015) for Indonesian men, Yamamura and Tsutsui (2017) for Japanese men, and Tao and Yin (2016) for Taiwanese men. The underlying theme in many of these studies is that height serves as a marker of a man’s economic potential, making taller men more desirable as partners. Sohn (2015) in particular provides an estimate of the earnings-value to male height, suggesting that 2/3 of the value attached to a man’s height in Indonesia relative to his wife’s height is explained by his earnings potential.====Men’s height has also been shown to associate with the education levels of their partners. Part of these associations might derive from assortative mating on height. There tends to be a modest correlation between partner heights (r ≈ 0.2) across countries (Stulp et al., 2017), and height tends to associate with education outcomes for both men and women (see Murasko (2019) for associations in women using a similar sample as this study; see also Case and Paxson (2008) and Čvorović (2019)). However, even when controlling for women’s height, studies still show an association between husbands’ height and wives’ education. Oreffice and Quintana-Domeque (2010) and Stulp et al. (2014) both find that shorter men in the US are married to women with lower education attainment, and Ponzo and Scoppa (2015) show similar findings for Italian men.====Fewer studies have evaluated how women’s height may influence their own marital outcomes. It is often suggested that men prefer women who are shorter than themselves (the “male-taller” norm), and this does seem to be the case in many populations (Sear, 2010). However, this does not necessarily mean that men prefer women who are shorter than average. Evidence on assortative mating on height suggests that the male-taller norm is to some extent relative to individual height (Courtiol et al., 2010; Pawlowski, 2003). The key question is why female height may be a factor in mating choice. Women’s height can act as a marker for her own economic potential, but it is not clear that such potential is a driving characteristic in her marriage prospects. While men may be evaluated on their perceived economic potential, prospects for women may be more strongly influenced by their perceived reproductive or nurturing potential (Sear, 2006). Indeed, women’s height has been shown to be positively related to birth outcomes in lower- and middle-income countries, possibly owing to height being a marker for maternal health (Monden and Smits, 2009; Özaltin et al., 2010). However no consensus view has formed as to the potential role of women’s height in marriage markets, with studies finding mixed results on the empirical associations between women’s height and marriage outcomes.====Baten and Murray (1998) provide a unique historical evaluation of the relationship between women’s height and marital outcomes using data from a Bavarian women’s prison between 1819 and 1886. They find that shorter women prisoners were less likely to marry than their taller counterparts. The few studies that evaluate contemporary samples tell mixed stories. Among those that look at higher-income countries, Nettle (2002) shows that the probability of marriage increases through mean height for British women, but then declines for taller women. His data suggests that this may partly result from a higher probability of limiting health conditions at the extremes of height that reduces the probability of a long-standing relationship. Yamamura and Tsutsui (2017) find that taller Japanese women were more likely to marry in the past, but this association has diminished for women born after 1965. Similarly, height was not found to be related to the probability of marriage in Taiwanese women (Tao and Yin, 2016).====A small number of studies look at women from less developed countries. Smits and Monden (2012) show that the odds of marriage for Indian women increase with height until the 90th percentile (about 160 cm) at which point there is a modest decline. They also show that taller women are less likely to marry early (<17 years age) than their shorter counterparts. Looking at more traditional societies, Sear et al. (2004) and Sear and Marlowe (2009) find no relation between height and mating success in contemporary foraging and farming populations in Gambia and Tanzania.====There is also mixed evidence on how women’s height may relate to her partner’s education and economic outcomes. As mentioned above, assortative mating on height may be expected to yield some correlation between women’s height and her partner’s outcomes. Indeed, taller women have been shown to have spouses with higher educational attainment in India (Smits and Monden, 2012) and Italy (Ponzo and Scoppa, 2015). The former study found a linear relationship between women’s height and spousal education, while the latter study found a non-linear association such that height-effects began to reverse above 169 cm (approximately one standard deviation above their sample mean height). In contrast to these studies, Oreffice and Quintana-Domeque (2010) find no significant association between women’s height and husbands’ education or earnings for women in the US.====Most of the above-mentioned studies used samples from higher-income countries. The small number of studies that evaluated samples from less developed countries (Gambia, India, Tanzania) found mixed results. This is a notable gap in the literature as women’s height might be thought a stronger predictor of economic and reproductive potential in less developed countries given the risk of detrimental exposure in early-life that affects these outcomes. There are also higher rates of earlier marriage in less developed countries in which women may have less agency in their marital choices and men’s preferences may dominate. This paper adds to the literature by presenting a study on the associations between women’s height and marriage market outcomes that is larger in scale than previous work. National surveys from 64 low- and middle-income countries are pooled to evaluate marriage and partner outcomes relative to women’s height. Represented regions include Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and regions of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. By assessing these relationships for populations of women across the developing regions of the world, this paper offers a broad view on the potential role of women’s height in their marital outcomes that has hitherto been evaluated only in smaller, country-specific samples and produced mixed findings.","Height, marriage, and partner characteristics for women in low- and middle-income countries",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19303284,11 May 2020,2020,Research Article,64.0

Height, chest circumference, and mid upper arm circumference were measured each year from 1904 to 1951. Body weight is available from 1933 to 1951. We used prediction equations from the literature, and also developed our own equations, which we tested and validated on the dataset from 1933 to 1951. We used a representative sample of usually 19-year-old Swiss males (N = 88,792, coverage > 88 %). There was an increase in average height and chest circumference between 1904 and 1951. During both world wars, chest circumference, mid upper arm circumference, weight, and BMI decreased, while height stagnated. Overall mean weight and BMI increased from 1904 to 1951, but decreased during the Great Depression. After World War II, weight quickly returned to the pre-war and pre-Great Depression level, while BMI had not reached the 1933 level by 1951. Average weights of the lower and middle socioeconomic groups were catching up with average weight of the upper socioeconomic group from 1904 to 1951. The convergence in height is less pronounced. Finally, we show that it is possible to accurately predict mean weight and BMI from other ==== measurements. We suggest that our estimation approach could be replicated for other historical populations to obtain more information on how ==== changed over time.","Anthropometric measurements assess the size, proportions, and composition of the human body, and are common external indicators of nutritional status (Willett and Hu, 2012; WHO Expert Committee, 1995). Because nutritional status is an important part of human health, growth in children and body dimensions at all ages also reflect the overall health and welfare of individuals and populations (WHO Expert Committee, 1995). Therefore anthropometric measurements are used to determine the inclusion of individuals, families, and communities in intervention programs to improve nutrition and health in general, as well as to evaluate those interventions (WHO Expert Committee, 1995).====Changes in the size and shape of the human body can be linked to various environmental changes (Ruff, 2018b; Floud et al., 2011). The reconstruction of body size and shape of past populations is a major focus in archaeological and anthropological research (Ruff, 2018a; Steckel and Rose, 2002). It is used to infer behaviour, based on long-bone structure, and to study the impact of changes in climate and nutrition on the human body. One main emphasis is to assess health status using variation in stature (Ruff, 2018a). Changes in average height have also been widely used in anthropometric history as a marker of changes in living standards (Floud et al., 2011; Steckel, 2009). In both Ruff and Floud et al., stature as well as weight and BMI are analysed (Ruff, 2018a; Carson, 2016; Floud et al., 2011; Ruff et al., 2005). While in archaeological and anthropological research, weight and BMI values have been estimated indirectly from skeletal remains, studies in anthropometric history have relied on historical sources to provide direct weight measurements.====In both cases, sample size has often been small, not least because direct weight measurements are scarce compared to height records. In addition, there is little information on weight and BMI values of a representative sample of young people who are generally healthy. To our knowledge, no studies have reconstructed and estimated body weights based on other available anthropometric measurements for a period of several years and for a representative historical population living in the first half of the 20th century. The existing studies in anthropometric history are either based on available weight measurements from the late 19th century, or on specific subpopulations like cadets, boarding school children or prisoners (Komlos and Carson, 2017; Komlos and Brabec, 2010).====Therefore, it is still largely unclear how BMI values developed in historical populations in the first half of the 20th century, which included boom times and economic crises, as well as two world wars (Komlos and Carson, 2017). In Switzerland, there was an above average increase in GDP per capita since the end of the 19th century, making Switzerland one of the richest countries in the world by World War I (Floris et al., 2019a). At the same time, Swiss on average became taller and experienced increased life expectancy, though in contrast to GDP per capita, they were not at the top of European rankings for height or life expectancy at birth (Floris et al., 2019a). The same is true for real wages. The increase is evident and Switzerland was no longer a low-wage country by World War I, but in comparison Swiss purchasing power was not higher than abroad. Living standards increased steadily until 1950, with noticeable but short-term decreases or stagnation during the two world wars and the Great Depression. Weight and BMI reflect the immediate nutritional conditions while height is the result of the cumulative net nutrition over the entire growth years. Thus, it is interesting to analyse how weight and BMI have developed relative to the increase in height and other well-being indicators during an erratic period when war, economic growth and economic crisis alternated and the welfare state expanded (Rosenberg, 2012).====The short-termed impact of World War I on birth weights, as well as on height and upper arm circumference of school children has already been analysed for some regions in Switzerland (Staub, 2016; Floris et al., 2016). In addition, the development of height, BMI, chest circumference and right upper arm circumference of conscripts has been studied for cross-sectional Swiss conscripts data (years: 1875–1879, 1933–1939, 1994–2014) (Staub et al., 2016; Schoch et al., 2012; Staub et al., 2010). A rising trend in BMI values was observed over the course of the 20th century using three cross-sections from the 1870s, the 1930s and 2014: average BMI among conscripts raised from 20.63 kg/m2 in the 1870s to 23.29 kg/m2 in 2014 (Staub et al., 2016; Schoch et al., 2012; Staub et al., 2010). In the 1870s and 1930s, weight and BMI values were almost symmetrically distributed (Staub et al., 2016). In the 1870s, 12.1 % of the young Swiss conscripts were underweight, 1.6 % overweight, and 0.1 % obese by modern standards, whereas in 2014 5.5 % were underweight, 18.4 % overweight and 5.7 % obese (Staub et al., 2016).====In the case of these anthropometric data analysed for Switzerland, however, there is a large time gap in the data for body weight measurements between 1880 and 1932 (the army did not consider body weight to be an important measure of nutritional status and military fitness at the time). In this paper, we aim to fill this weight gap and estimate weight and BMI based on height, chest circumference and mid upper arm circumference measures of Swiss conscripts in the city of Zurich for each year between 1904 to 1932. We used existing anthropometric prediction equations from the literature and developed equations that we tested and validated on our 1933–1951 dataset, which includes body weight data. This makes it possible to investigate changes in mean weight and BMI in the first half of the 20th century for a representative sample of young urban adults on a yearly basis.","Filling the weight gap: Estimating body weight and BMI using height, chest and upper arm circumference of Swiss conscripts in the first half of the 20th century",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19303429,11 May 2020,2020,Research Article,65.0

While obesity is rarely the sole cause of an illness, obese people are more likely to suffer from health issues, such as heart disease and diabetes, and thus have higher medical expenditures, which in turn lead to higher incidences of financial distress. The literature suggests that medical expenditures are one of the major causes of bankruptcies. Himmelstein et al. (2009) found that approximately 62 % of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical. Mathur (2006) used the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and found that up to 27 % of all bankruptcy filings involved cases where medical bills were the primary form of debt. This research question seems particularly important given the high levels of obesity in the United States—the prevalence of obesity has been increasing and was 39.8 % among adults during 2015–2016 in the United States (Hales et al., 2017).====The only study that examines the link between obesity and personal bankruptcy seems to be that of Guettabi and Munasib (2015), who use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and find that the risk of filing for bankruptcy is 22 percent higher for obese individuals. While individual-level data provide researchers with more flexibility in their analyses, one limitation to using the NLSY79 for studying personal bankruptcy rates is that it cannot necessarily be generalized to the overall US population. The NLSY79 consists of approximately 12,000 individuals aged 14–22 when they were first surveyed in 1979. Guettabi and Munasib’s sample consists of individuals of ages 28–51, and, even though they are a nationally representative sample of the overall population of similar ages, their analysis does not include those who are in their late-50 s/early-60 s and not eligible for Medicare yet. This age group should be included when studying the economic costs of obesity, as the incidence of obesity and health problems tend to increase with age. Furthermore, to examine this issue, using aggregate data is important and relevant, given that many policy interventions often take place at an aggregate level (see Abadie et al., 2010 for a review).==== This study uses a nationally representative panel of more than 3100 counties from the US Court and thus contains all bankruptcy filings from fifty states in the United States.====Using annual county-level data on bankruptcy rates for the period 2005–2017 and obesity rates for the period 2004–2016, I find that higher obesity rates are associated with higher bankruptcy, beyond what can be explained by local economic conditions and demographic characteristics, state-specific economic shocks, and county-specific time trends.

We find evidence that respondents in a mixed-mode opinion survey exhibit social desirability bias in both reported sweetened beverage consumption and beliefs about the health and economic benefits of sweetened beverage taxes. We do so in a study of 1704 adults residing in Seattle, Minneapolis, and the D.C. metro area. Phone respondents in our survey under-report sweetened beverage consumption by 0.63 beverages per week relative to web respondents (average web respondent consumption is 3.55 beverages per week). They also over-report their beliefs about the positive health and economic impacts of sweetened beverage taxes by 0.54 points in an 18-point index (average web respondent index score is 2.79). These differences are measured after we control for selection into survey mode by using matching methods, and we interpret them as occurring due to social desirability bias. In contrast to these findings, there is no modal difference in respondents’ stated approval of sweetened beverage taxes, and so we conclude that this question is not subject to social desirability bias.","The recent introduction of sugar sweetened beverage taxes as health-promoting policies has created a demand for information about the impacts of these taxes on the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (henceforth shortened to sweetened beverages). A flurry of recent papers have found that these taxes do, in fact, raise beverage prices and reduce purchases in affected areas, a necessary intermediate step in reducing consumption (see Teng et al.(2019) for a survey). However, with the potential for consumers to cross borders in order to purchase sweetened beverages outside of the taxed zone (Cawley et al., 2019), inferring sweetened beverage consumption from beverage purchases inside the taxed area may overestimate the consumption reduction due to taxes.====To address this issue, researchers have also used self-reported sweetened beverage consumption, measured either with bespoke surveys or large-scale surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), to evaluate the price responsiveness of consumers to sweetened beverage taxes (Falbe et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019b). These data may also be important for detecting the extent to which consumers avoid these taxes by shopping outside the taxed region. Accurate reports of sweetened beverage consumption are additionally useful for estimating the distributional impacts of sweetened beverage taxes, and optimally designing future tax policies (O’Donoghue and Rabin, 2006).====However, recent public attention around the health effects of sugar sweetened beverage consumption, as well as the growing use of sweetened beverage taxes to curb their purchase, suggests that social norms regarding the acceptability of consuming these beverages may be undergoing a shift (Tamir et al., 2018). As such, self-reported sweetened beverage consumption is increasingly prone to social desirability bias, a form of bias that arises from under-reporting opinions, habits, or behaviors that are in contrast with prevailing social norms. In particular, a study by Klesges and coauthors finds that pre-teen girls’ self-reported sweetened beverage consumption is negatively associasted with an index of compliance with social norms (Klesges et al., 2004). Their findings suggest that girls who are more compliant report about 10 % fewer beverages consumed than the average, and are consistent with previous studies that have found that women tend to understate their daily caloric intake by about 1% due to social desirability bias (Hebert et al., 1997).====In addition to being found in self-reported dietary intake, social desirability bias has previously been documented in surveys about such sensitive topics as voting behavior, weight, and sexual practices (Schläpfer et al., 2004; Burkill et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016; Burke and Carman, 2017). This bias appears to be meaningful in a policy sense, but to varying degrees. For example, Schläpfer and co-authors find that survey respondents overstate their willingness to pay for public goods by 10–20 times (2004). On the other hand, Burkill and co-authors only find that about 10 % of their survey questions about sexual attitudes and behavior are subject to social desirability bias (2016).====The methodology used to identify social desirability bias is also quite varied. Identification requires benchmarking survey responses against a “true” value for the variable, which is likely to depend on respondent characteristics. Some studies take the approach of modeling true values using known information about the relationship between respondent characteristics and these true values. This is the approach taken by Burke and Carman in detecting social desirability bias in reported weight, and is also similar to the method used by Klesge (Klesges et al., 2004; Burke and Carman, 2017). An alternative approach for detecting social desirability bias is to use mixed mode surveys that collect some responses on the web and some over the phone or in person and comparing responses across modes. In these studies, the web responses are taken to be the true response and the phone or in-person responses taken to be the responses contaminated by social desirability bias. Because there is frequently self-selection into survey mode based on the same characteristics that influence survey response, these studies must first correct for this confounding before estimating bias. They do so either by randomizing respondents into mode, or by using propensity scores or other matching methods to remove the influence of selection on observable characteristics on responses (Duffy et al., 2005; Kreuter et al., 2008; Vannieuwenhuyze et al., 2010). Once selection is accounted for in one of these ways, the remaining modal difference in survey responses is interpreted as social desirability bias.====This study follows the second strategy to explore the existence and extent of social desirability bias in self-reported sweetened beverage consumption, attitudes regarding the health and economic effects of sweetened beverage taxes, and overall approval of such taxes. We do so using a mixed mode (phone and web) survey of adult respondents in four U.S. cities. We use matching methods to account for selection into mode on observed demographic characteristics, and find that modal response differences remain for sweetened beverage consumption and attitudes toward these taxes, but not for overall tax approval. These modal response differences are consistent with social desirability bias, and we interpret them as evidence of bias in the first two outcomes. Our findings contribute to the literature on sweetened beverage tax impacts and extend the findings of Klesges (2004), by showing evidence of social desirability bias in reported sweetened beverage consumption among adults of both sexes and across race, ethnicity, and income lines. Our study is also the first to find evidence of bias in self-reported views on the potential health and economic benefits of sweetened beverage taxes.====The existence of social desirability bias in mixed mode surveys measuring dietary intake of sweetened beverages raises questions about the reliability of any self-reported measures related to sweetened beverages. If phone respondents feel social pressure to alter their responses when speaking to another person on the phone, they almost certainly feel a similar pressure when responding to surveys in-person, and we cannot reject the possibility that they also feel this pressure when responding on the web. Even surveys that report beverage purchases based on products or receipts scanned in the home may be called into question, if the social undesirability of sweetened beverage consumption is strong enough to cause households to neglect to record some purchases.====The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we formally model modal effects on survey responses as a combination of effects from selection by different respondent types into different survey modes and effects due to the mode itself, which we interpret as social desirability bias. In Section 3, we describe our survey, and define our key variables. Section 4 describes the methods we use, Section 5 describes our results and sensitivity analysis, and Section 6 discusses our results, study limitations, and conclusions.",Is the public sweet on sugary beverages?

Previous studies used income and education to measure SES, the NLS enables us to include wealth as well. Previous studies also used cross-sectional data, whereas the NLS allows us to examine whether changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake.====The results indicate an inverse gradient in SSB consumption with respect to both income and wealth, controlling for education. However, we do not find evidence that changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake. This finding suggests that SES influences the development of SSB consumption patterns, but changes in income and wealth generally do not alter them in adulthood.","In developed countries, the burden of disease follows an inverse gradient – for each step up the socioeconomic (SES) ladder disease prevalence falls (Braveman et al., 2010; Marmot, 2004). Research shows that variation in diet by SES contributes to this pattern (Darmon and Drewnowski, 2008; Kirkpatrick et al., 2012; Wang and Chen, 2011; Wang et al., 2014). This paper focuses on one aspect of diet, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB).====Every day roughly half the U.S. population drinks non-diet soda and other types of soft drinks containing added sugars (Bleich et al., 2018; Ogden et al., 2011). Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is associated with an array of health problems, such as obesity (Malik et al., 2006). Although research firmly establishes the negative health effects of SSB consumption (e.g. Malik and Hu, 2015), the economic profile of consumers is less well understood. While some researchers report that SSB drinkers have lower average income (e.g., Ogden et al., 2011), no research to date examines the wealth of those who consume SSB.====Adding wealth to the analysis enables us to examine whether the regular flow of resources (income) has a different relationship with SSB consumption than the accumulated stock of resources (wealth). Some adults, like retirees, have low income and high wealth, while others have high income and low wealth, such as newly minted physicians. Zagorsky and Smith (2017) did not find evidence of an inverse income or wealth gradient in fast-food consumption. Because consumers often purchase fast food and sugary soft drinks together, SSB intake might similarly follow a non-gradient pattern.====Understanding the economic status of people who consume SSB better is important for two reasons. First, those seeking to reduce health inequities need to identify factors that contribute to the disparity in order to develop effective policy. For example, 44 countries have either implemented or passed legislation taxing SSB in the entire country or in various locales (Global Food Research Program, 2019). In the U.S., several cities have enacted SSB taxes (Center for Science in the Public Interest, 2018). Such “soda taxes” may not reduce health disparities if SSB consumption does not in fact rise as SES falls, although they could improve general health. Second, understanding the economic profile of SSB drinkers will help us assess how the benefits and the burdens of such “soda” taxes could be distributed among consumers.",Who drinks soda pop?

Specifically, Courtemanche and Zapata (2014) estimate that BMI is 0.04 standard deviations lower, approximately 1 percent, among all Massachusetts residents following Massachusetts health care reform. Barbaresco et al. (2015) examined the ACA dependent coverage mandate and found similarly sized reductions in BMI. Although these may seem to be modest impacts, these changes in BMI correspond to weight loss of between one and six pounds. This is within the range of estimated weight loss arising from weight loss programs that are tied to financial incentives (between zero and nine pounds lost, see, e.g., Cawley and Price, 2013; Volpp et al., 2008; Finkelstein et al., 2007; Kullgren et al., 2013; Cawley et al., 2007; Cawley et al., 2013; John et al., 2011; Charness and Gneezy, 2009) and is larger than the estimates of weight loss arising from taxes on sugar sweetened beverages (between zero and three pounds lost, see, e.g., Fletcher et al., 2010a; Fletcher et al., 2010b; Fletcher et al., 2013; Tosun and Skidmore, 2007; Finkelstein et al., 2013; Zhen et al., 2014).====A decline in BMI at the conditional mean, however, does not inform policymakers as to which individuals along the distribution of BMI are experiencing improvements in weight-related health outcomes. Barbaresco et al. (2015) tested for the presence of distributional effects by examining whether the likelihood of obesity changed following the ACA dependent coverage mandate and found a 1.4 percentage point reduction in obesity among young adults who benefitted from the expansion, a reduction of six percent from the pre period mean of 0.2. Thus, the reductions in BMI observed following the ACA dependent coverage mandate correspond to important improvements in weight-related health among those with the worst weight-related health outcomes. It is important to understand the effect of the expansion at the top of the distribution of BMI because severe obesity is associated with substantially higher costs compared to moderate obesity; severe obesity was found to be more than twice as costly as moderate obesity in terms of annual health expenditures, compared to normal weight (an average increase of $2,264 annually vs. an average increase of $823) (Andreyeva et al., 2004).====Although previous work documented reductions in BMI following Massachusetts health care reform and the ACA dependent coverage mandate, there are no documented reductions in BMI or obesity following the 2008 Oregon Medicaid expansions (Baicker et al., 2013), the ACA in general (Courtemanche et al., 2018), and the ACA Medicaid expansions (Courtemanche et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2017). These earlier null results may reflect the fact that those expansions were different than the Massachusetts health care reform and the ACA dependent coverage mandate. For example, the composition of individuals who were treated by the expansions differ—those treated by Massachusetts health care reform and the ACA dependent coverage mandate have relatively high socioeconomic status. The expansions also have different scope—the two earlier reforms were on a smaller scale than the 2014 provisions of the ACA. Additionally, there was a different mix of public versus private provision of health insurance arising from each expansion. Alternatively, the earlier null results of the reforms on BMI at the conditional mean may have obscured effects at different points along the distribution of BMI.====Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, we examine whether these three recent health care reforms led to changes in BMI at different points along the distribution of BMI in two ways. First, we estimate linear probability models of the likelihood a respondent is overweight or obese, obese, or severely obese separately for each of the reforms. Evidence from these linear probability models provides evidence that the reduction in BMI following the ACA dependent coverage mandate was large enough to result in a reduction in the likelihood of obesity and severe obesity; we also find suggestive evidence of a similar pattern of results in Massachusetts. Second, we estimate the effects of all three reforms on BMI throughout the distribution of BMI using unconditional quantile regression models (as in Firpo et al., 2009). We find evidence that all three insurance expansions led to statistically significant reductions in BMI among the severely obese who are at the top of the distribution of BMI. With unconditional quantile regression we also confirm our earlier findings with larger reductions in BMI for those who are obese or severely obese following Massachusetts health care reform and the ACA dependent coverage mandate.====Thus, all three insurance expansions led to reductions in BMI for the severely obese, and we find some evidence that two of the expansions—Massachusetts health care reform and the ACA dependent coverage mandate—also led to a lower likelihood that a respondent is obese or severely obese. Together, these results highlight an important benefit of recent health insurance expansions: improved weight-related health for the most vulnerable. As reductions in BMI among the severely obese may be associated with substantial cost-savings and improvements in health, it is important that policymakers consider these perhaps unintended benefits arising from the expansion of health insurance.",Distributional Effects of Recent Health Insurance Expansions on Weight-Related Outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X18301102,28 April 2020,2020,Research Article,69.0

While it is well established that the fraction of mothers smoking during pregnancy is non-negligible, it is an open question of how many parents actually quit smoking to account for the adverse health effects accruing to their offspring. It is also unknown for how long smoking is reduced after first childbirth. This paper investigates these questions in a ====. The analyzed time period covers smoking patterns several years before childbirth and up to twenty years afterwards. Women’s smoking probability already drops several years before first childbirth and it remains reduced until the first child turns 18 years old. In the second and third trimester of pregnancy, the drop is largest by around 75 percent.","Maternal smoking is harmful to infant health as it increases the likelihood of premature births, of reduced lung functioning, and of mortality by sudden infant death syndrome (Cunningham et al., 1995; Haustein, 1999; McCowan et al., 2009; Williamson, 2010). On average, children of smoking mothers are born at a lower gestational age and with a lower birth weight (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Bharadwaj et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015). These disadvantages are not limited to the early years of childhood but were found to continue into adulthood. Simon (2016) shows that exposure to smoke in utero or early childhood increases sickness absences from school, asthma attacks as well as doctor visits and hospitalization for pre-school and school children. Adverse health conditions during childhood have long-lasting consequences on educational attainment and labor market outcomes in adulthood (Currie and Hyson, 1999).====According to the theory of rational addiction by Becker and Murphy (1988), individuals’ consumption of cigarettes is modelled within a utility maximization framework. Individuals decide upon smoking by comparing their gains from smoking (e.g. by satisfying their addiction) with the costs of cigarette consumption.==== The costs of smoking include not only the price of a pack of cigarettes but also the costs of future health restrictions. This is because smoking does not only depend on the current costs and benefits, but individuals are also forward-looking and aware of the potential negative consequences of smoking in the future. While there is a large literature showing that increases in the selling price of cigarettes reduce smoking in general (see Gallet and List, 2003 for an overview), much less is known about how much parents account for their children’s adverse health outcomes when deciding to smoke.====In a longitudinal analysis using German data, this paper analyzes how much smoking decreases during first childbirth. Previous studies analyze the extent of smoking cessation and relapse before, during and shortly after pregnancy for a sample of mothers by comparing smoking rates at different points of pregnancy (Fingerhut et al., 1990; Kahn et al., 2002; Colman and Joyce, 2003; Graham et al., 2010). These authors show that smoking goes down during pregnancy and returns to its former level immediately after childbirth. Estimating a multivariate model, Bradford (2003) also shows that smoking participation declines during pregnancy. However, these results do not account for the well-documented fact that smoking patterns vary with individuals’ age and display strong trends over time (Drogenbeauftragte der Bundesregierung, 2017). Additionally, the previous studies rely on data where mothers were asked retrospectively about their smoking behavior before and during pregnancy, with pre-pregnancy smoking generally being inquired for the time directly before pregnancy. If parenthood already leads to smoking cessation some time before pregnancy because individuals are forward-looking, comparing the period directly before pregnancy with the periods afterwards underestimates the probability of smoking cessation during pregnancy and overrates the relapse probability.====Our study does not only focus on the time of pregnancy but also analyzes changes in smoking patterns from three years before first childbirth up to more than twenty years afterwards. Within a dynamic model, parents’ smoking patterns are compared to the patterns of non-parents who are at the same age to account for age-specific smoking behaviors and who were interviewed in the same years to control for cyclical influences and general trends in smoking. Applying individual fixed effects eliminates level differences between parents’ and non-parents’ average smoking probabilities. It also accounts for time-constant aspects of one’s personality (e.g. self-control). The model is not only estimated for mothers but also for fathers, an aspect that contributes further to the literature. To our knowledge, there is only one study of a small sample of 200 men showing that the transition to fatherhood reduces men’s cigarette consumption (Kerr et al., 2011).====Our motivation to look at the long-run effects of motherhood and fatherhood also builds upon the theory of rational addiction (Becker and Murphy, 1988). Even though maternal smoking is most harmful during pregnancy and the time of breastfeeding due to children’s direct exposure to smoke-related toxins embedded in nutrition (e.g. in breast milk), secondhand smoking when children grow up could also impair the offspring’s health. This could increase the health costs of smoking for several years after childbirth, which could induce parents to quit smoking for a longer time period than just during pregnancy and the time of breastfeeding. Yet, because preventing kids from inhaling secondhand smoke could also be achieved without fully ceding to smoke (e.g. by avoiding to smoke at home or next to one’s children), it is an empirical question whether a long-term effect exists and whether fathers also quit smoking.====The theoretical model also predicts heterogeneous results by parents’ level of education. Due to the models’ life-cycle perspective, time preferences play an important role in smoking decisions. Individuals with higher discount rates, i.e. those having a higher preference for the present, perceive future costs less important for current decisions. Compared to the higher educated, it can be assumed that, on average, the low educated value the present more over the future. According to Becker’s (1962) human capital theory, a higher discount rate is one important reason why individuals decide to drop out of school earlier. A recent study empirically confirms that higher discount rates predict lower educational attainment (Goldsteyn et al., 2014). Thus, we hypothesize that changes in smoking prevalence around first childbirth are more pronounced for college graduates than for those without a college degree. To test this prediction, the empirical analysis is run separately by level of education.====Our analysis is also insightful for policy makers. The existing literature shows that policies can affect mothers’ smoking decisions through tax-induced increases in cigarette prices (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Colman et al., 2003; Lien and Evans, 2005; Williamson, 2010; Adams et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2015).==== Also, non-tax policies can reduce maternal smoking (Dolan-Mullen et al., 1994; Adams et al., 2012; Bharadwaj et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015).==== Harris et al. (2015) find that increases in health warnings on cigarette packages had a larger impact on quitting rates among pregnant women in Uruguay than tax increases. We contribute to the policy debate by emphasizing the importance of the non-monetary price of smoking. Our results can also provide evidence which educational groups should be targeted with interventions.====Our results show that women who enter parenthood start to quit smoking as early as three years before childbirth and that smoking is less likely until the first child turns 18 years old. During the second and third term of pregnancy, the smoking probability drops by up to 75 percent. One year after childbirth, smoking rates are still lower by around 60 percent. For men, the general pattern in smoking rates is similar, but it is less pronounced and has less of a long-term nature (even though it should be mentioned that these results are not statistically significant in all specifications of the robustness analysis). While the impact on women’s smoking rates is largest during pregnancy and immediately after first childbirth and steadily diminishes afterwards until it becomes insignificant after 18 years, the impact on men’s smoking rate is also negative but relatively constant over the first twelve years after first birth. Furthermore, we show that smoking cessation is less likely for the second childbirth compared to first birth, which confirms previous studies. However, this result solely appears because second childbirth occurs more often in environments where smoking is already reduced from first childbirth. This is a new insight. It suggests that analyzing births other than first childbirths underestimates smoking cessation when only comparing smoking patterns shortly before and after pregnancy. In fact, the average smoking rate during pregnancy is very similar for first and second childbirth.====The results are robust to various model extensions and empirical tests. For instance, the general patterns of smoking cessation remain similar after controlling for changes in household characteristics like marriage or household income. They become only slightly attenuated, indicating that only some of the drop in smoking is mediated by changes in household characteristics. To show that non-parents are a suitable control group for accounting for age and year effects, we provide suggestive evidence that smoking patterns of parents and non-parents evolve similarly before first childbirth is expected. We also estimate specifications excluding non-parents where identification solely rests on differences in the timing of parenthood, conditional on age and year. While the findings remain similar for women, the results become smaller and turn statistically insignificant for men.====The results remain unchanged when running the analysis separately by interview mode, i.e. for individuals who report smoking to an interviewer visiting their homes and for individuals who fill in a written questionnaire without having any personal contact to an interviewer. This is important because our data contains self-reported smoking, which might suffer from social desirability bias, i.e. underreporting because societies’ norms require mothers to be non-smokers, especially during pregnancy. Given that the results are similar regardless of the interview mode, we conclude that our findings of smoking cessation mirror actual quit behavior. We also provide evidence that the observed patterns indeed reflect smoking cessation and not changes in smoking initiation. The results are robust to using a specification that focus on a sample of individuals older than 25 years, which is an age at which smoking initiation no longer occurs in Germany.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the data, provides a descriptive analysis of smoking cessation before and after first childbirth, and describes the empirical strategy. Section 3 documents the long-run effects of parenthood on smoking patterns separately by gender and education. It also shows that the results are robust in various dimensions.

Much less research has investigated the reverse phenomenon: the effect of adult children’s human capital (education) on the financial and caregiving support they provide to aging parents. Recent studies find a positive association between children’s education and the caregiving and financial support they provide to their parents, but these studies fall short of establishing causality (Bonsang, 2007; Couch et al., 1999; Laditka and Laditka, 2001; McGarry and Schoeni, 1995; Park, 2014; Raut and Tran, 2005; Silverstein et al., 2006; Williams et al., 2012).====A challenge to establishing causality in these studies is that children’s education is endogenous to the financial and caregiving support they provide to their parents. Parents of more educated children are likely to be more educated, financially secure, and healthier in old age and therefore, less likely to need their children’s support, financial or caregiving, compared to parents of less educated children. Further, growing up with parents in ill health is likely to hamper children’s education. Unhealthy parents, who would need more care and financial support in old age, are often not able to finance their children’s education.====In this study, we address this endogeneity in children’s education and caregiving and financial support toward parents to estimate if the relationship is causal by bringing three innovations to the extant research. First, we study the association between adult children’s educational attainment and caring for parents (caregiving time, financial, and knowledge support) in the last year of the parent’s life. The last year of life is a critical period when older adults often experience significant functional and cognitive decline and the need for caregiving is high (Hank and Brandt, 2013; Hank and Jürges, 2010). By assessing the end-of-life period, we minimize survival bias and to some extent control for the aging parent’s need for caregiving support. Second, we use a rich set of variables to control for parental age, education, and wealth. Second, we control for whether the parents were in long-term care or home-care settings in the last year of their lives, and in some models, for various measures of the parents’ self-reported health and functional limitations. Third, we estimate models with family-level (parent) fixed effects and compare the caregiving and financial support that siblings with different levels of education provide to their parents. Parent fixed-effects models allow us to control for parental needs for caregiving and financial support and other unobserved parent-level characteristics.====Our empirical analysis is based on 10 waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), from 1994–2012. We find that children’s education has a significantly positive association with monetary transfers and knowledge support they provide to aging parents. Evidence of children’s education on instrumental support to parents is nonlinear in that while a high school degree and some college education increases instrumental support, a college degree does not have a statistically significant association. This last finding is in line with previous research that found children with higher earnings providing less time support to their parents (Zissimopoulos, 2001). Estimates remain robust across models, including those that include parent fixed effects.",How children's education affects caregiving: Evidence from parent’s last years of life,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302710,11 April 2020,2020,Research Article,71.0

For example, historical changes in the mean estimated stature in Northern and Central Europe have a characteristic pattern, with very short values in the Neolithic (when human nutrition depended on agriculture and low-quality proteins from cereals), and a dramatic increase during the late Eneolithic (3==== millenium BC), with the advance of the Corded Ware culture (Ehler & Vančata, 2009; Mummert et al., 2011; Ruff, 2018, p. 78-79). As already summarized by previous papers (Grasgruber et al., 2014; Grasgruber et al., 2016a), this sudden break can be connected with the spread of lactose tolerance and regular dairy consumption. Following the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 19==== century, height in the highly industrialized parts of Europe began to increase in an unprecedented way. Although the rising gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was the fundamental trigger of this trend, a more direct influence should be ascribed to changes in health care (reduced child mortality) and improved nutrition (Baten & Blum, 2012; Hatton, 2013).====Our ecological comparison of 105 populations (Grasgruber et al., 2016a) showed that the current height of young men in Europe, North Africa, Asia and Oceania is most strongly associated with the statistics of protein intake (supply) from the FAOSTAT database. The dominant role was played by dairy proteins, which naturally results from the high biological quality of their amino acid spectrum, and other nutrients in dairy products that are essential for bone growth (calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D) (see e.g. Black et al., 2002). The combination of ‘highly correlated proteins’ from dairy products, pork, eggs, beef and potatoes further increased correlation coefficients up to r = 0.85 in a sample of 93 populations. In contrast, cereals and legumes correlated negatively with height, and the shortest statures were typical of populations in the tropical belt of Asia where they were strongly associated with proteins from rice and legumes. In a multiple regression model incorporating 72 populations, the combination of three nutritional factors (‘highly correlated proteins’, cereal & legume proteins, total energy) explained by far the largest proportion of variance (adjusted R==== = 0.815). The best model combining four nutritional and three socio-economic variables was only moderately better (adjusted R==== = 0.872). At the same time, total fertility was a socio-economic factor with the strongest additive effect, followed by child mortality and urbanization.====As already indicated by the historical analyses mentioned above, GDP per capita did not have such a strong and direct influence on height in this ecological study. The explanation lies in the fact that the diet of wealthy Muslim and East Asian nations remains inferior relative to the diet of European nations, being characterized either by a low consumption of dairy products or the religious prohibition on pork, a relatively high consumption of cereals, and the dominance of low-quality meats (poultry). The unequal distribution of wealth (expressed by the Gini index) and surprisingly low health-related expenditures in Muslim oil superpowers, relative to the high GDP per capita, are other factors that obviously contribute to short statures in these populations.====Interestingly, there also exist intriguing relationships of height with the frequency of paternal genetic markers (Y haplogroups) which must reflect “founder effects” in isolated human communities. Genetic predispositions associated with the spread of Y haplogroup I-M170 can illuminate the unexpectedly tall statures in the Western Balkan countries, which contrast with their unimpressive GDP per capita and mostly mediocre level of dietary protein quality (Grasgruber et al., 2017, 2019). On the other hand, Y haplogroups of Neolithic (Near Eastern) origin correlate negatively with stature in Europe. Certain Y haplogroups also show positive or negative correlations with height in North Africa, Asia and Oceania. These geographical tendencies based on Y haplogroups are being largely confirmed by studies of autosomal DNA (Berg et al., 2017). However, one persistent weakness of these autosomal studies is the omission of the most interesting region - the Western Balkans.====Although all these comparisons were only ecological, i.e. at the level of populations, it is important to emphasize that this fact does not diminish their biological relevance and importance. Realistically, without the use of long-term socio-economic and nutritional statistics, it is not possible to trace the influence of external conditions on the child’s growth, which may last up to ∼20 years. Even current ideas about the nutritional needs of children are based on studies lasting only several days or weeks, whose accuracy and reliability are questionable. Indeed, recent research indicates that the actual protein recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies, which are based on short-term studies of nitrogen balance, underestimate the need for protein in children by almost two-fold (Elango et al., 2011). This agrees with our ecological data, because mean male height increases linearly with the supply of high-quality proteins, and no levelling-off of this trend can be observed (Grasgruber et al., 2016a).====The aim of the present study was to apply a similar ecological methodology on the American continent, which consists of 35 sovereign states and multiple dependent territories variously tied to Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.==== The total number of populations would thus increase by roughly four dozens and the larger size of this sample would enable a more precise evaluation of the role of environmental factors in the global context.",Nutritional and socio-economic predictors of adult height in 152 world populations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19300772,28 February 2020,2020,Research Article,72.0

Extreme height loss, defined as height loss greater than 3 cm is associated with 8–10 percent lower lung function and grip strength among both men and women. Extreme height loss among Indonesian older women is also associated with a 7-percentage-point increase in the likelihood of death in the most recent wave. Our results emphasize the importance of taking into account age related height loss as a significant covariate for health and mortality of older adults, independent of baseline height and health.","There is a rich literature at the intersection of bio-demography and economics, devoted to the study of human height- both as an outcome and as a predictor of economic well-being. Childhood and adult height have been found to be affected by socioeconomic factors at micro and macro level, such as parental investment and disease environment respectively (Thomas et al., 1990; Thomas and Strauss, 1992; Deaton, 2007). Adult height, considered to be a good proxy for childhood health (Cohen et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012), has been established as an important covariate for adult labor market outcomes and health (e.g., see Case and Paxson (2008b)). However, as Huang et al. (2013) explain, while height is a marker of early life health, when studying health of older adults, height shrinkage is a potential marker for later life health. They show that height-health associations for the elderly should take into account age-related height loss because many of the old-age health outcomes they analyze are significantly (and negatively) associated with height shrinkage; in some cases, the coefficients for height loss are larger and/or more significant as compared to those for height. This is an especially important and often ignored consideration for studies using self-reported height since medical literature documents that respondents overestimate current and recalled heights, and that this overestimation increases with age (Cline et al., 1989; Briot et al., 2010; Cawley et al., 2017). This plausibly leads to an attenuation bias in the height-health coefficients for older populations.====Given rapid population aging around the world, there is an increasing interest in late-life health among both academia and policymakers. The growing number of aging surveys over the past and present decade, in both developing and developed countries, is testimony to this. However, very little research has been done in the health-height economics literature regarding how not only height but also height loss could be associated with health in old age. Two recent contributions to the study of height shrinkage in this literature are Huang et al. (2013) using data from China and Fernihough and McGovern (2015) using English data. Both studies find that height shrinkage is negatively correlated with late-life health outcomes. It is important to note that Huang et al. (2013) use cross-sectional relationship between height and limb lengths among younger cohorts to predict pre-shrinkage height and thereafter shrinkage for older cohorts, and Fernihough and McGovern (2015) while utilizing repeated height measurements from longitudinal data, use a measure of height shrinkage ranging from 4 to 10 years.====This paper contributes to the literature by studying actual height shrinkage over the course of a longer time period -17 years - among mid-aged and older Indonesian adults. We draw upon data from the nationally representative Indonesian Family Life Survey, which has repeatedly measured height and health information over almost two decades. Understanding the correlates of height shrinkage and how height shrinkage is related to health decline is critical because Indonesians are among the shorter populations in the world, which indicates worse early life health (see Currie and Vogl (2013) for a detailed review about early-life environment and height). Since it is a developing economy with constrained resources, late-life health for older adults is also expected to be worse than their counterparts in developed countries. Furthermore, our estimates from Indonesia add to the evidence from other Asian countries, such as China in Huang et al. (2013), by following the same individuals over a long period of time and investigating the correlates of actual height shrinkage happened and provide evidence on the longer-term relationship between health, mortality and height shrinkage.====We begin by documenting the extent of height shrinkage among Indonesian older adults aged above 45. We see that women in the older age groups experience more height shrinkage than men. This finding is consistent with the medical literature which has established that women experience greater height loss (Sorkin et al., 1999), with one of the reasons being that women are more prone to osteoporosis and broken bones in old age than men (Cawthon, 2011; Twiss et al., 2002). Mid-aged and older Indonesian women (aged 45+) exhibit considerable height shrinkage despite being short to begin with, losing an average of 1.06 cm over 17 years, while their male counterparts lose 1.02 cm. We then explore gradients in height shrinkage, including age, socioeconomic variables and health variables from both adulthood and childhood. Consistent with the existing medical literature, we find that among both men and women, height loss increases with age and taller individuals shrink more. Men and women, however, have different socioeconomic and health covariates for shrinkage. Among men, higher education, being married at baseline, higher household per capita consumption, and being born in an urban area are associated with lower shrinkage; poor self-reported health at baseline and in childhood are both associated with higher values of shrinkage. Among women, being an ethnic majority and having mainly worked in the agricultural sector are associated with higher shrinkage; greater access to community-level health facilities is associated with lower shrinkage.====In addition, we expand upon previous research by providing estimates for the relationship between height shrinkage and a rich set of health outcomes, including lung function, grip strength, reported difficulties with daily physical activities, and cognition. Studying these health variables is motivated by the three main physiological deteriorations associated with height loss, and the resulting biological changes. First is spinal compression and/or curving (Krege et al., 2015), which could potentially cause internal systems to compress, notably the respiratory system, thereby reducing lung function. Second is muscle loss or sarcopenia (Szulc et al., 2005) which is measured by grip strength, and third is reduced mineral bone density or osteoporosis (Thornton et al., 2004). Since these changes could lead to reduced functional capacity (Ross, 1997), we also study difficulties with daily physical activities. Among our sample of Indonesian older adults, we consistently find a negative relationship between height shrinkage and measures of physical functioning and cognition in old age, even after controlling for baseline measures of height, health and socioeconomic status (SES). There is also important non-linearity in these associations, with extreme height shrinkage (defined as greater than 3 cm) being the most deleterious condition.====Finally, we also explore whether height loss is a significant predictor of mortality. We find that extreme height loss is associated with a 7-percentage-point higher rate of mortality among Indonesian older women. To summarize, in most of the shrinkage-health associations we study, height shrinkage is found to be an important component of height-health associations that is significantly correlated with worse old-age health.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We begin with a review of the existing literature on height, height shrinkage and late-life health in Section 2. We describe the dataset, the analysis sample and variables used in Section 3. We discuss the analytical methods in Section 4. Empirical results are presented in Section 5, where we document the extent of height shrinkage among Indonesian older men and women, explore correlates of height shrinkage, and analyze height-health and shrinkage-health relationships.

On July 1, 2017, Oakland introduced a tax of one cent per ounce on SSBs. In this paper, we estimate the impact of the tax on retail prices, product availability, purchases, and child and adult consumption of taxed beverages in Oakland, as well as of potential substitute beverages. We collected data from Oakland stores and their customers and a matched group of stores in surrounding counties and their customers. We collected information in the months prior to the implementation of the tax and again a year later on: (1) prices, (2) purchase information from customers exiting the stores, and (3) a follow-up household survey of adults and child beverage purchases and consumption. We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the impact of the tax on prices, purchases, and consumption of taxed beverages. We find that roughly 60 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There was a slight decrease in the volume of SSBs purchased per shopping trip in Oakland and a small increase in purchases at stores outside of the city, resulting in a decrease in purchases of 11.33 ounces per shopping trip that is not statistically significant. We find some evidence of increased shopping by Oakland residents at stores outside of the city. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in the overall consumption of SSBs or of added sugars consumed through beverages for either adults or children after the tax.","Taxes on goods that impose external costs on society have been a focus of economics from the beginning of the discipline; even Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations specified that sugar, rum, and tobacco were “extremely proper subjects of taxation” (Smith, 1776). Historically, countries have tended to focus such taxes on tobacco and alcohol rather than sugar. However, in recent decades, there has been increasing recognition of the role of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in causing diabetes and obesity (Johnson et al., 2009; Malik and Hu, 2011). In the past ten years, numerous countries, including France, India, Mexico, and the U.K., have begun taxing SSBs (Cawley et al., 2019a). Such taxes have also been implemented by several U.S. cities in the past five years, including Berkeley, California (2015); Albany, California (2017); Oakland, California (2017); Boulder, Colorado (2017); Cook County, Illinois (August-December 2017); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2017); San Francisco, California (2018); and Seattle, Washington (2018).====The effects of these city-level taxes on SSBs are of great interest, but the evidence base is relatively new and data are scarce; thus, information from each city is valuable and contributes to the evidence base. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect of the SSB tax in Oakland, California, which is equal to one cent per ounce and was first levied on July 1, 2017. The tax is levied on caloric SSBs, including regular soda, energy drinks, sweetened iced tea, and juice drinks; beverages such as diet (non-caloric) soda, water, milk, unsweetened iced tea, and 100 % fruit juice are exempt. Using original hand-collected data of store prices, store exit interviews with customers, and surveys of households, this paper reports the first evidence of the effect of Oakland’s SSB tax on a wide range of relevant outcomes, including retail prices, purchases, and consumption.====This study contributes to the evidence that is based on the experience of cities that adopted such taxes before Oakland. The impact of SSB taxes on retail prices varies across cities, from less than 50 percent in Berkeley (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017; Falbe et al., 2015), to greater than 50 percent but less than complete in Boulder (Cawley et al., 2018a), to essentially complete in both Philadelphia (Cawley et al., 2020, 2018; Seiler et al., 2019) and Cook County (Leider et al., 2018). The impact of SSB taxes on purchases or sales also varies considerably, not just across cities but also within cities across different studies. For example, in Berkeley, two studies using retail scanner data find a substantial reduction in SSB sales of roughly 7–12 percent in supermarkets (Silver et al., 2017; Bollinger and Sexton, 2018), while another finds no reduction in sales in supermarkets (Rojas and Wang, 2017), and one finds no reduction in sales in pharmacies (Bollinger and Sexton, 2018). In Philadelphia, one study that conducted store exit interviews estimated that the SSB tax reduced purchases of taxed beverages by 8.9 ounces per shopping trip (Cawley et al., 2019b), while another found a 38 percent reduction in sales at large chain retailers one year after the tax (Roberto et al., 2019). Both studies find evidence consistent with increases in cross-border shopping.====There is also mixed evidence regarding the impact of SSB taxes on consumption. For Berkeley, researchers found a 24 percent reduction in adults’ SSB consumption and a 37 percent increase in water consumption, 6 months after the tax (Falbe et al., 2016). The reduction in SSB consumption grew over time, averaging over 50 percent three years after the tax (Lee et al., 2019). Results are more mixed for Philadelphia. Repeated cross-sectional phone surveys conducted shortly before and after the tax suggest that the probability of being a daily consumer of soda fell 40 percent after the tax, but there was no substantial change in consumption by several other measures, such as being a daily consumer of any SSBs; the daily volume consumed of SSBs or any category of SSBs also did not substantially change (Zhong et al., 2018). Another study of Philadelphia uses longitudinal household surveys and finds no detectable impact of the Philadelphia SSB tax on the overall SSB consumption of adults or children; however, they do find a reduction in soda consumption for adults and substantial reductions among adults and children that were high consumers of SSBs prior to the tax (Cawley et al., 2019b).====In this paper, we present comprehensive evidence of how the SSB tax in Oakland influenced all of the outcomes described above: retail prices, purchases, and consumption. In brief, we find that roughly 60 percent of the tax was passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. There was a slight decrease in the volume of SSBs purchased per shopping trip in Oakland and a small increase in the volume of purchases at stores outside of the city, and we find some evidence of increased shopping by Oakland residents at stores outside of the city. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in overall consumption of SSBs or untaxed beverages for adults or children after the tax.","Oakland’s sugar-sweetened beverage tax: Impacts on prices, purchases and consumption by adults and children",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302552,21 February 2020,2020,Research Article,74.0

In this study, we examine whether increases and cuts of the soft drink tax lead to similar over- or under-shifting to prices and to similar demand responses. We use longitudinal scanner data of 1,282 Danish households to estimate within-product changes in prices and within-household changes in purchase quantity. The tax hike was overshifted by a factor of 1.6–1.8, while the tax repeal was fully passed through with a factor of 0.9–1.2. On average, consumption was 13.4 percent lower the year after the tax increase compared to the year before. The repeal of the tax was associated with an increase in purchase quantity of 31.0 percent. This is equivalent to price elasticities of −1.3 for both tax hikes and cuts. The results suggest that consumers react similarly to tax cuts compared to tax increases. Furthermore, the increase in purchases following a tax cut has no limiting effect on purchases of other beverages suggesting an increase in the intake of calories. This might have implications for health in countries that consider repealing current taxes on soft drinks.","There is clear evidence suggesting that excessive consumption of added sugar is a main contributor to obesity (Malik et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2015; Hu, 2013), cardio-metabolic problems (Huang et al., 2014; Malik et al., 2014; Xi et al., 2015), type2 diabetes (Vartanian et al., 2007; Imamura et al., 2015; Greenwood et al., 2014), and tooth decay (Bernabé et al., 2014; Park et al., 2015). In many countries sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major source of added sugar intake (Popkin and Hawkes, 2016). Excessive consumption of SSBs is particularly problematic as calories consumed in liquid form are incompletely compensated, i.e. when calorie intake from beverages is increased, intake from other sources is generally reduced by an amount smaller than the increased amount consumed through beverages (Malik et al., 2010; Vartanian et al., 2007; Poppitt, 2015; Maersk et al., 2012; Wolf et al., 2008). There is widespread evidence, that levying taxes on SSBs leads to a reduction in purchases (Cawley et al., 2019; Andreyeva et al., 2010), which has led many jurisdictions to implement taxes on SSBs in order to improve public health, including, among others the UK, Mexico, South Africa, and a number of cities in the US.====Until 2014, also Denmark had a tax on soft drinks====, but decided to repeal the tax in an attempt to reduce cross-border shopping. Similarly, in the US, SSB taxes are facing staunch opposition by beverage companies: In Chicago a soft drink tax was repealed in 2017 after being in place for only four months, (Cook County Government, 2017), while the state of California decided in 2018 to ban cities from introducing further soda taxes for the next twelve years (California Legislative Information, 2018; Backholer et al., 2018). These developments raise questions for policymakers: Are tax cuts passed through to soft drink prices to a similar degree as tax increases? Further, does consumption of sugary drinks react with the same elasticity to tax cuts as compared to tax increases?====The excise tax on soft drinks in Denmark has a long history since it has been in place since the 1930s, but both its introduction and subsequent tax reforms were mainly motivated by the goal of raising tax revenue (Bergman and Hansen, 2019). However, the first tax change that we study, the January 2012 tax increase from 1.08 DKK (0.14 €) to 1.58 DKK (0.21 €) per liter on soft drinks==== with more than 0.5 g of added sugar per 100 ml, had a public health focus, seeking to improve the dietary health of Danes. The public health focus was underlined by the fact that the tax on soft drinks with less than 0.5 g of added sugar per 100 ml remained unchanged. This tax increase was part of the 2010 Tax Reform that sought to reduce taxes on income, while simultaneously increasing taxes on consumption goods that have detrimental effects on public health or the environment. Besides soft drinks, taxes on sweets, chocolate, ice cream, and tobacco were increased (The Danish Ministry of Taxation, 2009). Moreover, in October 2011 the well-known “fat tax” took effect (Jensen and Smed, 2013), only to be repealed on January 1, 2013, motivated by a change in political priorities of the governing parties (Vallgårda et al., 2015). Subsequently, taxes on soft drinks with more than 0.5 g of added sugar per 100 ml were decreased to 0.82 DKK (0.11 €) in July 2013, while taxes on soft drinks with less than 0.5 g of added sugar per liter were reduced to 0.3 DKK (0.04 €) per liter. Taxes on both types of soft drinks were completely removed in January 2014 (see Table 1). The repeal of the taxes was motivated by the twin goals of, one, securing jobs in the retail sector in the Danish-German border region and, two, making up for tax revenue losses due to cross-border trade and illegal soft drink sales. Bordertrade has always been an issue in Denmark and the amount of cross-border shopping is followed closely in yearly reports by the Ministry of Taxation. In 2013 when the tax was repealed, the amount of softdrinks purchased abroad was estimated to 23 percent of total softdrink purchases (The Danish Ministry of Taxation, 2014).====In this paper, we investigate and compare the effects of tax increases and cuts on pass through to prices and on purchases using this variation in the Danish soft drink taxes. We use a regression discontinuity (RD) approach to assess the pass-through of the tax changes and a within-household pre-post design to estimate changes in purchases of soft drinks. Moreover, we run the same estimations on beverage types that did not experience tax variation to check for common demand shocks.====Our study contributes to the literature on soft drink taxes in three ways. First, while the pass through rates of increases in SSB taxes have been well documented (see e.g. Cawley et al. (2018); Cawley and Frisvold (2017); Colchero et al. (2015); Etilé et al. (2019); Falbe et al. (2015); Grogger (2017)), there is little evidence on the pass-through rates of tax decreases with Bergman and Hansen (2019) as an exemption. Second, we analyse how a SSB tax repeal affects purchases. While there is an extensive literature on the impact of SSB tax introductions on purchases and consumption (see e.g. Cawley et al. (2019); Colchero et al. (2016); Falbe et al. (2016); Capacci et al. (2019); Seiler et al. (2019)), much less is known about the effect of tax decreases and repeals. Third, most of the evaluation studies on the effect of soft drink taxes consider the effect of small tax changes, whereas in this paper we consider the effect of large changes in tax levels both for the hike and the subsequent cuts.",Do prices and purchases respond similarly to soft drink tax increases and cuts?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301947,21 February 2020,2020,Research Article,76.0

This study uses longitudinal data spanning the periods before, during and after the Irish crisis of 2007, to test the impact of economic expansion and contraction on mothers physical and mental health and health behaviours. Three waves of data from the Irish Lifeways Cohort Study for the period 2001–2011, and local area employment rates from the Irish Census, are used to capture the impact of a period of increased unemployment on health before, during and after the Irish recession, independent of individual employment status. The results from fixed effect linear probability models demonstrate that an additional unit of local area unemployment increases the probability of reporting poor self-rated health by 1–1.8 percentage points and of reporting poor mental well-being by 1.4 and 2.7 percentage points depending on the instrument used. There are decreases in the probability of consuming cigarettes by 3.3 percentage points, self-describing as a regular smoker by 2.9 percentage points and obesity by 0.9 percentage points. The probability of engaging in at least 20 minutes of strenuous or moderate exercise per week declines by 7.8 and 8.7 percentage points respectively, while the probability of engaging in at least 20 minutes of mild exercise rises by 10 percentage points. These results are largely consistent with the US literature, which is predominantly based on working men, thus demonstrating the universal impact of economic vulnerability on health.","Evidence on the relationship between periods of unemployment and health is far from clear, with much of the original literature reporting a negative relationship (Economou et al., 2008), and more contemporary research emerging from the recent economic crisis reporting the opposite (Ásgeirsdóttir et al., 2014). This paper explores this relationship by utilising longitudinal data spanning the periods before, during, and after the onset of the Great Recession in Ireland. In the mid-1990s, the Irish economy emerged from a prolonged period of high unemployment, tax levels, and formidable public debt. There followed a period of rapid growth and protracted expansion, with unemployment falling from ∼20 per cent in the early nineties to 4.5 per cent in 2006. Ireland was described as experiencing “essentially full employment for the first time in modern history” (Honohan, 2009, p. 2). Nonetheless, following two decades of expansion, Ireland’s economy collapsed more severely than almost all other countries during the global credit crisis of 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the unemployment rate almost tripled to 13 per cent and the average growth rate plummeted to −3.1 percent, while annual inflation became negative (Barrett and McGuinness, 2012).====The scale of the Irish recession was described by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland as among the worst in the EU (Honohan, 2009). Following a rescue package from the IMF, ECB and the EU, the economy recorded tentative growth and recovery from 2011 onwards, with positive average growth, a switch from negative to positive inflation and decreases in the unemployment rate (Barrett and McGuinness, 2012). While this unemployment shock had obvious economic consequences, given the size and significance of the shock, it may also have had consequences for the health of the nation. Thus, Ireland provides a unique setting in which to examine the health effects of a period of significant and pervasive employment declines. Indeed, Currie et al. (2015) describe the paucity of European studies investigating this relationship.====While there is a well-documented association between unemployment and health, this paper makes several contributions to the literature. Using panel data from the Irish Lifeways Cohort Study, a familial birth cohort comprising three generations of the same family sampled before, during and after the onset of the recession, allows us to test the impact of considerable unemployment variability on health using comparable pre- and post-recessionary data. Although the impact of unemployment on health is often restricted to those who experience direct changes in their employment status, such as working men (Dave and Kelly, 2012), the literature on community-level effects and psychological distress suggests that both the employed and non-employed can experience negative health shocks as a result of employment declines (Berkman and Kawachi, 2000; Gabel et al., 2009; Ruhm, 2000, 2003). This motivates our focus on mothers, a group with traditionally variable employment histories. By using local area unemployment, we investigate the impact of unemployment on health regardless of actual labour force participation (Currie et al., 2015; Gabel et al., 2009; Ruhm, 2003).====As unemployment rose during the financial crisis, the government was compelled to cut social protection payments to all families with children, with direct income consequences for mothers for whom these universal social transfers make up a proportion of their financial resources. These income effects were not insignificant, with estimates indicating that by 2013 such policies had reduced private consumption by more than 7 per cent nationally O’Farrell (2013).==== However, even if mothers do not experience a reduction in personal income, increases in local unemployment may lead to economic insecurity, resulting in changes in health behaviours through an anticipated income effect, which may alter the marginal costs and benefits of health behaviours (Berkman and Kawachi, 2000; Grossman, 2000). Economic insecurity may also influence the opportunity cost of time by changing expected returns to the labour market, and this may thus have implications for investment in time-intensive health behaviours such as physical activity, healthy diet and cigarette cessation (Lunn and Layte, 2009b; Ruhm, 2000, 2005).====Clark, 2003; 2011 notes the key influences of social norms and comparative psychological perceptions and expectations in determining individual health and well-being. Evidence suggests that there are significant effects on physical and mental health of austere macroeconomic policies, increases in community antisocial behaviour and declines in social cohesion and neighbourhood quality (Antonakakis and Collins, 2014, 2015; Nixon et al., 2015; Reeves et al., 2012). Therefore, it is possible that exposure to changes in labour market conditions, outside of personal experiences, may impact health through multiple mechanisms.====Using fixed effects regressions controlling for individual-specific effects which may be correlated with both the likelihood of poor health and of living in an area with high unemployment, we find that increases in local unemployment are associated with significant increases in the probability of mothers reporting poor mental well-being and poor self-assessed health, yet a reduction in the probability of obesity, smoking and regular cigarette consumption. The probability of undertaking mild exercise increases, but the probability of strenuous or moderate exercise falls. There are no significant effects on alcohol consumption.

However, our results depend crucially on our choices regarding two features. First, our results differ across two common measures of critical periods, which are used to define shocks relative to the timing of one's ","Rural populations often rely heavily on rainfall for their incomes while lacking adequate opportunities to minimize the risk resulting from variable rainfall. In particular, Brazil's highly unequal land distribution means that many landless individuals and small farmers remain particularly vulnerable, depending on rainfall for both their own production and for labor earnings in the agricultural sector. In this context, rainfall variations can reduce agricultural earnings and increase the risk of disease, both of which can negatively impact health and welfare in the short-run. Without insurance, the vagaries of the rainfall and the consequences of regular floods and droughts are a recurring theme in Brazilian life and the culture of rural areas. In his famous discussion of the semiarid area of Northeastern Brazil, Euclides da Cunha (1944) writes that: “At the height of the droughts they are, positively, a desert, but, when the droughts are not prolonged to a point where they occasion a painful exodus, man may be seen struggling like the trees, with the aid of those reserve forces which he has stored up in the days of plenty” (p. 40). In short, this paper studies the long-term impact of building up or depleting these reserve forces early in life.====There is growing evidence that these short-run shocks also have long-run consequences, especially for those that experience significant shocks in utero or early in life (Almond and Currie, 2011). However, there is little consensus about which periods are critical and which groups are most susceptible to negative shocks (Currie and Vogl, 2013). For example, in utero exposure to a flu pandemic negatively impacted a range of adult health and socioeconomic outcomes in the United States (Almond, 2006) and Brazil (Nelson, 2010). Studying the impact of war on individuals, Akresh et al. (2012) also find that in utero exposure is the most important critical period. In contrast, Maccini and Yang (2009) find that rainfall during and after the season of birth matters for women (but not men) while both Glewwe and King (2001) and Alderman et al. (2006) find that the second year is a critical period. Shah and Steinberg (2017) find that more early-life rainfall improves childhood educational outcomes, with the most important critical periods including ages 0–2 while ages 3–4 matter but to a lesser degree. Thus, while many individual studies find evidence that specific critical periods matter (most commonly in utero, the first year, or the second year), the collective findings fail to reach a consensus about which periods are critical for which groups and in which contexts.====In this paper, we evaluate the impact of exogenous early-life rainfall shocks on adult health and socioeconomic outcomes in rural Brazil. We evaluate rainfall variations during several potential critical periods around the year of birth and evaluate how these events impact individuals later in life. Our analysis uses men and women that were born between 1940 and 1979 in rural areas in both the Southeast and Northeast of Brazil. The Northeast in particular contains some of Brazil's deepest and most persistent poverty, which is caused, in part, by variable rainfall, unequal asset ownership, and inadequate infrastructure. While the Southeast experiences higher rainfall levels, its historical rainfall data also exhibits considerable variability. As a result, it provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of early-life shocks on very vulnerable populations. In order to evaluate these questions, we utilize the 1996–1997 Brazilian Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) alongside detailed monthly rainfall data. The LSMS provides information on adult health and socioeconomic status, which we match to early-life rainfall data using the location and timing of individual births. As an exogenous shock in areas with few ways to mitigate the consequences, rainfall provides a plausible measure of variation in early-life welfare.====We present several key results. First, we find that early-life rainfall variations during certain critical periods impact adult welfare. We find that a one standard deviation increase in rainfall in utero decreases monthly income per capita by 6.8 to 10.4 percent. After birth, greater rainfall positively affects several adult health outcomes, with a one standard deviation increase in rainfall during one's third year of life increasing adult BMI by 0.156 kilograms per meter squared. Greater rainfall during the second year of life similarly increases BMI and reduces the probability of reporting poor health by 0.8 percentage points. Thus, we find that potential critical periods range from the in utero period to the second and third year of life, in contrast with many other papers that find evidence of only one critical period. Collectively, these results indicate that early-life rainfall variations impact adult outcomes in economically meaningful ways.====Our second main result, however, is that these findings depend on two important decisions about how early-life conditions are measured. First, our results differ across two common definitions of critical periods, which determine the timing of shocks relative to the timing of one's birth. One approach (method one) defines the birth year as the month of birth as well as the previous 11 months, thus capturing the period just before conception and in utero, and evaluates additional 12-month periods around the birth year (a measure used, for example, by Thai and Falaris, 2014; Rocha and Soares, 2015; Aguilar and Vicarelli, 2018). Another approach (method two) defines the birth year as the season an individual is born in and the following season (Maccini and Yang, 2009).==== As discussed below, these measures do not align consistently and the choice of measure matters in our data, given that our findings are not all robust across both of these measures. Second, the way rainfall variations are measured also matters, with results differing between a measure of rainfall deviations (which is monotonically increasing in rainfall) and a binary measure of extreme weather (equal to one if rainfall is more than one standard deviation away from the historical mean in a given region). Among women, extreme weather before birth negatively impacts adult health, lowering BMI by 0.38 to 0.45 kg per meter squared and the probability of reporting good or very good health by 4 percentage points. Among men, extreme weather both before and after birth positively impacts a range of adult outcomes. We find evidence that mortality selection among males may partially explain these positive effects.====Papers evaluating rainfall variations employ a range of measures and the relationship between rainfall and the local economy will differ across various contexts. In the rainfall literature, some papers use deviations from historical means (Maccini and Yang, 2009; Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013), which is more appropriate when the impact of rainfall is monotonic. Other papers use dummy measures capturing extreme rainfall events (Jensen, 2000, Miguel, 2005, Shah and Steinberg, 2017, Adhvaryu et al., 2019), which might include positive and/or negative rainfall shocks depending on the impact of these events in a particular context. Others use a combination of approaches (Rocha and Soares, 2015). We find that the relationship between early-life rainfall and long-run health may even differ within the same sample, with results among men and women being more similar overall when using rainfall deviations but considerably different when using extreme weather indicators. Overall, our conclusions depend on the choice of how to measure both critical periods and early-life rainfall. To highlight one example, Maccini and Yang (2009) find that greater rainfall during and after birth positively impacts women but not men, but our results differ in several important ways. When we use their definition of critical periods and rainfall variation (method two in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4), we find that greater rainfall during the birth year negatively impacts adult incomes for both women and men (with the result being more robust for men) and that greater rainfall during the third year increases BMI for both men and women. However, these results then change whether we use either a different measure of critical periods (method one in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) or extreme weather shocks (method two in Table 5, Table 6). While evaluating multiple definitions of critical periods and measures of rainfall variation complicates our analysis, we find it to be important both in our data and as a way to help explain the range of empirical evidence in different studies.====These findings have important policy implications, relating to both Brazil in particular and development policy generally. Growing empirical evidence shows that effective policies early in life can either reduce the impact of negative shocks or significantly improve adult outcomes (see, for example, Hoyne et al., 2016). Given that many households are vulnerable to these temporary shocks that have significant long-run costs, there is a need for policies that better protect households from risk. In particular, these programs are likely to prove to be very cost effective, since they potentially provide both short- and long-run benefits. In Brazil, programs might include increased access to insurance, irrigation, and cash transfers to households.",The impact of early-life shocks on adult welfare in Brazil: Questions of measurement and timing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301807,8 February 2020,2020,Research Article,79.0

We explore whether the economic collapse in 2008 and subsequent economic crisis affected the probability of ischemic heart disease (IHD) events, independent of regular cyclical effects that can be attributed to typical economic conditions. Moreover, we conduct a mediation analysis to study the potential mechanisms through which the relationship between the economic collapse and cardiovascular health travels. We estimate linear probability models using administrative data on IHD events, earnings and balance-sheet status, as well as unemployment for all Icelanders aged 16 and older in 2000–2014.====We find that the sharp change in economic conditions in 2008 increased the probability of cardiovascular events in both males and females in the long term. In absolute terms, these effects were small in magnitude but often statistically significant, amounting to approximately 13–16 extra cases of IHD events in each of the two years following the collapse for males and 3–5 addition cases for females. Moreover, they contrast with the finding that general business-cycle fluctuations operated in the opposite direction. Several potential mediators were correlated with the probability of IHD events, but their inclusion had little impact on the estimated effects of the economic crisis. A statistically significant business-cycle effect is found for both genders indicating that in general, harder economic times are beneficial for heart health. Thus, the general business cycle and the economic collapse in 2008 and subsequent crisis can be thought of as separate phenomena with differing effects on IHD.","Following booming economic times in the early 2000s, Iceland experienced an economic collapse that was unique in terms of speed, scope, and severity, and can almost be pinpointed to a single date, October 6th 2008, when Iceland’s Prime Minister announced the risk of national bankruptcy (The Prime Minister’s Office, 2008). The impact of the collapse was widely felt: many people’s savings vanished with the crash of the Icelandic stock market; monthly unemployment rates tripled to reach their highest rates in recent history and remained high compared to the pre-crisis long-term rate of around 2.5–3 % (Statistics Iceland, n.d.); real wages dropped by 13 % from the beginning of 2008 to spring of 2010 (Iceland, n.d.); and the average Icelandic homeowner experienced an approximately 27 % decline in real home equity between 2007 and 2010 (Statistics Iceland, n.d.). Even those not directly experiencing a dramatic change in their own lives felt the shock through media and personal relationships. The crisis following the collapse was relatively short lived and the Icelandic economy experienced substantial recovery beginning in 2011, with decreasing unemployment (Iceland, n.d.); growing GDP (Statistics Iceland, n.d.); stabilizing of prices with relatively low inflation (Iceland, n.d.); climbing housing prices, and increased equity (Iceland, n.d.). Dramatic changes, from boom-to-bust and subsequent recovery therefore took place within a short period of time.====Economic fluctuations are not all the same, and their characteristics can differ markedly. Conditions can, for example, be characterized by debt crises, financial crises, collapse of the real economy, currency crises, and many more peculiarities with the potential to affect peoples’ lives very differently. The collapse in Iceland can be characterized as a particularly severe shock. Whether the health effects of such a shock can be fully attributed to general business-cycle effects is not well understood. This study examines whether the Icelandic economic collapse affected cardiovascular health, independent of regular cyclical effects that can be attributed to more typical economic fluctuations. Using register-based individual data on earnings, unemployment, and cardiovascular diseases for the Icelandic population we exploit this unique occurrence to examine the relationship between the economic collapse and cardiovascular health, specifically focusing on ischemic heart disease (IHD), also known as coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2014).====Although dating further back, the literature on business cycles and health received renewed impetus when Ruhm (2000) found that mortality increases in good economic times. Other studies followed, using different data, methods, and health outcomes – most with results consistent with those of Ruhm’s (Ariizumi and Schirle, 2012; Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006; Tapia Granados, 2005; Tapia Granados and Ionides, 2017; van den Berg et al., 2017), but others with conflicting findings of a counter-cyclical relationship or no relationship (Economou et al., 2008; Gerdtham and Johannesson, 2005; Stuckler et al., 2009; Svensson, 2007, 2010). There is evidence that the pro-cyclicality of mortality has fallen in recent years, at least in the United States (Ruhm, 2015), and limited recent analysis raises the possibility that economic crises have effects that differ in relative size or direction from those of smaller shocks (Ruhm, 2016). The reason for such disparities is not clear, but context appears to matter, and a fuller picture is slowly emerging, with each additional study showing results from different types of cycles, outcomes, and institutional or social settings.====In recent years the literature has moved towards more detailed analyses exploring the possible pathways of estimated effects. Those include changes in personal income, health behaviors, and individual labor-market status (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2016a, 2016b; Birgisdottir et al., 2017; Di Pietro, 2018; Jonsdottir and Asgeirsdottir, 2014; Miller et al., 2009; Olafsdottir and Asgeirsdottir, 2015; Olafsdottir et al., 2014; Ruhm, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2015). Miller et al. (2009) found that the added deaths related to a drop in the unemployment rate are concentrated among age groups that are mostly out of the labor force, indicating that work-related stress or substitution between work and health production are not primarily to blame, but with some evidence suggesting that reductions in air pollution could result in better health (Heutel and Ruhm, 2016). Ruhm (2000) showed that changes in personal income play a negligible part in in the relationship between business cycles and health, but he has also pointed to risky behaviors (such as smoking and drinking) as potential pathways (Ruhm, 2003, 2004, 2015). Conversely, increased income could have protective effects by raising the consumption of health care and other health-improving activities, especially in countries where a substantial portion of health services are privately funded (Gerdtham and Ruhm, 2006).====The Icelandic economic collapse has provided researchers with useful identifying variation of the effects of the collapse given the sharp contrast in economic performance before versus after October 2008. The health outcomes previously explored include determinants of cardiovascular diseases (Asgeirsdottir et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2016a, 2016b; Birgisdottir et al. (2017); (Eiriksdottir et al., 2015); Hauksdottir et al. (2013); Jonsdottir and Asgeirsdottir (2014); McClure et al. (2012); Olafsdottir and Asgeirsdottir (2015); Olafsdottir et al. (2014). Using survey data from 2007 and 2009, Asgeirsdottir et al. (2014b) find a short-term increased risk of male hypertension following the economic collapse and with an added wave of the same data for 2012, Birgisdottir et al. (2017) also show a longer-run rise in hypertension among females, and Eiriksdottir et al. (2015) find an increased risk of gestational hypertension after the economic collapse. Data from the emergency departments in Iceland’s capital area indicate a considerable increase in cardiac emergency department attendance during the first week of the economic collapse, particularly among females and for IHD diagnoses (Gudjonsdottir et al., 2012). This negative effect on heart health is not in accordance with results from other business cycles over the years in Iceland, that have generally shown null-effects (Birgisdottir and Asgeirsdottir, 2017) or negative effects during times of increased economic activity (Olafsdottir et al., 2016). As our analysis includes both general business-cycle fluctuations as well as the sharp collapse associated with the Great Recession, we aim to separate the two and estimate their relationship to cardiovascular health. Specifically, we assess whether the effect of the economic collapse of 2008 was in keeping with the general business-cycle effect. This is accomplished by using more comprehensive and detailed data than in previous studies (that only use aggregate data or small samples). Here, we use individual-level data from registers on the full adult population in Iceland.====Stress is known to raise the risk of IHD, as do various environmental factors (American Heart Association, 2015; Arbab-Zadeh et al., 2012). The medical literature distinguishes between long-term risk factors such as age, hypertension, and cholesterol levels (Muller et al., 1994) versus acute stressors such as natural disasters that come without warning (Dimsdale, 2008). Recent literature has shown that acute stressors, such as earthquakes, can have long-term effects on cardiovascular-disease risk factors (Li et al., 2017). Cardiac events increase in the immediate aftermath of such acute life stressors (Aoki et al., 2012; Bergovec et al., 1992; Leor et al., 1996), and research shows that transitory factors affect cardiovascular mortality. For example, increases have been found in the morning hours (Cohen et al., 1997) and on Mondays (Arntz et al., 2001). Long-term stressors associated with increased risk of coronary events include chronic work stress (Matthews and Gump, 2002) and marital stress (Orth-Gomér et al., 2000). Furthermore, changes in the rate of coronary events might emerge as immediate responses to circumstances (Ruhm, 2007) or as a delayed consequences of accumulated effects (American Heart Association, 2015; Olafsdottir et al., 2016). Stress, particularly among females, rose as a result of Iceland’s economic crash (Hauksdottir et al., 2013). Therefore, a study on the effects of a stressful event such as an economic collapse on coronary diseases is of high relevance.====This study contributes to the related literature by examining the short-term effects of the Icelandic economic collapse on the probability of IHD events (in the first months following the unofficial date of economic collapse, on October 6==== 2008), as well as the longer-term impacts over the subsequent two years. Our extensive microdata also permits a preliminary exploration of the pathways through which both the initial shock effect as well as the longer-term effects of the crisis operate. Specifically, we examine mechanisms related to changes in individual personal income, equity, and own unemployment in a mediation analysis. Furthermore, we consider the role of general business cycles, as measured by aggregate unemployment, one important external factor related to a deteriorating economy.",The effect of the economic collapse in Iceland on the probability of cardiovascular events,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X18303150,8 February 2020,2020,Research Article,80.0

Global interventions with a focus on diet-related fiscal strategies were assessed for the outcomes of ==== revenue, gross domestic product, government revenue and employment. We excluded non-English papers.====Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were on sugar sweetened beverage taxation and one also included an energy-dense food tax. Nine were modelling studies and two used interrupted time series analysis based on empirical evidence. One study found potential employment increases because of taxation; two found no significant job losses and eight found reduced employment. Taxes reduced sales volume and revenue within the sugar/beverage industry. Government revenue generation was positive in all studies. One study considered redistribution of consumer and government spending to other goods and services;====We found no robust evidence for negative macroeconomic impacts of diet-related fiscal policies, likely a reflection of the limited methodology used in the analyses. This review suggests that there is a need for more high-quality research into the macroeconomic impacts of diet related fiscal measures and similar to tobacco taxation, government should consider directing revenue generated towards complementary measures to generate employment and/or provide livelihood training for those affected.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended fiscal policies as part of comprehensive intervention packages to improve diets and reduce non-communicable disease (NCD) risk (World Health Organization, 2011; Sassi et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2015a). There is now a significant body of evidence indicating that unhealthy food and beverage taxes and subsidies on healthy food and beverages can improve diets and health and are likely to generate substantial revenue (World Health Organization, 2015a, b; Thow et al., 2014, 2018; Cobiac et al., 2017; Lal et al., 2017; Manyema et al., 2016).====Existing evidence for the impacts of fiscal measures has primarily focused on health, consumption, consumer behavior and revenue generation. However, potential economic impacts are also critical considerations for fiscal policy. Manufacturing, production and employment are likely to be affected by fiscal policies on food as well as employment in other parts of the food supply chain (Stiglitz, 2000). Industry actors have consistently resisted proposals for taxation with claims that this will negatively affect employment and other economic indicators. In Australia, for example, the Australian Beverage Council has successfully lobbied against a proposed tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), bolstered by the claim, ‘Mexico’s 2014 taxes on unhealthy drinks and energy dense foods have been a failure: jobs have been lost, sales have rebounded, and the poorest families are experiencing the burden of the tax’ (Anand et al., 2015). Also, in response to job loss concerns, the Government of South Africa halved their proposed 20 % SSB tax to just 11 % (Hofman and Tugendhaft, 2017). Similar concerns were raised by the tobacco industry in the face of public health intervention – including taxes – to reduce tobacco consumption. However, provision of Articles 17 and 18 within the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) specifically addressed alternative and sustainable livelihoods for farmers still producing significant tobacco as well as protecting the health of those involved in tobacco, particularly in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries. These provisions were critical to overcoming concerns about loss of employment (World Health Organization, 2005; Kulik et al., 2017).====Evidence of wider economic implications of diet-related fiscal policy to improve dietary behaviors and health outcomes will thus provide a rounded perspective and understanding to help policy makers make informed decisions in a cross-sectoral policy context (Box 1).",The macroeconomic impacts of diet-related fiscal policy for NCD prevention: A systematic review,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X1930228X,1 February 2020,2020,Research Article,81.0

The analysis focuses on men of middle and upper classes aged 19–50 years old. Despite the city’s growing economic importance and modernization, average heights remained stagnant around 163 cm. It also stands out that whereas average height differences between professional and ethnic groups remained significant and persistent throughout time, average heights remained stagnant in all groups. Three main reasons are provided to explain these inequalities between groups and stagnation across groups: scarce improvements in agricultural production, increasing wage inequalities and the persistence of a bad disease environment.","The Bolivian economy is frequently identified as a perfect example of a “reversal of fortune”: it was among the most dynamic spaces in the Americas during colonial times and today is among the poorer economies in the region (Acemoglu et al., 2002). No official data is available for Bolivian GDP prior to 1950. Using their own estimation of the Bolivian GDP and GDP per capita for the period 1846–1950, Herranz-Loncán and Peres-Cajías (2016) suggested that the divergence of the Bolivian economy (both to developed and neighboring countries) is driven by the low dynamism of the economy during the 19th century and two devastating crises that took place during the second half of the 20th century. Furthermore, they claim that divergence stopped, and even some convergence to developed and neighboring economies was observed, during the first half of the 20th century.====Nevertheless, there is still only scarce quantitative evidence of how the economy’s stagnation and subsequent recovery at the onset of the 20th century affected Bolivians’ welfare.==== This paper aims to fill this gap by providing an estimation of the average height of adult men (19–50 years) registered in the city of La Paz and who were born in the decades from the 1880s to the 1920s. Given the relevance of mining exports in Bolivia, it could be argued that economic growth was based on an enclave that hardly could affect overall urban wellbeing. However, one should be cautious before assuming that any export-led growth process in Latin America ended in mere enclaves (Kuntz-Ficker, 2017). Furthermore, our paper focuses on La Paz, which was the most dynamic region in Bolivia since the early 20th century, reflected by significant population and urbanization growth rates and a timid but continuous diversification of the economy towards manufactures and services. So, if a hypothetical trickle-down effect may have happened in Bolivia in the period we study, the place to look for evidence is La Paz.====In addition, the paper contributes to the growing literature on historical anthropometrics in Latin America since Bolivia is among the under-researched countries in the region (Martínez-Carrión and Salvatore, 2019). Our work is based on almost 5000 records on National Identification Cards and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first direct estimation of men’s average height in urban Bolivia during this period.==== As suggested by the political and social implications involved in the ID Law of 1927, the statistical analysis we carried out confirms that our sample is not representative of the entire population but rather of the middle and upper classes of La Paz.====Our work stresses the stagnation of men’s average height around 163 cm during the period under scrutiny. Despite differences in sample sizes, our results do not differ much to those found for rural Aymara and Quechua men in 1903 (average height around 160 cm) (Laure, 1991). Likewise, even taking into account differences in the ecological context, our results are in line with those found for the Tsimanes men in the Amazonian region of Bolivia in the first half of the 20==== century (average height around 163 cm) (Godoy et al., 2006). Our findings are also coincident with the story of average height stagnation highlighted in these works.====In this regard, our results resemble other Latin American cases where an export boom and the expansion of the economy did not necessarily translate into better biological standards of living (Baten and Carson, 2010; Llorca-Jaña et al., 2018a,b; López-Alonso, 2012; Salvatore, 2007; Twrdek and Manzel, 2010). The lack of a universal positive correlation between economic growth and average heights is a puzzle (Baten, 2017; Bodenhorn et al., 2017; Deaton, 2007; Komlos, 2019). One of the suggested explanations for this puzzle is inequality. In the case of the first Latin American export era (1850–1929), it could be argued that the extra revenue generated by higher exports and higher growth was captured by the elites and there was no trickle-down effect which would have generated improvements in the living standards of the population.====In this context, whereas our sample focuses in the upper and middle classes of La Paz, we are still able to show enduring differences between social groups. On average, indigenous men were 3 cm shorter than non-indigenous, illiteracy was associated with a 3 cm penalty in height and manual unskilled workers were approximately 2 cm and 4 cm shorter than non-manual unskilled and non-manual skilled workers, respectively. We show that these differences can be partially explained by the pressures on the less advantaged groups stemming from higher food prices and growing wage inequalities.====However, our results also show that average heights remained stagnant across the different occupational categories. Indeed, a particular lesson from our work stresses that the lack of a positive correlation between economic growth and biological wellbeing can take place even in the case of the elites. This result is similar to the Colombian sample of passport holders that spans from 1870 to 1919 (Meisel and Vega, 2007). Therefore, other factors beyond inequality could be also at play in the explanation of the “puzzle” in Latin America during the First Globalization. In this paper, we highlight the lack of improvements in general health conditions. Specifically, we stress the bad quality of water (despite the increase of municipal investment in water pipelines) and the lack of a suitable sewage system and proper public hospital until the early 1920s.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of economic development in Bolivia and La Paz from Independence to the Great Depression. Section 3 presents our database and clarifies whom we are measuring. Section 4 presents and discusses our main results. Section 5 explores some explanations for the poor improvement of Bolivian biological standards of living.

We merge destruction indexes calculated at the district level with 13 yearly rounds of household level surveys from Jamaica. The empirical strategy exploits variation arising from the storms’ timing and intensity across different cohorts within the same district. The findings rule out medium-to-large overall adverse effects of tropical storms. However, when expectant mothers living in coastal-rural areas are affected by the cumulative destruction of two hurricanes, their children experience negative impacts on both weight-for-age and weight-for-height measures.","This study analyses the effects of weather shocks suffered during pregnancy on humans' early physical development. The study provides evidence related to the “fetal origins” hypothesis pioneered by Barker (1990) focusing on the effects that tropical storms and hurricanes experienced during gestation periods have on anthropometric measurements taken during the first five years of life.==== We exploit anthropometric measures taken from children born between 1988 and 2012 in Jamaica along with geocoded information of estimated destruction due to storms occurred during their pregnancy periods.====The case of tropical storms has been studied by Baez and Santos (2007) who using household data from Nicaragua and a difference in differences method exploiting exogenous variation of the hurricane Mitch’s trajectory find that it reduced health care access in the medium term. Currie and Rossin-Slater (2013) exploited exogenous variation from hurricanes’ trajectory and used birth certificate data from Texas to show negative effects of these events on newborn outcomes like delivery problems and time in incubator after birth. Imberman et al. (2012) using data at the individual level from education institutions, exploited variation from hurricanes Sandy and Katrina and found negative effects on school performance in the aftermath of the event. Sotomayor (2013) exploited variation from hurricanes and tropical storms between 1920 and 1940 finding negative effects on health conditions like high blood pressure associated with the exposure to the events during in-womb. Unlike these studies, however, we exploit variation from the intensity of the exposure to tropical storms estimated as the continuous cumulative destruction received during certain period of gestation. This is a different approach from previous research since our measure is a proxy of the storms’ destruction rather than the dichotomic occurrence or not of the event.====Our study, therefore, is related to the literature on the effects of adverse weather-related events suffered during gestation on future children’s development. Agüero (2014) and Hu and Li (2019) investigate the effects of high temperatures on birth weight and adult height using cross sectional household data from Mexico and China, respectively. Molina and Saldarriaga (2017) exploit rich data from the Andean region to show how deviations from historical average temperatures suffered during pregnancy affect birth weight. Hoddinott and Kinsey (2001) using household panel data from Zimbabwe and exploiting variation from larger-than-average droughts found that children exposed to these events experienced negative growth outcomes on height. Our paper is also related to the literature studying the socioeconomic effects of natural disasters. Caruso and Miller (2015) using data from Peru’s census, exploited variation from an earthquake and found that adults who were affected in womb attained less years of school than those that did not. Frakenberg et al. (2017) used detailed survey data collected before and after the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia to study the response of children’s height to the shock. These studies show that shocks that affected the availability and quality of early life (i.e. during pregnancy) nutrition could have long lasting consequences.====Beyond weather-related shocks and natural disasters, our study is also related to several papers that explore the effects of other sources of negative shocks experienced during pregnancy and early infancy on children’s outcomes. For example, Case et al. (2002); Gutierrez (2013), and Kiernan and Huerta (2008) found negative effects on adult income and wealth resulting from experiencing economic crises during infancy. Lewis et al. (2014) study the effects of exposure to alcohol in-utero using panel data from UK. Almond and Mazumder (2011) study the effects of nutritional deprivation during pregnancy due to Ramadan on birthweight using microdata from Michigan in the USA and census data from Uganda and Iraq; while Schultz-Nielsen et al. (2016) studied how nutritional deficiency during gestation caused negative effects on adult’s labor outcomes. Camacho (2008) study the effects of acts of terrorism as source of mothers' stress on birth weight; and Lavy et al. (2016) focus on stressful migration episodes. More generally, our study is related to the literature exploring the medium- and long-term consequences of negative shocks suffered during early stages of development. Almond and Currie (2011) and Almond et al. (2018), provide comprehensive reviews of these studies. The common factor in the literature is that negative shocks suffered during early stages of development generate negative impacts over the short, medium, and long term.====We contribute to the international literature investigating the effects of tropical storms and hurricanes suffered during pregnancy on early childhood physical development. Our strategy allows an exploration of the possibility of nonlinear effects with respect to the intensity of the destruction suffered during pregnancy. To do so, we use all storms that affected the North Atlantic region between 1987 and 2012. These include hurricanes between categories 1 and 2 and tropical storms (which are weaker than hurricanes but are accompanied by more precipitation). To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring these issues within the Caribbean, a region that is exposed to recurrent weather shocks.====Our findings rule out medium-to-large overall effects of tropical storms experienced during pregnancy. We can rule out absolute effects beyond 9 percentage points in the likelihood of low birthweight; or beyond 0.37 standard deviations in weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age. However, expectant mothers living in coastal-rural areas exposed to an average of at least two hurricanes during their third trimester of gestation experience a reduction in children’s weight-for-age (weight-for-height) measured within the first five years of life equivalent to 2.55 (1.65) standard deviations. Recent evidence provided by Sánchez (2017) shows that physical development at age 1 significantly affects cognitive and non-cognitive skills measured at age 8. Therefore, the negative effects found on physical development within the first 5 years of life could also transmit to longer-term outcomes through reduced acquisition of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Consequently, our findings reinforce the importance of having appropriate safety nets in place to assist expectant mothers who experience negative shocks as those studied in this paper.====The remainder of the document is organized as follows. Section 1.1 provides a brief background on the Jamaican economy. Section 1.2 describes the data, while Section 1.3 shows the construction of the destruction measures based on the storms’ physical characteristics. The empirical strategy is developed in Section 1.4.

We analyse data on students between 10 and 17 years of age from the international survey ‘Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children’ and find robust evidence that a twelve-month increase in relative age (i.e. the hypothetical maximum age gap between classmates) i) increases life satisfaction by 0.168 standard deviations, ii) increases self-rated general health by 0.108 standard deviations, iii) decreases ==== complaints by 0.072 standard deviations, and iv) decreases chances of being overweight by 2.4 %. These effects are comparable in size to the effects of students’ household socio-economic status. Finally, gaps in life satisfaction are the only ones to reduce with the increase in absolute age, but only in countries where the first tracking of students occurs at 14 years of age or later.","Differences in age between students in the same academic class, also known as ‘relative age,’ affect human capital accumulation in youth. Such differences are due to the distance between a student’s birthdate and the cutoff date (i.e. the date that determines the ‘academic year’ or the grade==== to which the student is assigned). Relative age is mirrored by maturity differences and, in turn, by gaps in students’ performance and (non)cognitive abilities (Fumarco and Schultze, 2019; Fumarco and Baert, 2019; Peña, 2017; Schwandt and Wuppermann, 2016; Patalay et al., 2015; Ponzo and Scoppa, 2014; Black et al., 2011; Mühlenweg et al., 2012; Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2010; Sprietsma, 2010; Mühlenweg, 2010; Elder and Lubotsky, 2009; Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2008; Bedard and Dhuey, 2006; Lien et al., 2005; Allen and Barnsley, 1993). These gaps are also known as ‘relative age effects’ (RAEs), and it is legitimate to expect that, in any class of students, they are reflected by the younger students’ lower well-being.====We investigate this possibility using data on subjective well-being, an individual-founded measurement of well-being (OECD, 2013). Originating from research in psychology, subjective well-being has received considerable attention in economics in recent years (Frey and Stutzer, 2018). Many national and international surveys provide information about subjective well-being, and especially about two of its main components: happiness and life satisfaction (Diener et al., 2009). Scholars often use subjective well-being, ‘happiness’, and ‘life satisfaction’ interchangeably. However, these terms are not equivalent: subjective well-being is a latent, unobservable characteristic that consists of observable phenomena, namely positive affect (e.g. joy, optimism), negative affect (e.g. sadness, anger), and the evaluation of life as a whole, i.e. life satisfaction. The latter is a self-assessment of respondents’ life as a whole, and it is regarded as an overall cognitive appraisal of how well the respondent fares in his or her life. As such, life satisfaction is not susceptible to change because of short term emotional reactions to life events (Bruni and Porta, 2007). This is why life satisfaction is widely used as a measure of subjective well-being. This measure is usually reflected in answers to questions such as ‘All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole these days?’ (van Praag et al., 2003v). Various studies confirmed that subjective measures of well-being provide reliable information about an individual’s well-being. For instance, people’s evaluations of their well-being correlate with objective measures of well-being such as heart rate, blood pressure, frequency of Duchenne smiles, and neurological tests of brain activity (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2004; van Reekum et al., 2007v). Measures of subjective well-being are strongly correlated with other proxies of subjective well-being (Schwarz and Strack, 1999; Wanous and Hudy, 2001; Schimmack et al., 2010) and with judgements about the respondent’s happiness provided by friends, relatives, or clinical experts (Schneider and Schimmack, 2009; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006; Layard, 2005). Moreover, studies from the so-called happiness economics literature uncovered meaningful associations between economic variables and measures of well-being. Rich people are on average more satisfied than poor people (Gardner and Oswald, 2007); unemployed people are on average less satisfied with their life than employed people (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2000). A major concern, in particular among economists, is the difficulty of comparing life satisfaction scores across people. If respondents set the reference for their well-being differently, a condition that respondent A considers sufficient to be satisfied with his/her life may be considered insufficient by respondent B. In other words, what ‘being satisfied’ means differs from person to person, thus making the comparison of life satisfaction across people impossible. We cannot exclude that the reference level of well-being differs; however, evidence from psychological (Lucas and Donnellan, 2012) and economic (Ng, 1997; Gruber and Mullainathan, 2006; Kristoffersen, 2017) studies is encouraging as it suggests that, if this difference exists, it has negligible consequences. In sum, the reliability and wide availability of measures of subjective well-being allowed scholars to address important issues in various domains: in economics, to analyse the impact of issues such as poverty, inequality, unemployment, and inflation on people’s well-being (Di Tella and Mac-Culloch, 2008; Alesina et al., 2004; Diener et al., 2009; Clark et al., 2012, 2013); in sociology and politics to study ageing, gender issues, marital and employment status, as well as the quality of political institutions (Frey and Stutzer, 2000; Powdthavee, 2007; Stutzer and Frey, 2012). In the present work, we use life satisfaction as a measure of subjective well-being to check whether relative age affects students’ well-being. Although scholars developed measures of well-being for adults, a number of studies documented their reliability when applied to adolescents as well (Blanchflower and Oswald, 2000; Funk et al., 2006; Haranin et al., 2007; Jovanović, 2016).====Some studies investigated RAEs on outcomes correlated with well-being (i.e. on students’ self-esteem, see Thompson et al., 2004), and on the suicide rate of young adults (Thompson et al., 1999; and Matsubayashi and Ueda, 2015). In particular, Bahrs and Schumann (2019) studied whether younger students in a class have a higher probability of developing smoking habits and poor health and whether these effects persist into adulthood. By applying a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to German Socio-Economic Panel data, the authors document that increasing the school starting age by one year reduces the long-term risk of smoking by 1.3 percentage points, and it increases the likelihood of reporting to have good health by 1.6 percentage points. While Bahrs and Schumann (2019) focus on absolute age at school entry, we contribute by focusing on relative age effects and their impact on life satisfaction. That is, we measure how relative age impacts a direct self-assessment of how well the students fare with their lives, using a large international sample of European students. We also add to the evidence by Ando et al. (2019) who found that being younger than classmates (their measure of relative birth date) correlates negatively to well-being in a sample of 10-year-old pupils in Japan.==== Those authors argue that the lower academic performance and being bullied mediate the negative relationship between relative age and well-being. Ando et al. (2019) measure well-being using the WHO-5 well-being index, which evaluates a respondent’s well-being using five questions to which pupils reply using a six-point Likert scale.==== Compared to that study, our test adds evidence from a large sample of European countries. This provides a larger set of institutional frameworks, using life satisfaction as a single measure of subjective well-being. Moreover, we test the robustness of our findings using three additional health-related variables as detailed below.====Our study contributes to the literatures on relative age and on subjective well-being by investigating whether there is direct evidence of RAEs on subjective well-being. The relationship between RAEs and adolescents’ life satisfaction is relevant for three reasons. The first is that the well-being of young people is, in general, regarded as a desirable goal per se. The second reason is that adolescents’ well-being is an important predictor of well-being and emotional health in adulthood. For instance, using more than 17,000 observations from British Cohort Study panel data, Clark et al. (2018) show that the emotional health of children predicts adults’ life satisfaction, and it correlates negatively with criminal records in adulthood. Admittedly, this evidence is limited as it is based on a single country and the R-squared of the model is low, as it is often the case with regressions of life satisfaction. However, Frijters et al. (2014) estimate that 30–45 % of adult life satisfaction is fixed. This suggests that 55–70 % is transitory in nature and that a wide range of observed childhood circumstances captures about 15 % of the fixed component. Frijters et al. ground their evidence on two sources of data. The first is the National Child Development Study, which includes about 17,400 children born in 1958 who were followed up until 2008-09. The second is the British Cohort Study, which provides information on about 17,000 children from 1970 until 2008/09. Jointly, Clark and colleagues and Frijters et al. provide compelling evidence suggesting that well-being during childhood predicts life satisfaction at later stages in life. The third reason our study is relevant is that well-being has economically relevant consequences. For instance, a number of studies using experimental data, survey data, employer-employee matched data, and official statistics showed that satisfied people are more productive, less absent from the workplace, and more cooperative than others (Harter et al., 2003; Böckerman and Ilmakunnas, 2012; Oswald et al., 2015; DiMaria et al., 2019).====We conduct our study on a representative sample of European adolescents, from the international survey, ‘Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC).’ The HBSC survey has a unique feature compared to more popular students’ surveys (e.g. PISA, TIMMS, PIRLS): it allows the researcher to separate absolute age from relative age. This is possible because the respondents’ target age is between 10.5 and 16.5. This feature underlies the main difference between our study and those that studied effects of age at school entry (ASEs; Ponzo and Scoppa, 2014; Mühlenweg et al., 2012; Sprietsma, 2010; Bedard and Dhuey, 2006).====The present study contributes to the previous literature also on a methodological ground, as we are the first to separate the aforementioned relative age effect from the absolute age effect, and to investigate their interaction. All else equal, one would expect the strength of relative age to decrease as absolute age increases. That would mean that gaps in performance and (non)cognitive abilities caused by relative age would decrease with absolute age, and then reflect into smaller well-being gaps. However, there is some evidence that these gaps continue and shape success in adulthood (Gladwell, 2008). Indeed, some studies have investigated the effect of relative age, while controlling for absolute age, on social network (Fumarco and Baert, 2019), on grit and other character skills (Peña and Duckworth, 2018), and on performance (Ponzo and Scoppa, 2014). Other studies have found relative age effects on performance in different age groups (Nam, 2014; Allen and Barnsley, 1993).====To the best of our knowledge, no study in the RAEs literature has investigated how relative age interacts with absolute age yet, while controlling for absolute age. This is a methodologically relevant contribution as it improves the estimation of coefficients and the interpretation of the results. Estimated effects of relative age, while controlling for absolute age, represent average effects across different absolute ages. Estimates of relative age by age group, without controlling for absolute age, are not equivalent to estimates obtained while using a full interaction between relative and absolute age. This is the case as estimates of relative age by age group still incorporate the effect of absolute age, and are similar to analyses where relative age (as well as all the other control variables) is (are) interacted with absolute age. The importance of separating relative age from absolute age, within any age group, is discussed in greater detail in Section 2.4.1. Moreover, controlling for absolute age is importance because of its endogeneity. In Section 2.5. we illustrate how, following Peña and Duckworth (2018) and Fumarco and Baert (2019), we deal with this problem. Differently from Fumarco and Baert (2019), we report these results in full and explain in greater detail the procedure.====The analysis of the interaction between relative and absolute age adds to previous literature also because past studies investigated how subjective well-being varies with absolute age in adolescence (e.g. Currie et al., 2012), while no study has investigated the role of relative age. We thus contribute by filling this gap in the subjective well-being literature as well.====The present work contributes to the scientific literature in a third way. Our analyses of the interaction between relative and absolute age consider the age when the first tracking of students occurs. In adolescence, students are streamed into different educational paths (e.g. academic versus vocational path) based on their perceived skills. At any given absolute age, the probability of being streamed toward a low educational path is higher for relatively young students (Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014; Mühlenweg and Puhani, 2010; Allen and Barnsley, 1993). The threat of being streamed downwards is arguably stressful (Fumarco and Schultze, 2019). Moreover, in countries with early tracking, tracking may occur multiple times before the end of high school. Therefore, we should expect that the effect of this interaction is smaller (or even negative) in countries where tracking occurs at early ages. Ours is the first paper to test this hypothesis.====Many mechanisms can explain the positive RAEs on life-satisfaction: academic performance and self-efficacy (i.e. students’ belief in their own academic competence) are certainly two of them,==== as discussed in Lippman et al. (2014) and Zi et al. (2015). All else constant, the well-being of (relatively older) students who do better in school should be higher than the one of (relatively younger) students who do worse.====However, while academic performance is largely explored in the RAEs literature, this paper focuses on an important correlate of subjective well-being that has received less attention in the literature: health. Studies from various disciplines mostly focus on mental health, the (over)diagnosis of disorders, and disabilities (Schwandt and Wuppermann, 2016; Patalay et al., 2015; Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2010; Lien et al., 2005). These studies find that relatively old students are less often misdiagnosed with such conditions; this is because they have higher relative age, they are on average more attentive, less hyperactive and less impulsive than their younger peers. Other aspects of health have not been investigated so far. Thus, our fourth contribution to the literature consists in investigating three previously unexplored health outcomes: self-rated general health, frequency of psychosomatic complaints (as a proxy for mental health), and overweight status (as a proxy for physical health). It is important to remark that the study of this third health outcome is among the first ones to provide an objective and visible measure of RAEs on physical health.====Existing literature stresses the importance of a few mechanisms through which relative age affects our three measures of health. Relative age studies find that relatively old students are less frequently misdiagnosed with mental health conditions (Schwandt and Wuppermann, 2016; Patalay et al., 2015; Dhuey and Lipscomb, 2010; Lien et al., 2005). Thus, it is legitimate to expect that, all else equal, their self-rated general health is more frequently higher than relatively younger peers. In addition, psychosomatic complaints (e.g. nervousness, irritability, headaches) are often caused by stressful situations, such as feeling high schoolwork pressure, being bullied, and having weaker social networks (Currie et al., 2012); due to their lower school preparedness and physical development, these stressful situations affect more frequently relatively younger students (Fumarco and Baert, 2019; Fumarco and Schultze, 2019; Ando et al., 2019; Mühlenweg, 2010). Thus, it is legitimate to expect that, all else equal, relatively old students suffer less frequently from psychosomatic complaints than relatively younger peers. Moreover, literature from various disciplines finds that relatively old students engage more frequently in sport activities than their younger peers (Fumarco and Schultze, 2019; Cobley et al., 2009). This result is due to the fact that, at any absolute age, competition is tougher for relatively younger peers, who are less physically developed and tend to avoid at higher rates such activities (Cobley et al., 2009; Helsen et al., 1998). Obviously, more frequent participation to sports activities helps fighting overweight problems (Graf et al., 2004).====This investigation of health outcomes is relevant to this paper for three reasons. First, it serves as a robustness check, because of the positive correlation between adolescents’ health and subjective well-being (Currie et al., 2008). Second, measures of adolescents’ health are important predictors of their subjective well-being and objective health in adulthood (Layard et al., 2014; Currie et al., 2008). Third, adolescents’ health—including weight problems—affects labour market outcomes (Lundborg et al., 2014).====A number of studies suggest the possible sign of the impact of relative age on health outcomes. Because of its positive correlation with subjective well-being, we expect a positive association between life satisfaction (our measure of subjective well-being) and relative age. Moreover, self-esteem has a strong positive correlation with life satisfaction (Moksnes and Espnes, 2013)—it could be considered its proxy—and it is positively affected by relative age (Thompson et al., 2004). Furthermore, life satisfaction is negatively correlated with youth suicide, which reflects deep life dissatisfaction and is negatively affected by relative age (Thompson et al., 1999; Matsubayashi and Ueda, 2015).==== Similarly, we expect relative age to have positive effects on health outcomes. Few reasons can directly explain why the youngest students in a class might suffer from poorer health; in particular, relatively young students have a more sedentary and lonely lifestyle, and they face higher schoolwork strain (Fumarco and Schultze, 2019; Fumarco and Baert, 2019; Cobley et al., 2009).====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and descriptive statistics. Section 3 discusses the analyses of life satisfaction and health outcomes. Section 4 summaries the results, illustrates policy implications, and provides directions for future research.","Younger, dissatisfied, and unhealthy – Relative age in adolescence",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302503,30 January 2020,2020,Research Article,84.0

Cognitive and personality factors significantly explain this premium for both genders, but job attributes are also important for males.","Some of the starkest physical development changes to the body occur during adolescence, immediately before entering the labor market. Same-sex, same-age adolescents vary widely in their stage of physical maturity. At least half of this variation in pubertal timing is due to genetic influences (Beunen et al., 2000; Morris et al., 2011). Secular trends in puberty, such that boys and girls are entering puberty earlier than decades ago (Euling et al., 2008; Herman-Giddens et al., 2012), suggest environmental factors (e.g. nutrition, toxins, stress) matter as well. Early maturers are treated differently by adults or peers (Zebrowitz et al., 1991a; Reynolds and Juvonen, 2011) and, as will be explained, they gain experiences or opportunities that potentially affect labor market outcomes. While economists have begun studying adolescent growth spurt as a ==== aspect of physical maturation (Persico et al., 2004; Case and Paxson, 2008), the value of ==== physical maturity timing to early labor market participants remains an open question.====There are several reasons the timing of physical maturity during adolescence should affect labor market outcomes in young adulthood. First, it affects human capital investment. Economic studies have linked adolescents who experienced early puberty to better cognitive functioning (Case and Paxson, 2008; Koerselman and Pekkarinen, 2018). However, other studies find that when girls experience puberty at young ages it creates problematic journeys through high school (Cavanagh et al., 2007), raises adult BMI (Gill et al., 2018), or might not have any educational effects (Koivusilta and Rimpelä, 2004). Second, more mature-looking persons tend to make high-skilled occupational choices (Case et al., 2009) and gain high-status jobs requiring shrewdness and leadership skills (Zebrowitz et al., 1991b). Third, early maturity is associated with risky behaviors and psychological costs especially during adolescence (Copeland et al., 2010), which may negatively impact adult labor market outcomes (Fletcher, 2013a; Carter, 2019). Finally, early-maturing adolescents may develop personality traits (i.e. emotionally stable, conscientious, and sociable) that effectively prepares them for adulthood (Weichold et al., 2003), and are advantageous to labor market success (Almlund et al., 2011; Fletcher, 2013b). Thus, it is an empirical issue to establish which labor market responses dominate.====A growing literature explores the relationship between the timing of physical maturity (or aspects thereof) and adult labor market outcomes. Studies such as Persico et al. (2004) and Case and Paxson (2008) estimate the impact of teen growth spurt after age 16 on wages in their 30′s, using data from Britain’s National Child Development Survey (NCDS) and the United States’ NLSY79. While both studies agree that taller teens (conditional on adult height) earn more, they differ on the mechanisms that might explain this “height premium”. Persico et al. (2004) show early teen growth spurt relates to social experiences that form human capital, whereas Case and Paxson (2008) argue it is simply a marker of cognitive ability. In a follow-up paper, using the British Household Panel Survey, Case et al. (2009) add that sorting by adult height into high-paying occupations matters too. Using other specific components of pubertal timing, namely self-reported ages of menarche and first ejaculation for 14-year-olds, Koivusilta and Rimpelä (2006) find no association with employment at ages 28–34 in Finland. Similarly, Graber et al. (2004), also using a self-reported maturity measure, find no effects on employment and income for 24-year-olds in western Oregon, US. Unlike prior studies, Koerselman and Pekkarinen (2018) objectively measure each sex’s pubertal timing based on multiple components (i.e. facial, pubic, and underarm hair and breast development), as assessed by a medical examiner from the NCDS. They report late-maturing boys at age 16 have lower earnings at ages 33 and 42 than those who matured earlier, but find a near-zero effect for girls.====We use data from the United States’ National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to improve and contribute to the literature in several ways. First, we analyze a broader sample of adolescents 5–6 years before following them early into the labor market at ages 19–25. Second, we use interviewers’ assessments of how physically mature adolescents look for their age and gender.==== This measure is comprehensive. Aside from height, body hair, and breast development, interviewers can observe several other external physical features (such as boys’ muscle mass or voice depth, and girls’ hips, thighs or buttocks sizes). Prior studies use a few specific physical changes to assess maturity timing. Our measure is also free of self-reporting bias and avoids compliance bias due to its non-invasiveness (as opposed to professional assessments in non-clinical settings). Finally, we extend the common control set in the literature to better isolate the exogenous influence of physical maturity timing. Studies examining the labor market effects of maturity timing do not adequately control for confounding factors. Besides genetics or biological influences, one’s timing can be affected by a number of health, family background, and other environmental factors (Kipke, 1999; Lee and Styne, 2013), which may also relate to wages and employment.==== In this regard, Add Health provides more detailed indicators of health and family background than used in other studies. Moreover, given Add Health’s school-based survey design, we can adjust for age-by-school fixed effects. These effects capture important difficult-to-measure heterogeneity at the community and school levels, such as teacher quality, resources, and peers that vary by age, as well as persistent age-varying neighborhood stressors.====We find evidence that adolescents who were early maturers during high school earn more in adulthood when they work than their counterparts do. Moreover, this “maturity premium” exceeds the gains from height and physical attractiveness (potentially reflected in early maturers more appealing body shape). Specifically, early-maturing males earn roughly 8% more than those who are late/on-time while early-maturing females earn nearly 6% more, after adjusting for height and physical attractiveness. We also find that only early-maturing females have a greater probability of employment, but this relationship largely reflects physical attractiveness. We further explore why employers reward the timing of physical maturity beyond height and physical attractiveness. We consider as potential channels cognitive factors (e.g. high school GPA, degree attainment), adult personality (e.g. impulsivity, self-esteem), and job attributes (e.g. tenure, occupational choice). Our findings reveal cognitive and personality factors explain much of the maturity premium for females. While such factors also account for a significant fraction of the premium for males, we find their job attributes are important as well.====Next, we describe the data and define key measures. We then relate physical maturity timing to employment and wages in section 3, and deduce the mechanism through which it operates in section 4. Finally, section 5 concludes with some implications of our findings.",The value of early physical maturity to young adult labor market outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302473,24 January 2020,2020,Research Article,85.0

There are, however, contradictory findings on the extent to which subsequent ‘catch-up’ growth among stunted children is associated with similar ‘catch-up’ cognitive functioning. In this paper we show that the apparent contradictions in the literature may be a result of differences in the definition of catch up used in the different studies. We explore two variations in definition: the age from which catch-up growth is measured, and the extent of growth required to be classified as ‘caught up’. Using cohort data from South Africa with repeated measures of length in early childhood, we first show that varying the starting age from which catch up is measured from 1y to 2y greatly affects the conclusions drawn with respect to cognitive outcomes, as the prevalence of stunting tends to peak around 2y. Second, we show how the results differ when we vary what counts as catch up, and here we explore five definitions ranging from most lenient to strictest. The strictest definition requires children to have caught up sufficiently that their height-for-age falls within the ‘normal’ range at follow-up; very few children catch up to this extent. For all definitions of catch-up, except the strictest, we find that children who are stunted at 2 years of age who subsequently experience catch-up growth, on average, do worse on cognitive tests than children who were never stunted, and almost as poorly as children who remain stunted (with the coefficient ranging from -1.584; p < 0.01 to -1.753; p < 0.01). This suggests the timing of investments in early childhood is key, with intervention in the first two years to prevent deprivation that affects both linear growth and cognitive function.","The determinants of linear growth and brain development in early life overlap, including the importance of adequate nutrition (Leroy and Frongillo, 2019). It is unsurprising, then, that growth retardation in the first two years of life, indicated by stunting, has consistently been found to be associated with poorer cognitive function and schooling outcomes among children==== (Dewey and Begum, 2011).====The association between linear growth and brain development later in life is less clear. Linear growth has been found to be associated with cognitive function beyond two years, and again this is likely to occur because of the shared determinants, including adequate nutrition (Cheung and Ashorn, 2010; Gandhi et al., 2011; Georgiadis et al., 2016; Sudfeld et al., 2015; Teivaanmäki et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2011). However, there are contradictory findings on the extent to which ‘catch-up’ growth following growth retardation is associated with a catch up in cognitive performance. It is not clear that the determinants of recovery are shared. As a result, it is not known whether (nutrition and other) interventions following stunting, which improve growth, can be expected to reverse or even reduce deficits in cognitive function associated with early deprivation. In this paper, we show that apparent contradictions in the literature about the relationships between catch-up growth and cognitive recovery may result from differences in definition relating to the timing of catch-up growth and to what constitutes catch-up growth.====The first 1000 days from conception to the second birthday have been identified as an important period in children’s development Daelmans et al., 2017; Phillips and Shonkoff, 2000; Shonkoff et al., 2012). Neurological development in this period is rapid and energy intensive. Faced with a nutritional deficit, the body prioritises brain development at the expense of linear growth (Shonkoff et al., 2012). However, severe and prolonged deficits, expressed by stunting, have been associated with delayed or defective neurological development and lower levels of cognitive function (Dewey and Begum, 2011). The high prevalence of stunting in many developing countries implies that millions of children are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential (Daelmans et al., 2017; Richter et al., 2017).====It is not clear if catch-up growth after the first 1000 days reflects a recovery in linear growth and catch up in neurological development, given that brain plasticity reduces with age Nelson, 1999; Phillips and Shonkoff, 2000). Studies examining the association between catch-up growth report contradictory findings. On the one hand, a number of studies in the public health literature have reported that children who ‘recover’ from stunting in early childhood (i.e. were stunted at baseline but not at follow-up) do no differently on later cognitive assessments from those who were never stunted (Crookston et al., 2010, 2013. The authors conclude that there should be a renewed focus on nutrition and other interventions to promote catch-up growth beyond the 1000 day window Crookston et al., 2010; Pe, 2013). On the other hand, some studies have reported that children who recover from stunting have poorer cognitive function than children who were never stunted, and almost as poor function as the children who remained stunted (Casale and Desmond, 2015; Mendez and Adair, 1999). These results are taken to suggest that resources should be directed to prevent the early deprivations that have adverse impacts on linear growth and brain development. In the economics literature, the importance of the foundational phase has received increasing recognition. The finding that catch-up growth is not correlated with improved cognitive function is consistent with Cunha and Heckman’s assertion that inputs into the production of skills at different stages of childhood may not be perfectly substitutable (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).====Two issues regarding the relationship between linear growth and cognitive growth are sometimes conflated. The first issue relates to the substantial evidence that growth throughout early childhood is associated with cognitive development, given shared determinants, including adequate nutrition (Casale et al., 2014; Cheung and Ashorn, 2010; Crookston et al., 2011; Gandhi et al., 2011; Georgiadis et al., 2016; Sudfeld et al., 2015, Teivaanmäki2017; Yang et al., 2011). The second issue relates to whether, at the population level, children who are stunted early in life can catch up in both height and cognitive function, and if the former is evidence of the latter. The distinction is important. Evidence of the importance of a supportive environment, including adequate nutrition, for cognitive development throughout early childhood provides an argument for support for children who are already stunted, as it may prevent children from falling further behind. However, such evidence does not suggest that interventions that improve growth after stunting has occurred will ==== the negative consequences of early deprivation for cognitive development. This requires a determination on the second issue. It is with this second issue that this paper is concerned. If facilitating catch-up growth, including through nutrition interventions, is not likely to mitigate the cognitive consequences of early deprivation, policy makers must focus on preventing deprivation in the first place, and on mitigation interventions which go beyond nutrition and seek to improve cognitive outcomes directly (by promoting appropriate stimulation).====We seek to contribute to the evidence on whether catch-up growth among stunted children should be interpreted as an indication that the negative cognitive effects of early deprivation are being mitigated. An important contribution of our work is to shed light on why there are mixed findings in the existing literature regarding the link between catch-up growth and cognitive function, and the extent to which they may be explained by differences in the definitions used in that literature. We show that the definition of catch up significantly affects the conclusions. We tackle two aspects of the definition: timing and degree. Timing refers to the period over which catch-up growth is measured, specifically the start age at which it is measured. Degree refers to how much, relative to the reference population, the child needs to grow to be considered ‘caught up’.====The age of the first linear growth measurement matters because of the U-shaped pattern of child growth in many developing countries (Stein et al., 2010). The population average height–for-age z score, or HAZ, (i.e. height relative to the healthy reference population) falls off soon after birth and continues to falter until 2 years, where it remains at this low point, or increases (Victora et al., 2010). This means that the prevalence of stunting (HAZ <-2) in the population peaks around 2 years of age. If the first measurement of length to assess stunting levels is taken before this peak, it will affect the proportion of children classified as stunted and the proportion subsequently classified as caught-up. A number of studies, notably those using data from Young Lives, diagnose stunting at 6–18 months, while others use data on children’s height at 2 years of age. We have repeated measures of height-for-age in early childhood in our data. As a result, we can show for the same sample of children how the conclusions regarding the relationship between catch-up growth and cognitive function differ markedly when different ages are used as the starting point. In doing so, we can replicate and help explain, the apparent contradiction in the literature.====The degree of catch-up growth, i.e. how much the child has to grow to be considered ‘caught up’, similarly changes the results. A recent debate has emerged in the human biology/public health literatures on the appropriate definition of catch-up growth (Hirvonen, 2014). Recovery from stunting is commonly used, but this practice has been questioned (Leroy et al., 2015). The debate centres around whether one should use so-called ‘relative’ measures, i.e. HAZ-based measures, such as recovery from stunting or an increase in HAZ, or ‘absolute’ measures. In the latter, the height-for-age deficit (HAD) decreases such that the child catches up to the reference population in terms of centimetres (Desmond and Casale, 2017). This also pertains to the question of how large a change (in either HAZ or HAD) is necessary for it to be considered meaningful catch-up growth. Prior work has shown that the number of children defined as having experienced catch-up growth can vary dramatically depending on definition used (Zhang et al., 2016). In a study from South Africa, the percentage of children experiencing catch-up growth varied from 19 to 93 % depending on the definition (Desmond and Casale, 2017). To our knowledge, the implications of using different definitions for the association between catch-up growth and cognitive development, has not been investigated in the literature.====In this paper, we use birth cohort data from South Africa to explore these issues. The Birth to Twenty Plus (Bt20+) data are collected from an urban cohort born in 1990 (Richter et al., 2007). The data are particularly useful for our purposes for a number of reasons. First, because there was regular follow-up in the early years, there are repeated measures of length (0–2 years) and height (2 years plus). This allows us to replicate (approximately), for the same sample, the age ranges used in the existing literature by varying the starting age from which catch-up is defined. Second, a well-validated measure of cognitive function was collected at 5 years of age, which allows us to analyse cognition before children enter the formal schooling system, thereby avoiding the issue of school-level confounding relationships. Much of the existing literature explores the relationship between stunting and educational outcomes or cognitive measures when the child is of school-going age (Cheung and Ashorn, 2010; B. Crookston et al., 2010; Dewey and Begum, 2011; Mendez and Adair, 1999), as there is little data available in developing countries on cognitive function in the very early years. Third, extensive data on the home environment and caregiver involvement in the child’s life are available in Bt20+, allowing us to control for many of the generally ‘unobservable’ factors that are of concern in this literature. This is critical as it is difficult to find suitable instruments for height at one point in time let alone change in height over time (and we have found no good examples in the literature of the latter). Few developing country datasets have all three features.====Our paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review the literature on the relationship between catch-up growth and cognitive development. We highlight apparent contradictory results and we describe literature examining alternative definitions of catch up. In Section 3, we provide a description of our data and proposed methods. Section 4 presents the results in two parts: first, we show how varying the initial age from which catch up is measured produces conflicting results; and second, we examine how the conclusions on catch-up growth and cognitive development vary depending on the definition of catch-up growth used. Section 5 discusses the implications of these results.",Catch-up growth in height and cognitive function: Why definitions matter,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X1930231X,23 January 2020,2020,Research Article,86.0

We drew on universal product code-level store scanner data and used a pre-post intervention-comparison site difference-in-differences (DID) study design to estimate the impact of the Cook County SBT on prices of taxed beverages, across product categories and sizes, as well as on prices of untaxed beverages. The DID model results showed an over-shifting of the tax with a 119% pass-through rate, on average, across all taxed beverages in Cook County compared to its comparison site. This price change represented, on average, a 34% increase in prices of taxed beverages. For untaxed beverages, prices were estimated to increase slightly by 0.04 cents per oz driven mainly by an increase in milk prices (0.12 cents per oz). We also found some heterogeneity in tax pass-through for the taxed beverages by sweetened beverage product category and size with pass-through being higher, on average, for individual-size (126%) compared to family-size (117%) beverages and higher for energy drinks (145%) compared to other sweetened beverages. Based on the baseline prices of different categories and sizes of beverages, the effective percentage increase in beverage prices resulting from the Cook County SBT ranged from a 52% increase for family-size soda to a 10% increase for family-size energy drinks.","Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is directly linked to obesity and independently associated with adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental caries, and osteoporosis (Malik et al., 2013, 2010; Vartanian et al., 2007). Given health risks associated with SSB consumption and the fact that SSBs are a significant source of added sugar in American diets (Reedy and Krebs-Smith, 2010) (with half of U.S. adults and 60% of U.S. youths consuming at least one SSB on a given day in 2013-14) (Bleich et al., 2018), SSB taxes are increasingly proposed and implemented as a policy instrument to improve health outcomes. In line with national and international organizations’ recommendations (Institute of Medicine, 2012; Muth et al., 2019; World Health Organization, 2016), more than 40 countries and eight local U.S. jurisdictions have implemented some type of tax (University of North Carolina, 2019) specifically targeting sweetened beverages. In the U.S. specifically, sweetened beverage taxes have varied on multiple dimensions including: (i) the range of products targeted from SSBs, to both SSBs and artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), (ii) the point of levy from the distributor to the consumer at the point-of-sale, and (iii) the magnitude (from one to two cents per ounce (oz)) (Center for Science in the Public Interest, 2018).====If the goal of a tax policy is to reduce consumption of a particular good, then the tax must be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. The tax incidence, that is, the extent to which consumers versus producers/sellers bear the burden of the tax, depends on the price elasticity (responsiveness) of demand and supply (Fullerton and Metcalf, 2002). In the presence of price-insensitive demand, the entire amount of the tax is passed on to consumers and leads to no effect on quantity demanded and sold. Although such a setting may be ideal for raising tax revenue, it is not conducive for reducing consumption. In settings with elastic demand and supply, excise taxes generally lead to some (but not 100%) pass-through (i.e., a sharing of the tax burden by consumer and producers) and lower consumption – where the level of pass-through is decreasing in consumer price elasticity. The extent to which consumers are able to avoid taxes, say through cross-border shopping, can impact the elasticity of demand measure and, in turn, tax pass-through. Indeed, with respect to sweetened beverage taxes in local U.S. jurisdictions, there is, in fact, evidence of cross-border shopping (Roberto et al., 2019) and evidence showing that tax pass-through is relatively lower in stores located closer to the border of the taxing jurisdiction (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017). Additionally, in settings with less than perfectly competitive markets taxes may actually lead to over-shifting (Bonnet and Réquillart, 2013; Fullerton and Metcalf, 2002). Thus, given that the extent of the pass-through depends on both consumer demand and market structure, empirical studies on tax incidence for health behaviors such as tobacco have found both under-shifting (i.e., less than 100% pass-through) and over-shifting (i.e., more than 100% pass-through) (Hanson and Sullivan, 2009; Harding et al., 2012).====An increasing number of studies have assessed pass-through of taxes on sweetened beverage prices. Internationally, evidence has revealed partial to full pass-through of the soda tax in France (Berardi et al., 2016); over-shifting when SSB taxes increased and under-shifting when SSB taxes decreased in Denmark (Bergman and Hansen, 2016); partial to full pass-through of the SSB tax in Mexico including over-shifting for soda (Colchero et al., 2015; Grogger, 2017); and, under-shifting of the SSB taxes in Barbados (Alvarado et al., 2017) and Chile (Caro et al., 2018; Nakamura et al., 2018). In the U.S., a study of the Berkeley, CA, penny per oz SSB tax found that 47% of the tax was passed on to consumers, with slightly higher pass-through for soda (69%), and some differences by store type, when compared to untaxed sites at three-months post tax (Falbe et al., 2015). Similarly, another study found that taxed SSB prices rose, on average, by just under half the amount of the tax after three months (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017). At one year post-tax in Berkeley, another study found varying pass-through across store types with: full pass-through in supermarkets, over-shifting in small chain supermarkets and chain gas stations, under-shifting in pharmacies, and no change in prices in independent small stores (Silver et al., 2017). Heterogeneity by store type also was found in a recent study based on store scanner data on the effect of the 1.5 cent per oz tax on both SSBs and ASBs in Philadelphia, PA, with full tax pass-through in pharmacies (104%) but partial pass-through in supermarkets (43%) and mass merchandise stores (58%) (Roberto et al., 2019) which differs to the pattern found by store type for Berkeley (Falbe et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2017). Using data from airport terminal stores located both within and outside Philadelphia’s city limits, another study found almost complete (93%) tax pass-through (Cawley et al., 2018c). Similarly, another study based on store audits in Philadelphia compared to untaxed neighboring communities found full tax pass-through (Cawley et al., 2018b). A study also using store audits but examining the sweetened beverage tax that covered both SSBs and ASBs in Cook County, IL, found over-shifting of the tax (114%) onto beverage prices relative to prices in comparison area stores (Leider et al., 2018). Examining the largest SSB tax to date in the U.S. of two cents per oz in Boulder, CO, a recent study found that, compared to two untaxed communities, the estimated tax pass-through was 79% at one-month post tax and remained roughly constant through three-months post tax (Cawley et al., 2018a). Finally, a recent evaluation report of Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax, based on store audit data, found that at six-months post-tax the 1.75 cent per oz tax was almost (97%) fully passed through to consumers (Public Health-Seattle and King County, 2019).====The aforementioned studies provide valuable insight on the empirical relationship between taxes on sweetened beverages and consumer prices (i.e., tax pass-through) across store types, product categories, and geographies, in a setting where taxes were levied mostly at the distributor level. This study is the first to use universal product code (UPC)-level store scanner data to assess tax pass-through of a point-of-sale tax, which was implemented on both SSBs and ASBs: the Cook County, IL, Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT). Specifically, in November 2016, the Cook County, IL, Board of Commissioners passed the Cook County SBT Ordinance, which would impose a tax at the rate of one cent per oz on the retail sale of SSBs and ASBs to be applied at the point of sale (i.e., at the cash register) (Cook County Illinois, 2016). The SBT was in effect from August 2, 2017 to November 30, 2017; it was repealed by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, effective December 1, 2017 (Cook County Illinois, 2017).====Different from other recently implemented sweetened beverage taxes in the U.S., the Cook County tax was levied on consumers rather than distributors and thereby applied at the point of sale. Although there were provisions in the Cook County Ordinance to require retail outlets to indicate the tax amount at the shelf, this was not enforced during the four months that the tax was in place. This is of interest since there is some evidence to suggest that pass-through may differ based on whether taxes are imposed at the point-of-purchase (i.e., retail level) compared to those levied on the distributor (and, incorporated into the shelf price) based on saliency and compliance across the different types of taxes (Kopczuk et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2019). Additionally, besides Philadelphia’s tax, the Cook County, IL, SBT is the only sweetened beverage tax applied to both ASBs and SSBs, minimizing consumers’ ability to substitute away from taxed beverages to their untaxed counterparts.====This study uses UPC-level price data over the entire four-month period in which the 2017 SBT was in place. We implement a pre-post intervention-comparison site difference-in-differences (DID) study design to estimate the impact of the Cook County, IL, SBT on prices of taxed beverages, across product categories and sizes, as well as on prices of untaxed beverages.","The impact of the Cook County, IL, Sweetened Beverage Tax on beverage prices",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302230,21 January 2020,2020,Research Article,87.0

Obesity rates among adults in the U.S. increased over the last decade from 33.7% in 2007–08 to 39.6% in 2015-16; and, rates of obesity among children aged 2–19 years increased slightly over the same period from 16.8%–18.5%, although that change was not statistically significant (Hales et al., 2018). Parallel to the rise in obesity, the percent of U.S. national medical expenditures for treating obesity-related illness in adults rose from 6.13% in 2001 to 7.91% in 2015, an increase of 29% (Biener et al., 2018). Although energy intake from sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption fell by 55% among children aged 2–19 years and by 45% among adults (≥20 years) from 2003-04 to 2015-16 (Marriott et al., 2019), half of U.S. adults and 61% of U.S. youth still consumed at least one SSB on a given day in 2013-14 (Bleich et al., 2018). Additionally, SSBs are the largest contributor of added sugar in the American diet and added-sugar intake is above recommended levels (Johnson et al., 2009; Reedy and Krebs-Smith, 2010; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015). An estimated 30.3 million Americans (9.4% of the total population), of which 30.2 million were adults (12.2% of the adult population), had diabetes in 2015 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). SSB consumption is linked to obesity and independently related to adverse health outcomes including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental caries, and osteoporosis (Hirahatake et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2013, 2010; Vartanian et al., 2007).====In line with the public health aim of reducing SSB consumption and related health risks, SSB taxes have been a major policy focus worldwide and have been recommended domestically by the Institute of Medicine (Institute of Medicine, 2012) and internationally by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2016). Indeed, fiscal policy recommendations have led to the implementation of sweetened beverage taxes in more than 40 countries and, since 2015, in seven cities and one county (though subsequently repealed) in the U.S. (University of North Carolina, 2019). It is recognized that such policies should be evaluated not only for their effectiveness but also to assess potential ‘unintended’ consequences.====The evidence base on the impact of SSB taxes is growing worldwide and a number of studies have been published that have evaluated the extent of tax pass-through and impacts on beverage sales, purchases or consumption, and substitution from SSB taxes in countries such as Denmark, France, Mexico, Chile and Barbados (Cawley et al., 2019c). Given that these studies have evaluated national-level taxes, their study designs have generally lacked comparison sites.====This study contributes to the evidence base that is developing for local-level sweetened beverage taxes in the U.S. by evaluating the impact of the Seattle, WA, Sweetened Beverage Tax (SBT) on beverage prices (tax pass-through), the volume sold of taxed SSBs in Seattle and in its 2-mile border area to account for potential offsetting from cross-border shopping, and the volume sold of untaxed beverages in Seattle to assess substitution. On January 1, 2018, the City of Seattle implemented a 1.75-cent per ounce (oz) excise tax on the distribution of sugar-sweetened beverages with at least 40 kilocalories (kcal) per 12 fluid oz (Seattle City Council, 2017).====The extent to which the recent U.S. local-level sweetened beverage taxes have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices has been examined for several jurisdictions (using models with comparison sites) and studies reveal substantial variation by site. In 2015 in Berkeley, CA, where the first SSB excise tax was implemented at a penny per oz, studies consistently found tax pass-through to be only about half complete (Falbe et al., 2015; Cawley and Frisvold, 2017). At one year post-tax in Berkeley, another study found varying pass-through rates with, for example, full pass-through in chain supermarkets but lower pass-through in small independent stores (Silver et al., 2017). A slightly higher tax pass-through rate (61%) was found for the one-cent per oz Oakland, CA, SSB tax (Cawley et al., 2019b) and a higher level of tax pass-through of 79% at three-months post-tax was found for the two-cent per oz SSB tax in Boulder, CO (Cawley et al., 2018a). In Philadelphia, PA, where both SSBs and artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) were taxed, a number of studies found approximately full tax pass-through though differences were found by store type. One study that used data from airport terminal stores located within and outside the city limits found almost complete (93%) tax pass-through (Cawley et al., 2018c). Another study that used store audits in Philadelphia compared to untaxed neighboring communities found full tax pass-through (Cawley et al., 2018b). A recent study that used scanner data found full tax pass-through in pharmacies (104%) but partial pass-through in supermarkets (43%) and mass merchandise stores (58%) (Roberto et al., 2019). A study of the Cook County, IL, one-cent per oz Sweetened Beverage Tax (subsequently repealed), which also taxed both SSBs and ASBs, found over-shifting of the tax (114%) onto beverage prices relative to prices in comparison area stores (Leider et al., 2018). Only one study to date has assessed tax pass-through for Seattle’s SBT and, based on store audit data, it found that at six-months post-tax the 1.75-cent per oz tax was almost fully (97%) passed on to consumers (Public Health-Seattle and King County, 2019).====Evidence on the impact of local U.S. beverage taxes on demand for beverages as measured by either individual-level survey data or by retail-level sales data is much more limited, with particularly few studies assessing potential offsetting impacts of cross-border shopping. The largest body of evidence exists for the penny per oz tax implemented in Berkeley in 2015. One of the first studies to be published focused on low-income areas in Berkeley and found that SSB consumption fell 21% compared to a 4% increase in comparison cities, while relative water consumption increased (63% compared to 19%) (Falbe et al., 2016). Another study found that supermarket volume sold of taxed beverages fell 9.6% in Berkeley compared to an increase of 6.9% in non-Berkeley stores and that sales of untaxed beverages rose 3.5% in Berkeley versus 0.5% in non-Berkeley stores; although, this same study found no significant changes in SSB intake when using individual-level data (Silver et al., 2017). A more recent Berkeley study, based on individual-level data three years post-tax, found that SSB consumption fell by 0.55 times per day and water consumption increased by 0.85 times per day relative to changes in comparison cities (Lee et al., 2019). For the Oakland penny per oz SSB tax, recent evidence based on cross-sectional individual-level store-exit purchase data and longitudinal individual-level survey data on consumption revealed no impact of the tax on consumption of SSBs or added-sugar intake from beverages, although the study may have been under-powered based on the particularly small sample size for the individual-level consumption survey (Cawley et al., 2019b). Regarding the 1.5-cent per oz tax on both SSBs and ASBs implemented in Philadelphia, a study based on repeated cross-sectional random-digit-dial phone surveys found a reduction in the odds of daily regular soda (−40%) and energy drink (−64%) consumption and an increase in daily bottled water consumption (+58%) (Zhong et al., 2018). Using store scanner data, a recent Philadelphia study found a 51% reduction in volume of taxed beverages in the taxing jurisdiction with a net decrease of 38% when accounting for cross-border shopping and no significant increases in sales of untaxed beverages (Roberto et al., 2019). Another recent study, which used cross-sectional data from consumers at stores and longitudinal data on household beverage consumption, found that post-tax the frequency of adults’ soda consumption fell by 10.4 times per month (approximately 30% lower) but there were no changes in other beverages consumed and there were no changes in beverage consumption for children (except for frequent consumers) (Cawley et al., 2019a). This latter paper also examined cross-border shopping patterns and found that although there was no evidence that Philadelphia residents were more likely to travel outside of Philadelphia to shop as a result of the tax, those who already shopped outside of the city increased their purchases of taxed beverages (Cawley et al., 2019a).====In this study, we began by estimating the extent to which the Seattle SBT increased prices faced by consumers, also known as tax pass-through. Next, we assessed the impact of the tax on volume sold of taxed beverages in Seattle and on volume sold in the 2-mile border area of Seattle to understand the extent to which any reduction in volume sold may have been offset by cross-border shopping. Finally, we examined changes in volume sold of untaxed beverages to understand the extent of substitution from taxed to untaxed beverages. We assessed the extent of heterogeneity of the impact of the Seattle SBT on all outcomes by beverage type and size. We drew on universal product code (UPC)-level store scanner data and used a pre-post intervention-comparison site difference-in-differences (DID) study design to estimate the causal impacts of the tax. This is the second study, to our knowledge, to assess tax pass-through of the Seattle SBT and the first to use UPC-level scanner data to examine this outcome. Also, to our knowledge, no other study has been published to date on the impact of the Seattle SBT on sweetened beverage consumption, purchasing, or volume sold. Thus, this study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the Seattle SBT including an assessment of the extent to which tax avoidance in the form of cross-border shopping may offset its impact. Based on our DID models, we find that in the first year following the implementation of the Seattle SBT relative to the changes in the comparison site: 1.03 cents of the tax was passed through to consumers reflecting a tax pass-through rate of 59%; volume sold of taxed beverages in Seattle fell by 22% and this reduction was not dampened by cross-border shopping in its two-mile border area; and, there was moderate substitution to untaxed beverages whose volume sold increased by 4%.",The impact of Seattle’s Sweetened Beverage Tax on beverage prices and volume sold,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19302758,21 January 2020,2020,Research Article,88.0

According to Becker’s “quantity-quality trade-off” theory there is an inverse relationship between the number of children in a family, and spending per child. We test whether this has led to significant differences in the height, weight and ==== of only-children compared with children with siblings in China using 4414 observations derived from four recent waves (2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011) of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We use propensity score matching and instrumental variables to control for the possible endogeneity of the number of siblings. Results show that only-children are significantly heavier (1.88 %–3.86 %), and have higher BMI (2.59 %–3.50 %). Moreover, they are more likely to be obese than children with siblings (2.33 %–3.00 %). Further analysis shows that these differences in health outcomes might be attributable to higher consumption of animal-source food (23.90–27.13 g), a higher frequency of eating western fast food (0.48-0.70 times/3-month) and drinking sweetened soft drinks (0.29-0.36 times/month), a higher share of meals eaten away from home (4.67 %–5.31 %), and more sedentary activity (20.04–34.35 minutes/week) by only children. Our study indicates that the growing share of only children due to China’s family planning policies also contributes to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in China. This policy has been eased in recent years, which might slow the increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity and thus reduce the corresponding health burden for Chinese society as a whole.","In the Chinese culture, as in many others, having many children was traditionally seen as a symbol of prosperity: ‘more children’ was synonymous with ‘more blessings’. This preference was further strengthened by informal policies established by the new government of the People’s Republic of China after 1949, which encouraged large families and fostered rapid population growth in the early 1950s (Feng et al., 2009). Beginning in the mid-1950s, several scholars proposed the concept of family planning, which triggered heated public debate (Qin et al., 2017). In particular, Ma (1957) suggested a birth control policy in his famous public speech “New principle of population” in 1957. However, due to political turmoil in the late 1950s and 1960s, the idea of birth control received less attention, even though contraception was advocated after the mid-1950s and a Family Planning Commission was established in 1964.====Family planning policy regained importance and was gradually implemented in the early 1970s. It was integrated into the fourth five-year “National Economic and Social Development Plan” in 1971 and added to the Chinese Constitution in 1978 (Qian, 2009). In 1979, the central government announced the “One-Child Policy” (OCP), which began to be strictly enforced across the entire country one year later (Banister, 1987). Couples who violated the policy had to pay a “social child-raising fee” that could amount to as much as five times the annual household income (Ebenstein and Avraham, 2010). Some exceptions were made. For example, a document issued by the Central Party Committee in 1984 proposed the “1-son-2-child” rule, which allowed rural couples to have a second child if their first child was a girl (Behrman and Taubman, 1986; Wang et al., 2016). In addition, the OCP was only binding for Han Chinese; members of non-Han ethnic groups were usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas, depending on whether the ethnic group’s population was greater than 10 million (Feng et al., 2009; Liao, 2013). Further exceptions were made if a couple’s first child was not healthy or handicapped. These exceptions notwithstanding, the strict implementation of the OCP for the great majority of Chinese families made the one-child family the dominant family type in China in the 1980s and 1990s.====However, as the OCP’s effects on China’s demographic structure became increasingly apparent, it was progressively loosened. First, in 2002 parents were permitted to have a second child if they were both only children themselves. Then, beginning in 2013, parents were permitted to have a second child if either one of them individually was an only child (Qin et al., 2017). Finally, in early 2016 the OCP was abandoned completely and a “Two-Child Policy” for all came into effect (Wang et al., 2017).====The implementation of strict family planning policies over the past four decades, and in particular the OCP, has made China the country with by far the largest number of one-child families in the world (Min et al., 2017a). The total fertility rate in China declined sharply from more than 5 births per woman in early 1970s to 1.5–1.6 in recent years, which is well below the replacement rate (Wang et al., 2017). Guo et al. (Guo et al., 2014) estimate that in 2005 the total number of only children was about 150 million, and that one-child families accounted for about one-third of all families in China.====Resource allocation within a family is affected by the number of children it has. According to Becker’s “quantity-quality trade-off” (Becker, 1960; Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker and Tomes, 1976; Doepke and Matthias, 2015), the income elasticity of child “quality”, defined as spending per child, is high, while the income elasticity of child quantity is low. As their incomes increase, families will wish to spend more on the quality of their children. However, since this additional spending is incurred for each child, the shadow price of child quantity will also increase and families will choose to have fewer children. The result is an inverse relationship between the quantity of children and spending, including investments in human capital, per child.====Many empirical studies have confirmed a negative relationship between the number of children and human capital accumulation per child in Chinese families. For instance, Rosenzweig and Zhang (Rosenzweig and Zhang, 2009) find that the OCP contributed to a higher probability of school attainment and better school performance in Kuming province. Similarly, Qin et al. (Qin et al., 2017, 2018) find that the educational attainment of individuals born around the initiation of the OCP increased significantly compared with earlier cohorts. The higher human capital of only children in China is confirmed by Liao (Liao, 2013) and Li and Zhang (Liao et al., 2016). Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2017) also find that only children earn higher incomes than children who have siblings. Most studies in developed countries also find a negative association between family size and educational and labor market outcomes (Datar, 2017).====While many studies test the relationship between the number of siblings and child education, only few address the relationship between the number of siblings and nutrition and health outcomes. The quantity-quality trade-off will presumably lead to differences in nutritional status and nutrition-related health outcomes such as overweight and obesity between only children and those with siblings. In low-income countries where many families face budget constraints, larger families have to allocate limited resources among more children. All other things equal, this will have a negative effect on child nutrition, growth and other health outcomes (Aslund and Gronqvist, 2010). Families with fewer children can concentrate their resources on these children, who will benefit from better nutrition as a result.====However, as incomes in China have increased rapidly in recent decades, better nutrition may have given way to over-nutrition as many families have been able to concentrate increasing resources on their only children. Parents (and grandparents) in China tend to give food such as snacks as rewards to children for good behaviour (Mosli et al., 2015), and otherwise overfeed their “little emperors” (Cheng, 2013; Min et al., 2017b). In addition, the OCP has imposed an exogenous constraint on the fertility of higher-income parents who would otherwise have chosen to have more than one child, restricting them to focus their relatively abundant resources on one child.====These considerations lead us to hypothesize that only children in China are more likely to be overweight and obese than children with siblings. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis by comparing health outcomes such as growth indicators, body mass and the risks of overweight and obesity between only children and children with siblings.====The relationship between the number of siblings and health outcomes has been analyzed by several authors. Chen and Escarce (Chen and Escarce, 2014) and Datar (Datar, 2017) study the relationship between the number of siblings and child Body Mass Index (BMI) and obesity in the U.S. using a national sample. Both find that having more siblings tends to reduce BMI and the prevalence of obesity in childhood. Datar (Datar, 2017) attributes this effect to factors such as more consumption of healthy food, fewer purchases of sweetened soft drink at school, fewer hours of television watching, and less eating away from home in families with more children. Similar results are reported for Japan (Ochiai et al., 2012), Denmark (Wang et al., 2007; Haugaard et al., 2013) and Australia (Hesketh et al., 2007). The only empirical study for China is by Min et al. (Min et al., 2017a), who find that only children are roughly four times more likely to be overweight and obese than those with siblings. They attribute this effect to the fact that only children have a higher probability of excessive calorie intake and spend more time in front of television, computer and smartphone screens.====Min et al.’s (Min et al., 2017b) analysis is the first to address the effects of the OCP on nutrition and health outcomes in China, but it does not account for two possibly important factors. First, the number of children in a family may be endogenous, because not only the nutrition and health outcomes of a family’s children but also their number might be affected by unobserved heterogeneity in parental preferences, socioeconomic status and other characteristics. Even in the unique context of China’s OCP, which imposed an exogenous constraint on the number of children that a family could have, some of the exceptions outlined above (e.g. for non-Han ethnic groups, or for rural families whose first child was a daughter) were triggered by factors that might also affect a family’s nutritional choices and health outcomes (Angrist et al., 2010; Liao et al., 2016; Datar, 2017). In our empirical analysis we use a number of econometric techniques including propensity score matching and instrumental variable estimation to address the possible endogeneity of the number of children.====Second, (Min et al., 2017a) do not account for the fact that a child’s health outcomes such as weight and height are influenced not only by post-birth factors such as nutrition and activity, but also by the genetic predisposition inherited from its parents. Previous studies have mainly focused on post-birth factors because datasets that include anthropometric information on both children and their parents are rare. We analyze data that include anthropometric information for all family members, and that therefore allow us to control for genetic predisposition as well as post-birth factors.====In summary, this study contributes to the current literature by investigating, in the unique Chinese setting, the effect of the number of children in a family on their health outcomes. We make four specific contributions. First, we test the quantity-quality trade-off theory in China from the perspective of health outcomes. Second, we employ multiple strategies to deal with the possible endogeneity of the number of children in a family. Third, we control for genetic predisposition as well as the post-birth factors that might affect a child’s health outcomes. Finally, we generate some insights into the causal linkages between number of siblings and children’s health outcomes from the perspective of physical activity and dietary behavior. China has progressively eased its family planning policy, and has been actively encouraging larger families since 2016. Our study provides evidence on the health implications of family planning policy in China, and can thus contribute to ongoing debates on further adjustments to this policy and possible flanking or supporting measures, for example in public health and education policy.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

In Mexico it is common practice to include a ,"Obesity around the world has tripled since 1975 (WHO, 2018). This pattern is not restricted to high-income countries, but is present in low- and middle-income countries as well (WHO, 2015). Mexico is no exception: the overweight and obese population has doubled in the period 1988–2012, but the obese population has more than tripled (ENSANUT, 2012). This problem is particularly acute in women, as 73 % are overweight or obese. Mexico ranks first in total overweight and obesity rates among the OECD countries (OECD, 2017).====Beyond the damaging health consequences of this epidemic, there are also potential effects on labor market outcomes. Hamermesh and Biddle (1994) first documented the importance of physical appearance in earnings and employment outcomes. Obesity has been related in particular to lower probability of work and lower wages, especially for women (Asgeirsdottir, 2011; Atella et al., 2008; Averett, 2014; Brunello and d’Hombres, 2007; Caliendo and Gehrsitz, 2016; Cawley, 2004; Garcia and Quintana-Domeque, 2006; Han et al., 2011; Lundborg et al., 2014; Morris, 2007). However, as body weight is not randomly assigned it has been difficult to assess its causality with respect to labor market outcomes.====One way to address the identification problem between obesity and employment outcomes is with the use of correspondence audit studies.==== Rooth (2009)==== employs a field experiment in which he sends fictitious resumes in response to real advertisements for job vacancies in Sweden. For each vacancy, he sends two fictitious resumes with different photographs of persons very similar in appearance, one obese and one non-obese. He finds that obese individuals, both women and men, show differential callback rates. Obese women have a callback rate that is 8 percentage points lower than non-obese women; for obese men the rate is 6 percentage points lower. Using the non-obese callback rate as the base, this represents a rate that is 19 % less for obese women and 16 % less for obese men.====Building on Rooth (2009), our study adds significantly to the literature. First, our methodology employs a correspondence audit study that uses a non-paired design by gender (Gaddis, 2018). Since it is common practice in Mexico to include a photograph in a resume, and job advertisements often specify physical or personal characteristics, we can use resumes to assess discrimination against the obese and identify the potential channels of such discrimination. We send two fictitious resumes, one of a woman and another of a man, one obese and the other non-obese, in response to job advertisements. In our study, the photograph of the obese individual is a digital manipulation of the same person, unlike Rooth (2009), who uses different but similar-looking individuals.==== By restricting the analysis to the same person we eliminate concerns that a physical trait correlated with obesity is driving the discrimination result. In contrast to other correspondence studies, ours is also based on the text in the job advertisement. This allows us to explore channels like the salary offered, the gender of the person hiring, and the nature of the position itself.====Our study also offers an additional element of external validity. Recent literature reviews (Baert, 2018; Bertrand and Duflo, 2016) mention only one correspondence audit study that analyzes the effect of obesity on employment (Rooth, 2009). Given the magnitude of the overweight and obesity epidemic around the world, this lack of investigation in different settings and cultures is unfortunate. Rooth (2009) reports that in Sweden 39 % of women and 55 % of men aged 18–84 are overweight or obese. In Mexico the figure is much larger: 70 % of the population is overweight or obese. This difference suggests that the sensitivity of differential treatment might be a function of the fraction of overweight or obese individuals in the population. In addition, the institutional setting in Mexico is different from that of Sweden: the cultures and capacities of these two states to prevent discrimination are not equal. Indeed, 20 % of Mexicans have reported discrimination and infringement of their rights because of their physical appearance (CONAPRED, 2011). Effective discrimination could vary according to the economic development of each country.====Our study is not able to separate the interactive effects of phenotype and obesity. We manipulate only one picture of a woman and one of a man. A survey we carry out of 715 students and administrative workers finds that there is an attractiveness penalty for obese individuals. This penalty is similar for the man and woman used in the photographs. As Rooth (2009) points out, it is difficult to credibly identify the separate effects of obesity and attractiveness. It may be more fruitful for future research to analyze how the penalty varies with more objective measures like skin color, tattoos, and other clear phenotypic characteristics. Nevertheless, our study is internally valid, as the physical characteristics of persons in the photographs are all held constant except the obesity manipulation.====We restrict the field experiment to fictitious individuals in their twenties, mostly recent college graduates responding to job advertisements that request no more than three years of experience. We send resumes in response to advertisements for the following occupations: accounting (general and accounts payable), technical support in hardware, software, and web development, graphic design, law, imports and exports, marketing, and face-to-face and telephone sales. We send a total of 3202 resumes in response to 1696 job advertisements in two of the largest cities in Mexico (Mexico City and Monterrey), with a callback rate of 23 %. There is clear evidence of discrimination against obese women, but not obese men: the callback rate for non-obese women is 29.1 % and 21.3 % for obese women, and the difference is statistically and economically significant. An obese woman would need to send 37 % more resumes to obtain the same number of callbacks as a non-obese woman. This difference is greater than the obesity penalty found in Rooth (2009) and greater than the race penalty in Mexico (comparing callbacks for white women versus dark-skinned women) found in Arceo-Gomez and Campos-Vazquez (2014). The result is also consistent with previous studies finding that men are not as affected by obesity as women and that race does not seem to affect men in Mexico. Our finding shows that in the Mexican labor market physical appearance is important for women but not for men.====We explore potential mechanisms behind this discrimination pattern. First, we analyze callback rates by occupation to see whether there is a relationship between customer discrimination (employer discrimination based on perception of customer expectations) and our findings, but we do not observe a clear pattern. Second, we analyze whether discrimination varies with the salary offered in the advertisement. If obesity is thought to affect productivity, we would expect to see an increasing pattern of discrimination for jobs offering higher salaries, but we do not find such a pattern. Third, it is possible that discrimination is related to men preferring to work with non-obese women. For most job advertisements, we are able to record the gender of the person to whom the resume is sent: this person presumably makes the hiring decision. We do observe greater discrimination against obese women when the hiring decision is made by a man. However, since there are more women than men making hiring decisions, this difference cannot explain a large portion of the observed difference in callbacks. Finally, we relate the difference in callback rates by occupation with the female-to-male ratios of university students. There is no clear relationship with these variables.====This paper is ordered as follows. Section 2 presents the experimental design of the study, and Section 3 provides the descriptive and econometric results. Section 4 explores the potential channels of our findings.

In panel regressions that include province and year fixed effects as well as province trends, we show that children have significantly better health outcomes at birth in times of high unemployment: a 10 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is significantly associated with about 2 log-points higher birth-weight, almost 2 percentage points fewer babies with low birth weight, 0.6 points fewer babies with very low birth-weight, and a 0.4-point drop in mortality rates in the first 24 h We explore several potential mechanisms. First, we show that the documented association is not driven by in-utero selection: we do not find that high unemployment is associated with more miscarriages, abortions, or stillbirths. Second, we explore the role of composition in terms of parental characteristics. We find evidence that unmarried and younger parents, who typically have unhealthier babies, are relatively less likely to have children when unemployment is high. Finally, we show that there are fewer first births during recessions, and birth order is strongly positively correlated with health at birth. Birth order can account for up to one fifth of the countercyclicality of birth weight.","A rich recent literature in economics has explored the association between aggregate economic conditions and health. Multiple studies suggest that adult health may improve during recessions, in the US (Ruhm, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2016) as well as in other OECD countries.==== These studies typically relate state or regional unemployment rates with measures of adult health.==== Following the same approach, Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) found that worse macroeconomic conditions are associated with better newborn health in the US, using state-level variation and 30 years of data. Similar results were found for Sweden (Van den Berg et al., 2018).==== The channels driving this association are unclear, and may include changes in the selection of new parents throughout the cycle, and changes in maternal behaviors during pregnancy.====We study the relationship between aggregate economic conditions and neonatal health using 35 years of birth records in Spain. We show that newborns are significantly healthier when the unemployment rate in the province is high, confirming the results found in other developed countries. We then explore the drivers of this association.====We find that birth rates are lower in periods of high unemployment, and this effect is driven by the pro-cyclicality of first births. This goes in line with the findings in an ample previous literature showing that the business cycle is associated with fertility, with birth rates falling during economic downturns (Goldstein et al., 2013; Currie and Schwandt, 2014; Chatterjee and Vogl, 2016; Hofmann and Hohmeyer, 2016).====We also find that higher-order births tend to be healthier on average, even when comparing multiple children to the same mother. This was shown before by Hinkle et al. (2014) and Lehmann et al. (2018) for the US, Wilcox et al. (1996) for the UK, Brenoe and Molitor (2018) for Denmark, and Lundberg and Svaleryd (2016) for Sweden.====By combining these two latter findings, we are able to show that the countercyclicality of newborn health in Spain can be largely explained by the drop in the share of first births in periods of high unemployment. Since first births tend to be less healthy, their lower share leads to an improvement in average health at birth. This is a new result that can help understand a puzzling empirical pattern observed in some industrialized countries (infant health improving during recessions). Our main contribution is thus to provide a credible channel for this pattern.====Spain is a high-income country with large regional heterogeneity as well as large fluctuations in the unemployment rate over time. We exploit high-quality birth- and death-certificate data for the universe of registered births from 1981 to 2015, taking advantage of regional variation across the 50 Spanish provinces. We proxy macroeconomic conditions by the province unemployment rate (defined as one minus the employment-to-population ratio) in the year of conception.==== Our main measures of health at birth are birth-weight, prematurity, and neonatal mortality.====First, in a regression with province and year fixed-effects (like Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004) as well as province trends, we confirm the US finding that babies are born healthier when the local unemployment rate is high. We then explore several potential channels. First, we evaluate the role of in-utero selection, i.e. the possibility that less healthy fetuses are less likely to become live births during bad times. We provide evidence that miscarriages, abortions and stillbirths do not increase during recessions, which allows us to rule out this channel.====Second, we explore selection in parent characteristics. It may be that families with traits associated with better newborn health are relatively more likely to have children when unemployment is high. In a second finding, we show that married and older parents are, indeed, over-represented during recessions, which explains part of the positive infant health effects.====Third, we identify one factor that can account for a relevant fraction of the observed association, and that was previously undocumented in the literature: the number of previous children of the mother, or birth order. We show that there are significantly fewer first births during recessions. Birth order is shown to be positively correlated with health at birth, so that this factor alone can account for up to 22% of the association between unemployment and infant health. We are also able to rule out that birth order is proxying for unobserved parental characteristics, in specifications that exploit only between-sibling variation.====Finally, we turn to maternal health outcomes and health-related behaviors. We merge eight waves of National Health Survey data, covering 1987–2011, and our results point towards improvements in fertility-age women’s health and health behaviors during recessions, although the effects are imprecisely estimated.====We conclude that the combination of fewer first births and positive selection in parent characteristics more than compensate for the fall in household income during recessions, leading to healthier babies on average when the economy is weak.====Our work extends the findings in Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) in several directions. First, we confirm their main result, that newborn babies’ health is countercyclical, with data for a different developed country, with important differences with respect to the US in terms of the health care system (Spain has universal, public healthcare) as well as the labor market (the Spanish labor market is highly regulated and characterized by high and persistent unemployment). Second, we explore a new potential channel, in-utero selection, and are able to discard that miscarriages, abortions or stillbirths are important drivers. Third, by using pooled National Health Survey data for the same time period, we are able to rule out large changes in maternal health. Fourth, we identify a new mechanism, not explored in the previous literature, which can account for a large fraction of the effect: the fact that first births are procyclical (combined with first births being less healthy). And last, we also document changes in parental characteristics (mainly increases in married and older parents) that contribute to the improvements in newborn health in recessions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first present the baseline results (in section 2), showing that province level unemployment is associated with healthier newborns, after controlling for province and year fixed-effects (and province trends). In section 3, we proceed to evaluate the role of three potential channels: in-utero selection, composition effects in terms of observable characteristics of the parents, and mothers-to-be health outcomes and health-promoting behaviors.

This process involves rising agricultural productivity through the adoption of modern technology, diversification of crop production patterns and commercialisation of agriculture. It also involves diversification of rural livelihoods, through off-farm employment and improvements in public health, transport and communication infrastructure and access to services in rural areas (IFAD, 2016). The rural transformation process can be expected to induce substantial changes in the patterns of physical activity, energy expenditure and time-use associated with rural livelihoods. Understanding the nature of these changes is important for the design of interventions aimed at improving the nutrition, health and well-being of rural inhabitants (Johnston et al., 2018) However, reliable empirical evidence on the patterns of physical activity, energy expenditure and time use in rural livelihoods in LMICs has been limited on account of the constraints in accurate measurement of these parameters, particularly energy expenditure, in free living populations. This paper addresses this gap by taking advantage of emerging consumer friendly wearable technologies for physical activity monitoring. Integrating data from wearable accelerometers with household survey data, we generate robust activity, energy expenditure and time-use profiles for rural agricultural households in an LMICs context.====Robust livelihood energy expenditure profiles can provide significant inputs for policy or programme interventions aimed at improving rural welfare. Physical activity and energy expenditure profiles can contribute more accurate assessments of the incidence, depth and severity of undernutrition and poverty (in cases where undernutrition levels are defined in relation to average reference calorie requirements as is the case in the assessments of global hunger and food insecurity made by the FAO and IFPRI (FAO, 2015; von Grebmer et al., 2015) in low and middle income countries). Although recent initiatives have highlighted the need for better data to monitor food systems and nutrition outcomes (Global Panel, 2015; IFPRI, 2015), the assessment of the incidence of undernutrition/poverty is still often based on expenditure/consumption/dietary surveys using normative energy requirement figures (which may vary by age group or gender). The variation in energy requirements across socio-demographic and occupational/livelihood categories and agro-climatic zones is not taken into account in the assessment of undernutrition – a factor which may significantly bias the assessment of calorie deficits in the population at risk of undernutrition. Knowledge of energy expenditure profiles can provide a better understanding of the influence of livelihood strategies and activities, environmental factors (e.g., climate and temperature) and access to health and physical infrastructure on energy expenditure patterns and inform better targeting of nutrition interventions.====Examination of energy expenditure profiles can provide a better understanding of the link between productivity-enhancing interventions and nutrition outcomes for individuals within a household. In many developing countries, there appears to be a perplexing disconnect between agricultural productivity growth and expected improvements in nutrition status (Gillespie et al., 2012; Meeker and Haddad, 2013; Fan et al., 2019). Productivity-enhancing agricultural and food processing interventions impact nutrition and health outcomes in rural livelihoods through complex pathways that have yet to be well documented (Headey et al., 2011; Dangour et al., 2013). Delineation of the linkages between productivity enhancement and improvements in nutrition has been a major concern to policy makers and has been the subject of considerable recent research (Turner et al., 2013). The changes in the physical activity, energy expenditure and time-use patterns associated with productivity-enhancing interventions can be expected to have an important influence on the nutrition status of the rural population. However, empirical studies on nutrition impacts have tended to focus only on the quantum and distribution of gains in consumption following interventions while the energy expenditure dimension has been neglected.====This paper generates robust energy expenditure profiles to examine how changes in physical activity patterns, particularly drudgery reduction (DR), can affect the energy requirements of men and women in rural households in LMICs and the implications that this may have for their nutritional status (calorie adequacy). We address the following research questions:====Our analysis based on data from two case studies of rural households in Ghana and India suggests that in the context of rural livelihoods in LMICs, DR can offer substantial savings in energy expenditure that could offset the calorie deficits faced by some segments of the population. DR could offer an important and substantial route to nutritional improvement in rural livelihoods. At the same time DR can also lead to increasing incidence of overweight and obesity in rural areas. The energy expenditure dimension associated with changing patterns of activity in rural livelihoods may be an important factor explaining agriculture-nutrition linkages.====Section 2 explains the concept of DR employed in this paper and the factors influencing the potential for DR in the context of rural livelihoods. Section 3 examines the previous literature on physical activity patterns in rural livelihoods and the link to agriculture-nutrition linkages.

I consider a ==== in which individuals are heterogenous with respect to the experience of chronic pain and susceptibility to addiction and live through two periods. In the first period they consider whether to treat pain with opioid pain relievers (OPRs). In the second period they consider whether to continue non-medical opioid use to mitigate cravings from addiction. Non-medical opioid use is subject to social disapproval, which depends negatively on the share of opioid addicts in the ====. An opioid epidemic is conceptualized as the transition from an equilibrium at which opioid use is low and addiction is highly stigmatized to an equilibrium at which opioid use is prevalent and social disapproval is low. I show how such a transition is initiated by the wrong belief that OPRs are not very addictive. Under certain conditions there exists an opioid trap such that the community persists at the equilibrium of high opioid use after the wrong belief is corrected. Refinements of the basic model consider the recreational use of prescription OPRs and an interaction between income, pain, and addiction.","In this paper, I propose an economic theory that addresses the epidemic character of opioid epidemics. The prime application of the theory is the present opioid crisis in the U.S. whose core elements are briefly reviewed in the next paragraphs.====The crisis originated in the 1990s. Until then, the prescription of opioid pain relievers (OPRs) was mainly confined to treat acute pain and cancer pain (in palliative care). Morphine and its derivatives like heroin were known to be highly addictive and their non-medical use was mainly confined to marginalized groups of society. Then, a couple of research papers argued that OPRs could be prescribed on a long-term basis with insignificant risk to addiction (e.g. Portenoy and Foley, 1986, Zenz et al., 1992), the pharmaceutical industry developed new slow-release OPRs (oxycontin) and convinced many physicians that OPRs can be prescribed safely and more freely, and an increasing share of OPRs were paid by insurance (Zhou et al., 2016). In 1997, the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine issued a consensus statement endorsing opioid use for chronic pain (Haddox et al., 1997).====As a result of these developments, prescription OPR use increased from 134 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per adult American in 1992 to a peak of 1011 MMEs in 2011 (IQVIA, 2017). Many OPR patients developed an addiction and it is estimated that 25 million Americans initiated non-medical use of OPRs between 2002 and 2011 (SAMHSA, 2012). OPR-overdose and OPR-abuse treatments increased in sync with OPR sales (Kolodny et al., 2015). From 1999 to 2016, more than 630,000 people died from drug overdose, making it the leading cause of accidental death in the United States (CDC, 2017a). In 2007, the developer of oxycontin pled guilty to criminal charges for misrepresenting the risk of addiction (Van Zee, 2009). Health care providers gradually prescribed OPRs more reluctantly and the CDC re-reformed their recommendation of pain treatment (CDC, 2017a, CDC, 2017b). Since 2011, OPR use decreased gradually to a level in 2017 that is about five times as high as in 1992 (IQVIA, 2017).====The decline of OPR use was accompanied by a sharp increase of heroin sales such that deaths from heroin overdose increased by about factor 5 from 2010 to 2016 (CDC, 2017a). These trends can be explained by the chemical similarity of OPRs and heroin. When a prescription runs out, addicted users have an incentive to avoid withdrawal pain by switching to illicit opioids. In terms of morphine equivalents, heroin is available at about one-tenth of the street price of OPRs (DEA, 2015, Gupta, 2016) and 94% of illicit opioid users state to use heroin because prescription opioids are far more expensive and harder to obtain. (Cicero et al., 2014). As a result of these developments, opioid addiction is no longer confined to a minority of impoverished men in marginalized inner city environments. It is now prevalent among white middle-class men and women living in suburban and rural areas (Cicero and Ellis, 2017). In other words, opioid use and addiction arrived in the mid of the American society.====An interesting but so far little discussed question is why the rapid increase in opioid use has been addressed as an “opioid epidemic”. The Concise Medical Dictionary (2014) defines an epidemic as a “sudden outbreak of infectious disease that spreads rapidly through the population, affecting a large proportion of people.” Since opioid use is clearly not infectious in an epidemiological sense, the use of the term “opioid epidemic” by the press, scientific scholars, and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2017a) could perhaps be based on a loose interpretation of the term, in the sense of “crisis”. Here, we scrutinize the idea that the term “opioid epidemic” could actually be appropriate in a strict sense, namely through social contagion. Specifically, we consider the stigmatization of opioid addicts by social disapproval in their community. Fighting and overcoming an addiction is costly in terms of pain from withdrawal. The presence of social disapproval additionally motivates to fight an (accidental) addiction or to altogether avoid the use of addictive substances.====Social disapproval is likely to decline when an increasing share of a community deviates from the social norm. In particular, the exposure to colleagues, friends, or family members who became addicted to opioids, perhaps in an accidental way through pain treatment, could motivate a decline in social disapproval. According to a survey of the Pew Research Center (2017), 46% of U.S. adults say they have a family member or close friend who is or has been addicted to drugs. The meta study by Cicero and Ellis (2017) argues that the transition of former prescription OPR users to heroin caused a dissipation of social stigma associated with heroin use. In this sense, an opioid epidemic is conceptualized as the transition from an equilibrium where non-medical opioid use is low and social disapproval of addicts is high to an equilibrium where non-medical opioid use is prevalent and social disapproval of addicts is low.====The modeling of the opioid epidemic as a social phenomenon allows to contribute to the literature with some points that have not yet been extensively addressed. It also offers an answer to the question why it is so hard to reverse the opioid epidemic. From a mechanistic viewpoint, the correction of wrong beliefs regarding the addictive power of OPRs and the discontinuation of OPR prescriptions should be sufficient to reestablish the initial pre-crisis situation. These supply side policies are likely to cause much hardship and further casualties because of the transition to illicit opioid use of individuals who are already addicted (Strulik, 2018). But one could naively expect that these policies prevent or drastically reduce the initiation of opioid use and thus gradually re-establish the pre-crisis state at which opioids were only used by a marginalized minority of society. Actually, however, we observe that an increasing share of new opioid users initiates an addiction with illicit opioids (Cicero et al., 2017). Chen et al. (2019) simulate the future development of opioid misuse and conclude that the epidemic will develop further and that prescription OPR policies are unlikely to fundamentally change these trends (see Pitt et al., 2018, for similar results).====The opioid-epidemics theory offers an explanation of these trends. Social dynamics self-enforce the equilibria of high and low opioid use. Once one policy (for example, the wrong information about addictive power of OPRs or the generous prescription of OPRs) has increased opioid use and decreased social disapproval of addiction in the community, it is insufficient to reverse the policy to re-establish the old equilibrium. The local stability of the old equilibrium required that addiction is strongly disapproved, a social norm that is no longer sustained. In other words, many individuals who are now observed (Cicero et al., 2017) or predicted (Chen et al., 2019) to initiate an opioid addiction would have prevented from doing so by social disapproval in the pre-crisis environment. The fact that there are now so many addicts in the community, however, keeps social disapproval low. The community is caught in an opioid trap.====A series of studies supports the notion that drug use is subject to social interaction, disapproval and stigma and that drug use of peers and community members reduces stigma and motivates drug use, in particular among adolescents and young adults (e.g. Bachmann et al., 1990, Poelen et al., 2007, Simons-Morton and Chen, 2006, Palamar et al., 2013, Palamar et al., 2012, Strickland and Smith, 2014). Social interaction may motivate drug use through other channels than declining disapproval such as learning from peers, greater availability of drugs, or social pressure to conform. The theory developed in this paper is consistent with all of these channels. Social disapproval, however, seems to be the most plausible channel. It can rationalize why the opioid epidemic has affected many social groups in communities such as villages and towns but still remains restricted to (large) minorities within the communities, a phenomenon that is harder to explain with learning or conformity.====In the economics literature, Becker (1992) has initiated the discussion of addiction and social interaction. Jones (1994), Cutler and Glaeser (2007), and Poutvaara and Siemers (2008) discuss the role of social interaction in smoking decisions. Christakis and Fowler (2007) show how obesity spreads from person to person in a large social network and Strulik (2014) proposes a theory of evolving obesity based on social disapproval. Manski (2000) highlights the difficulties in identifying social interaction empirically. Brock and Durlauf (2001) propose a general theory of social interaction and Reif (2019) integrates social interaction in the Becker–Murphy (1988) model of rational addiction. McDonald et al. (2012) document a large variation of prescription OPR use across U.S. counties of which less than a third is explained by the characteristics of the local population and the number and composition of health care providers. Finkelstein et al. (2018) show that opioid abuse of individuals increase when they move into counties in which OPR use is prevalent. These observations could reflect local differences in OPR prescription and monitoring policies. They can also be motivated by the proposed theory of social interaction and the local stability of disapproval of opioid addiction.====In mathematical biology, the epidemic character of addiction has been modeled by adapting the SIR model of infectious diseases of Kermack and McKendrick (1927), see, for example, Hoppensteadt and Murray (1981) and White and Comiskey (2007). Battista et al. (2019) apply this approach to study the prescription opioid epidemic. The main difference to the here proposed theory is that these models are rather mechanistic, in the sense that they do not model economic choices, attitudes and behavior.====By focussing on social dynamics the paper neglects several aspects of the opioid epidemic that have been addressed in related literature. Case and Deaton (2017) observed increasing deaths from suicide, alcohol-related liver diseases, and drug overdoses among middle-aged white Americans and hypothesized that these “deaths of despair” may be driven by declining opportunities for people without a college degree. Ruhm (2018) argues that increasing overdose deaths are largely driven by higher availability and lower costs of opioids rather than deteriorating macroeconomic indicators. Grossmann and Strulik (2018) propose a macroeconomic model to analyze the impact of deteriorating economic status and declining opioid prices and argue that both trends are necessary to motivate increasing opioid use of the middle class. Strulik (2019) integrates pain, pain treatment, and addiction into a general life cycle theory of human aging and analyzes the transition in demand for different analgesics and opioids and its impact on health. Schnell (2017) proposes a model of physician behavior when OPRs can be obtained legally as well as illegally. Evans et al. (2018) argue that abuse-deterrent oxycontin, which entered the market in 2010, is associated with less OPR-related death and more heroin deaths with no effect on total deaths from overdose.====The paper is structured as follows. I set up the basic model and develop the main results in Section 2. In Section 3, I extend the basic model by allowing to initiate addiction with recreational OPR use. In Section 4, I extend the model by integrating an association between income and pain and a feedback effect of opioid use and addiction on income.

Very significant political, social and economic changes in Poland occurred in the period studied. The political revolution that began in Poland at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s dramatically changed the picture of social inequalities in the country. It rapidly transformed (in different directions and to a different degree) the economic situation, working conditions, lifestyles and the prestige of particular social classes and professional groups. A positive secular trend was observed in 19-year-old participants in the period analysed in all homogeneous socio-professional groups, however, with different intensity in each group. The highest body height increases in 1965-2010 were observed in the sons of farmers with post-primary father’s education (7.77 cm). The lowest were observed among the sons of professionals, only 5.45 cm. Although social distances between extreme socio-economic groups significantly decreased (from 4.89 cm in 1965 to 2.76 cm in 2010), social gradients of body height, despite the improvement in the standards of living of the entire society remained exceptionally stable and unchanged for nearly half a century.","Similar to other countries, there were growing social differences in Poland of the second half of the 20th century, as evidenced by the growing value of the Gini coefficient calculated in relation to income, which is a measure of social inequality (SP, 2015; Statistics Poland (SP, 2019; WBW, 2015). The biological effects of social stratification are recorded by analysis of the social differences in some indices of population well-being, such as the rate of growth and maturation of children and adolescents (Bielicki et al., 1986, 2003, 2005; Charzewski et al., 2003; Zong et al., 2015), health status and morbidity in adults (Bray et al., 2018; Jankowska et al., 2008; Kołodziej, 1998; Lipowicz, 2007; Łopuszańska-Dawid, 2018; Rogucka and Bielicki, 1999; Rogucka et al., 2000; Szklarska and Rogucka, 2001), and mortality rates, especially concerning premature deaths (Kołodziej et al., 2007, 2008; Rogucka, 1995).

We estimate a value-added model that controls for a rich set of child, mother, and family characteristics, from a nationally representative sample of Chilean children aged 52–83 months. We find harsh parenting is significantly associated with lower verbal skills (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) of a magnitude of 0.06 ","Most children in the world are exposed to violence, either physical or psychological, and in many cases to both. Of particular concern for their development and well-being is the fact that the majority of the violence they experience originates in their own family environment, typically exercised by parents or other family members. Using comparable data for 63 countries or areas, UNICEF (2014a) reports that on average about four in five children between ages 2 and 14 are subject to some form of violent discipline in their homes. Although in recent years there seems to be some decline in mother’s endorsement of physical discipline in the U.S. (Ryan et al., 2016), and several countries have prohibited all corporal punishment of children even within the household, the use of some forms of violence is still highly prevalent in most countries in the world—regardless of their income or development level. Furthermore, parental use of violence is legal in more than seventy five percent of countries in the world (Global Initiative, 2017).====Violence towards children can take several forms. For instance, physical violence can be severe, putting the physical integrity of the child at risk—also referred as child abuse or maltreatment—or it can take the form of lack of care, referred to as neglect.==== Parental disciplinary practices can also reach lower levels of severity, including physical or corporal punishment that do not endanger the child’s physical integrity.==== It can also include verbal or psychological aggressions, which can take the form of threats, shouts, or insults. In this paper, we study the effect of harsh parenting (HP), i.e., parental strategies that incorporate these lesser forms of violence and aggressions towards children, on early childhood cognitive and socio-emotional development.====Overall, there is a broad consensus on the negative effects of severe forms of child abuse/neglect towards children, yet there is an ongoing debate on the effects of the lesser forms of violence. For instance, studies have analyzed the association between physical punishment and children's outcomes, with some common findings, which include increased child compliance following corporal punishment, and increasing negative effects with age and with frequency of punishment (Larzelere, 2000; Gershoff, 2002; Benjet and Kazdin, 2003; Larzelere and Kuhn, 2005; Ferguson, 2013; Gershoff and Grogan-Kaylor, 2016).====In economics, child abuse has received relatively little attention.==== Using US state-level panel data, Paxon and Waldfogel (1999, 2002) show that states with more absent fathers and working mothers have higher rates of child maltreatment. In terms of its effects, Currie and Tekin (2012) find that maltreated children are more likely to engage in crime, and Currie and Widom (2010) find that children that were subject to child abuse and/or neglect have lower education, employment, earnings, and assets in their adulthood. Pieterse (2015) finds that childhood maltreatment is associated with lower numeracy test scores and higher dropout among children in one city in South Africa.====Even less attention has been devoted to understanding how parenting styles can affect child development (MacMillan and Mikton, 2017), although it is already known that household investments and structure during early childhood play a significant role in the development of cognitive and socio-emotional skills (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, Doyle et al., 2009, Chan and Fung, 2018), and that early skill formation has a significant impact on later outcomes, including schooling, wages, occupation, and productivity, among others (Heckman et al., 2006; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008; Cunha et al., 2006; Cunha and Heckman, 2008, 2009; Gertler et al., 2014; Almond et al., 2017). Additionally, the formation of child cognitive skills has been shown to be associated with socioeconomic characteristics of their household, child’s health, and their parental cognitive development (Paxon and Schady, 2007; Schady, 2011; Schady et al., 2015; Contreras and González, 2015; Contreras et al., 2014; Galasso et al., 2017). However, less is known about how parenting strategies are related to child development (Pinquart, 2017; MacKenzie et al., 2014; Coneus et al., 2012). One exception is Paxon and Shady (2007), whom in the context of analyzing children’s cognitive development in Ecuador find that parenting quality—including harsh parenting—is negatively correlated with cognitive development.====In this context, our study seeks to contribute to the literature on the association between harsh forms of parenting—not reaching the level of abuse or maltreatment—and early childhood cognitive and socio-emotional development. We use data from a nation-wide survey on early infancy with a sample of children aged 4–7 years-old (specifically 52–83 months). Cognitive development is measured using the Spanish version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and socio-emotional development is assessed using the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). We are able to expand the existing literature because we have longitudinal data that follows children over a two year period, which allows us to estimate the association of harsh parenting with child development within a value-added framework.====A second contribution is that we provide estimates of the association using two different measures of harsh parenting, one that is self-reported by the child’s mother, and another that uses a direct observational measure of harsh parenting.==== In addition to asking care takers about their use of several forms of parenting that can be classified as harsh parenting (shouting, criticizing or hitting the child), the survey collected information on observations provided by surveyors/test enumerators. They filled out the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) questionnaire, reporting several measures of maternal attitudes towards the child during the visit, including verbal and/or physical aggressions. We use these two measures—one self-reported and one observed—to capture the potential effects of parental aggressions on development. The self-reported measure would capture the effect of a more structural or permanent parental strategy, and the observed measure would capture the contemporaneous or immediate association between exposure to harsh parenting and the child’s test performance.====Our results show that exposure to harsh parenting—i.e., being exposed to verbal aggressions or milder forms of physical violence, or both—is significantly associated with lower development of verbal skills (our cognitive outcome), and with a larger number of behavioral problems (our socio-emotional outcome). Results are similar for both measures of harsh parenting, and in some cases, we find a stronger association between child’s outcome and concurrent aggressions, i.e. for the observed measure of harsh parenting. Exposure to harsh parenting is also associated with an increasing likelihood that the child falls into a category of low verbal skills development and in a clinical range of behavioral problems. Furthermore, harsh parenting affects different types of behaviors, including the three broadband behavior scales into which CBCL behaviors are grouped: internalization, externalization, and sleep problems.====We also analyze systematic exposure to harsh parenting over time, and find that it affects child development: the more persistent harsh parenting is, the worse children fare in both dimensions of child development. Finally, we study heterogeneous effects along child’s sex, age, and maternal education level. We find a similar association for both boys and girls; that the association is strongest when children are 5 years old; and that harsh parenting is associated with diminished verbal skills only for children with less educated mothers, but it is negatively associated with socio-emotional development irrespective of mother’s education level. Overall, our findings reveal that less severe, but more common forms of violence are associated with lower levels of development during early childhood.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology; Section 3 describes the data and variables; Section 4 presents the results; and Section 5 summarizes and provides a discussion on the implications of our study.",Harsh parenting during early childhood and child development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301327,26 November 2019,2019,Research Article,95.0

Yet we know little about the determinants of variation in perceived income justice across individuals. In this paper, we ask to what extent differences in genes are related to variation in individuals’ perceived income justice, and whether there is a gene–environment component. Analyzing data from the German TwinLife study, we find that more than 30% of individuals’ perceived income justice can be attributed to genes. The rest is mostly related to an idiosyncratic environment.","A key building block of economics and neighboring disciplines which explain human behavior is that preferences drive individual decision making. As there is, furthermore, ample variation in economic preferences between and within countries (Falk et al., 2018) understanding the origins of people's preferences better is certainly of utmost importance. It could be that variation in people's preferences is genetically determined, subject to environmental influences, or stems from the interaction of environmental and genetic effects. In this respect, important insights have already been gained in relation to the genetic and environmental components of, for example, risk preferences and saving behavior (Cesarini et al., 2009, Cesarini et al., 2010, Cronqvist and Siegel, 2015). Many other domains have remained unexplored, however, mostly due to the lack of appropriate data.====In this paper, we make use of a fairly recent dataset, the German TwinLife Study (Diewald et al., 2018), to elicit the genetic determinants of people's preferences for income justice. Within a classical twin design, we investigate to what extent the variance of individuals’ assessment of perceived income justice can be attributed to variation in genes and the environment by comparing the survey answers of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. In addition to exploring the contribution of genes to perceived income justice, we address several issues which have attracted limited scholarly attention thus far. Our data allows us to analyze gene–environment interaction, assortative mating, the closeness of DZ and MZ twins, and unequal treatment of DZ and MZ twins by parents as potential causes of measurement bias in the heritability component of people's stated preferences.====Perceived income justice plays an important role in labor economics and beyond. In their seminal contributions, Akerlof (1982) and Akerlof and Yellen (1990) introduced the fair wage hypothesis, showing its implications for workers’ effort choices. It is argued that workers who perceive their income as unfair reduce their work-related effort below a level that they would have shown otherwise. Experimental studies have been strongly supportive of the wage-effort relationship, see, e.g., the survey by Fehr and Gächter (2000). In addition to the effects of unfair pay on workers’ effort, several other consequences of unfair pay have been pointed out. D’Ambrosio et al. (2018) finds that perceived unfairness of pay negatively affects workers’ well-being and increases quits. Falk et al. (2017) show that workers who perceive their income as unfair are more likely to suffer from stress-related diseases and cardiovascular health problems. Moreover, it has been found that workers who consider their pay as unfair sleep less and have more sleep disorders (Pfeifer, 2015). There is also experimental evidence which shows the effect of fairness on emotions (Bosman and Van Winden, 2002, Ben-Shakhar et al., 2007). Overall, it appears that perceived income justice has far reaching consequences in various domains of life. The extent to which there is a genetic influence on peoples’ preferences for income justice is largely unexplored, however.====Our results suggest that more than 30% of the observed variance in perceived income justice can be attributed to variation in genes. We do not find evidence for a common environmental component. The rest of the observed variation in preferences appears to be related to idiosyncratic environments of the twins. Furthermore, we do not find evidence in support of gene–environment interactions, although this might be the result of a considerably lower number of observations available in the TwinLife data as we include parental characteristics. Addressing the further assumptions of the classical twin design (no assortative mating; equal treatment of twins; identical closeness of MZ and DZ twins), we find that our main results survive although the size of the heritability component changes for some of the sub-samples on which we conduct the variance decomposition.====A well-known proverb asserts that “The apple never falls far from the tree.”, i.e. that children very often have similar characteristics to their parents. The likely channels through which parents and their children become alike are manyfold. Preferences could be inherited via genes, be the result of environmental effects, or, as we argue later on, be influenced by gene–environment interactions. The nature versus nurture distinction for exploring adolescents’ preferences, behavior, and economic outcomes has been attracting considerable scholarly attention, and has been dominating the debate for a long time. On the nurture side, we relate to a strand of literature that sees preference transmission within a family driven by idiosyncratic traits and values that parents inculcate in their children. Such a channel was debated among philosophers already centuries ago. For example, John Locke (1632–1704) claimed that children are born with a blank slate and that it was only through a process of socialization that parents and society shaped their values. Contrarily, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) believed that children are born innately good and that it is their parents’ responsibility to uphold these values. In this view – the nurture explanation – parents attempt to mold their children's preferences in order to induce choices which the parents see as conducive to a successful life. Such a parenting style is called authoritative in the language of development psychology (Baumrind, 1967). The effect of parenting styles on children's preferences has been an intensively investigated topic in many studies in psychology (see, e.g., Spera, 2005), showing that they do have an effect on adolescents’ behavior.====The size of the genetic component as opposed to nurture can be addressed with studies that conduct variance decompositions based on twin data. A seminal contribution to the economics literature using the classical twin design is Taubman (1976). It sparked a large literature which was mainly interested in the nature versus nurture distinction in relation to IQ transmission and receiving education. These studies on IQ transmission and education are reviewed in Sacerdote (2011). We add to a literature on the genetic origins of preferences that has so far explored the determinants of moral foundations (Smith et al., 2017), political attitudes and ideology (see the survey by Hatemi and McDermott, 2012), risk preferences (Cesarini et al., 2009, Cesarini et al., 2010, Cronqvist and Siegel, 2015), trust (Cesarini et al., 2008, Sturgis et al., 2010, Oskarsson et al., 2017), fairness (Wallace et al., 2007), dishonest behavior (Loewen et al., 2013), or social attitudes (Eaves and Eysenck, 1974, Martin et al., 1986). This literature on preferences, however, lacks a study on perceived income justice, see also Polderman et al. (2015). The analysis perhaps closest to our study was done by Funk et al. (2013) who explore, among other traits, the genetic origins of egalitarianism, applying an index developed in Feldman and Steenbergen (2001). None of the items in this index, however, addresses the question of perceived income justice.====In our contribution, we want to determine the size of the genetic component of that particular trait which plays an important role in labor economics and beyond as we tried to argue beforehand. In addition, we address a more nascent literature and look into gene–environment interaction. There, it is argued that the genetic component is moderated by the environment (see, e.g., Cunha and Heckman, 2010, Diewald, 2010, Rutter, 2006, Stenberg, 2013). We will analyze whether the genetic component in perceived income justice unfolds differently if twins are exposed to distinct parental backgrounds. To this end, we elicit parental background variables that have been found to be correlated with preferences for income distribution in previous studies (Alesina and Giuliano, 2011). Then to investigate gene–environment interactions, we apply two different methodological approaches. One of the simplest ways (c.f. Dick, 2011) to test for a gene–environment interaction is to split the sample along the magnitude of the environmental variable, and compare the separate estimates. Alternatively, we estimate a gene–environment interaction model on the full sample following Purcell (2002). The latter model features the additional advantage that we can formally test for the existence of gene–environment interactions.====The following section introduces the TwinLife dataset.

These results are lower than previously reported and suggest that the higher previous estimates may be heavily affected by the highest income level and confounded by endogeneity in the income variable. As expected, we find that the value of pain relief increases with pain severity.","Chronic pain clearly lowers utility, but quantifying exactly how much people are willing to trade-off pain and income is challenging. To avoid the problems of market-based valuation, stated-preference methods, and hedonic wage regressions, we use the subjective well-being method to estimate the monetary value of pain relief among individuals age 50 and older. State of the art econometric methods are applied with a piecewise-linear model introduced as a model of particular interest, while comparing the statistical relationship between subjective well-being and health to that of subjective well-being and income. Our model specifications are an improvement over prior applications of the method and could be applied to other longitudinal survey data on subjective well-being, income, and health.====Because chronic pain is associated with psychological distress, functional impairment, and disability (Hardt et al., 2008; Nahin, 2015), pain-relief treatment increases well-being. In addition to other benefits, such as productivity gains (Kapteyn et al., 2008), the direct effect of pain relief on quality-of-life is likely to be extensive. Monetizing this well-being improvement is thus needed when choosing treatments by their net benefit, or even when choosing between a pain treatment and other well-being-increasing policies.====Developments in subjective well-being research have led to a consensus on the importance of three methodological attributes; i.e. to control for unobserved heterogeneity, to account for decreasing marginal utility of income, and to instrument for income (Becchetti and Pelloni, 2013; Clark et al., 2008; Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2006; Frey et al., 2010; Frey and Stutzer, 2002). However, previous studies on valuing pain relief have failed to include all of these attributes (Graham et al., 2011; McNamee and Mendolia, 2014). Moreover, given the few applications of the subjective well-being method to health, validating results using different data sets and exploring the sensitivity of results to different model specifications is important before settling on the most consistent estimate.====Apart from addressing these two issues, we have four specific econometric contributions to the literature. First, we study detailed, longitudinal individual-level data on a sample for which pain is prevalent and we can control for individual heterogeneity. Second, we explore the methodology of the subjective well-being method from a new perspective — using models that are more flexible by allowing a piecewise-linear relationship in the income variable. Third, we address endogeneity in income with instrumental variables, because theory and previous research suggests that simple models have a downward-biased coefficient on the income variable. Fourth, we test the sensitivity of results to the level of pain severity. Thus, this is the first paper to estimate willingness to pay for pain relief that allows for heterogeneous effects across income levels and instruments for income.====We find that the value of pain relief increases with income and with pain severity. Our estimates of the value of pain relief are lower than previous research using data from Australia and Latin-America suggest. Our exploration shows the value of pain to be sensitive to the functional form of income.",Valuing pain using the subjective well-being method,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19300656,16 November 2019,2019,Research Article,98.0

The present analysis investigates the relationship between height and the probability of being in a leadership position in the ==== using multinational European Social Survey data from 19 countries. Studying full-time, employed individuals between 20 and 55 years of age reveals considerable country differences which is beneficial for the estimated multilevel models as variation is increased.====The results indicate a statistically significant effect whereby women are 0.15 percentage points more likely to be in a leadership position for each additional centimetre of absolute height when controlling for education and occupational position whereas there is no effect for men.====In order to study the relevance of absolute vs relative height, which is the difference to the local peer-group, regional data is utilized. The main findings are that there is no effect of relative height for men but a statistically significant effect for women. For them, absolute and relative effects are about equally strong.","Physical height is one of the most prominent and outstanding characteristics that is obvious in any form of direct social interaction. Consequently, the effects of height on a large set of outcomes have been well studied in the social sciences. Just to name a few, being tall is associated with higher educational attainment (Magnusson et al., 2006), higher intelligence (Sundet et al., 2005), a lower risk of suicide (Magnusson et al., 2005), reporting higher levels of happiness (Carrieri and Paola, 2012; Deaton and Arora, 2009) and higher wages (Kim and Euna, 2017; Case and Paxson, 2008; Cinnirella et al., 2011; Heineck, 2005; Herpin, 2005; Hübler, 2009; Lundborg et al., 2009; Persico et al., 2004; Böckerman et al., 2017). As the number of cited sources underlines, especially this last aspect has been studied in detail, drawing data from a large number of different cultures. However, the mechanisms that might elucidate this phenomenon are less understood. Why do tall people earn more on average? The explanations why tall people enjoy these positive outcomes are quite controversial and disentangling the mechanisms that are accountable for these effects is a major challenge. Scientists are usually not able, at least in observational studies, to monitor all factors that affect the studied outcome (wages) which might introduce spurious correlations. For example, many studies show a quite strong effect of height on wages which is significantly reduced after other factors, like intelligence, cognitive ability or educational attainment, are introduced into the models. One central chain of reasoning is that tall people display these positive outcomes as they are more often in leading positions at the workspace and have responsibility for subordinates (Lindqvist, 2012). This appears to be a highly relevant starting point for further research. However, there are more open questions, for example, the effects of gender. Many studies only include men in their samples (often due to data restrictions), therefore, the effect for women is less researched. Do they also profit from being tall or are the effects quite different? These questions deserve more attention, especially when equal rights at the workplace are still an issue many countries have to deal with. Lastly, the question arises whether absolute height or relative height is more significant when examining the effects of being tall. This aspect is crucial as it also refers to the entanglement of a set of confounders: is height important because it is a good predictor of health and intelligence (absolute value) or is it important for selecting the individuals who are taller than their peers and therefore perceived as more dominant (relative value)? Previous studies indicate that this relative measure can be of great relevance and deserves more attention from researchers (Stulp et al., 2013).====In summary, the paper has three main research questions:",The relationship between height and leadership: Evidence from across Europe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19300760,15 November 2019,2019,Research Article,99.0

We also find that being born above the 5000-gram cutoff has a mortality-reducing effect: infants with a birth weight larger than 5000 grams face a 0.15 percentage-point lower risk of mortality in the first week and a 0.20 percentage-point lower risk of mortality in the first month, compared to their counterparts with a birth weight below 5000 grams. We do not find any evidence of changes in health treatments and mortality at macrosomic cutoffs lower than 5000 grams, which is consistent with the idea that such ==== decisions are guided by the higher expected morbidity and mortality risk associated with infants weighing more than 5000 grams.","This study examines the relationship between birth weight, neonatal care, and infant mortality among high-risk newborns at the upper end of the birth weight distribution. Prior work has mainly focused on newborns with a low birth weight (LBW). Medical research has shown that being born with a LBW increases the risk of developmental problems, which worsens as birth weight decreases (Hack et al., 1995, Abernethy et al., 2002). Economic studies have shown that health treatments received by very LBW children are effective in reducing the risk of infant mortality and at improving subsequent health and academic achievement (Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Almond et al., 2010, Cutler and Meara, 2000, Breining et al., 2015). Since these findings only apply to LBW infants, it is important to analyze the return to medical care for high-risk newborns with a high birth weight (HBW), who have been not been studied in the early life literature.====Recent data from the CDC Wonder System indicate that, over the past decade, the rate of ====, or the percentage of newborns who were born with a HBW has hovered around 8%.==== In contrast to LBW newborns, the health risks associated with macrosomia worsen as birth weight ====. Medical studies have shown that the morbidity and mortality risks associated with a macrosomic newborn all grow as birth weight increases (Boulet et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2008, Oral et al., 2001, Vidarsdottir et al., 2011), especially for infants heavier than 5000 grams (Chatfield, 2001, Gottlieb and Galan, 2007). As the health complications increase in number or complexity, there is likely to be a corresponding increase in health care costs associated with treating them.====Building on prior research that has found that a rule of thumb is used for assigning medical care to very LBW newborns (Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Almond et al., 2010, Cutler and Meara, 2000, Breining et al., 2015), we demonstrate that a similar rule of thumb is used in the assignment of medical care to high-risk newborns in the macrosomic segment of the birth weight distribution, and exploit the resulting plausibly exogenous variation in medical care receipt to estimate the health returns to providing neonatal care to macrosomic babies. Our analysis uses data from the 2007–2013 Birth Cohort Linked Birth-Infant Death Files, which, starting in 2007, has collected newly available information on the health treatments received by newborns. In a regression discontinuity framework, we use a sample of newborns born within 227 grams (half a pound) from a macrosomic cutoff to analyze whether being born above the cutoff affects the probability of receiving health treatments in the delivery hospital and the risk of infant mortality. The underlying assumption in our analysis is that babies born within a small birth-weight window around the macrosomic cutoff are relatively homogeneous, except for the extra medical care that newborns weighing-in above the macrosomic cutoff receive because of rule-of-thumb treatment decisions.====Our results indicate that being born above a weight of 5000 grams (extremely HBW [EHBW]) increases the probability of receiving antibiotics for suspected sepsis and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by around 1 and 2 percentage points, respectively, which correspond to an increase of 40% and 19%. We also find that the risk of 7-day and 28-day mortality drops by around 0.15 and 0.20 percentage points, respectively, as the 5000-gram cutoff is crossed from below, which are large relative to the mean mortality rates below the cutoff (0.09% and 0.12%, respectively). These results are robust to a wide variety of robustness and sensitivity checks. While the examination of health treatments represents our first-stage analysis, we interpret the reduction in mortality as the intention-to-treat effect of being an EHBW infant: even though it is plausible to link the reduced mortality for EHBW newborns to the increases in NICU-based treatments and antibiotics receipt, there may be other medical inputs that are not observable in our data that also change at the 5000-gram cutoff and contribute to the mortality reduction. We do not find similar discontinuities at macrosomic cutoffs below 5000 grams, which is consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of rule-of-thumb health treatment assignment may grow with the higher expected morbidity and mortality risks associated with heavier macrosomic babies.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on fetal macrosomia and presents descriptive evidence on health treatments and mortality for macrosomic newborns, while Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 5 focuses on the 5000-gram cutoff and presents our main results, the results from a battery of robustness and sensitivity checks, as well as additional evidence on the mortality effects.

Recent studies have reported that water purifications systems are responsible for huge contributions to human capital. Although some studies have investigated the instantaneous effects of water-supply systems in pre-war Japan, little is known about the chain effects of these systems. By analyzing city-level cause-specific mortality data from 1922 to 1940, we find that a decline in typhoid deaths by one per 1000 people decreased the risk of death due to non-waterborne diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia by 0.742–2.942 per 1000 people. Our finding suggests that the observed Mills–Reincke phenomenon could have resulted in the relatively rapid decline in the mortality rate in early 20-century Japan.","Waterborne diseases caused considerable losses of human capital throughout the 20th century (Preston and van de Walle, 1978, Evans, 1987, Troesken, 2004). Previous studies have therefore regarded the implementation of water purification systems as being responsible for the huge improvements in public health. The pioneering and influential study by Cutler and Miller (2005) showed that the development and application of water purification technologies was responsible for roughly 40% of the decline in the mortality rate from 1900 to 1940. Subsequent studies also found the similar improving effects of clean water both in European and in Asian countries (Macassa et al., 2006, Jaadla and Puur, 2016, Ogasawara and Matsushita, 2018, Peltola and Saaritsa, 2019).==== However, the recent study by Anderson et al. (2018) found more moderate impacts of water purification technology on crude and infant mortality rates than those shown by Cutler and Miller (2005). Brown and Guinnane (2018) also provided contradictory views on these improving effects of safe water in Bavaria between 1825 and 1910.====The present study seeks to contribute to this debate by adding new evidence on the improving effects of modern water-supply systems on the historical decline in the mortality rate. While a large number of previous studies have shown the instantaneous effects of clean water on mortality rates, we try to show the chain (i.e., persistent) effects of safe water on mortality rates by testing the Mills–Reincke phenomenon. The Mills–Reincke phenomenon is an epidemiological proposition arguing that the purification of polluted water could not only reduce deaths due to typhoid in the initial stage, but also those due to other infectious diseases in the later stage (Sedgwick and MacNutt, 1910, Evans, 1987). Epidemiological case studies have provided evidence of this phenomenon in large cities in France and the United States (Preston and van de Walle, 1978, Crimmins and Condran, 1983). Economic studies of this phenomenon are more scarce; however, the work by Ferrie and Troesken (2008) showed that for every death from typhoid fever prevented by water purification, three or more deaths from other causes were also prevented in Chicago from 1850 to 1925. While these studies have predominantly focused on the cases of a few large cities, this study is the first to use a more comprehensive dataset covering multiple cities in prewar Japan.====We find that eliminating typhoid fever infection decreased the risk of non-waterborne diseases. Our estimates show that for each additional death due to typhoid, there were approximately two deaths due to tuberculosis and pneumonia; this magnitude is indeed greater than that observed previously in Chicago (Ferrie and Troesken, 2008). The composition of the cause-specific deaths suggests that the national malady (====), especially tuberculosis, was more likely to be improved by the eradication of typhoid fever. This finding not only supports the evidence provided by Ferrie and Troesken but also adds more comprehensive evidence on the chain effects of clean water in industrializing Japan.====This study contributes to the broader literature in the following two ways. First, we complement the abovementioned discussion on the role of water purification technology in mitigating historical mortality declines (Anderson et al., 2018, Cutler and Miller, 2019). The results of this study indeed support the evidence provided by previous studies of the important role of clean-water technology (e.g., Alsan and Goldin, 2019). Second, we explore the validity of the Mills–Reincke phenomenon using comprehensive city-level mortality data from the early 20th century. Expanding Ferrie and Troesken's (2008) strategy to capture the mechanisms responsible for the appearance of the phenomenon, we find that the chain effects of clean water were still considered to be substantial.==== This study highlights the importance of investigating not only the instantaneous effects but also the subsequent chain effects of clean water when we discuss the impacts of the implementation of water purification systems on historical mortality declines.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of mortality rate trends in pre-war Japan, and also illustrates the features of the Mills–Reincke phenomenon.

These events were caused externally by the unprecedented structural shifts in the economy. This natural experiment provides an opportunity to estimate the causal effect of various labor market ==== on individual health and health-related behaviors. Propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimates using household survey data show that labor market shocks during the early transition had long-term negative effects on individual health. I also find an increased incidence of smoking and alcohol consumption as well as a higher risk of certain types of chronic health problems for the people affected by labor market shocks.","A number of studies have shown that negative labor market events may affect people’s health. Mostly job loss and unemployment have been shown to have a negative effect on individual health. During periods of deep economic crises or economy-wide structural shifts, such as the transition from a planned to market economy, people experience a wide range of external labor market shocks that are not limited to job loss. The case of the Russian transition to the market economy provides a unique natural experiment setting that allows for the estimation of the causal effect of labor market shocks on individual health, which is the purpose of this paper.====This study is not limited to job loss: I estimate the effect of several negative labor market events. Previous literature has examined the effect of economic changes on health and mortality indicators in transition mostly at the aggregate or regional levels (Walberg et al., 1998; Stillman, 2006). I use unique data on individual-level labor market shocks. In addition, previous studies mostly examined short-term effects while I estimate the long-term health effects that are observed 15 years after the start of transition. Another distinguishing feature of the paper is the use of a wide range of health indicators and health-related outcomes: self-assessed health (SAH) and the EQ-5D measure, the indicators of the occurrence of chronic diseases and cardiovascular problems, the incidence of smoking and alcohol consumption.====During the first years of transition in Russia, economic decline was dramatic. Gross domestic product declined by 40% during the first half of the 1990s. Unemployment increased from nonexistent to almost 10% in 1995. The structural shifts in the economy have led to a large-scale labor reallocation across sectors. Employment in the industry declined, while employment in the new sector of the economy – market services – surged. Approximately 42% of employed people permanently changed occupations between 1991 and 1998 (Sabirianova, 2002). Another specific feature of economic transition in Russia was the large-scale nonpayment of wages by enterprises to their workers (Earle and Sabirianova, 2009) and various forms of underemployment (reduced working time and unpaid leaves; see Gimpelson and Kapelyushnikov 2013), which forced many people to obtain additional jobs. Consequently, many employed people in Russia experienced negative labor market events caused by the turmoil of transition and fundamental structural changes in the economy. In this paper, I test the effects of four events: job loss due to plant closure or downsizing, occupational downshifting, the performance of additional work and salary cuts.====To estimate the health effects of labor market shocks, I use the data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, which is a household survey. In the main part of my analysis, I use data from the 2006 round of the survey. In the 2006 round of the survey, people were asked a number of questions concerning their labor market experiences during the transition, i.e., beginning in 1991. These data allow us to use a matching method to estimate the effect of labor market shocks. I assume that, conditional on observable individual characteristics at the start of transition, the treatment, i.e., labor market shock, was exogenous. The probability of the shock was related to the severity of economic decline in the sector of individual employment. In a supplementary analysis, I also use a subset of the panel data for 1994–2000 to estimate the difference-in-difference model.====Matching estimates are performed separately for men and women. The results show that labor market shocks had a negative long-term impact on overall individual health (both self-assessed health and the EQ-5D measure). In particular, job loss was more harmful for women’s health, additional work was more harmful for men’s health, while occupational downshifting was negatively related to the health of both groups. I find that certain labor market shocks increased the risk of cardiovascular diseases, heart attack and stroke, and chronic problems of the kidneys, gastrointestinal system and spine. Finally, labor market shocks are associated with higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption for both men and women. Importantly, the negative health effects found in his study are likely to be underestimated due to the fact that we do not observe people who did not survive until 2006 in our sample.====Two potential channels through which labor market shocks may affect individual health are income decline and psychological stress. Job loss and wage cuts or nonpayments result in a decline in income, which translates into worse health status through poorer nutrition and fewer resources for medical treatment. Using individual-level survey data, Stillman and Thomas (2008) showed that gross energy intake in Russia did not change much in response to household income fluctuations during the 1990s. However, the diet composition was affected by the income decline.====There are a number of ways in which labor market shocks in transition may induce psychological stress. In the planned economy, people had very stable employment, while the market transition has dramatically increased the level of uncertainty with respect to their labor market position and future earnings. Many people had to move to a less qualified job or into completely different occupations, which induced psychological stress due to the loss of human capital, in particular for older people==== . Job loss and occupational downshifting also resulted in a decline in social status and a loss of social networks for many people. Indeed, my analysis shows that people who experienced labor market shocks, in particular, job loss, report the decline of their position in relative income and power distributions. Medical literature shows a strong link between chronic psychological stress and cardiovascular diseases as well as increased smoking and alcohol consumption.====In addition to providing evidence on the social cost of economic transformations in terms of the decline in health of the working population, this paper contributes to the understanding of Russia’s mortality crisis. There was a sharp rise in both male and female mortality rates at the beginning of the economic transition in the early 1990s (Vichnevski, 1999). Life expectancy for men dropped from 65 years in 1988 to 58 in 1994; for women, it dropped from 75 to 72. The mortality increase was highest among the working-age population over 40, with the main medical cause of death being cardiovascular disease. This rise in mortality is still not fully understood.====Brainerd and Cutler (2005) empirically test a wide range of possible explanations and suggest two main explanations: broadly defined psychosocial distress from the transition (stress from increased uncertainty; higher risk of negative outcomes in the absence of a social security net) and an increase in alcohol consumption, which paralleled the rise in mortality. Denisova (2010), in her study of the causes of adult mortality during the transition, showed that both heavy drinking and smoking increased the risk of mortality by almost 60%. The role of labor market transformations during the transition in the mortality crisis is underexplored, although some studies indicate its importance==== . Massive labor reallocation, which is shown in this paper to have negative health effects and increased individual levels of smoking and alcohol consumption, is likely to have contributed to rising mortality in Russia in the early 1990s.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the main findings in the literature concerning the effect of various work-related events on health and the mechanisms behind these effects. Section 3 provides a discussion of labor reallocation during the transition and a description of data on individual labor market changes and indicators of health and health-related behaviors.

The reported impact varies across mothers’ socioeconomic status, with relatively poorer Chilean mothers being more vulnerable to earthquakes. A possible mechanism that explains these results could work through changes in the incidence of women with diabetes. We provide indirect evidence in this regard. Mothers with diabetes are more likely to have large-for-gestational-age babies. Exposure to earthquakes increases the incidence of diabetes among the affected population, with the observed impact on diabetes being relatively higher among women of lower socioeconomic status.","Poor health at birth has important implications for public health and socioeconomic issues. Preterm and low-birthweight infants (weight <2500, LBW hereafter) are prone to serious health problems that may impede their physical growth and cognitive development, as well as their accumulation of human capital and their prospects for future socioeconomic status (Lobel et al., 2000, Mancuso et al., 2004, Case et al., 2005, Johnson and Schoeni, 2011).====Scholars and policy makers are concerned about understanding the factors and the mechanisms that drive the impacts on birth outcomes. From a public health point of view, this first step is crucial to designing policy interventions that aim to reduce or prevent negative health consequences at birth. In this paper, we use exposure to earthquakes as a source of prenatal maternal stress. We study the effects of exposure to this stressor on birth outcomes in Chile over the period 2011–2015. We assess the impacts on fetal growth, in addition to the typical outcomes related to the length of gestation used in the literature (i.e., birth-weight, gestational length, LBW, an indicator of high birthweight, weight ≥4500 g, and preterm birth), and we also try to identify which group of mothers—and at what stage of pregnancy—is more vulnerable to the effects of earthquakes.====McEwen (2000) defines stress as a “real or interpreted threat to the physiological or psychological integrity of an individual that results in physiological and/or behavioral responses.” Medical research has consistently documented that prenatal maternal stress does affect birth outcomes of newborns, and this relationship applies to women from different cultures, nationalities, and social classes (Mulder et al., 2002, Dunkel-Schetter, 1998, Rice et al., 2010). The exposure to a stressor activates the system of stress regulation, which generates changes in the concentration of many hormones during stress and causes negative effects on the length of gestation and fetal growth and maturation (Lou et al., 1994, Mulder et al., 2002, Wadhwa et al., 2004, Wadhwa, 2005, Mancuso et al., 2004).====LBW babies include infants born preterm and newborns who suffered fetal growth restriction (Lee et al., 2013). Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a process by which a fetus fails to reach her/his growth potential. Indirect measures for fetal growth—namely, birth weight adjusted for length of gestation—are typically used in the medical literature. Small for gestational age (SGA) refers to a newborn with a birth weight lower than a predetermined threshold, and it is used to diagnose IUGR. A fetus may also suffer accelerated growth. Large for gestational age (LGA), which refers to birth weights higher than a predetermined cutoff value, is an indicator for this type of disorder. SGA and LGA are complex syndromes that affect different groups of infants and may have an important influence on them throughout their lives. In adulthood, SGA infants may be at elevated risk for hypertension, stroke, and metabolic diseases, among others health issues (Campbell et al., 2012), and LGA babies are at increased risk for hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and obesity in adolescence (Das and Sysyn, 2004).====How women respond to an identical stressful stimulus depends on their personal characteristics, genetic factors, and previous experience. Because the interaction of several factors may confound the impact of prenatal stress on birth outcomes, some researchers have exploited natural experiments to identify the causal relationship between exposure to unexpected negative shocks (i.e., man-made/natural disasters) and health at birth. Our work belongs to this strand of the literature. We use Chilean official birth records from 2011 to 2015, with information on newborns’ birth outcomes, as well as parents’ sociodemographic characteristics and information about mothers’ anonymized IDs and their comuna of residence.==== We also have information about whether a ==== was affected by an earthquake. We then combine this information with mothers’ ==== of residence to determine whether they were exposed to an earthquake, and at what moment during gestation the earthquake occurred. Our empirical strategy consists of using mothers’ anonymized IDs to construct a panel of mothers and compare the birth outcomes of siblings of the same mother who suffered different levels of exposure to earthquakes. This approach allows us to account for any mother's or family's time-invariant characteristics that could affect the estimates (Black et al., 2016).====We contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we provide accurate estimates of the causal link between exposure to earthquakes and birth outcomes. We use Currie and Rossin-Slater's (2013) instrumental variable approach, which corrects for the positive mechanical correlation of gestation length with the probability of exposure. On the other hand, we reduce the possibility that confounding factors, such as non-stress-related shocks, affect our results. Non-stress-related shocks, such as fatalities, increased pollution levels, economic losses, or resource shocks, were not reported for the vast majority of the earthquakes we consider in this analysis. Our findings show that exposure to earthquakes affects fetal growth. The effect varies greatly across socioeconomic statuses, with poor Chilean mothers being more vulnerable to exposure to earthquakes. Our results survive several robustness checks, such as endogeneity of maternal location, multiple hypothesis testing, and placebo effects.====Our second contribution is to discuss and provide indirect evidence of the mechanisms that could explain the varying effects on fetal growth across socioeconomic status. Exposure to earthquakes may affect birth outcomes through channels other than neuroendocrine changes. We first discuss two alternative explanations for the mechanisms that may drive the relationship between exposure to earthquakes and fetal growth, and then we assess whether these explanations vary across socioeconomic status.====The first hypothesis states that exposure to earthquakes may prompt health-enhancing behavior among pregnant women, which positively affects birth outcomes (see Torche and Villarreal, 2014). Our second hypothesis is that exposure to earthquakes may be responsible for increased rates of preeclampsia (Wadhwa, 2005) and diabetes; and infants born to mothers with preeclampsia and/or diabetes are more likely to be larger than other babies (Xiong et al., 2000). Roberts et al. (2015) show that women who were exposed to traumatic life events and exhibited post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a roughly twofold increased risk of type-2 diabetes compared to women without exposure to trauma.==== What does the literature say about stress effect of earthquakes? Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and so on. Some studies show a prevalence of PTSD, ranging from 5% to 60%. For instance, in Santiago, Chile, near 24% of women reported symptoms of this affliction related to the 1985 “Algarrobo” earthquake that struck the Central Chilean Zone (see Galea et al., 2005).==== In sum, we would expect that exposure to earthquakes increases the incidence of diabetes among affected women, which, in turn, could explain the observed effects on fetal growth. Our reported indirect evidence is in line with the stated mechanism.====The rest of the paper is organized as follow: In Section 2, we discuss the literature closely related to our work. In Section 3, we briefly describe the history of earthquakes in Chile. Section 4 describes the data; Section 5 presents our econometric approach and identification strategy; and Section 6 reports the results. In Section 7, we discuss some possible mechanisms that may drive the results, and in Section 8, we conclude.",Growing in the womb: The effect of seismic activity on fetal growth,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19300619,19 September 2019,2019,Research Article,106.0

This study investigates the impact of an unconditional CT policy on children’s education outcomes focusing on both the primary and secondary phases of education. We also examine the spillover effect of CT policy on parents’ employment. To identify these effects we focus on South Africa and exploit the changes in age eligibility requirements of the CT policy to build credible control and treatment groups based on birth cohort. Our results show that CT policy improves reading and writing abilities at both the primary (by 3.7% and 3.3% respectively) and ==== levels (by 10.2% and 10.1%, respectively) but it fosters school attendance only in secondary education. We also provide evidence that, for primary education students, the effects are only significant for boys. Notably, the positive effects of CT programs are also confirmed by the presence of spillover effects to other members of the family in our observance of increases in both mothers’ and fathers’ employment outcomes (by 35% and 34%, respectively). Therefore, in this paper we provide robust evidence that unconditional CT policy supports resilient development of the country’s population in several dimensions that go beyond the educational achievement of targeted children.","According to the recent South African Human Rights Commission report published in 2014, roughly 47% of children between the ages of 0–17 were living in poverty stricken households. This figure gives rise to serious grounds for concern especially if we take into account the evidence that links child poverty to poor educational attainment in the latter stages of adulthood (Almond and Currie, 2011; Le Thuc and Behrman, 2017). As in many other countries, the South African government tried to mitigate this significant problem by rolling out cash transfers (CT) to poor families, with the main goal of fostering the development of young children.====These types of programs are generally introduced as a result of theoretical evidence that household income is the strongest predictor of children’s educational attainment (Barrow and Schanzenbach, 2012). On the other hand, some scholars do not support this view and claim that CT programs are not an effective policy to foster children’s development. As hinted by Handa et al. (2017), there are perceptions that CTs are mere ‘hand-outs’ which create dependency on the state and discourage parents from seeking employment.====In South Africa, despite the popularity of CT policy to poor households, there is no study that has analyzed their impact, neither for the targeted children nor for the rest of the family members. Even a recent review article on CT programs shows no evidence of such analyses being done in the South African context (Harman et al., 2016). Therefore, our aim in this paper is to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the impact of a large CT program in South Africa on children’s educational outcomes as well as on potential spillover effects on their parents’ employment outcomes.====Although many studies have analysed the impacts of CT on several outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, none of the papers focus on outcomes for both children (in terms of educational achievement) as well as for parents (in terms of employment). For example, CT policy in Colombia has been associated with improvement in labour participation rate, employment, and job search for parents who received the grant (Barrientos and Villa, 2013). A similar outcome is reported in Uganda where CT was associated with increases in female earnings due to the rise in microenterprise ownership and income (Blattman et al., 2015). However, in these cited studies, it remains to be seen whether CT improves both parent employment and children educational outcomes concurrently. Thus, there is a need in the literature to investigate this intersection (Bastagli et al., 2016).====In this paper we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What impact does unconditional CT exert on the ability to read and write, as well as on school attendance in both the primary and secondary phases of education? (2) Is the CT program inducing a substitution effect and discouraging/encouraging parents’ employment? (3) Lastly, are there gender-based differences in the impact of CT policy? We believe that answering these interrelated questions represents a key element to promote the understanding of the ways in which unconditional CT policy can foster the achievement of multiple development goals.====To identify the effects, we exploit several extensions in the age eligibility threshold of the program in order to obtain clearly defined treatment and control groups based on the birth cohort of the children. We use large and recently released labour force and household surveys from Statistic South Africa which contain information on both children’s educational outcomes as well as parents’ employment and CT program receipts. Our results show that CT policy improves reading and writing abilities at both the primary and secondary education levels but it only encourages school attendance in secondary education.====We also provide evidence that, for primary education students, the effects are only significant for boys. Notably, the positive effects of CT programs also foster spillover effects to other members of the family as we document increases in both mothers’ and fathers’ employment outcomes. Thus, even if the main aim of the CT policy was not promoting the labor market integration of the parents, this presents an important spillover effect of the policy as it has been widely documented that parents with better employment will very likely have a positive impact on children’s wellbeing. In light of these positive outcomes, we conclude that unconditional CT policy supports resilient development of the country’s population in several dimensions that go beyond the educational achievement of the targeted children.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section two gives an overview of the literature. Section three discusses the history and characteristic of the CT program in South Africa.

Using data from ====, a large ==== from the northern Netherlands, I show that the probability of CD for male babies increases when unemployment levels rise. This result suggests that maternal stress might be one of the mechanisms how early life economic conditions affect health.","A growing body of research supports the Barker’s hypothesis (Barker, 1995), that adverse economic conditions around the time of birth have a negative effect on a variety of health outcomes over the lifetime (Alessie et al., 2018, 2019; Olafsson, 2016; Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004; Case et al., 2005; Case and Paxson, 2010; Van den Berg et al., 2006, Van den Berg et al., 2009, Van den Berg et al., 2011 and 2013; Angelini and Mierau, 2014). The studies exploring the mechanisms behind these effects suggest malnutrition, changes in cohort composition and health behaviors of the parents as potential explanations of the effects (e.g. Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004; van den Berg et al., 2006, 2009, 2011). In addition, some recent findings suggest that stress caused by economic problems might have direct health effects on pregnant women and fetuses (Alessie et al., 2018; Olafsson, 2016; Bruckner et al., 2014). To test this economic stress hypothesis, Bruckner et al. (2014) investigate the relationship between business cycles and the number of cesarean deliveries (CD) by a time series analysis using data on the monthly count of male CD in California from 1989 to 2007 and total state employment. They find that male CD increases above its expected value when employment declines, as male fetuses are more sensitive to adverse conditions ====.====This paper also examines whether stress caused by economic downturns affects the pregnant women severely enough to increase the probability of Cesarean Deliveries (CD) for male babies. My paper adds to the findings of Bruckner et al. (2014) and the related literature in several ways.====First, similarly to Bruckner et al. (2014), this paper provides evidence on the importance of stress as a transition mechanism between ambient economic conditions early in life and health outcomes. The literature provides ample evidence that macro-economic conditions may prove stressful enough to affect health and behavior. Responses to economic downturns include stressful economic (e.g., job loss, difficulty paying bills) and noneconomic (e.g., family problems, change of residence) life events. Additionally, following economic downturns, mental health and self-reported health, reportedly, worsens even among those who do not lose jobs (Ferrie et al., 1995; Vahtera et al., 1997). Likewise, reductions in cognitive ability and ability to perform simple daily tasks have been observed in individuals facing financial pressures (Andreoni et al., 2017; Mani et al., 2013). In sum, this suggests that economic downturns may lead to substantial maternal stress. In turn, biologically, feeling stressed may increase corticosteroid production in pregnant mothers and this can cause non-reassuring fetal heart rate or “fetal distress” (Owen and Matthews, 2003; Matthews et al., 2002). Following obstetric care guidelines, a physician who observes fetal distress during pregnancy or labor may decide to perform a CD (Bruckner et al., 2014; Hendrix and Chauhan, 2005).====Second, this study adds to the growing evidence on gender specific health effects of early life conditions. Reportedly, male fetuses greater than 20 weeks of gestation react more sensitively than female fetuses to maternal corticosteroids (Owen and Matthews, 2003; Matthews et al., 2002; Van den Berg and Modin, 2013; Catalano et al., 2005 and 2010). In a related line of literature, evidence from California, Sweden, and Germany shows that the secondary sex ratio (e.g. the ratio of male live births vs. female live births) falls following declines in the economy (Catalano, 2003; Catalano and Bruckner, 2005; Catalano et al., 2010; Almond and Mazumder, 2011). If stress has a similar effect on the risk of male fetal loss as on the risk of fetal compromise, then, following stressful events, CD in male fetuses may increase more than in female fetuses.====Third, I use individual level data containing information on the date and manner of birth from a large-scale cohort study from the Northern Netherlands, called ====. This has two advantages compared to the aggregate approach of Bruckner et al. (2014). Most importantly, it allows me to increase the precision of the estimates by using a sample of individuals born only in the weekends or holidays. Since CDs caused by fetal distress in reaction to maternal stress cannot be planned beforehand, this paper considers only the effect of unemployment level on unplanned CD. By design, Bruckner et al. (2014) are not able to distinguish between unplanned and planned CD in their data, which means that a large part of the observed CDs are driven by factors other than stress.==== This may lead to underestimation of the effect and large standard errors. To address this issue, I exploit the fact that a planned CD in the Netherlands is routinely scheduled during regular working hours, e.g. on weekdays. Hence, I select a subsample of individuals who are born in the weekends and Dutch public holidays, which lets me exclude the planned CDs from the analysis and, possibly, obtain estimates that are more precise.====Another advantage of the individual level data is that it lets me investigate if the results are driven by selective fertility. Previous literature has shown that the relationship between unemployment rates and infant health can partially be explained by changes in cohort composition or health-related behaviors (e.g. Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004; Alessie et al., 2018). Since socio-economic gradient has been found in CD probabilities in the Netherlands (Westert et al., 2003), it is conceivable that the relationship between unemployment rates and the probability of CD might also be driven by changes in the cohort composition of the pregnant women. I exploit the parental information available in the ====, namely the mother’s age and smoking status during pregnancy, as well as parental immigrant status to provide suggestive evidence that my results are not driven by selective fertility during economic downturns.====Finally, Netherlands might be a particularly interesting country for investigating the effects of maternal stress due to its distinctive institutional setting. The Dutch obstetrical care system is unique in that it is characterized by a well-defined distribution between primary and secondary care, which results in low CD rates overall==== (Amelink-Verburg and Buitendijk, 2010). In general, since CD is costlier than a vaginal delivery, the medical specialists and hospitals might respond to financial incentives and recommend more CDs when facing financial pressures, for example, during recessions. However, the delivery guidelines in the Netherlands limit the opportunities for supplier-induced demand or delivery on demand. Another institutional feature of the Netherlands is its generous unemployment insurance that limits the effects of job loss on income and consumption of pregnant women.====The rest of this paper is set up as follows. In the following section, I present the data. Section 3 describes my empirical strategy and methods. In Section 4, I present and discuss the results, and the final section concludes.",Do Cesarean Delivery rates rise when the economy declines?

For this purpose, we use five waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset and construct a health deficit index for 21 European countries. Results from log-linear regressions suggest that, on average, elderly European men age faster when they were born in spring and summer (compared to autumn). At any given age, they have developed about 3.5 percent more health deficits. These differences due to seasons of birth are not mediated by body height and education. In a subsample of Southern European countries, where the seasonal variation of sunlight is smaller, the birth season plays an insignificant role for health in old age. In a subsample of Northern countries, in contrast, the season of birth coefficients increase. At any given age, elderly Northern European men born in spring have developed, on average, 8.7 percent more health deficits than those born in autumn. In non-linear regressions we find that the speed of aging is also associated with the birth season.","The last decades of epidemiological research have provided mounting evidence that environmental conditions early in life, particularly during the gestation period, have a significant impact on the development of diseases later in life (for literature surveys, see Barker, 2004, Vaiserman, 2014, Langley-Evans, 2015). While the earlier studies focused on cardiovascular diseases (Barker, 1992, Barker, 1995) there is now evidence of “fetal origins” of a wide spectrum of chronic and aging-related diseases, ranging from severe conditions like type-2 diabetes, cancer, and osteoporosis (Calkins and Devaskar, 2011) to relatively mild markers of aging like grip strength, skin thickness, and hearing impairment (Sayer et al., 1998). More recent studies have started using as an identification strategy “natural shocks” like hurricanes (Sotomayor, 2013), conflict (Bundervoet and Fransen, 2018) or influenza spread (Ogasawara, 2018) to study the “fetal origins” hypothesis on different outcomes.====A natural way to test the fetal origins hypothesis is to investigate the impact of exposure to shocks in utero on late life outcomes, a literature with an increasing contribution by economists (for surveys, see Almond and Currie, 2011, Almond et al., 2018). A particularly mild “shock” is the time of birth itself, which may, for example, affect fetal development through access to nutrition like fresh fruits and vegetables or the exposure to sunlight and UV-B radiation. The seminal study in this regard is Doblhammer and Vaupel (2001) who show that in Austria and Denmark, individuals born in autumn live longer than those born in spring, while it is the other way round for individuals born in Australia. Since then, individual country studies for Germany, Greece, Sweden, and Ukraine found similar patterns with higher age at death (lowest mortality) for individuals born October to December and lowest age at death (highest mortality) for those born April to May (Vaiserman et al., 2002, Lerchl, 2004, Flouris et al., 2009, Ueda et al., 2013).====The prevalence of certain diseases such as diabetes (McKinney, 2001), cardiovascular diseases (Tornhammar et al., 2014), Alzheimer's disease (Philpot et al., 1989), and immune-mediated diseases (Disanto et al., 2012) has also been shown to be associated with the season of birth. Here, we contribute to this literature by investigating how the season of birth is related to an aggregate, encompassing measure of health and aging, the health deficit index. In contrast to most of the available literature on cross-sections in specific countries, we investigate elderly individuals from a panel of countries observed over time (in up to 5 waves). This allows us to focus on the aging process, understood as the accumulation of new health deficits, and to control for country- and year-of-birth fixed effects.====We follow Mitnitski et al., 2001, Mitnitski et al., 2002 and quantify health and aging by using a health deficit index (a frailty index). This index counts the number of health deficits that a person has at a given age relative to the number of potential health deficits. Health deficits include serious disabilities as well as mild illnesses. The specific choice of deficits is not crucial provided that sufficiently many indicators are present in the index (see Rockwood and Mitnitski, 2006, Rockwood and Mitnitski, 2007 for methodological background). The seminal paper by Mitnitski et al. (2002) has generated a significant amount of new research with hundreds of studies applying the methodology.====Measuring aging by the health deficit index has a micro-foundation in the reliability theory of aging. Specifically, it has been shown that organisms constructed in parallel from non-aging elements age according to the Gompertz-law of mortality when the number of initially non-functioning elements follow a Poisson distribution (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 1991). This theory of aging predicts that small endowment differences early in life (in utero) are preserved and amplified over the lifetime and affect late-life health and mortality (Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 2004). A recent study uses network theory to explain human aging and provides a microfounded explanation for why an ==== health deficit index provides an accurate measure of aging and mortality (Mitnitski et al., 2017).====In health economics, it has been criticized that the standard model of health capital accumulation (Grossman, 1972) predicts that health differences in early life are depreciated away and play asymptotically no role in late-life health outcomes (Almond and Currie, 2011). The standard model of health deficit accumulation, in contrast, is capable of explaining fetal origins of adult diseases (Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014, Dalgaard et al., 2017).====In this study, we document a strong and significant relationship between the season of birth and aging (health deficit accumulation) for elderly European men but not for women. In accordance with most country studies on specific diseases or mortality, men born in spring or summer, at any given age above 55, have accumulated more health deficits than those born in autumn or winter. While we do not consider the causes of this variation, our results are consistent with the notion that mothers of children conceived in summer or autumn had less access to fresh fruits and vegetables and less exposure to (vitamin-D-generating) UV-B radiation during critical gestation periods in the winter months (Doblhammer and Vaupel, 2001, Disanto et al., 2012).====The average size of the season of birth coefficient (of about 3.5 percent more health deficits at any given age above 50) could be regarded as small compared to studies using more severe early-life shocks like exposure to war or famine (Kesternich et al., 2014, Kesternich et al., 2015, Halmdienst and Winter-Ebmer, 2014; Akbulut-Yuksel, 2017). This, however, can be expected from relatively mild changes of environmental conditions like seasonal variation in the availability of fresh fruits and UV-B radiation. Interestingly, the season of birth plays an insignificant role in a subsample of Southern European countries where seasonal variation of sunlight is smaller. In a subsample of Northern countries, in contrast, the seasonal coefficient gets much larger. We find that Northern European men born in spring have accumulated, on average, about 8.7 percent more health deficits at any given age. In non-linear regressions, we find that the seasonal coefficient increases from 3 percent at age 50 to 15 percent at age 90, suggesting that the speed of aging itself is associated with the season of birth.====The result that only male health and aging show a statistically significant negative correlation with certain seasons of birth is consistent with the finding of larger season-of-birth effects for men on life expectancy (Doblhammer and Vaupel, 2001, Lerchl, 2004) and on adult body size (Krenz-Niedbala et al., 2011) and with the general notion that males are more responsive to adverse environmental conditions in early life (Stinson, 1985). As a potential explanation, it has been proposed that boys grow faster than girls in the womb such that the size of the placenta relative to body size of the newborn is smaller for boys and thus provides less protection against nutritional shocks experienced by the mother (Eriksson et al., 2010).","Season of birth, health and aging",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X18302739,22 August 2019,2019,Research Article,109.0

However, the impact of reduced fertility on female empowerment could be heterogeneous and differ by regions. In this paper, using a Family Planning Program in Bangladesh as an instrument for fertility, I find that lower fertility gives women access to economic resources and control over their practice of clothing and greater physical mobility. I also find that there is a trade-off in female autonomy resulting from reduced fertility. In developing countries, where the women’s position in the marriage is weak, lower fertility reduces the decision making power of the women and curtails their property rights.","Economists have long studied the link between fertility and empowerment of women. Empowerment of women can result in lower fertility (Dyson and Moore, 1983; Rasul, 2008), and at the same time, a reduction in fertility can influence different dimensions of female empowerment (Duflo, 2012). Increased autonomy of women has helped reduce fertility and child mortality in Bangladesh (Eswaran, 2002; Anderson and Eswaran, 2009), Malaysia (Rasul, 2008) and in South Africa (Hogan, 1999). Studies from the USA show that women’s control over fertility helped increase their years of education (Goldin and Katz, 2002). However, a study from Bangladesh shows that when family planning services are accessible only through marriage, women’s bargaining power, one of the indicators of female autonomy, can actually decline as a result of lower fertility (Peters, 2011). There is hardly any evidence of positive impacts of lower fertility on female empowerment in developing countries and one may therefore, ask, is lower fertility detrimental to female empowerment in developing countries? Or, does it indicate that the impact of reduced fertility on female empowerment can be heterogeneous and vary across regions? In this paper, I find that there are mixed effects of reduced fertility on female autonomy in a developing country. On one hand lower fertility reduces the decision making power of women and curtails their property rights but on the other hand, it gives them more mobility, greater access to economic resources and higher control over their practice of head covering.====Generally speaking, empowerment is a process by which those who are denied the ability to make choices improve such ability. Duflo (2012) defines women empowerment as their ability to access different components of development – “health, education, earning opportunities, rights and political participation”. For women in a developing country, who generally play a subservient role to men in almost all spheres of life, empowerment means primarily more bargaining power within the households and greater flexibility outside. The empowered women will have enhanced decision making power, greater mobility, secured property rights, greater participation in life both inside and outside the household.====There has been a large literature on how to promote female empowerment. The effects of education and credit programs on women’s empowerment have been widely explored (Hashemi and Schuler, 1993; Rahman and Rao, 2004; Pitt et al., 1999). Hashemi et al., 1996 find that women members of Microfinance Institutions (MFI) had greater physical mobility, a stronger role in the household and higher participation in community activities. But Goetz and Gupta (1996) find that credit alone is not sufficient to improve women’s status in rural Bangladesh where they hardly have any control over the fund (Pitt et al., 2006). In many cases it leads to increased tension within the household and more domestic violence (Rahman, 1999; Koenig et al., 2003).==== Kuenning et al., 2012 find that providing literacy camps, adult education classes and vocational training to women can increase their mobility, political participation and access to employment.==== In South Africa, electrification increased female employment by 9.5% (Dinkelman, 2010)====A reduction in fertility can also help to empower women both directly and indirectly. It reduces maternal mortality rates, which may increase parents’ investment in girls’ education as they expect their girls to live longer (Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney, 2009). Hatton et al. (2018) find that lower fertility increases the height of children, and there are studies that show that height influences earnings of both males and females (Lang and Nystedt, 2018; Lundborg et al., 2014; Case et al., 2009; Case and Paxson, 2008; Persico et al., 2004). In the United States, the availability of pills to young unmarried women increased their age at marriage and years of education in the 1960s (Goldin and Katz, 2002) and their labor market participation (Bailey, 2006; 2013). The more direct effect of reduced fertility on women’s empowerment comes through freeing up their time. Child rearing is primarily a mother’s job in most of the developed and developing world. Women spend 70 percent more time for child care in Sweden to ten times more in Iraq (Berniell and Sanchez-Paramo, 2011). A reduction in fertility will release a huge amount of time and energy that the mother spends in bearing and rearing a child. She can then utilize these resources to some other productive activities which will increase her income/wealth and empower her. This will change her status within the family and change her private consumption and welfare.====However, the directions of these changes in different dimensions of empowerment may depend on a woman’s relative bargaining power within the household. In a society where the bargaining power within marriage is highly biased towards husbands, a reduction in fertility may affect some dimensions of women’s empowerment in a positive way and some others in a negative way. Peters (2011) shows that reduced fertility makes women less empowered by reducing their decision making power within the household.==== Decision making power is only one dimension of empowerment, and there could be positive or negative effects of lower fertility of other dimensions. In this paper I show that when fertility declines, women enjoy greater mobility and higher access to economic resources which eventually lead them to be less sexually segregated. However, in a patriarchal society, where the distribution of the marital surplus is biased towards the husbands and the women’s position in the marriage is weak, the husbands may take away some of the newly generated surplus by curtailing their decision making power (as is shown in Peters, 2011) within the households. The husbands may also take their assets and savings against their will. As a result, the women’s property rights may decline.====This paper estimates the effects of lower fertility on different dimensions of female empowerment using an experimental Family Planning Program (FPP) implemented by the International Centre for Diarrhea Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) in an area called ==== which reduced the average fertility rate in the program areas compared to that in the control areas by 33%, as an instrument for fertility.==== The results show that a unit reduction in fertility increases women’s mobility, access to economic resources and decreases the practice of head covering. At the same time it reduces their decision making power and property rights. The paper also finds that reduced fertility has heterogeneous effects on female empowerment. Educated women have lower fertility and higher empowerment compared to the uneducated women.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next sectiondescribes the data and the estimation strategy. Section 3 presents the results. Robustness of the instrument and the identification strategy is discussed in section 4. Finally, section 5 draws concluding remarks.",Does lower fertility empower women?
