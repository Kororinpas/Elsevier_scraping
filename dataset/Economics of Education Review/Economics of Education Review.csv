In most countries, entitlement to regular UI hinges on completing a qualifying period of work and social contributions. In Belgium, this requirement also exists but is relaxed for education-leavers in that they can substitute time actively searching for a job for employment during the qualifying period. We evaluate the impact on degree completion and dropout of a 2015 reform that withdrew this weaker requirement from graduates aged 25 or over and from high school dropouts younger than 21. We find that the reform significantly increased degree completion and reduced dropout for students in higher education but not for those in high school. We argue that the higher prevalence of behavioral biases among the lower-educated could explain these contrasting findings.","In most countries, entitlement to regular unemployment insurance (UI) hinges on having completed a qualifying period of work and having made social contributions before the claim.==== A consequence is that youths who do not acquire sufficient work experience after leaving education cannot claim unemployment benefits (UB). They then either remain financially dependent on their parents or are sustained by means-tested welfare benefits. This financial hardship during the qualifying period before UI eligibility incentivizes youths to search harder for a job and to accept job offers more quickly. An abundant literature has studied these effects of UI generosity on work incentives.==== However, the anticipation of financial constraints could also affect human capital investment decisions. On the one hand, it could incentivize youths to invest in education because this shields them from the risk of unemployment during the qualifying period (Kesselman, 1976; Moffitt, 2002). On the other hand, there is substantial evidence that adolescents are present-biased and have difficulty taking future awards into account when making decisions (Lavecchia et al., 2014). Thus, there remains an empirical question of whether the prospect of tighter eligibility conditions for UI effectively changes the educational choices of youths. There has been remarkably little research on this question. This is surprising because the answer may have important consequences for the optimal design of UI. We provide empirical evidence based on a reform of a specific UI scheme for education-leavers in Belgium.====In Belgium, to be eligible for regular UI individuals must have worked full time for 12 months within the last 21 months. However, education-leavers can claim UI under weaker conditions. They may substitute an active job search or part-time employment for full-time employment during the 12-month qualifying period. This is the so-called “activation allowance” financed by social security contributions from salaried employment, as are the regular UB. Periods of inactivity extend the qualifying period. Similar schemes exist in Denmark and Luxembourg, and in Sweden until 2007, but such schemes are the exception rather than the rule (OECD, 2011).====In 2015, the Belgian government tightened the eligibility requirements for this more lenient UI for education-leavers. Youths aged 25 or over when submitting a benefit claim, as well as high-school dropouts younger than 21, were no longer entitled to the activation allowance. They could therefore only claim UI if they complied with the stricter qualifying conditions of the regular UI scheme. The 2015 reform induced exogenous variation in eligibility requirements by age and educational attainment. We exploit these in a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach to study the impact of tightening the eligibility conditions for UI on degree completion and dropout by students still in education. By being targeted at two different age groups, those 25 or older and those younger than 21, the reform allows us to estimate the behavioral reactions for students at two different levels of education, i.e., college/university and high school.====Our main findings can be summarized as follows. Tightening the eligibility requirements for UI significantly increased the rate of degree completion of Belgian students in higher education by 2.8 percentage points (pp) and reduced dropout by 1.1 pp. By contrast, we did not find any evidence that the stricter eligibility conditions for UI enhanced high school graduation or reduced high school dropout. In Belgium, each language community (Flemish or French) manages education with full autonomy, and we cannot reject the hypothesis that the reported effects of the 2015 reform are similar between these communities.====The existing empirical literature has mainly investigated whether programs that make work more rewarding hurt educational investment and not whether stricter eligibility criteria for social benefits can enhance educational attainment. Keane and Wolpin (2000), Riddell and Riddell (2014), and Blundell et al. (2016) provide causal evidence that financially rewarding work lowers educational attainment. Keane and Wolpin (2000) estimate a structural dynamic model of schooling, work, and occupational choice decisions over the life cycle. They show that introducing wage subsidies in the U.S. would reduce the returns to education and, therefore, completed schooling levels. Blundell et al. (2016) build on this model to study the consequences of the introduction of tax credits for lone-mother welfare recipients on labor supply and human capital accumulation over the life cycle in the UK. They find that tax credits increase labor supply and reduce the post-compulsory educational attainment of young women. Riddell and Riddell (2014) studied the impact of an activation program for welfare recipients on educational attainment. The program provided a generous earnings supplement paid out to long-term welfare recipients in case they returned to full-time employment. Based on a randomized controlled trial, this study found firm evidence that the supplement reduced the likelihood of educational upgrading at all levels, from high school completion to enrollment in higher education. This led to the conclusion that “work-first” policies reduce educational activity and may have adverse consequences on the long-run earnings capacity of welfare recipients.====To the best of our knowledge, there is no research regarding the prediction that tightening the eligibility conditions for UI increases the returns to education. Most closely related to our research are the studies of Hernaes et al. (2017) and Cammeraat et al. (2022), which evaluate how stricter eligibility requirements for means-tested welfare benefits affect schooling outcomes.==== Hernaes et al. (2017) find that imposing stricter eligibility criteria in the form of activation and work requirements for recipients of social assistance enhances degree completion and decreases dropout in secondary education in Norway.==== They also show that these favorable effects persist by contributing to higher educational attainment, higher labor earnings, and lower transfer dependency at age 25. By contrast, Cammeraat et al. (2022) report that the introduction of a mandatory activation program for young welfare-benefit recipients in the Netherlands did not significantly affect enrollment in higher education for youths aged 25 and 26. They argue that the fact that this policy reform was introduced at the start of the Great Recession explains this null effect.====Imposing stricter eligibility conditions on UI is expected to have a different impact on educational attainment than similar initiatives for social assistance because of the distinct (i) nature of these schemes, (ii) timing of the qualifying activity, and because (iii) it induces a behavioral reaction in a different subpopulation. First, after the 2015 reform in Belgium, targeted education-leavers could no longer substitute job-search efforts for full-time employment to qualify for UI. This imposes a very different type of activity requirement than the social assistance schemes studied by Hernaes et al. (2017) and Cammeraat et al. (2022) in that employment is an activity that an individual cannot perfectly control. Finding a job and keeping it does not only depend on individual effort. It also partly hinges on the chances of being offered a job and of being retained in it. This distinction resembles the difference between assigning financial incentives (rewards or losses) to inputs (effort for an activity) or outputs (such as employment). There is evidence from behavioral education economics that financial incentives for educational inputs, such as reading a book or good behavior, are more effective than incentives for educational outputs (Fryer, 2011; Gneezy et al., 2011).====A second reason why we expect a different reaction to the stricter eligibility conditions in this UI scheme than for social assistance is that the financial reward of complying, i.e., the entitlement to UI, does not materialize immediately after leaving school, but rather only after the qualifying period of one year. Numerous studies in behavioral economics have found that adolescents tend to be present-biased and have difficulty taking future awards into account when making decisions (see Lavecchia et al. 2014, Koch et al. 2015, Levitt, List, Neckermann, & Sadoff, 2016, for example). The delay in the financial reward may therefore decrease its power to trigger behavioral reactions. Moreover, this literature suggests that more able and higher-educated individuals are less present-biased than lower-educated ones (Becker & Mulligan, 1997; Sutter et al., 2013; Golsteyn et al., 2014; Lavecchia et al. 2014). We therefore expect that the reduced behavioral response to postponing this reward matters less for highly educated youths compared to low-educated youths. This prediction is supported by the studies of Leuven et al. (2010) and Bettinger (2011), who find that the provision of delayed financial incentives leads to higher academic achievements for higher-ability students only.====A third reason why we expect a different reaction from the Belgian UI reform is that the target populations are different. The reform particularly affects youths who expect to lose entitlement to the UI benefit for education-leavers. This excludes youths who expect to be eligible for means-tested social assistance, the target groups studied by Hernaes et al. (2017) in Norway and Cammeraat et al. (2022) in the Netherlands. To the extent that lower-educated youths are more likely eligible for means-tested welfare benefits, this, together with the arguments discussed in (i) and (ii), could explain the strong behavioral reaction uncovered for high school students in Norway and the absence of an effect on enrollment in higher education in the Netherlands. This is also consistent with our finding that the 2015 UI reform in Belgium only induced a behavioral reaction in students in higher education and not those in high school. An additional explanation for the stronger reaction of higher-educated youths in response to the UI reform is that job seekers with a high underlying job-finding rate tend to be overly pessimistic about their employment chances, whereas job seekers with a low job-finding rate are over-optimistic (Mueller et al. 2021). The higher-educated would therefore overreact relative to their risk of being unemployed after the qualifying period of one year.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the institutional context and the UI reform that may have affected the behavior of students in secondary and higher education. Section 3 discusses the methodology and expected effects of the reform for the different treatment groups. Section 4 describes the data, and Section 5 presents the results. The last section provides some concluding remarks.",Tightening eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits.

While highest track enrollment increases for previously ineligible high-SES students relative to comparable low-SES students, the SES gap does not increase. This is because previously eligible low-SES student become more likely to enroll in the highest track. A key mechanism for this response appears to be lower preferences for the intermediate track due to concerns about the inflow of mostly low-achieving and low-SES students from the lowest track after the repeal.","Most OECD countries sort students into hierarchically ordered secondary school types which provide access to different postsecondary schooling and occupational career paths (e.g., access to university) (OECD, 2013). In these between-school tracking systems, students from more disadvantaged families often attend less demanding school types (henceforth tracks) compared to children from more advantaged backgrounds with similar measures of prior academic achievement.==== These social differences in higher track attendance potentially reinforce educational inequality and prevent social mobility.====Track admission rules could play an important role in these observed educational inequalities. A key policy question is whether admission to more demanding tracks should be conditional on prior achievement or unrestricted. Due to potential social differences in educational aspirations, a common concern with free track choice is a widening of the gap in higher track attendance by socio-economic status (SES)====: higher-SES parents might be more likely to choose a higher track for their child, irrespective of ability, relative to lower-SES parents when admission is not conditional on prior achievement.====This paper addresses this concern by studying whether introducing free track choice makes track decisions more dependent on social background. The context is Germany’s early between-school tracking system, where children as young as 10 years old are sorted into different hierarchically ordered school tracks at the end of primary school. Specifically, I investigate the effects of abolishing binding track recommendations on track decisions. Binding track recommendations are based on student performance in the last grade of primary school and put an upper limit on track choice—students cannot attend a higher track than recommended but can always enroll in lower tracks.====The first part begins with a case study of the federal state Baden-Württemberg which repealed binding track recommendations in 2012. The cohort transitioning to secondary school in that year was the first free to choose between the basic, intermediate, and academic track, regardless of the type of track recommendation. Based on county-level data for the universe of track transitions in Baden-Württemberg, I document that transitions into the highest (academic) school track evolve smoothly prior to the repeal. When the repeal goes into effect, transitions into the academic track increase sharply and by roughly the same proportion across counties with very different average SES (as measured by the share of the adult population that holds an academic track qualification). In other words, free track choice did not widen the gap in academic track enrollment between higher- and lower-SES counties. However, this result masks disparate responses across counties at the two margins that students might find themselves at: students ==== an academic track recommendation – who would have been ineligible prior to the repeal – are much more likely to enroll in the academic track after the repeal in higher-SES counties compared to lower-SES counties. But this does not increase the academic track enrollment gap because students in lower-SES counties ==== a recommendation for the academic track – who were already eligible pre-repeal but often enrolled in the intermediate track instead – become more likely to comply with an academic track recommendation.====I replicate these results using student-level data from the National Assessment Study (NAS), which surveyed state-representative samples of around 25,000 fourth grade students, as well as their parents and teachers, across all German federal states in 2011 (pre-repeal) and 2016 (post-repeal). This allows to include the federal state Saxony-Anhalt in the analysis, which also repealed binding track recommendations in 2012. I draw on other federal states, which did not change track admission rules, as a comparison group in a difference-in-differences design (DiD). Thus, I identify the effect of repealing binding track recommendations from relative changes between repeal and no-repeal states, pre- and post-repeal. Classifying students as high- and low-SES by whether or not they have at least one parent with an academic track qualification, I again find that the SES gap in academic track enrollment does not widen after the repeal. Looking at transitions conditional on track recommendations reveals similar patterns as the county-level analysis: high-SES students without an academic track recommendation are 19.4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to enroll in the academic track after the repeal, while low-SES students without an academic track recommendation increase their academic track enrollment only by 7.8 p.p. At the other margin, low-SES students with an academic track recommendation become 12.3 p.p. more likely to enroll in the academic track after the repeal. There is no corresponding change for high-SES students. Tracing out effects across the achievement distribution (measured by standardized test scores) confirms the asymmetry in responses across SES: low-achieving, high-SES students increase their academic track enrollment relative to comparable low-SES students. The reverse is true for average achieving, low-SES students relative to comparable high-SES students.====The second part explores potential mechanisms for the surprising finding that low-SES students with an academic track recommendation increasingly enroll in the academic track after the repeal despite the fact that their choice set did not expand. There is no evidence that this effect results from compositional changes. For instance, due to low-SES students becoming relatively less disadvantaged over time, or positive selection into the group of students with an academic track recommendation as a result of stricter grading requirements after the repeal. The effect is also not mechanical because of intermediate track schools becoming oversubscribed after the repeal. This supports a behavioral response interpretation: low-SES students who would not choose the academic track, despite being eligible, when track choice is restricted, do so when track choice is free.====Further analyses suggest that this response to free track choice is, to a large extent, the result of concerns about the inflow of previously ineligible students into the intermediate track. Evidence for this explanation comes from the finding that responses differ by whether or not free track choice is predicted to result in increased intermediate track enrollment of students with only a basic track recommendation. Specifically, I show that in settings where the basic and intermediate track are combined within a single comprehensive track (i.e. where a shift of students from the basic into the intermediate track is ruled out), free track choice has no or only a small effect on low-SES students’ compliance with academic track recommendations.====This study is related to several strands of literature. The first comprises research on factors affecting educational decisions and socio-economic gaps in educational attainment. Most economic research in this area has looked at college enrollment decisions and degree completion (e.g., Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). In between-school tracking systems, where postsecondary education opportunities strongly depend on the secondary school track, consequential schooling decisions are made relatively earlier and to a much larger extent by parents. The theoretical literature on SES gaps in schooling decisions has emphasized the importance of educational aspirations in these contexts (Dalton et al., 2016, Genicot and Ray, 2017, Mookherjee et al., 2008). My contribution to this literature is twofold. First, the finding that academic track enrollment of previously ineligible students rises relatively more for high-SES compared to low-SES students under free track choice, provides causal revealed preference evidence for the role of social differences in educational aspirations as an explanation for educational attainment differences. Second, my results contribute to the literature by drawing attention to the malleability of disadvantaged households’ schooling decisions. Low-SES students’ increased compliance with academic track recommendations due to concerns about an inflow of low-achieving students into the intermediate track suggests the sensitivity of their schooling decisions to contextual factors.====This article also adds to the academic debate around school choice and its implications for educational segregation. Most work by economists has analyzed the effects of increased school choice (e.g., through voucher programs or charter schools) in comprehensive school systems where school choice is typically restricted by place of residence due to school catchment areas (see Burgess & Greaves, 2021 for an overview).==== Overall, the evidence for comprehensive school systems points towards more student sorting by ability or parental background when choice increases. In contrast, households in between-school tracking systems are generally free to choose any school as long as students qualify for the specific track offered at the school (i.e. there are no catchment areas). As a consequence, educational segregation in these systems is highest across school types and not across individual schools of a given type (see, e.g., Oosterbeek et al., 2021). I contribute to the literature on school choice by demonstrating that increased choice in between-school tracking systems does not necessarily result in more educational segregation by family background. Inequality exacerbating responses of high-SES households to increased school choice are potentially offset by general equilibrium responses of low-SES households for whom choice does not increase.====More narrowly, this article contributes to an expansive literature on the effects of free track choice on track decisions. The topic has been extensively studied, particularly in the German context, and primarily by sociologist. Previous work has reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of free track choice on the SES gap in academic track enrollment with effects ranging from positive to negative (see, e.g., Büchler, 2016, Dollmann, 2011, Esser and Hoenig, 2018, Gresch et al., 2010, Grewenig, 2021, Jähnen and Helbig, 2015, Neugebauer, 2010, Osikominu et al., 2021, Roth and Siegert, 2015, Roth and Siegert, 2016).==== My study potentially solves a key puzzle in this literature which has eluded explanations thus far: high-SES parents generally report higher track aspirations for their children than low-SES parents conditional on prior academic achievement (see, e.g. Ditton, 2007, Paulus and Blossfeld, 2007). This is difficult to reconcile with the ambiguous evidence on the effects of free track choice on the SES gap in academic track enrollment from previous studies. The tendency of eligible low-SES students to increase their academic track enrollment in response to free track choice could explain why an increase in academic track enrollment of previously ineligible high-SES students does not widen the SES gap in academic track enrollment.==== As I show that responses to free track choice also depend on the structure of the tracking system further helps to explain why previous studies potentially reach such different results.",Heterogeneous responses to school track choice: Evidence from the repeal of binding track recommendations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000596,3 June 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

We then propose a new measure of effective in-person learning (EIPL) that combines information on schooling modes with cell phone data on ==== and estimate it for a large, representative sample of U.S. public and private schools. The EIPL measure, which we make publicly available, resolves the discrepancies across trackers and is more suitable for many quantitative questions. Consistent with other studies, we find that a school’s share of non-white students and pre-pandemic grades and size are associated with less in-person learning during the 2020–21 school year. Notably, we also find that EIPL was lower for schools in more affluent and educated localities with higher pre-pandemic spending and more emergency funding per student. These results are in large part accounted for by systematic regional differences, in particular political preferences.","The COVID-19 pandemic led many schools in the U.S. to suspend or substantially reduce in-person learning. Several organizations and research teams have developed schooling mode trackers to measure the extent of traditional, hybrid, and virtual schooling that students obtained during the pandemic. A rapidly growing literature uses these trackers to estimate the consequences of reduced in-person instruction on student enrollment and academic achievement (Dee et al., 2021, Dorn et al., 2021, Engzell et al., 2021, Goldhaber et al., 2022, Jack et al., 2022, Kogan and Lavertu, 2021, Lewis et al., 2021), COVID infection and death rates (Chernozhukov et al., 2021a, Ertem et al., 2021), as well as local labor market outcomes (Amuedo-Dorantes et al., 2023, Garcia and Cowan, 2022, Landivar et al., 2022, Prados et al., 2021).====While certainly indicative of school closures, these trackers have several drawbacks. First, as we document in this paper, the various trackers provide very different accounts of the fraction of students who spent the 2020–21 school year in either of the three schooling modes. The differences are due to how each tracker defines hybrid schooling as well as the sample of schools and source data that the trackers take into account. This poses an important challenge for researchers interested in analyzing the extent and consequences of school closures as the choice of tracker is not obvious but can substantially affect results.====Second, even if one has good reason to prefer one tracker over the others, its usefulness for quantitative analysis is limited. This is because the trackers are qualitative — in particular, the category “hybrid” denotes an interval of possible in-person schooling days per week, reflecting the supply side of a school’s reopening policy but not the students’ take up of this option. While for some questions, one may prefer a measure of ==== in-person learning (i.e. the supply side), for many other outcomes such as the ones studied in the above referenced papers, ==== in-person learning (i.e. take up) is the more relevant metric. More generally, the treatments implied by the different schooling modes are not mutually exclusive. If a school is fully in-person (treatment 1), then it cannot be in hybrid mode (treatment 2). But if a school is not fully in-person, then it can be either in hybrid mode or in virtual mode. This makes it difficult to interpret regression results.====Third, the quality and coverage of the different trackers varies by geography and time period, and the data is typically limited to county or district-level averages of public schools. This further limits the applicability of the trackers for empirical analysis.====Motivated by these issues, we propose a new measure of Effective In-Person Learning (EIPL) that we estimate by mapping anonymized cell phone data from Safegraph on visits to schools with information from schooling mode trackers. The Safegraph data is available weekly for a large, representative sample of both public and private schools. Our estimation allows for the possibility that student presence (in-person learning) and cell-phone presence (visits) at schools may not have varied 1:1 during the pandemic; that the trackers use different definitions of hybrid schooling; and that the trackers are subject to measurement error that may vary by region.==== For each school in the sample, we therefore select the estimate from the mapping between visits and tracker information with the smallest measurement error. The result is a database of weekly EIPL from March 2020 to June 2021 for more than 70,000 public and private schools. We make this database available through the online repository of the Center for Open Science at ====.====To illustrate the use of the data, we investigate the extent to which EIPL correlates with a host of school and local characteristics. Naturally, these correlations should not be interpreted as causal, but they provide us with a set of stylized facts to understand the factors behind school closings, and which segments of the student population were most affected. We find the following main results:====The relation of EIPL with race, test scores, school size, and school spending confirm results previously documented by, e.g., Parolin and Lee (2021) or Landivar et al. (2022), while the relation with Republican voting preferences is consistent with Hartney and Finger (2020), Gollwitzer et al. (2020) and Valant (2020). Our contribution is to analyze these relations in a multivariate context, which reveals that systematic regional variations more so than local or school characteristics account for the large observed regional differences in public school closures. Indeed, our analysis uncovers a new nexus between income, voting preferences, and access to in-person learning: EIPL was on average lower – not higher – in more affluent localities, and this is in large part accounted for by their lower Republican vote share. Equally striking, we find that ESSER funding is on average not associated with higher EIPL even though the program was advertised primarily as support for schools to reopen for in-person learning. These findings raise critical questions about education policy during the pandemic and have potentially important implications for the impact of in-person learning loss on future educational attainment as well as income inequality.====Besides the above mentioned studies based on schooling mode trackers, several other studies have used school visits from cell phone data, in particular Safegraph, to proxy directly for school closures during the pandemic (Bravata, Cantor, Sood, & Whaley, 2021; Chernozhukov, Kasahara, & Schrimpf, 2021b; Parolin & Lee, 2021; Garcia & Cowan, 2022; Hansen, Sabia, & Schaller, 2022). The proposed EIPL measure advances over these proxies by taking into account information from schooling mode trackers and by allowing for the relationship between school visits and in-person learning during the pandemic to be different from 1:1, which our estimates suggest is important for many cases. Furthermore, attributing cell phones to a particular location is subject to inherent measurement issues, and our analysis reveals that this leads to sparse or noisy data for a non-negligible number of schools. Accordingly, we estimate EIPL only for schools with reliable visits data.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 compares the different schooling mode trackers. Section 3 describes our empirical approach for measuring EIPL. Section 4 studies the relation of EIPL with school-specific and local indicators.

As disability is not randomly assigned this is an empirical challenge. In this paper we use Danish administrative data and variation in the onset of type 1 diabetes to compare education outcomes of focal children with a disabled sibling to outcomes of focal children without a disabled sibling (matched on date of birth of the focal child, sibling spacing and family size). We find that having a disabled sibling significantly decreases 9==== grade exit exam GPAs, while having no impact on on-time completion of 9","When someone experiences a health shock, his or her family is also impacted. For example, Fadlon and Nielsen (2019) find health spillovers onto spouses and children while Fadlon and Nielsen (2021) find spousal labor supply spillovers. Also, child health impacts parental labor supply and mental health (for some recent examples, see Eriksen, Gaulke, Skipper and Svensson, 2021, Steingrimsdottir and Gunnsteinsson, 2019, Breivik and Costa-Ramón, 2022, and Adhvaryu, Daysal, Gunnsteinsson, Molina, and Steingrimsdottir, 2022).====There is a growing literature measuring sibling educational spillovers in the context of a health or disability shock, but those papers have largely focused on sibling spillovers in only one direction (older to younger only or younger to older only). For example, the empirical strategy in Daysal, Ding, Rossin-Slater, and Schwandt (2021) only allows them to document negative impacts of infectious disease on younger siblings while the empirical strategy in Black, Breining, Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik, Nielsen, and Simonsen (2021) means they can only document spillovers from the third born child onto older siblings. Breining (2014) only looks at spillovers from ADHD onto older siblings.==== One key exception that includes both older and younger siblings in the analysis is Daysal, Simonsen, Trandafir, & Breining (2022) which finds that early life medical interventions for children with low birthweight led to positive educational spillovers. However, differences in effects by birth order are not focused on in that paper.====This paper adds to the literature on whether educational outcomes are impacted by sibling disability status by using type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a disability shock, which allows us to test for differences in impacts by birth order and age at sibling's diagnosis. This source of variation follows Eriksen et al. (2021), which uses variation in T1D onset to estimate spillovers onto parental labor supply and parental mental health, and Lóven (2017), which uses variation in T1D onset to estimate sibling spillovers in labor market outcomes in Sweden. Lovén (2017) only tests whether the labor market estimates are robust to controls for education and thus does not test for educational spillovers directly. This matters because she concludes that educational spillovers are not important, while we find evidence of economically meaningful educational spillovers.====T1D is an ideal candidate for a disability shock for numerous reasons. First, T1D is an auto-immune disease in which the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This causes a substantial limitation to the endocrine system because the body cannot convert glucose to energy. It is impossible to survive without treatment if one has T1D (Hakim et al., 2010), meaning our control group will not include children with siblings who have undiagnosed T1D. Even with treatment, glucose levels are not as stable and are elevated compared with those without T1D, and this can lead to numerous other health problems which we discuss in more detail in the background section. Also, unlike the more common Type 2 Diabetes, it is not related to lifestyle; in fact, it is of unknown origin (Regnell and Lernmark, 2017). Research has tried to pinpoint the cause but has found a low degree of inheritability (Pociot and Lernmark, 2016), and no socio-economic gradient in diagnosis in Denmark (Prætorius, Urhoj, & Andersen, 2022). As the main threat to identification is that the unknown cause of T1D is related to educational outcomes (i.e., these children would perform worse even in the absence of sibling's diagnosis), the lack of a relationship between disease onset and both parent's income and education level is important.====Using full population administrative registry data from Denmark, we can identify siblings. Through administrative medical data we know whether each child was diagnosed with T1D and through administrative education data we have access to educational outcomes and enrollment. Each child with an impacted sibling is matched with non-treated children based on their year of birth, sibling spacing, and family size. We rely on the quasi-randomness of T1D as a disability shock to estimate effects.====Our first contribution is that we estimate a different, but complementary, treatment effect than that estimated in Black et al. (2021). As Black et al. (2021) state, they estimate an effect of relative exposure to a disabled sibling and not the total exposure to a disabled sibling. This is because the effects are based on the relative effects on first-born versus second-born children and thus difference out the common effect impacting both first-born and second-born children. Using T1D allows us to estimate the effect of total exposure to a disabled sibling. Black et al. (2021) find that the relative exposure is a decline of 3.4% of a standard deviation on the 9th grade Exit Exam while we find that the total exposure is a decline of 3.8% of a standard deviation on the 9==== grade Exit Exam (with all controls included). Focusing on a specific, but relatively common health shock, has benefits since parental responses could vary by whether the disability impacts relative returns on investment (substitution effect of parental time investments across children) or how time intensive the treatment is (income effect on parental time investments in children); thus, averaging effects may mask economically important impacts on some siblings.====While both papers estimate impacts on 9==== grade Exit Exams, we contribute to the literature by documenting significant impacts on educational trajectories as well. Despite not finding a significant difference in the probability of enrolling in post-compulsory school education, when we instead focus on the intensive margin we find a significant 3.1 percentage point (pp) decrease in the probability of enrolling in high school compared with vocational school. This matters because attending academic high school is required if one wants to attend college, and thus labor market opportunities are likely impacted as well.====Since there is variation in age at sibling's diagnosis, we can investigate whether this is a source of heterogeneity. This is important because Black et al. (2021) compare effects on 9th grade exit exams when the sibling's disability occurs before age five and between age five and age ten to find larger effects if the disability is diagnosed earlier. They posit multiple hypotheses as to why this may be the case, including that having a disabled sibling is more detrimental at earlier ages given the literature on the importance of early childhood environments (for example, see Cuhna and Heckman, 2007). Therefore, we contribute to the literature by documenting that there appears to be periods in a child's life where investments matter more than others. Specifically, we observe 7.7% of a standard deviation decrease in Danish scores for the children aged 6-9 years of age at sibling's diagnosis, which is the age at which children enter school and acquire their basic reading skills.====Another statistical benefit to using T1D as our shock is that it allows us to test for differences in effects by birth order. Birth order could potentially be important because several papers show that birth order matters for a range of child outcomes. For example, children of higher birth order have better health endowments at birth, are more likely to be delinquent and involved with the criminal justice system, and have worse test scores and behavioral development (Pruckner, Schneeweis, Schober, & Zweimüller, 2021, Breining, Doyle, Figlio, Karbownik, and Roth, 2020, and Silles, 2010). Also, according to Cunha and Heckman (2007) the returns to child investments will be larger the earlier the investment. Consistent with our hypothesis of larger penalties for younger siblings, we find no significantly negative impacts among children who are older siblings.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on T1D and the Danish setting of this study. Section 3 describes the Danish administrative registry data, the matching of treated and non-treated focal children, and the matched regression used to estimate the effects. Section 4 discusses the impact of having a sibling diagnosed with T1D on our education outcomes of interest, a falsification test that uses focal children too old to be impacted by sibling's onset, and heterogeneous treatment effects. Section 5 discusses impacts on numerous measures of school well-being.

We find lower-ranked graduate student teaching assistants and adjunct instructors were more likely to deliver riskier classes. Using an IV strategy in which teaching risk is shifted by classroom features (geometry and furniture), we show instructors who taught at least one risky class earned $7,400 more than those who did not."," State governments quickly responded with their own COVID-19 rules and orders for university re-openings. In this academic year, constrained by this new set of rules, universities made operational changes designed to maintain educational quality and continue carrying out their missions.====, ====, ====, and ====), and ====). A recent paper, ====, models how universities decide on their course offerings. A parallel literature studies the provision of amenities on campus and how universities respond to different student populations (e.g., see ====). With the advent of COVID-19, universities were forced to grapple with a new constraint on both revenues and costs. ==== show that universities in the U.S. monitored and (sometimes explicitly) based COVID-19 reopening decisions on the behavior of peer institutions. These developments highlight the complex interplay between market forces, institutional decision-making, and external shocks.====While public proclamations and course schedules can provide some insight into universities' responses to government policy during the pandemic, less is known about the internal institutional arrangements that underpin these decisions. For example, it is unclear how universities allocate resources, such as instructional labor and technology, to achieve their desired outcomes. This is particularly relevant given the significant cost differences between academic fields, such as math and English (====).====In this paper, we study the reopening of Auburn University, a large public research university in Alabama, documenting how the institution adjusted its instructional operations and incentive structure when faced with constraints associated with health guidelines and orders during the pandemic. On May 21, 2020, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey issued a public health order with specific instructions for the resumption of on-campus activities at the state's universities.==== Concerning social distancing, the order stated: “Schools shall take reasonable steps, where practicable, to maintain six feet of separation between persons of different households.” During the Summer of 2020, the Auburn University Architect's Office began to conduct Classroom Capacity Analyses (CCAs), presumably to comply with the Governor's social distancing order.====Auburn University resumed in-person classes in Fall 2020 on a voluntary basis and, following the low participation of instructors, mandated in-person classes for instructional faculty in the Spring 2021 semester.==== After the faculty scrutinized the plans for mandated face-to-face instruction, administrators acknowledged, in recorded public forums, that the university did not have a social distancing policy for its classrooms. Instead, the central administration relied on a 50-percent enrollment limit of the normal seating capacity in classrooms (50% Rule).====We compared the enrollment limits from the CCAs with reported student enrollments in face-to-face (F2F) classes.==== About half of the F2F courses in Spring 2021 were delivered in what we refer to as ""==== classrooms—where the enrollment exceeded the maximum number of students that can be seated in the room while allowing six feet between everyone. Also, approximately one out of four Spring 2021 F2F classes violated the university's 50% Rule.====In the first part of our paper, utilizing the granular nature of our risk measure, we investigate the association between instructor characteristics and the probability of teaching a risky course. Graduate student teaching assistants (GTAs) and non-tenure-track adjunct instructors were more likely to teach risky classes in Spring 2021 than the tenure-track professors and administrators teaching in the same department, holding constant personal attributes (including age) and course characteristics. The magnitude of this effect is equivalent to about one-third of the mean of the outcome. We also show that the relationship between instructor attributes and the (hypothetical) risk did not exist in Spring 2020, implying that lower-ranked faculty do not routinely teach more crowded classes than their higher-ranked counterparts. These jointly suggest that in Spring 2021, instructional assignments were set in response to the classroom risk.====An extensive amount of research investigates the wage effects of job (dis)amenities. The most common is the study of the impact on wages of occupational hazards (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). In a recent paper, ==== shows smoking bans in restaurants and bars in Germany caused a decrease in the earnings of waitresses/waiters. Others focus on a range of other non-market goods/“bads,” such as sexual harassment (====), work shifts (====), schedules (====), commute time (====), and contract guarantees (====).====, indicates whether the classroom characteristics (layout) or furniture (attached to the ground or movable) allow students to spread out and away from each other when attending the lectures. Importantly, it has a mechanical relationship with our measure of risk. Controlling for its square footage, the COVID-19 enrollment capacity of a classroom is higher in dispersible classes.==== As a result, courses held in rooms where students can spread out are expected to be less risky. Indeed, we show a solid first-stage relationship between our instrument and the level of risk. Our identification strategy relies on the assumption that the IV is related to an instructor's wages only through the risk of the class she/he teaches. That assumption is likely to hold in our application because classroom layouts were determined long before the teaching schedules. Further, we show that an instructor's or her/his class's observable attributes are not correlated with whether the assigned classroom is dispersible, suggesting that our instrument is as-good-as-random.====Results of 2SLS regressions show that instructors who teach at least one risky class earn about 20% more than their observationally equivalent counterparts who do not deliver any risky courses. The risk premium is approximately $7400 in a four-month semester. However, these results do not imply that every instructor who taught a risky class was compensated for the risk. In a placebo test, we find that instructors who taught hypothetically risky courses in the pre-pandemic Spring 2020 semester were not paid more than those who taught safe courses, suggesting that the risk premium existed only in the Spring 2021 semester and not before. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that our results are driven by non-professorial instructors, such as GTAs, adjunct instructors, and instructors who also work in staff positions at the university. This is consistent with the institutional practices that allow department chairs leeway when contracting temporary instructors to teach classes.====While ==== equalizing wage differentials model provides a natural theoretical starting point for understanding our estimate of the risk premium at Auburn, that model implies a market with perfect information. In contrast, the Spring 2021 market for risk at Auburn University was much more complicated.==== Department chairs generally administer the teaching assignments of the instructional staff. These department chairs are local monopsonists, as instructional labor is usually not substitutable across academic departments, and Auburn University is the largest academic employer within 100 miles. In addition, instructors’ knowledge of classroom risk was imperfect when courses were scheduled due to the late announcement of the CCAs. The central administration also lacked information about individual faculty members’ risk tolerances and attitudes. Below, we outline an alternative framework in which department chairs determine instructors’ wages and classroom risk to achieve the central administration's objective to minimize the total cost, subject to delivering at least a certain amount of in-person classes. Our empirical estimate of $7400 for the price of COVID-19 risk is best viewed as the ====.====, as we study the disaggregated behavior of elites in the allocation and compensation of health risk. Consistent with past research, our findings show that elites’ preferences are expressed in the aggregate outcome in extreme risk situations, such as those involving life and death (====).====Below, we first present critical institutional details, followed by a description of our data and empirical analysis. Next, we demonstrate that Auburn University saved approximately $8 million in ==== by ignoring CDC's social distancing guidelines. The last section offers a summary and discusses whether Auburn's actions were socially optimal.====Auburn University is a public (Carnegie R1) research university located in Auburn, Alabama. Established in 1856, the university comprises 206 academic buildings on 1841 acres and has a student body of about 30,000. University employs 5000 full-time workers, of which administrative/professional personnel make up about half, faculty personnel make up about a quarter, and staff personnel the remaining quarter.====Operations of Auburn University are extremely important for the well-being of the local economy since the businesses around Auburn depend heavily on student demand. The ratio of the number of students to the population in the Auburn Metro Area, according to the 2020 Census, is about 20%. In addition, Auburn's home games in intercollegiate competitions attract tens of thousands of visitors to the town, generating positive externalities for the local food services and accommodations industries (Lentz and Laband 2009). According to an internal report, Auburn University's direct economic impact is $2.2 billion, “representing Auburn's in-state expenditures, such as payroll and purchases, student spending on local housing and food, construction, and spending by visitors to university events.”====During the Spring 2020 semester, the university ceased on-campus instruction following Spring Break, as the state of Alabama entered a mandatory lockdown period.==== The closure of the university had immediate and significant consequences, not only on students and faculty but also on local residents and businesses. The demographic makeup of the city in which the university is located displays a heavy concentration of college students relative to its population, compared to other US college towns. As such, the local economy was placed in a precarious situation while the campus was closed to students, many of whom left the area.====In ==== ====, using Google's foot traffic data, we present the mobility trends in retail and recreation venues (as a proxy for local business demand) in Spring 2020 in the counties where AL colleges are located.==== The vertical axis measures the percent change in mobility in the county of each university relative to the average in the first five weeks of 2020 in that same county. To eliminate daily fluctuations, we present the data as the average of the last seven days. The bold, dark-green line portrays Lee county, which is the home to Auburn University. The average of the whole state of Alabama is represented by the thin dashed line. The thin solid lines in various colors are the trends of the counties of other universities in Alabama.==== ==== ==== shows that all college counties, including Auburn University's, moved along the same pattern as the state average in Spring 2020. However, it is important to highlight that across all of these college towns, Auburn University's location, Lee county, experienced ==== decreases in magnitude in demand. In other words, the reduction in recreation and retail shops’ foot traffic is the highest around Auburn University. This finding suggests that the local businesses were hit especially hard around Auburn, perhaps harder than others in the rest of the state.====Besides the local businesses, Auburn University's finances suffered during the shutdown in Spring 2020. For example, the top financial executive of the university reported that the university's losses amounted to $15 million through the mid-summer of 2020.==== In addition, Auburn University was under pressure from parents and students who questioned the effectiveness of remote instruction.====During the reopening, the university initiated a number of policies. When planning their courses for the Fall 2020 semester, instructors were allowed some leeway. They were asked to choose the modality they thought best aligned with their courses’ objectives. However, this ==== approach changed in Spring 2021 when the university required all instructors to teach their classes in pre-pandemic modalities (typically F2F) unless they have an exceptional medical excuse or a compelling pedagogical counter reason.==== The consequences of this policy change are reflected in ==== in the main text, which displays the distribution of modalities by semester in the academic year 2020–2021. Specifically, the push for in-person classes by the university led the proportion of classes taught in-person to increase drastically, from 19% in Fall 2020 to 71% in Spring 2021.====Presumably to comply with the AL Governor's health order, that requires colleges to implement six-foot social distancing in the classroom, and at the same time to offer as many in-person classes as possible, Auburn University started measuring the safe capacities of each classroom in Summer 2020. At the June 16 University Senate meeting, the Provost announced that classrooms would practice safe social distancing and that a team was working on classroom diagrams.==== Shortly afterward, the first CCAs were conducted by the Office of the University Architect. The goal of the surveys was to determine their safe capacities, i.e., the maximum number of students who can be seated in the classrooms while maintaining CDC-recommended six-foot social distancing. Examples of these studies are presented in ==== ==== and ====.====Each room study has a timestamp indicating the day on which it was completed. ==== ==== displays the timeline of these studies. According to these dates, the CCAs appear to have stopped on August 11, before the safe capacities of all classrooms were determined and the Fall 2020 semester began.==== The studies were restarted on November 18, and the complete set was made available on the university's web page on December 19, long after classes of the Spring 2021 semester were scheduled. The university did not announce the completion of these studies to the campus community. Some members of the Auburn University community speculate that the university administration was trying to suppress this information from the instructors and students.====Despite the fact that the university administration had the information about the safe capacities of the classrooms, Auburn University did not implement the CDC-prescribed six feet social distancing order of the AL Governor in the 2020–2021 academic year. This is likely because of the capacity constraints of the university. For example, when asked about physical distancing in the classrooms at a General Faculty meeting on October 27, Auburn's Director of Facilities summarized the university's rationale: “In a classroom with fixed seating, the 6 feet ==== is difficult to handle and still meet capacity needs [emphasis added].”====In the Fall 2020 semester, the university initiated its “50% Rule” policy, which allowed classrooms to contain up to half of their usual enrollment limits.==== According to this rule, a class will not be allowed to contain more than 50% of its usual student capacity. It is important to note that the 50% Rule was not sufficient to keep the number of students in a class below the safe capacity. For example, we found that 105 out of the 114 classrooms for which a study was available at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester hosted a class size above its safe capacity. Despite this, the university administration did not change the 50% Rule for this academic year. In the Spring 2021 semester, the 50% rule was not implemented universally. We have identified at least 435 violating classes in that semester.====University's disregard for social distancing guidelines caused discontent among the faculty. For example, the Auburn chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) recommended that the university should adopt a number of policies regarding safety from COVID-19. In a special faculty meeting on November 10, 2020, several faculty expressed concerns about classroom capacities. In addition, this meeting generated a motion of “No Confidence” in the Provost.==== As a response, the university administration held a series of Town Hall Meetings where the Provost and other members of the administration fielded questions from instructors.==== In these meetings, Auburn University's central administrators announced that the enrollment decisions in the classrooms would be “pushed down” to the lowest level—i.e., the department and instructor level. In the first days of the Spring 2021 semester, during a University Senate meeting, the Director of Auburn's Medical Clinic and member of the COVID-19 task force explained that Auburn University does not have a policy with respect to social distancing in the classroom and informed faculty that they did not have the authority to enforce social distancing in their classrooms if students wanted to sit together.====It is apparent that Auburn University's position on social distancing in the classroom evolved substantially between June 2020 and the preparations for the Spring 2021 semester. However, it is important to note that the AL Governor's “Safer at Home Order” maintains the same language, with respect to social distancing in the classroom, from the initial order in May 2020 until the latest extension of that order in January 2021 (which was in effect until March 2021). For the purpose of our study, the discretion that is given to faculty in choosing how they deal with social distancing and, particularly, the scheduling flexibility afforded department heads/chairs, likely creates heterogeneity in the assignment of risk across and within different administrative units at the university.==== ====Altindag, Duha Tore, Elif S.

We find that childhood obesity decreases high school GPA by 0.92 grade points (33.0%), GPAs of different subjects by 0.72–1.11 grade points (21.7–42.6%), the probability of college enrollment by 0.37, the probability of college completion by 0.65, and years of schooling by 2.19 years (14.8%). Additionally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms through which childhood obesity adversely influences educational outcomes. Our results indicate that childhood obesity does not have a statistically significant influence on cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, it negatively affects educational achievements via health factors (overall health status, health-damaging behaviors, and psychological well-being), school ==== and aggression, college aspirations and expectations, and family dynamics. This research provides evidence that childhood obesity can hinder children's educational progress, potentially affecting adult outcomes and exacerbating economic ====.","Childhood obesity stands out as the most widespread health issue affecting children in the United States.==== The prevalence of childhood obesity reached 19.7% in 2017–2020, affecting 14.7 million children.==== Childhood obesity is known to have profound effects on children's physical health, social, emotional wellbeing, and self-esteem (Cawley, 2010; Wang & Veugelers, 2008). It can have lasting effects into adulthood – obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood (Simmonds et al., 2016) and develop non-communicable disease like diabetes at a younger age (Sahoo et al., 2015).====Several studies have investigated the potential impact of childhood obesity on academic performance and educational attainment (Almond et al., 2018; Jackson, 2009). However, the literature offers mixed results. Some studies suggest that childhood obesity has no effect on school performance (Kaestner & Grossman, 2009; Scholder et al., 2012; Von Hinke et al., 2016). Others show that it may have adverse effects (Ding et al., 2009; Rouse & Hunziker, 2020; Joseph J Sabia, 2007; J. J. Sabia & Rees, 2015). Furthermore, most previous studies have focused on the association between childhood obesity and school performance, with few exploring causal relationships (Martin et al., 2017; Santana et al., 2017). As such, further research is needed to advance the literature and identify the causal effects of childhood obesity on academic performance and educational attainment.====The key challenge in investigating the causal link between childhood obesity and educational achievements is that a naïve comparison of either academic performance or educational attainment between obese and normal-weight children is unlikely to establish causal effects. This is because childhood obesity is influenced by various confounding characteristics at the individual (e.g., cognition and self-control abilities), family (e.g., parents’ income and education), and neighborhood (e.g., neighborhood safety) levels; and these characteristics may also affect education. To address this endogeneity issue, several studies have employed an instrumental variable (IV) approach. For example, Sabia and Rees (2015) use sibling BMI and maternal obesity status as an IV. They find that being overweight or obese in adolescence has statistically significant and adverse effects on high school GPA and college completion. However, using such variables as an IV may violate IV validity assumptions due to their associations with home environment and parental behavioral factors that are known to affect academic performance. Alternatively, researchers have suggested using child fixed effect (FE) models to address endogeneity (Palermo & Dowd, 2012; Scholder et al., 2012), which is useful only if the unobserved variables affecting both childhood obesity and educational outcomes are time-constant, not time-varying (Scholder et al., 2012). More research is needed to identify the causal effects of childhood obesity on educational achievements while adequately controlling for the confounding variables that impact both childhood obesity and education outcomes.====This study leverages genetic information to create a novel IV for children's weight status to address the endogeneity issue. The recent advancements in measuring genetic information within a large population at low cost have made genetic factors accessible to social science researchers (Belsky & Israel, 2014). As genetic information is predetermined before birth and remains stable throughout one's life, using genetic variants as an IV has gained increasing attention in economic and social studies (Belsky & Israel, 2014; Von Hinke et al., 2016). Previous studies have proposed using body mass index (BMI) genetic variants or BMI polygenic score (PGS)==== as an IV for weight status (Böckerman et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2009; Scholder et al., 2012; Von Hinke et al., 2016). However, BMI PGS could compromise the validity of the IV due to the horizontal pleiotropy problem, where the pathways of BMI PGS correlate with the confounding factors between weight status and educational outcomes. For example, BMI PGS has been found to share genes with education PGS (Boardman et al., 2015; Okbay et al., 2016), thereby violating the independent and exclusion assumption of a valid IV as it correlates with intelligence-related control variables such as children's cognitive endowment or parents’ education. To address this problem, we employ a novel two-stage regression approach to construct an IV based on BMI-related genetic information. This approach purifies the genetic information exclusively for BMI by residualizing the BMI PGS using a linear regression controlling for the confounding PGSs that share biological pathways with the BMI PGS, such as PGSs relating to education and cognitive ability, substance use, and mental health. By purifying the genetic information for BMI, our IV is less likely to be correlated with socioeconomic determinants of childhood obesity and better satisfies the assumptions of a valid IV.====Using the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data, we investigate the impact of childhood obesity on academic performance in high school and educational attainment in early adulthood. Our findings show that childhood obesity has adverse effects on both academic performance in high school and educational attainment in early adulthood. Childhood obesity reduced the overall high school GPA by 0.92 (33%) grade points and the subject GPAs of English, history, social science, math, science, and physical education by 0.72–1.11 (21.7–42.6%) grade points. Moreover, childhood obesity decreases educational attainment by 2.19 years (14.8%) and lowers the probability of college enrollment and completion by 0.37 and 0.49, respectively. As educational attainment has been shown to be a critical factor in determining earnings (Heckman & Mosso, 2014) and income inequality (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lemieux, 2006), our study highlights that childhood obesity could significantly impact economic well-being and income equality through its influence on education. We further investigate the possible mechanisms through which childhood obesity could negatively affect educational outcomes. Our analysis rules out the possibility that childhood obesity impacted cognitive abilities and confirms that it had a negative effect on general health, health-compromising behaviors, psychological well-being, school absenteeism and aggression, college aspiration and expectation, and family dynamics. Our results are robust to various tests and placebo checks. The findings not only highlight the causal effects of childhood obesity on educational achievements, but also suggest that preventive measures for childhood obesity could improve high school academic performance in the short run and educational attainments in the long run, and ultimately reducing economic inequality.====This study contributes to three strands of literature. First, it adds to the general body of knowledge concerning the relationship between education and health. It is well established that education and health are highly interdependent, with a bi-directional, positive relationship between two (Currie, 2009; Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2006). Given the impact of education on labor market outcomes, this study highlights how childhood obesity may have contributed to income inequality in the United States by lowering educational levels. Second, this research enriches the literature on human capital development by shedding light on the relationship between childhood obesity and the development of neurocognitive abilities, an area that has hitherto been poorly understood (Liang et al., 2014). A key challenge in this area is to measure cognitive endowment and development, which are the fundamental factors in children's educational outcomes (Benner & Mistry, 2007; A.K. Cohen, Rehkopf et al., 2013; Hossler & Stage, 1992). Employing a gene-based IV model and controlling for one's intelligence PGS as a covariate representing the cognitive endowment, we have identified the mechanisms through which childhood obesity may affect educational outcomes. Third, this study contributes to the literature using genetic information in social science studies. We develop a novel two-stage strategy to construct an IV more exclusively related to BMI and obesity than the raw BMI PGS. This strategy can be readily adapted to address the pleiotropy problem and accommodate new discoveries in PGSs and underlying biological pathways. The constructed IV allows for the separation of the reciprocal relationship between health and education and emphasizes the causal effects of childhood obesity on educational outcomes.====The rest of this study proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of genetics and its use in social science. Section 3 describes the data and key variables. Section 4 describes the empirical strategies and the construction of IV. The IV validation and main results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 validates our main results by providing robustness checks and placebo test. Section 7 discusses mechanisms through which childhood obesity can potentially affect educational achievements.

To do so, we use historical time-use data from the course’s online homework module to estimate the association between study time and course performance. We measure the impact of providing students this information on subsequent study effort, class attendance, homework scores, and exam performance using a randomized research design. Results show that the information contained in our intervention increased time spent studying by approximately 7% throughout the entire course, though this effect is imprecisely measured. However, when examining shorter-run outcomes (prior to the next exam) we find larger and more precisely estimated ==== on time spent on homeworks (12%) and homework scores (14% of a standard deviation). Treatment effects on longer run outcomes in the course are negligible. We additionally estimate large, but somewhat imprecise, average ==== on class attendance and small positive and insignificant average treatment effects on exam performance throughout the course.","A student’s study effort is a critical part of their education production function (Bonesrønning and Opstad, 2015, Fraja et al., 2010, Gneezy et al., 2019, Stinebrickner and Stinebricker, 2004, Stinebrickner and Stinebricker, 2008). As such, understanding how students make decisions on how much time to allocate towards studying is of great importance for education policy-makers. Study effort decisions contain important trade-offs for students, as increased time towards studying implies less time for other activities such as leisure and work (Bound et al., 2010, Bound et al., 2012, Metcalf et al., 2019, Stinebrickner and Stinebricker, 2003). However, in order to make these trade-offs efficiently, students must know the actual returns to effort. That is, how study effort maps onto academic outcomes such as performance on exams and course grades.====Despite the central importance of these study effort decisions, the research is decidedly thin regarding the returns to study effort and how students make these choices. This is likely due to the fact that valid measures of study effort are both difficult to obtain and are endogenous to other factors affecting achievement. As a consequence, it is unclear how and whether students incorporate information about the returns to study effort into their beliefs and behavior, and whether changing those beliefs can lead to increases in academic achievement.====Previous work has shown that students often have incorrect beliefs about their own education production function (Ersoy, 2021, Fryer, 2016). Absent accurate information on their returns to study effort, students may over or under-invest in studying, leading to an inefficient allocation of time. While there is a growing literature examining information interventions in college classes, to our knowledge, no study has attempted to update students beliefs about the returns to study effort in a similar setting.====To fill this gap in the literature, we derive and administer an information intervention that both elicits and shocks students’ beliefs about their returns to effort in an introductory microeconomics course. To obtain a valid measure of study effort to create the information treatment, we leverage historical, granular time-use data derived from the course’s online homework application. After eliciting student’s own beliefs about returns to study effort in a baseline survey, we randomly provide one-half of the students in the class information regarding the average returns to effort using data from a previous version of the course taught by the same instructor. We then track subsequent study effort and course performance for all students.====Results show that the information contained in our intervention increased time spent studying by approximately 7% throughout the entire course, though this effect is imprecisely measured. However, when examining shorter-run outcomes (prior to the next exam) we find larger and more precisely estimated treatment effects on time spent on homeworks (12%) and homework scores (14% of a standard deviation). Treatment effects on longer run outcomes in the course are negligible. We additionally estimate large, but somewhat imprecise, average treatment effects on class attendance and small positive and insignificant average treatment effects on exam performance throughout the course. When controlling for multiple hypothesis testing across our study effort outcomes, we retain significance (p ==== 0.05) on short term study time.====Using responses from our baseline survey, we examine the role of initial beliefs about the returns to study effort when estimating our treatment effects. We fail to detect significant differences in treatment between students who have high or low estimates of their returns to study effort. As such, we posit that the short-run effects on study effort we observe are driven by one of two mechanisms: (1) an increase in the salience of study effort induced by the treatment; and/or, (2) a diminishing of the treatment effect in the long-run as students update their beliefs about their true returns to study effort.==== In our setting, students had multiple homework and exams post-intervention to learn about their own returns to study effort. Under these circumstances, student beliefs may naturally evolve and change, likely reducing the effectiveness of our information as the course progresses.====Finally, we use our experimentally induced short-term increase in study effort to estimate the causal impact of study time on homework scores and exam performance. We do so by using treatment status as an excluded instrument in an IV regression of course performance on study time. Results indicate ordinary least squares estimates tend to underestimate the returns to study effort, indicating study effort is negatively selected with performance.====This paper makes contributions to several related literatures. First, we contribute to the research examining student effort decisions and the effect of study effort on academic achievement (Ahn et al., 2019, Fraja et al., 2010, Metcalf et al., 2019, Stinebrickner and Stinebricker, 2008). This literature has primarily focused on how changing incentives for achievement affect study effort and subsequent performance (Azmat and Iriberri, 2015, Golightly, 2020, Hishleifer, 2016, Stinebrickner and Stinebricker, 2008), while our paper manipulates beliefs about effort while keeping incentives for achievement fixed. Additionally, in a pair of papers most related to ours, Ersoy, 2019, Ersoy, 2021 uses data from an online language platform to demonstrate that students have incorrect beliefs about returns to study effort and shows that those beliefs become more accurate upon receiving information. In the spirit of Ersoy (2021), who studies how similar information impacts beliefs and performance for Duolingo users, our study focuses on updating students’ beliefs in a classroom setting about the returns to effort.====Second, this paper contributes to the literature on performance feedback by examining how changes in beliefs translate into changes in achievement. Prior studies have found strong effects on achievement as a result of performance feedback (Azmat and Iriberri, 2010, Bandiera et al., 2015, Bobba and Frasinco, 2019a, Bobba and Frasinco, 2019b, Brade et al., 2018, Gonzalez, 2017, Goulas and Megalokonomou, 2018, Li, 2018), although these effects are not always positive (Azmat et al., 2019). These papers rightly interpret these effects as a result of changing beliefs about students’ own abilities. What is less clear, however, is the mechanisms by which changes in beliefs translate into changes in achievement. As students learn about their ability, some inputs into the education production function must also change. The inputs most under the student’s control, as well as those we believe most likely to be related to beliefs about ability, are those related to study effort. We aim to study this potential link and assess whether changes in beliefs about returns to study effort mimic findings from the research on beliefs about ability.====Third, we contribute to the literature examining beliefs, specifically in an education setting. A large literature has emerged over the past decade which demonstrates the importance of students’ beliefs in decision making (Bobba and Frasinco, 2019a, Bobba and Frasinco, 2019b, Conlon, 2020, Wiswall and Zafar, 2015a, Wiswall and Zafar, 2015b, Zafar, 2011, Zafar, 2013). To our knowledge, we are the first to document beliefs about returns to study effort in a common educational setting; a large introductory course at a selective public four-year university. We also examine the role ex ante beliefs about returns to study effort play in making study effort decisions.====Finally, we contribute to the literature studying “nudges” in education that attempt to alter student behavior via light-touch interventions, although with varying success (Carrell et al., 2020, Damgaard and Nielsen, 2018, Li, 2018, Oreopoulos et al., 2020). We show that our light-touch intervention changes short-run behavior in a way that is consistent with a common decision framework used in economics, further demonstrating that nudges may yet play an important role in the classroom.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section 2 provides details on our field experiment; Section 3 describes our data; Section 3.3 presents our results; Section 4 concludes.",Knowing what it takes: The effect of information about returns to studying on study effort and achievement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572300047X,25 April 2023,2023,Research Article,6.0

We explore whether demographic targeting by colleges differs by sector (for-profit, not-for-profit, and public colleges), as well as for predominantly online institutions and multi-campus chains. Our data include spending on television, radio, Internet, print, and ","Advertising has become an increasingly important tool for student recruitment among postsecondary institutions in the United States. From social media feeds to college sports broadcasts to billboards over highways, ads for college can be found just about everywhere. Colleges may engage in strategic advertising for any number of reasons, including generating enrollment, ensuring diversity, enhancing selectivity, and maximizing revenue. Where and how colleges advertise can reveal key insights into their priorities and desired student body. Despite research into other types of college outreach and recruitment, we know little about how colleges use commercial advertising to attract students.====In this paper, we begin to address this gap, drawing on data from Kantar Media to describe the advertising patterns of U.S. higher education institutions between 2013 and 2017. Our data contain estimates of dollars spent by each institution on TV, radio, print, outdoor, and Internet display ads.==== We first describe differences in advertising spending across institutions by sector (i.e., for-profit, non-profit, or public), size, and degree characteristics. We next ask where colleges advertise, analyzing the correlation between advertising spending and metropolitan area demographics. In particular, we explore whether demographic targeting differs for for-profit, not-for-profit, and public colleges, or for predominantly online institutions and multi-campus chains, that may have different incentives for recruitment. Finally, we consider whether the location of a college campus mediates the patterns we find.====Combining data on institutional characteristics from the IPEDS with ad spending across metropolitan areas, we find that for-profit institutions—especially chain for-profits—spend more on advertising than their non-for-profit and public counterparts. Institutions with larger enrollments and those offering four-year degrees are also associated with higher spending. With regard to demographics, we find that all colleges spend more advertising dollars in communities with higher proportions of Black residents and spend less in areas with higher concentrations of individuals in poverty and residents identifying as Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white racial groups. We find that for-profit institutions are much more likely than public and not-for-profit private institutions to focus their advertising on areas with high shares of Hispanic residents and areas with high military employment.====Assessing the role of college location, we find that spending on advertising is higher among both for-profit and public institutions in metropolitan areas with both a physical location and a high share of Black residents. Unlike not-for-profit and public institutions, ad spending by for-profit institutions is positively correlated with the share of Hispanic residents regardless of proximity to a physical location. Our results suggest that college location and advertising are inextricably linked, but campus location alone cannot fully explain the advertising patterns we observe.====This paper relates to a large literature on college student information, recruitment, application, and enrollment. Commercial advertising represents one form of information that students may or may not rely on to make college enrollment decisions. Scholars in the economics of education have found that information provision alone has little influence on student application or enrollment behavior (Bergman, Denning & Manoli, 2019; Bettinger et al., 2012, Gurantz et al. 2021, Hoxby & Turner, 2013, Hurwitz & Smith, 2018, Hyman, 2020) although none that we know of assess the role of advertising specifically. On the other hand, recent experiments involving clear, direct, and personalized outreach find strong impacts on enrollment, particularly for students of color, first generation students, and lower- income students (Dynarski et al., 2021; Hoxby & Turner, 2013; Smith, Howell & Hurwitz, 2022). Perhaps most closely related to our work are studies on the demographic targeting of recruiting visits by public institutions. Salazar, Jaquette and Han (2021) find that public universities are more likely to visit whiter and wealthier high schools on out-of-state recruiting visits. Related work by Salazar (2022) describes cases of “recruitment redlining”—the avoidance of Black and Latino communities in college recruiting visits (Salazar, 2022).====Targeted advertising by colleges may be beneficial for students and society if advertising provides high-quality information on college costs and benefits—especially for students who may not have other sources of reliable information. On the other hand, if advertising is deceptive or misleading, such targeting could lead students to enroll in sub-optimal or low-value programs and institutions, potentially exacerbating existing inequities. The latter possibility is concerning in light of a growing literature on for-profit colleges that finds poor student outcomes and evidence of strategic behavior in the sector. For example, Cellini (2010) finds that for-profit campus openings are strongly correlated with the generosity of federal and state student aid awards, particularly in high-poverty areas. Others document strategic responses to federal student aid (Lau, 2014; Turner, 2017, and Cellini & Goldin, 2014) and worse student outcomes (such as employment, earnings, and loan repayment) relative to institutions in other sectors (see Cellini, 2022 for a review of this literature). In the sociology and education literature, case studies document the predatory recruitment tactics of for-profit institutions targeted toward low-income students, military students, and students of color (e.g., Cottom 2017). Dache-Gerbino, Kiyama and Sapp (2018) contend that for-profit institutions both locate in and market to low-income areas and communities of color—particularly targeting Latina students with their recruitment strategies.====Our paper also relates to the literature on proximity and college choice. Many scholars have documented the role of proximity in college attendance (e.g., Card, 1995, Rouse 1995, Long, 2004, Niu & Tienda, 2007). Research by Hillman (2016) further documents “education deserts” where few or no postsecondary institutions exist. Importantly, he finds that these deserts are disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color. Education deserts may reinforce geographic racism and segregation (Dache-Gerbino, 2018), perpetuate inequalities, and lead to sub-optimal educational choices for students (Klasik, Blagg, and Pekor 2018). College adverting may further contribute to these disparities or ameliorate them: a question we cannot answer without more information on student enrollment and outcomes.====We believe our study is among the first in the literature to study commercial advertising by U.S. colleges. It builds on our own exploratory work documenting trends in advertising in higher education over the last decade (Cellini & Chaudhary, 2020). Most previous studies use self-reported data or rely on government sources that combine advertising with other types of spending, such as student services. For example, Kittle (2000) surveyed 59 public and nonprofit institutions to understand the prevalence of different modes of advertising in the 1990s.==== More recently, reports from the Century Foundation document college advertising patterns in the pandemic, describing an uptick in COVID-related messaging around uncertainty, staying at home, and essential workers in Internet ads (Dudley, 2020). Dudley (2021) further reports on the types of websites on which college Internet ads are placed, finding that for-profit institutions are more likely to place ads on gaming, sports, and news websites relative to other sectors. Our main contribution is exploring whether colleges engage in differential targeting of students by race, ethnicity, income, and military status, and whether such targeting differs by sector, campus location, and mode of instruction.",Where do colleges advertise?

This paper investigates whether students delay ","College students face strong and persistent adverse effects when graduating in a recession. A recent survey by von Wachter (2020) finds that, on average, college students graduating in a recession earn 10% less, an effect that persists for ten years following graduation.==== Altonji, Kahn, and Speer (2016) and Arellano-Bover (2020a) attribute part of these effects to students graduating in a recession finding their first jobs in lower-paying occupations or with smaller firms. Forsythe (2022) documents that hiring rates fall faster for young workers during recessions. The adverse effects of graduating during a recession are not limited to labor market outcomes: cohorts graduating in recessions experience worse outcomes on health, family formation, and crime (von Wachter, 2020).====This raises the question of whether college students postpone graduation to avoid entering a depressed labor market. While there are direct and opportunity costs of delaying graduation, these costs could be outweighed, for some students, by avoiding the scarring effect of unemployment and finding a better match in the labor market later on. Universities facilitate networking opportunities and provide infrastructure to help job-seeking students, which can be more valuable with higher labor demand. Additionally, maintaining status as a student can be beneficial since they can enjoy subsidies and internship opportunities and increase human capital by attending more courses.====Whether (and for whom) the benefits outweigh the costs is, ultimately, an empirical question. In this paper, I investigate if the local labor market conditions affect college students’ graduation decisions in Brazil. By investigating which students avail of opportunities to delay graduation, I highlight a new dimension of heterogeneity in the costs of recessions.====To answer these questions, I bring together a rich collection of data. My primary dataset consists of longitudinal data for the universe of students enrolled in any higher education program in Brazil since 2009, the Higher Education Census. For every student, I have demographic information, characteristics of the chosen major and institution, and, critically, the expected and actual graduation dates. Using national matched employer–employee data, I construct a measure for the labor market conditions specific for each major and state, which I term the major-weighted hires (MWH). To construct it, I retrieve the number of hires for each occupation and state from the matched employer–employee data. The final measure is the average of hires, weighted by the importance of each occupation for each major. Like common measures of the labor market conditions, such as ==== unemployment rates, MWH explores labor market variations across time (students expected to graduate at different years) and geography (students graduating in different states).==== However, MWH provides unique detail by major; students from the same state with the same expected graduation date may have different labor market opportunities, depending on how the typical occupations for their majors are trending.====Exploring variation in employment conditions at the expected graduation date, I show that the overall effect of labor market conditions on graduating decisions is indistinguishable from zero. However, this aggregate effect masks substantial heterogeneity, particularly by the type of university. Students from public universities are less likely to graduate on time when facing a weaker labor market. Reducing the ==== hiring by 1% implies that these students are 0.07pp less likely to graduate on time. In the 2014–2016 recession in Brazil, the weighted hiring fell by 30% on average, implying that the on-time graduation rate for public students was 2.1pp lower.==== This effect represents a 6.5% reduction in graduation at the expected time, translating to an increase in the average graduation time by around 0.11 semesters. That is equivalent to 1 out of 18 students (5.5%) delaying graduation by one year.====In contrast, I do not find any response on the timing of graduation for students in private institutions. These contrasting results are not surprising given the institutional differences between public and private institutions. Differences in course quality and students’ characteristics can only account for part of the gap in the public–private estimates. Therefore, it is likely that public institutions being tuition-free plays a role in explaining these results. Postponing graduation for students in private institutes is significantly more costly. This makes the results from this paper even more relevant for several countries where the majority of the tertiary system is free or at a relatively low cost.====In terms of heterogeneity, the effects of a recession on postponing graduation are more pronounced for students in higher-earnings majors and better socioeconomic status. Students with more advantaged backgrounds have more family resources to rely on while postponing labor market entry. In particular, this suggests a channel through which the educational system might foster inequalities — more privileged students are better able to shield themselves from the adverse effects of labor market fluctuations by more freely choosing when to graduate.====I complement this analysis by gathering data from one large public university in the state of Bahia — The Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). UFBA is the state’s flagship university, admitting 4,200 students annually. This data has information on credit accumulation and entry scores and can be linked with the matched employer–employee data. The credit accumulation is only responsive to the labor market conditions in the semesters near expected graduation, indicating that students may reduce their course load to postpone graduation. The delaying effect comes entirely from students without jobs. Students that had a formal job the year before graduation do not change their graduation decisions. The delaying effect is higher for students with higher entry scores in the admission exams and better socioeconomic status.====Several papers document the negative effects on college students graduating in a recession (Altonji et al., 2016, Arellano-Bover, 2020a, Genda et al., 2010, Kahn, 2010, Oreopoulos et al., 2012, Rothstein, 2021, Schwandt and Von Wachter, 2019). This paper contributes to this literature by showing that some students react to labor market conditions by delaying graduation. There is abundant evidence that the choice to enter college is responsive to labor market conditions.==== Here, I explore a different margin, showing how students in the final years of college still respond to the labor market conditions by adjusting the time of graduation and, therefore, when to fully join the labor market. So, even if some individuals do not change their educational attainment, they still respond to the environment by adjusting graduation timing.====The heterogeneous effects complement the findings and supplement our understanding of existing literature. Altonji et al., 2016, Genda et al., 2010, Oreopoulos et al., 2012, Schwandt and Von Wachter, 2019 and Arellano-Bover (2020a) find stronger negative scarring effects for students in lower-paying majors and with lower socioeconomic status. This is consistent with my findings that there is a smaller delaying effect for students with less advantaged backgrounds. My results reinforce the inequality concerns about who bears the costs of recessions raised by these papers.====My paper relates to other papers that evaluate the relationship between labor market characteristics and late graduation. Chen and Yur-Austin (2016) shows that students more pessimistic about the labor market are more likely to plan for late graduation. Bozick (2009) uses a 2003–2004 survey in the US to show how some colleges accommodate students in times of a depressed labor market. Messer and Wolter (2010) uses a sample of Swiss graduates from 1981–2001 to show how higher unemployment leads to a lower time-to-degree. Pechacek (2013) explores state-level variation in unemployment to assess whether a sample of US college students from 1995 and 2003 are more likely to delay graduation. Lastly, Aina and Casalone (2020) explores a sample of students graduating in 2002–2003 from 24 universities in Italy, showing that unemployment can be associated with late graduation and that this delay is costly for students. Relative to this work, my paper offers several contributions. First, my data covers the universe of college students in Brazil from more than 2300 higher education institutes and 40,800 programs expected to graduate in 22 semesters. This universal coverage is beneficial to estimating the effect for a more representative sample and is essential to gauge the heterogeneity analysis. The different results depending on the type of university, majors, and individual characteristics are paramount to understanding the college-market transition and the effects of recessions. Second, my sample does not rely on students graduating in a given year, making it possible to control for cohort and still explore the effects of different labor market conditions.==== Lastly, this paper also highly benefits from the matched employer–employee data, which allows me to compute labor market measures that vary not only across time and space but also across majors.====Moreover, my results provide an explanation for Kahn (2010) and Arellano-Bover (2020b)’s findings of larger effects when instrumenting the labor market conditions by the unemployment rate of expected graduation than in the OLS specifications. The compliers in their instrumental variables approach are precisely those not delaying graduation. I show that these students who do not delay graduation are more likely to be in lower-earnings majors and less advantaged backgrounds.====The large difference in the effect of recession on delaying graduation between public and private institutions demonstrates the key role of the institutional setting. These results align with Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, and Rettore (2012) and Brunello and Winter-Ebmer (2003). This points to one caveat: these results draw from the Brazilian institutional setting, which differs in important ways from the setting of several countries where the literature has documented the scarring effects.====This paper proceeds as follows. I present the institutional setting of higher education in Brazil (Section 2); discuss the benefits and costs of delaying graduation (Section 3); present the datasets (Section 4); discuss the empirical strategy and the construction of the labor market measure (Section 5); present and discuss the empirical findings (Section 6); and offer concluding remarks (Section 7).",Labor market conditions and college graduation: Evidence from Brazil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572300050X,12 April 2023,2023,Research Article,9.0

We decompose this early gender gap and find that especially differences in coefficients help explain different expectations. In particular, the effects of having time for family as career motive and being first-generation college student are associated with large penalties in female wage expectations exclusively. This is especially true for higher expected career paths. Resulting expected returns to education are associated with college enrollment of women and could thus entrench subsequent gaps in realized earnings.","The literature on gender pay gaps continues to grow rapidly in parallel with a lively public debate (see Blau & Kahn, 2017 for an overview). Many studies show that gender gaps are not only prevalent in actual earnings, but that already in college, women hold lower wage expectations than men (see e.g. Blau and Ferber, 1991, Reuben et al., 2017). However, less is known about the determinants of gender gaps in wage expectations before postsecondary enrollment. Such ==== wage expectations can influence later human capital investment and career decisions. Thus, a better understanding of early gender gaps in expected wages can also provide insights into the formation of later disparities.====Gender gaps in expected wages prior to labor market entry may become self-fulfilling as they can entrench actual wage inequalities through at least two channels. First, lower expected earnings reduce the incentives to invest in higher education (see e.g. Ferber and McMahon, 1979, McMahon and Wagner, 1981). Recent evidence shows that expected wages are a significant predictor for the choice which level of education to pursue, as well as for college major choice.==== Second, wage expectations might affect starting wages through the formation of reservation wages (Brown & Taylor, 2013). If, in turn, lower reservation wages result in lower starting salaries, they are likely to have a persistent effect on actual wage trajectories.==== Caliendo et al. (2017) show that gender differences in reservation wages can indeed account====for a large share of the subsequent gender gap in realized wages. This is exacerbated by gender differences in negotiation styles and outcomes, which are larger for inexperienced negotiators (see Mazei et al., 2015 for an overview) and thus matter especially for starting wages.====Our study asks: what factors drive the gender gap in expected wages among high school students? Our analysis draws on data from a unique survey among high school graduates in Germany, in which we asked individual students for their expected full-time earnings range at age 35 years in three different scenarios: (i) if they enrolled for a vocational degree, (ii) if they enrolled for a bachelor’s degree or (iii) if they enrolled for a master’s degree. We examine the determinants of the expected gender gap using a regression-compatible Oaxaca–Blinder (OB) decomposition (Blinder, 1973, Fortin, 2008, Oaxaca, 1973) and place a particular focus on differences in coefficients (====) as opposed to differences in endowments (====), giving a detailed overview of components attributable to socio-demographic factors, intended college major choice, career motives and both cognitive and noncognitive abilities.====We find that the gender gap in average wage expectations after high school graduation amounts to over 15%. Our decomposition results indicate that endowments explain some of the difference in future wages: around a quarter of the total gap. In particular, intentions to choose a major in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and a high academic self-efficacy==== are more prevalent in men and on average associated with higher expected wages. However, it is the differences in coefficients rather than differences in endowments that play a bigger role. Being potential first generation at college, intending to study business or management and expressing ==== as a career motive all have significantly more negative impacts on female expected wages than on male expected wages. Some further factors, such as having ==== as a career motive, also have relatively more positive impacts on female expectations. The fact that these coefficient effects offset each other, explains the relatively low share of the gender gap in wage expectations explained by differences in coefficients.====We investigate the decomposition not just for mean expected wages pooled over educational scenarios, but also for minimum and maximum expected wages, as well as bachelor and master scenarios separately, to shed light on underlying heterogeneity. Certain factors, e.g. ====, are associated with the largest contribution via the unexplained part for the maximum expected wages and the master scenario, implying the differential impacts are exacerbated for the highest career tracks. This result suggests that women anticipate having to give up higher career paths and leadership positions in order to have more flexible work arrangements.==== Recent evidence by Wiswall and Zafar (2021) stresses the close link between human capital investments, including major choice, and expectations about career and family.====In our findings, having a very high preference for ==== as a career motive is the largest single and most consistent driver of the gender gap in wage expectations. Although time for family could cover many family related issues, as caring for parents, partners, or siblings in need, it is very often related to childcare. Our analysis suggests that ====, one of the most central factors in explaining inequalities in earnings, are already reflected in the expectations of high school students. Finally, to assess possible pathways of how the gender gap in wage expectations might translate into actual earnings, we examine the association between expected returns to college and college enrollment. We find strong heterogeneities across gender and socioeconomic background.====The majority of existing studies on earnings expectations focus on averages, asking students for point estimates of their future wages (for overviews, see e.g. Brunello et al., 2004, Giustinelli, 2022, Manski, 2004). By eliciting the minimum and maximum expected wages of high school students, we are able to give a more comprehensive picture and are able to assess drivers of wage expectations at different margins. Many studies in this strand of the literature compare expected wages of students to actual wages of different reference groups and focus predominantly on college students (e.g. Alonso-Borrego and Romero-Medina, 2016, Betts, 1996, Carvajal et al., 2000, Huntington-Klein, 2015, Manski, 1993, Wolter, 2000, Wolter and Zbinden, 2002). By eliciting wage expectations for different degree types, we can compare wage expectations to actual earnings of a wider range of reference groups. Other studies investigate the ==== of college students’ expectations and compare them to later realized wages by following students into the labor market (e.g. Filippin and Ichino, 2005, Jerrim, 2011, Jerrim, 2015, Webbink and Hartog, 2004).====Our study is not the first to elicit the wage expectations of pre-college students. However, it is one of only a few studies that aims to explain the gender gap in expectations at this early age. Many studies of the wage expectations of pre-college students do not specifically estimate gender gaps (e.g. Attanasio and Kaufmann, 2014, Dominitz and Manski, 1996, Hastings et al., 2016, Hastings et al., 2015, Schweri and Hartog, 2017, Wolter, 2000) whereas several others estimate the gender gap only in passing while summarizing the data (e.g. Belfield et al., 2020, Boneva and Rauh, 2020, Mazza and Hartog, 2011). Only three previous studies place a specific focus on estimating and explaining the gender gap in wage expectations, Eliophotou-Menon, 1997a, Eliophotou-Menon, 1997b for secondary school students in Cyprus, Attanasio and Kaufmann (2017) for high school graduates in Mexico, and Boneva et al. (2022) for secondary school students Germany. All three studies regress explanatory factors on wage expectations for the girls and boys groups separately, but none carries out a decomposition analysis to assess the determinants of gender gaps in early wage expectations.====Eliophotou-Menon, 1997a, Eliophotou-Menon, 1997b elicits wage expectations of secondary school students in Cyprus finding a gap in wage expectations and finding that factors such as family background and perceived ability affected the wage expectations of girls and boys differently. Attanasio and Kaufmann (2017) document a gap in wage expectations for high school graduates in Mexico also findings differences between boys and girls in the relationship between expectations and personal characteristics. Their study also analyzes later college enrollment, but places a focus on marriage market returns. Boneva et al. (2022) elicit the gender gap in competitiveness of adolescents from lower socio-economic backgrounds in Germany by looking at earnings expectations. Their focus is on the development of gender differences in competitiveness and the role of the social environment in this process. Additionally, the authors show that also earnings expectations of girls and boys already differ significantly at around fourteen years of age. Their findings suggest that the gender gap in wage expectations emerges already at the beginning of adolescence and is larger for children from lower socio-economic backgrounds.====A small number of studies decomposes the gender gap in wage expectations, but only for college students, i.e. when the decision to invest in higher education is already made.==== Delaney et al. (2010) decompose the gender gap in expected earnings of college students, using data from the Irish Universities Study. As one of only a few studies, they also consider career motives and noncognitive abilities as determinants of wage expectations. Their findings attribute a large share of the gender gap to risk preferences, but also indicate that family considerations can play a significant role. Kiessling et al. (2019) use data from the online survey ==== that elicits wage expectations of college students in Germany.==== Their findings attribute a larger role in explaining the gender gap in expected wages to occupational sorting and negotiation styles. Surprisingly, prospective child-related labor force interruptions have a relatively small effect in their framework, which focuses primarily on endowment effects. Fernandes et al. (2021) use data on wage expectations of students majoring in business at two Swiss colleges. Their findings confirm the importance of both fertility considerations and career preferences in explaining the gender gap in wage expectations, but focus mostly on endowment effects. Consistent with our results, they also find that both males and females overestimate their wages compared to actual ones. Furthermore, males respond in an overconfident manner to information about realized wages. Briel et al. (2022) decompose the gender gap in wage expectations for German university applicants. With an average age of 21 year these prospective students are older than those in our study and have already decided whether to invest in higher education. The authors carry out quantile regressions finding larger gaps at the bottom of the distribution. They find an important role of ====: men tend to overestimate both the average salary in their fields as well as their own likelihood to earn above this average. In a decomposition, these factors all help explain the gender gaps in expectations, leaving most other factors seemingly irrelevant.====Lastly, related studies by e.g. Reuben et al. (2017) and Wiswall and Zafar (2018) investigate the relationship between career motives, major choice and wage expectations among college students, using data from high-ability undergraduate students at New York University. Wiswall and Zafar (2018) confronts these students with multiple hypothetical job choice scenarios that vary in expected wages and other job characteristics. Their results show that, among others, women have a significantly higher willingness to pay (in terms of expected wages) for flexible working hours and more secure jobs than men. Since ==== can be interpreted as a form of higher flexibility in working hours, our findings are roughly in line with these results. However, we cannot confirm women’s high willingness to pay for secure jobs.==== Reuben et al. (2017) also investigates the role of preferences in explaining gender differences in wage expectations. Based on the same survey among New York University undergraduates they document a large gender gap in expected wages. While part of the gap is due to gender differences in college major choice, the gap in wage expectations within a college major still amounts to around 20%. They further show that gender differences in preferences such as overconfidence, competitiveness and risk aversion, explain 18% of the gender gap in expectations.====Our study stands out from the related literature on wage expectations as it combines central aspects of the before-mentioned studies. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze determinants of the gender gap in earnings expectations of individuals before their decision to invest in higher education by explicitly carrying out detailed decompositions at different margins. Moreover, our panel data allows to track students over time and assess the association of wage expectations with college enrollment. Lastly, and unlike most other studies, we consider different noncognitive abilities and career motives, such as ====, as potential drives of the gender gap. Our study therefore contributes to a better understanding of gender gaps in wage expectations and the interplay between educational investments and family and career considerations that take place already at a relatively early and crucial age.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data, provides detailed information on the measurement of wage expectations and presents descriptive statistics. Section 3 introduces the OB decomposition method. Section 4 presents the decomposition results, examining the role of different factors in explaining the gender gap in wage expectations. Section 5 shows associations of wage expectations with subsequent college enrollment.

We investigate whether household sorting in response to changes in K-12 school funding inhibits spending from reaching targeted students with a case study in Metro-Nashville Public Schools of the School Improvement Grant (SIG) program, which invested $7 billion in the nation’s lowest-achieving schools between 2009 and 2016. Using a boundary-discontinuity difference-in-differences design and home sales data, we estimate that households were willing to pay more than three times the average per-pupil grant award to live in SIG school zones. Neighborhoods zoned for SIG schools experienced moderate income and racial integration following funding receipt. However, evictions in these neighborhoods increased by 35%, and non-white enrollment at SIG schools declined by 15%. Our findings illustrate a major limitation of place-based public good provision: sorting may displace the initially targeted population.","K-12 education funding programs often target schools, rather than students directly. The federal government has distributed funding to high-poverty schools since 1965 through the Title I grant program, totaling $15 billion per year over the past decade. Because schools in the United States are broadly segregated by race and income (McGrew, 2019), programs that aim to increase resources available to disadvantaged students allocate additional funding to schools with large minority or low-income student populations. However, households may respond to shocks to school spending when choosing schools and neighborhoods, potentially reducing the effectiveness of such targeting. In particular, sorting in response to investments in local schools can result in housing price increases that reflect households’ valuation of the investments (Bayer et al., 2020, Bayer et al., 2007, Cellini et al., 2010, Tiebout, 1956). Household sorting of this nature may result in less effective targeting of education funding if disadvantaged families are priced out of neighborhoods zoned for newly improved schools.====We examine whether household sorting in response to changes in school funding inhibits spending from reaching targeted students with a case study of the effect of federal grants to low-performing schools in Metro-Nashville Public Schools (MNPS). We study the School Improvement Grant program (SIG), a Title I program that invested over $7 billion in the nation’s lowest-achieving schools between 2009 and 2016. Using real estate assessment and property transaction records linked to MNPS attendance zones, we find that home values in SIG-receiving school zones increased by 10.5% more than that of houses just outside the attendance zone boundary in response to the investment. Under the assumption that no other factors affecting house prices changed across attendance zone boundaries differentially before and after SIG treatment, our results indicate that households were willing to pay $3 for every dollar in per-pupil grant aid to live in SIG school zones.====This price increase is consistent with funding for education in SIG schools previously being suboptimally low (Oates, 1969) but also represents a potential barrier for low-income families to access newly improved schools. We characterize sorting in response to SIG and explore its consequences using Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) mortgage data, eviction counts from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, and school enrollment demographics. We show that following program roll-out homebuyers moving into previously majority–minority SIG attendance zones reported 9% higher income and were 13% more likely to be white. At the same time, the share of students at SIG schools who are white increased by almost 20%. In tandem with evidence of a 35% increase in evictions in neighborhoods zoned for treated schools and a 15% decline in nonwhite enrollment at SIG schools, our results suggest that SIG-induced gentrification displaced disadvantaged residents from their previous neighborhoods and schools.====We identify effects of school improvement grants on housing prices using a difference-in-differences design that appeals to the boundary-discontinuity estimations used in previous literature (Black, 1999, Schwartz et al., 2014). Exploiting variation in access to schools implementing SIG-funded interventions across space and time, we compare changes in prices of homes sold within a half-mile of attendance zone boundaries for SIG-treated schools. Causal interpretation rests on the assumption that home values of properties on either side of attendance zone boundaries for SIG schools would evolve in parallel in the absence of the program, which is supported by common trends in sale prices prior to SIG funding receipt. Our preferred specification restricts the sample to single-family home and duplex sales and includes boundary segment-by-year fixed effects that account for time-varying neighborhood amenities. However, our results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. We provide evidence that our estimations are not confounded by the Great Recession and housing crash, rising housing prices common to all neighborhoods zoned for low-performing schools, and changes in neighborhood demographics, but note with caution that we cannot rule out bias from other unobservable neighborhood amenities that differentially change just inside of SIG school zones compared to just outside these zones.====Next, we examine how sorting in response to SIG funding affected the demographic composition of neighborhoods and schools. To do so, we match CFPB mortgage data and eviction counts from the Eviction Lab to MNPS attendance zones. Difference-in-differences estimates that compare Census tracts or block groups within SIG attendance zones to those outside these zones before and after SIG receipt indicate that the reported income of mortgage applicants in neighborhoods zoned for SIG schools increased by 9% within two years of grant receipt and that the share of white home buyers rose by 13%. Enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reveal similar patterns of racial integration into SIG schools, with the share of students who are white increasing by almost 20% relative to that at non-SIG schools. These results suggest that SIG funding led to moderate integration by income and race in previously majority–minority neighborhoods. However, this influx of higher-income households into SIG neighborhoods also displaced some disadvantaged residents: evictions increased by 35% in neighborhoods zoned for SIG schools relative to non-SIG attendance zones after grant receipt, and nonwhite enrollment at SIG schools declined by 15%.====SIG likely had heterogeneous effects on housing prices across housing markets, and our primary estimates represent local average treatment effects from SIG’s implementation in Nashville, a booming housing market. We provide support for the generalizability of our findings by examining the household sorting response to SIG in California, a state where we observe eligibility and funding receipt for all SIG cohorts and which successfully used SIG funding to improve student achievement in low-performing schools (Friday, 2021). Matching data on housing prices, mortgage characteristics, and evictions to school attendance zones in California, we estimate a difference-in-differences specification that compares changes in neighborhoods zoned for schools that received SIG funding to those zoned for SIG-eligible schools that did not receive grants. We find evidence of willingness-to-pay for school funding and neighborhood sorting that is broadly consistent with the results from our case study: for every $1000 in per-pupil SIG funding, home values in California increased by 3% and the reported income of homebuyers in neighborhoods zoned for SIG schools increased by 3.5%.====Our analysis advances existing research on the relationship between school characteristics and home values by estimating the capitalization of SIG funding (and any associated changes in school quality) into local housing prices. Prior research finds that housing prices increase by 3%–10% in response to a standard deviation increase in school achievement==== and found that households are willing to pay more than $1 for every dollar increase in K-12 spending (Barrow and Rouse, 2004, Bayer et al., 2020, Cellini et al., 2010). We contribute to this literature by estimating willingness-to-pay for school spending targeting schools at the bottom of the achievement distribution, where additional funding may be especially impactful. Our estimates of over a $3 increase in house price for a dollar in per-pupil grant aid suggest that education funding among this subgroup falls well below the efficient level of provision (Oates, 1969).====Our results also add to a growing literature examining how changes in the provision of K-12 education influence neighborhood sorting. Notable policies addressing the inequitable provision of K-12 education include desegregation, school choice, and funding increases targeting low-performing schools. Baum-Snow and Lutz (2011) show that court-ordered school desegregation efforts induced white-flight into suburban school districts. Moreover, previous research shows that both “exit options” (Schwartz et al., 2014, Zheng, 2019) and “forced choice” (Wigger, 2020) varieties of school choice weaken the link between neighborhood school characteristics and home values.==== If our results are interpreted as causal, we extend this literature by showing that investments to improve low-performing schools can make neighborhoods served by those schools more desirable and attract wealthier households. Together, these findings indicate the need to consider the potential for neighborhood sorting and displacement when designing K-12 finance and assignment policies aiming to make schooling more equitable.====More broadly, this paper contributes to literatures on the relationship between public good provision and housing markets and the nature of gentrification of low-income neighborhoods. Following SIG-funded interventions, wealthier and whiter residents moved into neighborhoods zoned for SIG schools. Integration into SIG school zones is consistent with the pattern of sorting found in response to other education-related policies (Billings et al., 2017) and broader place-based policies targeting low-income neighborhoods (Diamond & McQuade, 2019). We contribute to these findings by testing whether sorting displaces existing residents of neighborhoods benefiting from increased public good provision. In contrast to previous literature on gentrification, which found little empirical evidence of displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods (Disalvo, 2022, McKinnish et al., 2010), our results suggest that gentrification displaced a non-negligible share of existing residents of SIG neighborhoods via increased evictions. Taken together, our findings illustrate a major limitation of place-based public good provision: sorting, or concurrent gentrification, may displace the initially targeted population.",Turning around schools (and neighborhoods?): School improvement grants and gentrification,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000298,3 April 2023,2023,Research Article,11.0

In particular, the CRE effect varies based on locality and access to reading materials, with a larger effect on students residing in ==== or close to public libraries. However, the positive effects on low-income students diminish over time; CRE does not show impacts on the scores of students from better-off families either.","Early childhood development is essential to an individual’s subsequent life outcomes. The literature has documented early childhood intervention as an effective means of improving academic achievement for disadvantaged children and reducing the gap between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged counterparts (====, Deming, 2009; Heckman et al., 2010; Magnuson and Duncan, 2016; York et al., 2018)..====This paper assesses the effects of a reading intervention program, Cocky’s Reading Express (CRE), on children’s academic outcomes. CRE is a literacy outreach program of the University of South Carolina (UofSC) founded by a group of undergraduate students in 2005 with a mission to promote literacy among children in South Carolina. Under this program, UofSC students and the university mascot Cocky visit children in pre-kindergarten (pre-K) through second grade in underserved public schools to read aloud to them and give each child a book of their own.====CRE may improve academic performance via several channels. First, the reading sessions may spark children’s interest in books and help them understand the importance of lifelong reading. Young children likely look up to college students from a flagship university and the beloved figure Cocky and thus take their advice to read seriously (Prilosadoso et al., 2021, Ross et al., 1984). The book gifts may remind them of the CRE visit so that their motivation lasts longer. When children get more motivated to read, parents are also more likely to share reading with them (Preece & Levy, 2020). Second, the gifts of books help enhance home literacy environment. The physical proximity of books increases children’s exploration of and engagement with books and thus improves their literacy outcomes (Lindsay, 2010, Neuman, 1999). More importantly, the presence of age-appropriate books at home may incentivize parents to initiate and maintain book reading routines (Bus et al., 1995, Kalb and van Ours, 2014, Neuman et al., 2021). Third, CRE hands out leaflets of book recommendations and information on community literacy resources in addition to books. When parents are better informed about quality reading materials and where to access them, they may become more likely to utilize such resources. Last, reading provides information across the curriculum (Grimm, 2008). Hence, CRE may positively impact student performance in subjects other than reading by improving literacy skills (Glenberg et al., 2012, Grimm, 2008, Hubner et al., 2022). CRE may also inspire increased motivation for learning so that participants may perform better in all subjects. Notably, families of low socioeconomic status (SES) typically have fewer books at home than higher-SES families. Low-SES parents are also less likely to share book reading, utilize community literacy resources, and have linguistic interaction with their children. Therefore, CRE may particularly benefit children from disadvantaged family backgrounds.====I link the CRE visits over the years, which are recorded by school and grade, to the individual-level English Language Arts (ELA) and math scores in statewide tests of elementary students. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I compare the test scores of students visited by CRE to those not visited in the previous school year, controlling for student demographics, including measures of poverty, school characteristics that may affect student performance, and unobserved heterogeneity across grades and schools. Though children do not self-select into the CRE sessions, CRE may choose the schools to visit according to school attributes unobserved to econometricians but relevant to student outcomes. Therefore, I match a visited school-year observation to the “nearest neighbor” in the control group so that a matched pair of schools are geographically close, share common student characteristics, and garner similar educational resources. The only difference is that the CRE visits one school but not the other in that particular year. Then, I add the matched-pair fixed effects to the difference-in-differences model to control for the unobserved heterogeneity across (pairs of) schools. Alternatively, I calculate the difference, or “distance”, between a matched pair and restrict the sample to schools with the distance in the bottom quartile. This way, the treated and control groups are balanced in the observables.====The empirical results suggest that CRE visits improve the test scores of elementary school students from low-income households but have little impact on their higher-income peers. Specifically, the ELA scores of low-SES students increase by 0.02 to 0.03 standard deviations one year after a CRE visit; the impact on the math scores of the same demographic group is smaller and only significant in some specifications. Moreover, the effect of CRE on the ELA scores decreases in the subsequent years; the improvement in the math scores takes more time to manifest and is also slightly more persistent than that in ELA.====I next explore the heterogeneous effects of CRE to shed light on the mechanisms of why this program enhances student academic outcomes. First, I find that low-income students in schools where the school library offers fewer books per student enjoy a slightly larger increase in their test scores than their counterparts whose school library has more resources. This finding may suggest that the books gifted to children who are most deprived of reading materials, either at school or at home, make a difference in promoting a scholarly culture at home (Evans et al., 2010).====Second, the effects of CRE vary by the potential access to literacy resources. In particular, the impacts of CRE on disadvantaged children appear more evident in metropolitan areas than in rural areas. Low-SES students also experience more significant test score increases if they live close to a public library. The improvements among these students are even larger if CRE visits a school right before school vacations when students presumably use library services more intensively (Gilpin & Bekkerman, 2020). The CRE events and the gifts of books may have children and their families start a reading routine and utilize extra reading materials they would not otherwise use. Because CRE provides information regarding community literacy resources, students with easier access to such resources, either because they reside in a metropolitan area or close to public libraries, are more likely to take advantage of them and improve their academic performance accordingly. These findings may verify that, while book ownership exerts an important influence in its own right, the increased support at home, either through shared reading activities or efforts to garner additional reading materials, may also account for the child outcomes (Neuman et al., 2021).====This paper has three main contributions to the literature. First, this paper contributes to a large economic literature on early childhood interventions. This literature largely focuses on the impacts of preschool programs (====, Magnuson et al., 2007; Deming, 2009; van Huizen & Plantenga, 2018). This paper extends this literature by examining a reading intervention, Cocky’s Reading Express, that affects home-based inputs to early childhood development. Although there is no data directly measuring home inputs, the current results may imply that families increase their literacy-promoting activities post-CRE visits and confirm several studies in other fields that demonstrate a positive association between book gifting and parental interest in and frequency of shared book reading, public library use, and the number of children’s books at home (de Bondt et al., 2020, Neuman, 1999). Second, the paper adds to a broad multidisciplinary literature that evaluates reading interventions and book distribution programs (====, Kim & Quinn, 2013 ; de Bondt et al., 2020; Neuman et al., 2021). Notably, most of these studies are in realms other than economics; they are often based on small samples and fail to address the endogenous self-selection of participants. This paper fills the gap and provides causal estimates using administrative student data. The paper also highlights the role of community literacy resources that may improve the effectiveness of school-based reading interventions. Lastly, relative to other reading interventions, CRE is unique in that it combines reading sessions, book gifting, and information dissemination. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no other book giveaway program studied in the literature contains all these elements. The three aspects of CRE may complement each other so that a modest intervention like the CRE can generate economically meaningful academic improvements among low-SES students. The findings also confirm the argument in the existing literature that personal contact is crucial to the efficacy of book giveaway programs (de Bondt et al., 2020).====The findings in this paper have important policy implications. Book giveaway programs are a relatively low-cost strategy to promote early childhood literacy and have been adopted in many countries and served millions of families. Technology advancement may reduce the cost further as electronic books become more common in book distribution (de Bondt et al., 2020), although the influence of e-books on child reading is questionable (Furenes et al., 2021). To close the achievement gap between disadvantaged and advantaged children, which emerges even before they start kindergarten, reducing the disparities in book availability to children becomes more important than ever. The COVID-19 global pandemic has dramatically sped up the digitalization of education, while the adoption of technology in education likely broadens, rather than narrows, these gaps (Gordanier et al., 2022, Vigdor et al., 2014). The closure of schools and public libraries due to the pandemic further limits student access to books and other educational resources, which disproportionately hurts the learning of young and low-SES students (US Department of Education, 2021, Weiland et al., 2021). Book distribution programs may attenuate the problem by providing free and inexpensive books and learning materials to children in low-income communities (Aridi, 2020). Therefore, it is of critical importance to understand which delivery model can efficiently inspire book reading and how organizations that offer books and supports to families can reach those most in need. Analyzing the effects of CRE on children’s academic outcomes may thus provide potential answers to these questions. The empirical results in this paper may verify the pivotal role of personal connection in book giveaway programs for both parents and children. As CRE has shown little impact on children from nonpoor families, books given to high-SES families are likely a redundancy of efforts and a waste of resources.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 conducts a review of relevant literature; Section 3 describes the program of Cocky’s Reading Express in further detail; Section 4 discusses the data employed in the analysis; Section 5 introduces the empirical strategies; Section 6 presents and discusses the regression results; finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.",Book matters: The effect of Cocky’s Reading Express on student performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000420,30 March 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

Our findings are in line with those in the previous literature showing a modest effect of tracking (i.e., ability sorting) in advanced countries where the autonomous school system is well organized and commercial educational services are easily accessible and a strong positive effect of tracking in developing countries where access to well-resourced private schools and private education is generally limited.","Educational tracking is the practice of sorting students into different educational tracks based on academic achievement. Although tracking has been implemented through various means, two types of tracks are currently widely used: within-school tracking, which groups students by ability at the classroom level, and between-school tracking, which assigns students to different schools according to exam scores and other admission criteria.====The introduction of tracking influences student learning because the changes in classroom peer characteristics and the behavior of teachers and parents could be affected by tracking status. For example, within-school tracking could improve educational achievement for all students by improving teaching quality but could reduce the positive spillover effect for low-achieving students by decreasing peer diversity within the classroom (Zimmer, 2003).====It is empirically challenging to identify the causal effect of tracking on student performance. One reason for this is that student assignment across schools and across classrooms within a school is generally not random. Behavioral responses from teachers, principals, and parents also make the causal link uncertain. Teachers might change instructional strategies and teaching materials to better fit heterogeneous students academically, and principals might hire more (or fewer) staff and teachers to adapt to the new system. Parents who are potentially worried about the adverse effects of detracking might employ private tutors to supplement their children's formal education in school. Certainly, the degree of discretionary responses from teachers, principals, and parents to detracking could depend upon their endowments and circumstances.====This paper examines the impact of between-school detracking on student academic performance using a data set from Korean high schools, including schools that transitioned from tracking to detracking in 2002. We use KSAT score population data from 1999 to 2007, which allows us to use within-school variations over time between tracked and detracked schools. We combine the KSAT score data with local education department data, which provides rich information on school characteristics. The combined data set allows us to examine the effects of detracking and its attenuation.====Our results from difference-in-differences (DID) estimations show that the transition to detracking significantly reduced KSAT Korean (reading), mathematics, and English scores by 0.16, 0.18, and 0.16 of one standard deviation (SD; 1 SD is equivalent to 30 out of 100 maximum points), respectively. Because transitions to detracking started in the 1970s in Korea, the negative effect of detracking on test scores should have been well-known when they were introduced in 2002. Thus, we examine the role of school autonomy and private tutoring in buffering the negative effect of detracking. First, to determine how schools responded to the negative effects of detracking, we exploit private school status. Unlike in the United States and other European countries, in Korea, students are randomly assigned across high schools within the detracked district, including both private and public schools. Therefore, private high schools cannot select their students by using their own admission criteria. However, private schools in Korea have autonomy and more discretion in making changes to reverse the negative effects of detracking than public schools do. Our empirical results show that public schools entirely drive the negative effect of detracking, with no statistically significant drop in test scores for private schools.====Second, we use another source of data, the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), to examine whether parents had attempted to reverse the negative shock of detracking by using private tutoring services—a popular supplement to school education. We find that students in detrack schools used private tutoring services significantly more than those in tracking schools. Notably, we find that even after controlling for household-level income, the detracking effect on the use of private tutoring services is all positive. This result implies that even poor parents invested in private tutoring services to counter the negative effects of detracking. Given that private tutoring services raise student achievement, the increase in the use of tutoring may mitigate the negative effects of detracking.====Our findings suggest several policy implications. First, school detracking did not reduce test score gaps among schools. Because the introduction of school detracking is to minimize test score inequality across schools, this finding implies that the detracking policy did not attain the intended goal but had some unintended consequences, such as the deterioration of academic achievement. Second, the effects of detracking may be much smaller in advanced countries than in developing countries. This is because the autonomous education system and commercial education market are likely to be better established in advanced countries. Finally, our results show that households at all income levels increased their private tutoring expenditures to maintain the same level of academic achievement. This result implies that school detracking may pose a financial burden on lower-income households.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous literature on tracking and discusses our study's contributions. Section 3 provides institutional details about South Korea's secondary education system and the introduction of detracking in South Korea and describes the data.

In the context of the Chinese meta-major reforms that transition from ==== choice to ==== choice, we provide the first experimental evidence on the information frictions and heterogeneous preferences that students have in their response to the meta-major option. In a randomized experiment with a nationwide sample of 11,424 high school graduates, we find that providing information on the benefits of a meta-major significantly increased students’ willingness to choose the meta-major; however, information about specific majors and assignment mechanisms did not affect students major choice preferences. We also find that information provision mostly affected the preferences of students who were from disadvantaged backgrounds, lacked accurate information, did not have clear major preferences, or were risk loving.","College major choice, which affects individuals’ long-term career choices and skill compositions in the workforce, has been brought to the forefront of the global higher education policy agenda (Altonji et al., 2012, 2016; Patnaik, Wiswall, & Zafar, 2020). One of the most important mechanism design policies in college admissions is for students to choose a college major sequentially (==== choice) or jointly (==== choice). Unlike countries such as the United States and Canada, which allow students to declare a major after they enroll at colleges, many other countries employ ==== admissions policies that require students to choose a college-major pair jointly when they submit their applications (Bordon & Fu, 2015; Che, Hahm, Kim, Kim, & Tercieux, 2022; Kirkeboen et al., 2016; Krussig & Neilson, 2021; Machado & Szerman, 2021; Meyer, Leuze, & Strauss, 2021).==== The ==== choice provides students with more specialized training upon college enrollment and helps confer degrees quickly and efficiently. Alternatively, the ==== choice allows students to explore and develop their major-specific interests during college with a low switching cost. The question as to which policy is better for a targeted group of students depends on students’ sorting behaviors, which may be relevant to students’ academic achievement, major choice preferences, risk attitudes, and information frictions they encounter in the application process; however, little is known about how students would behaviorally respond to the two different college major choice policies.====This paper fills this gap by examining students’ college-major choice behaviors in a recent national reforms of college-major admissions in China, which has the world's largest centralized college matching market (Chen & Kesten, 2017). The reforms, allowing a subset of elite colleges to switch from the traditional ==== applications and admissions to ==== applications and admissions, have been implemented in China in the past two decades. The core of the university-level reforms is the implementation of meta-major, which clusters relevant academic majors into a larger cohesive bucket (e.g., a science meta-major includes all science-related majors).==== These meta-major reforms across colleges provide a unique opportunity to empirically study students’ preferences for different college major choice mechanisms.====Recent literature shows that delaying specialization in a ==== choice mechanism is conducive to helping students discover their comparative advantage and increases student-major match quality and student welfare (Bordon & Fu, 2015; Che, Hahm, Kim, Kim, & Tercieux, 2022). A meta-major simplifies major choices when applying to colleges, delays students’ final major declaration, and provides a wide range of deferred major choice opportunities that improve students’ major fits. However, unless all students can freely declare the majors in which they are most interested, they face significant uncertainties in the final major choices and risks of being assigned to less-preferred majors during college. Thus, the effects of meta-major reforms on students’ college-major choice behaviors are ambiguous, depending on how students respond to different components and characteristics of the reforms. In a companion paper (Li, Ma, Ye, & Zhu, 2022), using unique administrative data on college-major admissions over 18 years, we identify the policy impacts of the staggered adoption of the reforms across institutions on student composition using a difference-in-differences design. We find that the meta-major reforms generally have a minimal impact on the distribution of ability and demographic characteristics of students by college-majors, suggesting that the meta-major reforms do not significantly change students’ college-major choice behaviors.====In this paper, using a randomized experiment with a nationwide sample of college applicants, we focus on understanding why students did not respond to the ==== reforms in a favorable way as expected by policymakers and institutional practitioners. One important reason might be information frictions. That is, students lack critical information on meta-majors when they compare a meta-major option consisting of many majors in a cluster with other traditionally single college-major options. As we will discuss in detail later, the official guide that the Ministry of Education provides to college applicants often does not list the specific majors contained in a meta-major, nor information about how students would be eventually assigned to specific majors after enrolling in a meta-major. Additionally, students may also have incomplete information or biased beliefs about the potential benefits and risks associated with ==== choice versus ==== choice (Patnaik, Wiswall, & Zafar, 2020). Therefore, students’ college-major choices can be largely affected by what information about a meta-major is available to them and how the information is presented, communicated, or consumed.====This paper presents the first experimental evidence on the information frictions and heterogeneous preferences that students have in their response to the meta-major option. Using a large-scale randomized informational experiment with a random sample of nationwide college applicants, we examine the impacts of different information components about meta-majors on students’ college-major choices. We further study to what extent students’ heterogeneous preferences mediate how they respond to various kinds of information on meta-majors. By combining the experimental evidence with text data obtained from a popular Chinese online discussion board, our results provide novel implications on the heterogeneous impacts and potential mechanisms of the ==== to ==== reforms on students’ college-major choice decisions.====We collaborated with the Chinese Society of Educational Development Strategy (CSEDS), the primary think tank of the Ministry of Education of China, to implement the experiment with a nationwide sample of high school graduates of class 2020 (11,424 students from 268 high schools) via an online survey platform. The survey was conducted by the CSEDS to monitor high school students’ development and the consequences of college admissions by randomly sampling nationwide. We took advantage of the survey to test the impacts of the three most important information elements of the meta-major reforms summarized from the explorative qualitative analysis prior to the experiment: (1) the specific majors offered by a meta-major, (2) the benefits of choosing a meta-major versus choosing a specific major, and (3) the assignment mechanisms and corresponding risks of major declarations in a meta-major. When making their college major choices, students may be provided with information on the specific majors offered by each meta-major; however, this information may not be salient enough for many students.==== Moreover, students may have information frictions in accessing and/or understanding the information about the benefits and the assignment mechanisms (Arcidiacono et al., 2016). In our experimental module, students were asked to declare their willingness to choose a meta-major (versus the traditional college majors) after being randomly presented with different pieces of information related to the meta-major.====Results show that information regarding the benefits of meta-majors statistically significantly increased students’ willingness to apply to them by approximately 6 percentage points. This was an 8 percent increase from the control mean of 71%. In contrast, information about specific majors and assignment mechanisms did not significantly affect students’ willingness to apply to a meta major. We find clear evidence that students held heterogeneous beliefs on multiple aspects of a meta-major, which could affect their major choice: all three types of information had larger impacts on those students who were (1) from disadvantaged backgrounds, (2) had limited access to college-major choice information and guidance, (3) did not have strong preferences for specific majors, and (4) risk lovers.====To interpret those experimental results, we investigated students’ revealed preferences for meta-majors using qualitative data from one of the largest Chinese online discussion boards and supplemental focus group interviews. The analysis shows that students varied greatly in their responses to the meta-major reforms based on their heterogeneous beliefs. Some students were concerned about various aspects of the meta majors, including, but not limited to, major and course settings, cross-disciplinary training, study burden, assignment mechanisms, and education equity. Some students had different opinions and attitudes toward this new meta-major setting, which may be correlated with their information frictions driven by their socioeconomic background. Those results are consistent with the experimental findings. Given that information frictions are common among Chinese college applicants (Ye, 2023), the increased willingness of applying to meta majors from simple information provision also helps explain the null impacts of the reforms on students’ actual college application behaviors as documented in Li, Ma, Ye, & Zhu, 2022.====Our paper contributes new empirical evidence in the following three aspects. First, since most countries only use one type of admission mechanisms (==== choice or ==== choice), little is known about the potential consequences of switching from one mechanism to the other.==== The meta-major reforms from ==== choice to ==== choice in China provide us with a unique opportunity to study students’ preference between ==== choice and ==== choice. We extend the literature by integrating a randomized experiment on 11,424 high school graduates with qualitative analysis and providing one of the first pieces of empirical evidence on different major-choice mechanisms. Second, students across the world are all confronted with the problems of information frictions in choosing a college major.==== The meta-major reforms, as important university-level reforms that switch from ==== to ==== admissions, greatly affect students’ college choices and subsequent careers. However, students face more challenges in obtaining and analyzing information about what the meta-major means and how their final majors would be determined in a meta-major. We use the experiment to test how varied information would affect students’ decision-making. The results provide the evidence base for future policy-making to improve the major choice mechanism designs. Finally, in the early years of the meta-major reforms, colleges also faced certain uncertainties about how to cluster different majors into one meta-major. They also lack knowledge about how students with heterogeneous preferences respond to different meta-majors and related information exposure. Our paper provides pivotal implications not only for students making one of the most important decisions of their lives but also for higher education institutions reforming college-major choice mechanisms to attract a more talented and diverse student body.",College-major choice to college-then-major choice: Experimental evidence from Chinese college admissions reforms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000274,16 March 2023,2023,Research Article,14.0

Over the course of showing the limitations of using FRM data to measure poverty, we also provide early evidence on the potential value of two alterative measures of school poverty.","Free and reduced-price meal (FRM) enrollment under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) plays a central role in identifying high-poverty students in U.S. education policy. For example, under the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the accountability systems of all fifty states plus Washington DC track gaps in student achievement by poverty status, and 84 percent (all but six states and Washington DC) use FRM data to identify high-poverty students. FRM data are also used to allocate federal, state, and local funding with the goal of targeting resources toward schools serving low-income children.==== The scholarly community is similarly reliant on FRM data to identify high-poverty students for a variety of research-based applications (Domina et al., 2018).====While FRM data are commonly used in these roles, it is well-understood that FRM designations are error-prone, blunt indicators of poverty that obscure wide variation in income within FRM status bins (Domina et al., 2018; Harwell & LeBeau, 2010; Michelmore & Dynarski, 2017; Parsons, Koedel & Tan, 2019). There is also evidence that FRM status is awarded to more students than income-eligibility thresholds would imply. For example, Bass (2010) shows disparate trends in youth poverty rates measured inside and outside of schools from the 1970s through the early 2000s, while Domina et al. (2018) link FRM data to IRS tax records and show that FRM status is awarded to more students than income data suggest should be eligible.====We complement these previous studies by using two new data sources to evaluate the accuracy of FRM data for measuring student poverty in the state of Missouri. The first is administrative records on student direct certification (DC) status. DC data capture participation in social service programs outside of public schools, for which income-eligibility is more carefully vetted than participation in the NSLP. The second data source is recently-developed “school neighborhood poverty” (SNP) metrics made available by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). These metrics are estimated for schools using data on incomes of nearby households and were first made available by the NCES in 2016. Both data sources are independently promising for measuring poverty. We increase our confidence in their reliability by validating them against each other, which confirms they contain similar information (on average) in Missouri. We then use them to assess the accuracy of NSLP-based poverty designations.====Our findings complement previous work by Bass (2010) and Domina et al. (2018) by showing that students’ FRM designations overstate poverty. We extend the literature by directly estimating the magnitude of the overstatement, which is substantial—for instance, we find that free-meal enrollment in Missouri is oversubscribed by 35–50 percent relative to the stated income threshold in the NSLP. We further show that NSLP enrollment was oversubscribed prior to the NSLP's community eligibility provision (CEP), though the CEP has made it worse.====Our most credible estimates of oversubscription in the NSLP apply to Missouri and the income threshold at 130 percent of the poverty line, where we can triangulate all three of our data sources: NSLP data, DC data, and SNP data. The DC data are a limiting factor to expanding our analysis: we only have these data from Missouri, and they only plausibly identify children from families at this specific income threshold. However, under some additional assumptions (described below), we extend our investigation of students’ NSLP designations using the SNP data in two ways. First, we examine free-meal (FM) and reduced-meal (RM) designations separately. Our findings suggest most of the oversubscription in the NSLP is in the “free meal” category. Second, we analyze a larger sample of 27 states and estimate that NSLP enrollment is oversubscribed in the larger sample at a rate similar to Missouri, on average. The 27-state expansion further reveals considerable heterogeneity across states in the mapping between SNP- and NSLP-based poverty measures, which we identify as an important area for exploration in future research.====We contribute to a thin literature on a topic of great importance for contemporary education research and policy in the United States. We show that FRM data do not measure poverty in public schools accurately and that the errors are substantial and asymmetric. There are several possible explanations for the persistent overstatement of poverty rates in FRM data, with a prominent one being that districts are incentivized to identify students as FRM-eligible but are not similarly incentivized to do so accurately.====These findings refute the common misperception that FRM data have historically served to measure poverty (e.g., prior to the CEP). Instead, as our results make clear, FRM data have captured the nebulous concept of student disadvantage, albeit under the guise of measuring poverty. This longstanding misperception is causing two problems in contemporary education policy. First, it is hampering the use of modern data systems to develop new and more accurate poverty metrics. For instance, old rates of FRM enrollment are being used as benchmarks for assessing the accuracy of new poverty metrics (e.g., see Croninger, Rice & Checovich, 2015; Grich, 2019; Massachusetts Department of Elementary & Secondary Education, 2017). In addition, in some states, CEP-adopting schools and districts that no longer collect FRM data are being forced to report poverty using alternative metrics. If these schools and districts do not build measures that match (high) FRM-based poverty rates, it can put them at a disadvantage in state funding and other policies, even if the FRM-based rates are not correct.==== Second, it contributes to resistance to the idea of moving away from poverty designations in policy applications and toward the arguably more useful concept of disadvantage designations. Hence, a greater awareness of what FRM data really measure may lead to more productive conversations about measuring student need in public schools.",Free and reduced-price meal enrollment does not measure student poverty: Evidence and policy significance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000213,10 March 2023,2023,Research Article,15.0

While CAL interventions have been shown to be effective internationally and elsewhere in China, these have been mostly offline CAL programs that are difficult and costly to implement. An online CAL (OCAL) may be able to bypass many of offline CAL's implementation problems and enhance the remedial tutoring experience. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of an OCAL intervention on the academic and non-academic performance of students and to explore the mechanism behind OCAL's impact. According to the findings, OCAL improved overall English scores of students in the treatment group relative to the control group by 0.48 ","Improving education for poor and disadvantaged populations has been a long-standing challenge for both developed and developing countries (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008, 2012). This is perhaps especially true for developing countries undergoing economic transitions, typically from an economy reliant on labor-intensive manufacturing to one based on skill-based industries. When a significant portion of a country's labor force has relatively low educational attainment, the resulting shortage of human capital impedes further economic advancement (Khor et al., 2016). In addition, disparities between a country's urban and rural education systems may lead to long-term disparities in human capital acquisition and income between urban and rural populations, with serious implications for a country's growth and stability (Li et al., 2010, 2012).====In China, millions of students from rural areas and migrant communities lag behind their urban counterparts in terms of academic achievement. For example, Lai et al. (2013) found that fourth-grade students living in poor, rural areas had significantly lower scores in core subject areas compared to their urban peers. Even though China's government has already passed a number of compulsory education mandates aimed at remedying this issue, such as increasing the number of rural students attending school, or increasing the number of years of schooling attended by rural students, it has placed less emphasis on improving the overall quality of rural education (Wang et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2017b; Lai et al., 2013).====One major reason why rural students in China fall behind—and stay behind—urban students academically, is because they are much more likely to lack access to remedial academic support. When urban students fall behind in school, they often have access to affordable remedial tutoring services offered to them by their teachers, commercial sources, or family members (Huang and Du, 2007; Lai et al., 2015). Students in rural areas, however, tend to have far less access to sources offering remedial tutoring (Lai et al., 2013). In addition, studies have found that many rural parents are unable to assist their children academically because they either live and work far away from their children, or they have low educational attainment themselves (Mo et al., 2015).====Internationally, some educators have addressed the problem of unequal access to remedial education for marginalized or disadvantaged populations through an education technology known as computer-assisted learning (CAL). In the current study, we define CAL as any kind of computer-related or computer-based software program created for improving a user's learning outcome in a specific subject area (Rouse & Krueger, 2004). However, we note that there are several different, more narrow definitions of CAL used in the literature. One such definition refers to CAL as the “well-defined” use of software packages designed to develop particular skills, such as improving math computation (Escueta et al., 2017). A second definition refers to CAL as an intelligent tutoring system that transmits knowledge to users using artificial intelligence to meet the specific needs of each learner (Dalgarno, 2001). Finally, a third definition refers to CAL as any learning method that may be run on a computer platform, such as online courses and online learning, and is delivered one-to-one or one-to-many (Schittek et al., 2001). This paper adopts the first and second definitions of CAL. While some forms of CAL are limited to purely giving students exercises in a drill-and-practice format, others offer students remedial learning materials in the form of gamified interfaces with the aim of improving educational outcomes via cultivating a long-term interest in learning (Inal & Cagiltay, 2007; Schaefer & Warren, 2004).====Past studies on CAL's effectiveness have been mostly promising, yet there have been somewhat mixed results. On the one hand, Escueta et al. (2017) identified 29 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of CAL experimental studies run in developed countries, among which 20 of the studies showed positive effects on student learning outcomes, eight found no effects, and one found a negative effect . On the other hand, some studies have concluded that the effects of CAL differ according to the target subject, and that the choice of subject could matter when analyzing the mechanisms behind program effects (Almekhlafi, 2006; Bianchi et al., 2022; Zhang & Zou, 2022; Sariman & Cetin, 2018; Seo & Bryant, 2009; Bayturan & Keşan, 2012; Nikou & Economides, 2018; Shannon et al., 2015).====Recently, CAL has become increasingly popular for use in developing countries, and experimental studies on the impact of CAL have been conducted in countries such as India and China. For example, Muralidharan et al. (2019) studied the impact of a personalized technology-aided after-school instruction program and found that math scores and Hindi scores improved by 0.37 SDs and 0.23 SDs, respectively. CAL has also been found to be effective in the context of rural China. Bai et al. (2016), Lai et al. (2013, 2015, 2016), Mo et al. (2014, 2015), and Yang et al. (2013) all offer evidence from randomized experiments showing that CAL can improve learning outcomes among disadvantaged rural students in China. Moreover, aside from improving academic performance, CAL programs have been found to exert beneficial effects on non-academic outcomes, such as a student's self-confidence and their interest in schooling (Lai et al., 2013). In sum, the international literature generally shows that CAL programs have been effective in raising both academic and non-academic outcomes in developing settings.====Yet while CAL programs have been found to be effective in rural China, there exist implementation drawbacks in regards to the type of CAL technology used in previous interventions. To the best of our knowledge, CAL interventions in China have nearly all used offline CAL programs providing tutoring courses powered by a set of gamified remedial exercises and learning materials. Interviews with the Principal Investigators of earlier China-based offline CAL studies revealed that at least 50 h per school per semester had been spent on the software installation, testing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance required to implement and manage the offline CAL interventions and evaluations, as offline CAL programs must be preloaded onto computers and run without Internet access. Additionally, in-person training workshops were needed for both teachers and students, and virus threats to computers were a constant source of program interruption. These factors thus make offline CAL programs expensive and time-consuming, which in turn may dissuade policymakers from upscaling CAL technology to a large number of schools.====With online computer-assisted learning (OCAL hereafter), many of these problems are remedied, which may be advantageous for improving CAL's effectiveness in the context of rural China. First, OCAL eliminates the need to manually install and maintain software on each computer hardware and lowers the costs and time demands placed on program teachers who are often already overworked. Second, the ability to log in anywhere and at anytime may be able to increase student access, as students can open the program software on any computer they have access to that has Internet connectivity, instead of only through those on which the CAL software is installed. Third, the OCAL software system allows for the integration of features into the program offering interaction between different users (e.g., students can compete with peers on quizzes and earn virtual prizes; the software system can also provide an automated ranking system that may further motivate student learning) (Borgatti & Cross, 2003; Holmes & O'loughlin, 2014). Since offline CAL has already been demonstrated to improve student academic performance in rural China, we hypothesize that OCAL will improve student academic performance by an even larger amount at a lower cost.====To our knowledge, few if any OCAL programs using online remedial tutoring have been rigorously evaluated in rural China. Though there exist some studies on online courses or internet-based CAL in the context of other countries, they provide limited evidence relevant to rural China. In addition, the results of these studies have been mixed. Of studies that have produced positive effects, Deault et al. (2009) used a web-based literacy program to help students with reading; results showed that significant positive effects of the intervention were evident for about half of the reading and related measures, and the program might have helped kids with attention problems. Kelly et al. (2013), another study that found positive effects, used a CAL program that provided online homework support to students, and achieved an effect size of 0.56 SDs on math. There are studies that have found no significant impacts, however, proposing that CAL has no advantage over traditional methods of learning. For example, Rouse and Krueger (2004) evaluated the Fast ForWord computer-based language training program on students and detected null results. Van Klaveren et al. (2017) compared an adaptive CAL program against a static (non-adaptive) one, showing no statistically significant improvement from the adaptive CAL program relative to a non-adaptive CAL program. Therefore, due to the mixed nature of the existing literature, it is difficult to propose an estimate of the effectiveness of OCAL based on previous research; additionally, context-specific studies remain necessary in rural China.====To fill in these gaps, the overall goal of this paper is to examine the impact of OCAL on the academic and non-academic performance of rural and migrant students in China. To achieve this goal, we have four sub-objectives. For our first sub-objective, we examine OCAL's impact on student academic performance measured by their English score, and use math scores to test for potential spillover effects. We chose English as our OCAL program subject for several reasons. First, English is one of the main subjects used to test students as part of the competitive examination system in China that allows students to compete for positions in high schools and colleges (Bolton & Graddol, 2012; McKay, 2002; Davey et al., 2007). In fact, the subject of English takes up about one-third of the test for both the high school and college entrance exams. Second, English teaching and English learning is particularly weak in rural China (Ma et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2017b). Studies have shown that a low English score is one of the most important factors keeping rural students from attending high school in China (Loyalka, 2014; Li et al., 2021), and rural English teachers are also of notoriously poor quality (Hu, 2003, 2005, 2009; Mo et al., 2020). Given the importance of English for advancing in school in China, and due to the current status of English education in rural China's schools, we decided it would be most appropriate to test an OCAL program focused on improving English skills among rural students. For our second sub-objective, we measure OCAL's impact on non-academic outcomes, in particular on student self-efficacy and student attitudes towards teachers, courses, and schools. For our third sub-objective, we attempt to explain the mechanism behind OCAL's effectiveness by examining a number of possible reasons behind its impact. Finally, we conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine OCAL's feasibility in relation to traditional offline CAL interventions.====To meet these objectives, we will present the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving an OCAL intervention with over 1650 fifth-grade students in 44 schools located in rural areas and migrant communities across China. Results show that the OCAL intervention improved the English performance of students in the treatment group (relative to those of the control group) by 0.48 standard deviations, which is larger than the impact (0.15 SD) found in previous offline CAL studies focused on English learning in rural China (Bai et al., 2016). We also find that OCAL improved the attitudes of students towards English class but had no significant effect on their attitudes towards their English teachers.====After rejecting the possibility that the results were due to either a Hawthorne Effect or self-efficacy-induced changes, we find there are three possible explanations for OCAL's large impact in our experiment: (1) interest-oriented stimulation from OCAL's interactive, gamified nature and the chance for comparison and competition with peers; (2) customized remedial question banks tailored to each student's individual needs; and (3) compared to math, there is room for easier gains in English proficiency. Finally, our analysis indicates that our OCAL intervention has a higher cost-effectiveness ratio than traditional offline CAL programs. Therefore, we conclude that OCAL appears to offer a more efficient solution for improving education in rural China, as it has both larger impacts and lower costs.====Our study adds to the literature in three ways. First, this paper is the first to measure the effect of OCAL on learning outcomes among an underserved population in China using experimental design to rule out potential bias. Second, this paper contributes to our understanding of the overall mechanism of the impacts. Third, because this paper focuses on the impact of OCAL on English learning in rural China, it makes a contribution to the scant literature on CAL in the context of second-language acquisition.",Impact of online computer assisted learning on education: Experimental evidence from economically vulnerable areas of China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000328,7 March 2023,2023,Research Article,16.0

I find 12 years of exposure to school accountability leads to an increase in the likelihood of graduating high school by 2.3 percentage points but has no statistically significant effect on college attendance or the likelihood of receiving a Bachelor's degree. However, racial heterogeneity shows Hispanic students experience a significant increase in the likelihood of attending college. I rule out changes in school expenditures and teacher characteristics as potential mechanisms and present suggestive evidence that schools are classifying more students as learning disabled. Lastly, accountability is more effective in conjunction with ==== gates.","School accountability, the system in which schools are responsible for student performance, has been at the forefront of education policy in America and other countries for over two decades. There is substantial evidence suggesting school accountability has successfully increased student test scores (Carnoy & Loeb, 2002; Dee & Jacob, 2011; Hanushek & Raymond, 2005). However, school accountability has been criticized for causing teachers to teach to the test, to teach to the students who are near the margin of passing, or to sort to well-performing schools. Evidence of student performance across the achievement distribution suggests students in the middle of the distribution benefit the most from school accountability, but students in the tails of the distribution perform worse on standardized tests than they would have without the policy (Lee & Orfield, 2006; Neal & Schanzenbach, 2010). As a result, it is still unclear whether school accountability is beneficial to student performance and educational attainment.====I examine the long-term effects of school accountability on students’ high school graduation, college attendance, and college graduation. Although test scores are an acceptable proxy for measuring student learning, they have their shortcomings. For instance, it is not possible to distinguish between improved learning or improved test-taking skills nor do they offer any measure of students’ soft skills. Therefore, studying the long-term outcomes is necessary as it offers insight into whether the test score results are a reflection of better test-taking skills or if they improve student learning and lead to higher educational attainment.====Using American Community Survey data for the years 2008 to 2016, I estimate the effect of school accountability on educational attainment. I utilize two sources of plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to accountability policies to estimate a dynamic differences-in-differences event study analysis. First, I take advantage of the staggered implementation of school accountability across states throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Second, I use variation in exposure to accountability based on an individual's age when school accountability was adopted in their state. Individuals who were out of school (18 years or older) the year of or before school accountability was adopted in their state are considered untreated. Individuals who are of school-going age during or after the year the policy passed are considered treated and are assigned a value for the number of years they are exposed to school accountability. I find 12 years of exposure to school accountability leads to an increase in the likelihood of graduating high school by 2.3 percentage points on average but has no statistically significant effect on college attendance or college graduation.====As the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act emphasized the performance of minority students which may have led to more concentrated effects among Hispanic and Black students, I conduct a heterogeneity analysis by race. The estimates show Hispanic and Black students are not significantly more likely to graduate high school than white students. However, Hispanic students are 7.7 percentage points more likely to attend college if they were exposed to school accountability for the entirety of their school life. The outcomes of Black students are not statistically significantly different from those of White students. The findings are consistent with previous heterogeneity analyses that estimate the effect of school accountability on student test scores (Carnoy & Loeb, 2002; Dee & Jacob, 2011).====Further, I investigate whether the presence of promotion gates, as defined by high school exit exams, influences the efficacy of school accountability. There may be complementarities between school accountability and promotion gates as both emphasize testing, or promotion gates might be a signal that a state has a stricter accountability policy. The results show a large part of the effect on the high school graduation rate is coming from the interaction between exposure to school accountability and exposure to promotion gates, suggesting that promotion gates in conjunction with school accountability lead to larger increases in high school graduation rates.====School accountability is a nebulous policy in which individual states have significant control over its implementation, even in the post-NCLB era. Therefore, it is important to explore what particular policy choices might be driving the results reported in this paper. I investigate school expenditures, teacher wage and qualifications, and the proportion of students eligible for special education and language assistance programs. I find suggestive evidence that the proportion of students eligible for special education increased after school accountability, implying schools may be reacting to accountability policies by more proactively testing students for special education.====Due to the national adoption of school accountability, the long-run effects of school accountability are challenging to study, and the current literature is sparse. There are only two published studies that look at the long-run effects of school accountability, Carnoy and Loeb (2002) and Deming et al. (2016). This is the first paper to investigate the general effect of school accountability, as opposed to comparing a weaker version of school accountability to a stronger version (Deming et al. 2016).==== The general effect of school accountability is meaningful as states have significant autonomy in designing their school accountability policies, even after the implementation of NCLB, and knowing the average long-run effect of accountability on the generations of students affected by this policy may influence future policy decisions. Moreover, this paper is the first to look at the effect of school accountability by exposure.==== This is also policy-relevant as it is important to know whether the effect of school accountability is a result of compounded exposure or if just minor exposure to the policy can induce significant effects.",Does test-based accountability improve more than just test scores?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000286,5 March 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

Leveraging variation within schools over time, we explore heterogeneity in the impact of hurricane-related schooling disruption on students’ end-of-grade test scores. Impacts were not concentrated on students performing at the lowest levels in the prior year nor on those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. Rather, the estimates suggest that most students experienced small declines in test performance irrespective of baseline human capital or ==== group.","In light of current climate change-related increases in average sea and air temperatures, scientists predict that extreme weather events and weather-related natural disasters will become more frequent and more severe (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016, Walsh et al., 2016).==== These events often result in schools closing for an extended period.==== Students likely suffer disruptions in both their school and home settings, with those from disadvantaged families potentially bearing the highest costs. To target resources efficiently, it is important to understand which students are at risk of experiencing the largest learning losses following a natural disaster-related school closure. We provide new insights on the heterogeneous impacts of natural disaster-related school closures by studying the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which caused widespread and extended school closures in North Carolina in the fall of 2018.====School closures may disproportionately impact students who were previously struggling and performing at the lowest levels because it is more difficult for them to catch up on missed material. Similarly, the most disadvantaged students may be less resilient to school closures or experience greater disruptions at home concurrent with school closures. In this paper, we estimate learning losses by prior achievement and by measures of economic disadvantage, racial/ethnic group, and gender. Further, middle school students may be more capable of independent learning and could, theoretically, make up missed material outside of classroom hours. Therefore, we also explore whether elementary school students experienced greater impacts than middle school students.====Using variation in school closures in North Carolina due to Hurricane Florence, we estimate a regression model with school fixed effects to compare end-of-grade (EOG) test performance of elementary (4th and 5th grade) and middle school (7th and 8th grade) students using data spanning AY2015-16 through AY2018-19.==== By including school fixed effects, we control for all time invariant differences by school and leverage only variation within schools over time. We find a small but statistically significant and robust drop, on average, in both reading and mathematics end-of-grade examinations. Importantly, when considering the effect by quintile of prior year test score performance, we find that the effect is largest near the median for mathematics. At the same time, all but those with the highest performance on prior-year reading exams saw significant reading test score losses. When considering heterogeneity by grade levels, test score declines were only slightly smaller for elementary versus middle school students. We fail to find evidence that economically disadvantaged or racial minority students experienced larger learning losses, although the point estimates are smallest for non-Hispanic White students. Indeed, nearly every subgroup studied experienced some learning loss due to the school closures.====Our estimates regarding the impact of Hurricane Florence capture learning losses from both missed instruction and disruption that occurred in students’ lives outside of school. In fact, by leveraging data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), where available, we find evidence that both effects are present in our setting. It should also be noted that we measure short-run test score declines net of any mitigation actions taken. Furthermore, it is outside the scope of this study to explore persisting impacts of school closures or the effectiveness of remediation strategies. Taken together, the results indicate that the impacts of natural disaster-related school closures were broadly experienced by students in both middle and elementary schools across most demographic groups and throughout the distribution of prior performance levels following Hurricane Florence.",Heterogeneity in the educational impacts of natural disasters: Evidence from Hurricane Florence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000201,1 March 2023,2023,Research Article,18.0
"De Paola Maria,Gioia Francesca,Scoppa Vincenzo","Department of Economics, Statistics and Finance, University of Calabria, Italy,Italian National Institute of Social Security (INPS), Rome, Italy,Department of Law, University of Milan, Italy,Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Bonn, Germany","Received 19 December 2022, Accepted 15 February 2023, Available online 1 March 2023, Version of Record 1 March 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2023.102378,Cited by (1),"Despite growing consensus in the public debate that self-discipline is key to succeeding in an online learning environment, the evidence available is very limited. We investigate the role of procrastination as a moderator of the impact of online teaching on ","In recent years, new styles of education have emerged alongside traditional face-to-face teaching, mainly thanks to technological improvements. Higher education institutions are now able to choose whether to have their students learn via traditional face-to-face teaching, electronic and online media (online teaching) or a combination of both (blended teaching). Nonetheless, not much is known about which system is the most effective under which circumstances.====The Covid-19 pandemic, with the subsequent closure of schools and universities and the massive transition to online teaching, has made these issues even more pressing. Online delivery has made the provision of education to a large mass of individuals possible and many actors have discovered how it can be an important tool in sustaining skill development. Even though there are concerns that online learning may have been a sub-optimal substitute for face-to-face instruction, the forced shift induced by the pandemic is likely to have persistent effects and online and blended teaching are expected to become much more widespread than before the pandemic. Consequently, it is very important not only to understand whether online teaching is as effective as class-based learning, but also to be able to recognize factors that might hinder or inhibit learning in an online environment in order to understand how teaching activities should be organized in the future.====From a theoretical point of view, distance learning has both benefits and drawbacks compared with face-to-face teaching (Figlio et al., 2013). The advantages of distance learning include the lower costs deriving from the fact that the same lesson can be followed by a large number of students, the possibility for students to attend classes when they prefer, so avoiding overcrowded classrooms, and being able to review lessons in order to understand aspects that were not immediately clear. Other benefits for students include access to the latest information, sharing of content, and communication (Mathew & Iloanya, 2016). Last, but not least, distance learning allows both teachers and students to reduce mobility costs and commuting time. On the other hand, disadvantages include the lack of in-person peer contact, more difficult interaction between teachers and students and technology-related hindrances, such as slow or unreliable internet, the cost of connection and insufficient technological skills (Alvarez, 2020; Mathew & Iloanya, 2016; Lynch, 2020). In addition, the lack of a structured environment with a set routine might induce students, especially those with present-biased preferences, to skip assignments and postpone activities requiring effort.====Given the interplay between these positive and negative aspects, the understanding of how online teaching affects the achievements of students is an empirical matter. In this paper, we focus on tertiary education and address this issue by analyzing the impact of the shift from face-to-face to online teaching during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to the richness of our data, we study whether online teaching exacerbates problems deriving from present-biased preferences. Indeed, a number of papers highlight how study activities might be more difficult in a less structured setting without routine interaction with peers and instructors (Banerjee & Duflo, 2014; Figlio et al., 2013; McPherson & Bacow, 2015)==== Thus, students who tend to procrastinate costly activities, like studying, may perform worse when there is less feedback and commitments become less binding.====We use very rich administrative data from a medium-sized Italian public university, with information on the academic careers of four cohorts of students. Thanks to the structure of examination sessions, we are able to observe the performance of students in exams taken both before and after the transition to online teaching. This allows us to estimate the overall effect on student performance of the shift from face-to-face to online teaching by applying a difference-in-differences identification strategy: we compare the academic performance of students of different cohorts (some affected by the health emergency and others unaffected) in the exams taken in the first semester, so identifying a pre-treatment difference, with the difference in performance in the exams taken in the second semester, which includes the effect produced by the transition to distance learning (and other possible changes related to the emergency). Even though the pandemic posed additional problems, besides those deriving from the transition to online teaching, which might also have affected student performance, we provide evidence that these aspects are likely to have played a minor role in our setting. Most importantly, given our focus on the role of procrastination, any pandemic-induced confounding factor should not have a different effect according to the degree of students’ present-biasedness.====To investigate the role of procrastination in shaping online learning results, we exploit a measure of students’ tendency to procrastinate based on their behavior during the enrollment process. This measure, already used by De Paola and Scoppa (2015), considers how students actually behaved during their enrolling at our university of reference. All students who apply to enroll at the university considered in our study are notified of the admission decision at the same time (through the university official website) and have seven weekdays in which to complete the enrollment procedure (requiring the payment of an initial fee and the filling in of a number of forms). Accomplishing the enrollment procedure generates an immediate cost which students with a tendency to procrastinate might tend to postpone, but accomplishing the procedure at the last moment may be particularly risky as students might end up by being excluded from their chosen degree program due to some unexpected event (illness, bad working of the internet connection etc.). Therefore, with the support of results from our previous research (De Paola & Scoppa, 2015), which showed that students who take longer to accomplish the enrolment procedure are also more likely to self-assess as procrastinators, we assume that procrastinating the completion of this administrative task is predictive of a general tendency to procrastinate.====In line with findings emerging from the recent literature on the topic, our estimation results show that pandemic-induced online teaching has significantly reduced the number of credits acquired over a semester. We also find that student's tendency to procrastinate is an important moderator of this effect and online teaching is particularly detrimental for students affected by present-bias problems. With online teaching, non-procrastinators reduce their performance by about 2 credits per semester while the performance of students with present-bias problems is further reduced by about 1.2 credits. The total effect for procrastinators amounts to more than 18% of a semester workload, so implying a potential delay of approximately two semesters in the time necessary to graduate from an online versus a face-to-face five-year degree course. A similar negative effect is also found when we consider as an outcome variable an overall measure of student performance which takes into account the grades students obtained at exams. Our results are robust to the inclusion of student fixed effects and several control variables for individual and local characteristics. Furthermore, we find that procrastination exerts a negative effect on a student's probability of passing an exam and on the grade obtained.====Although we compare online and face-to-face teaching over a period characterized by a health emergency which could have had an effect on student performance above and beyond the simple change in teaching style, we show that the estimated effect does not seem to depend on the severity of the health emergency or on the quality of internet connections. Indeed, the university considered is located in the south of Italy, an area that has experienced low rates of contagion and death, especially in the first wave of the pandemic.==== Moreover, the heterogeneity shown by our findings supports the idea that the worsening of student academic performance observed in our setting is mainly driven by the change in teaching and learning practices, since it would be difficult to argue that procrastinators were more negatively affected by health conditions than their colleagues or that instructors were less compassionate with them at exams.====Our research contributes to the literature investigating the impact of online teaching on student performance. Although relatively new to Italy, online university courses were already widespread in the United States and in many other advanced countries before the pandemic crisis. Nonetheless, a number of identification challenges has meant that the literature that tries to identify the causal impact of different teaching methods is rather limited in quantity. Some papers rely on small-scale experiments where students are randomly assigned to alternative teaching systems (face-to-face, online and blended) (Alpert et al., 2016; Bowen et al., 2014; Coates et al., 2004; Cacault et al., 2021; Figlio et al., 2013; Joyce et al., 2015) and showed negative effects of online compared to face-to-face classes. Similar results are found also by Bettinger et al. (2017) and Xu and Jaggars (2013), who considered quite large populations of students and dealt with selection problems by adopting an instrumental variable strategy.====This literature has recently been enriched by several papers examining the impact of the closure of schools and universities and the consequent switch to remote learning due to the spread of the coronavirus disease. In a review of papers studying the effect of COVID-19-related school closures in spring 2020 on the achievement of students attending primary and secondary schools, Hammerstein et al. (2021) highlighted a considerably negative impact, particularly for younger students and students from families of low socioeconomic status.====As regards university students, Orlov et al. (2021) compared student performance in standard assessments in spring 2020 to student performance in the same courses in either autumn or spring 2019. They found that during the pandemic there was a decline in total scores and that prior online teaching experience and teaching methods that encouraged active engagement helped to mitigate the effect. Likewise, by using data on a randomized controlled trial comparing online and in-person classes, Kofoed et al. (2021) found that online education led to a lowering of students’ final grades, especially with students of below median academic ability. Negative effects were also found by Altindag et al. (2021), who relied on data from a large US public university instead. They also showed that instructor-specific factors, such as leniency in grading due to a more compassionate approach towards students in response to the difficulties caused by the pandemic, play an important role and might lead to the erroneous conclusion that online teaching is better than face-to-face teaching. On the other hand, Binelli et al. (2021) found evidence of a positive effect for students enrolled at a public university located in the North of Italy, probably due to a greater effort made by students in studying activities during the lockdown period.====Our contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we offer new evidence for Italy,==== a country where the higher education system before the pandemic was mostly traditional and the web and technology were mainly just used as support for face-to-face classes (to share course information and/or additional teaching materials with students).==== The timing of the transition to online learning for the university considered in this study, coinciding with the beginning of the second semester, just as for many other universities in Italy and in other countries worldwide, allows us to apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy. A similar identification strategy was used by Orlov et al. (2021), but while they only considered seven intermediate-level economics courses, we are able to rely on a very large dataset including hundreds of courses in several academic areas (Scientific, Humanities, Social Sciences) offered by an entire large public university.====Second, compared with the few papers that, similarly to our study, rely on large populations of students, we are able to offer evidence of the role played by procrastination. The tendency to put off action until some later time is a well-known detrimental attitude to academic achievement. Despite several authors envisaged the potential negative consequences of procrastination on online learning, to the best of our knowledge, there are no papers offering empirical evidence on how procrastination moderates the effects of online teaching.==== Our evidence suggests that, when comparing face-to-face with online teaching, students’ present-biased preferences should be taken into account and online teaching should be supported by tools that allow students with a tendency to procrastinate to feel more involved, thus attenuating the larger negative impact on their performance.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and, in Section 3, the methodology used. In Section 4, we present and discuss our main results on the impact of pandemic-induced online-teaching on the number of credits acquired in a semester and on a comprehensive measure of performance that takes into account grades awarded to students. Section 5 examines the role of students’ tendency to procrastinate. Section 6 looks at the effects of synchronous and asynchronous online teaching. Section 7 offers some concluding remarks.","Online teaching, procrastination and student achievement",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000250,1 March 2023,2023,Research Article,19.0

Early feedback overall enhances exam performance while late feedback worsens it. We find this pattern to hold for level feedback in general and for change feedback when negative. Heterogeneity analyses suggest the effects are mostly driven by boys, who also negatively update ability beliefs in response to feedback.","Education is now more important for one’s life expectancy, health, and income than ever before (Elo, 2009, Jasilionis and Shkolnikov, 2016, Michaels et al., 2014) but in spite of enormous public investments in education, about one in five students in OECD countries does not reach the baseline level of skills in mathematics, reading, and science needed to participate in society and the labor market (OECD, 2019). An important question is therefore what role students’ own investments play for their educational outcomes and what motivates them to learn. Young children are particularly focused on the short term (Sutter et al., 2019) and are hardly motivated to exert effort on activities that have large long-term benefits but may not be intrinsically very enjoyable. While a number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of non-monetary and monetary incentives for younger students and have found mixed results (e.g., Bettinger, 2012, Fryer, 2011, Gneezy et al., 2019, Jalava et al., 2015, Kremer et al., 2009, Levitt et al., 2016),==== a question that has rarely been asked is whether children respond to performance feedback that allows them to learn about their abilities but that is not itself tied to any rewards (one exemption is Beuchert et al., 2020 studying feedback in third grade). We help to fill a gap in the literature by investigating the effects of feedback to young students on their educational performance in the presence of high-stakes incentives. In particular, we ask the following questions: Is feedback about the ==== or feedback about the ==== in performance more effective? Is feedback more effective when given a ==== or when given ==== an exam?====Studies on the “growth mindset” (Paunesku et al., 2015) and grit (Alan et al., 2019) suggest that feedback making performance ==== over time salient may motivate students to invest effort into education. Additionally, educational policy advice from the OECD recommends against the use of marks that are based on relative performance ==== as those depend strongly on factors that are outside a student’s control, such as innate ability or the quality of a student’s peers, and may discourage learning (OECD, 2012 p. 54–55). Still, students around the world mostly seem to receive the latter.==== Furthermore, the timing of feedback possibly plays a role in its effectiveness. Evidence shows that providing students with performance incentives immediately before an otherwise unincentivized test may significantly improve test performance (Gneezy et al., 2019), which the authors interpret as the effect of effort on the test itself. However, effort spent on deliberate practice may also strongly contribute to performance in education, and similarly at work and in sports competitions (Macnamara et al., 2014). It remains an open question whether giving feedback immediately before a high-stakes exam has a similar effect to the one found for incentives by Gneezy et al. (2019), and whether this feedback is more effective than feedback given a few days before, to which students may still adjust their preparation effort. Investigating the relative effectiveness of a widely used type of feedback (about performance levels) and of a rarely used but promising type of feedback (about performance changes) provided either just before an exam to influence effort during the exam or early enough to influence exam preparation allows us to shed light on two dimensions that are likely important for the success of feedback in education.====We use a field experiment with fifth and sixth graders to measure the effect of performance feedback given by teachers to their students on the latter’s performance in a high-stakes exam.==== Feedback was unanticipated, private, written, and given only once. The type of feedback students received was randomized within classes. It either contained information about (i) the ==== in the last math exam (level feedback), (ii) the ==== between the two previous math exams (change feedback), or (iii) no information (control). Across classes and within schools, we randomly varied when students received feedback: (a) a few ==== before, or (b) ==== before the final math exam of the semester. A survey administered immediately after the reception of feedback allows us to detect adjustments of students’ ability beliefs in response to feedback.====Our results show that the timing of feedback is very important. Feedback given a few days prior to the exam significantly enhanced performance while feedback on the examination day significantly worsened performance. These effects are driven by level feedback and negative change feedback. Level feedback significantly improved performance by about 0.2 standard deviations (sd) when given early but significantly worsened performance by about 0.1 sd when given late. Change feedback – when negative – exhibits the same pattern and we find significant positive effects of 0.5 sd when given early and significant negative effects of 0.3 sd when given late. Heterogeneity analyses show that the effects are mostly driven by boys. We do not find that feedback significantly affected girls’ performance. Exploring mechanisms, we find that boys tended to update beliefs negatively while girls tended to update beliefs positively in response to feedback.====Overall, our results suggest that level feedback and negative change feedback motivate young students to invest more effort into exam preparation and that this extra effort invested within a few days is highly effective in improving exam performance. Our results also caution that the same information provided immediately before an exam, when preparation is no longer possible, affects test-taking behavior negatively. Evidence from belief elicitation suggests that the reason why boys responded to feedback was because it was negatively surprising to them. This may help to explain the timing dimension: Negatively perceived information possibly motivates students to improve their exam preparation but may worsen test-taking behavior when given immediately before an exam. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies compared the effectiveness of level and change feedback or investigated the effects of feedback timing on high-stakes outcomes. We are also not aware of any studies that investigated the effectiveness of any feedback on high-stakes outcomes for children as young as age 11–12.====Our findings are particularly relevant for educators because feedback that compares students in terms of their performance levels dominates educational practice but has been criticized for being ineffective or harmful for motivation. Results from a randomized field experiment allow us to formulate a differentiated appraisal of this claim: Level feedback may, indeed, be harmful for performance when timed badly, however, it may improve performance when timed well. Likewise, feedback about performance changes, when negative, may have positive or negative effects on performance depending on when it is given. We find some evidence that change feedback raises students’ effort-effectiveness belief, which would be in line with ideas about the motivating effects of a “growth mindset” and grit. In our setting, however, responses seem to be driven by negative updating of beliefs about one’s level of competence.==== More broadly, the insight that the effects of feedback may hinge on its timing is also very relevant in other settings – such as work and professional sports – in which well-timed effort is crucial for performance.====The paper is organized as follows.

We estimate the impact of same-race teachers and other observed teacher qualifications on students’ likelihood of receiving a disciplinary referral. Using data that track all disciplinary referrals and the identity of both the referred and referring individuals from a large and diverse urban school district in California, we find that Black students’ probability of receiving at least one referral is about 3 percentage points (26.6% of Black students’ base rate) smaller than for white students when they have a Black teacher versus a white teacher. The reduced likelihoods of receiving referrals from same-race teachers also convert to reduced likelihoods of being suspended. These results are mostly driven by referrals for violence, interpersonal offences, and walkout infractions, middle school students, and students from high-poverty schools. Students are also less likely to be referred by more experienced teachers and by teachers who hold either an English language learners or ","Racial disparities in exclusionary discipline (i.e., suspensions) exist both between and within U.S. public schools (Barrett et al., 2019; Chin, 2021; Kinsler, 2011; Liu et al., 2022a). Specifically, the 2013–14 Civil Rights Data Collection finds that Black students accounted for 40% of suspensions but only 16% of enrollments. These disparities are troubling for two broad and related reasons. First, suspensions are harmful in the sense that they likely hinder economic mobility and related long-run outcomes (Bacher-Hicks, Billings, & Deming, 2019; Sorensen et al., in press; Weisburst, 2019). Second, these racial disparities in exclusionary discipline are at least partly due to systematic biases, or “intentional discrimination,” in schools’ handling of student indiscipline (Barrett et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Shi & Zhu, 2022).====Accordingly, closing racial gaps in suspensions and reducing the use of suspensions in general are growing priorities for policymakers and education practitioners (Steinberg & Lacoe, 2017; Davison et al., 2022). Achieving these goals requires a clear understanding of the production of suspensions and the determinants of racial gaps in suspensions. Sorensen et al. (in press) study the role of principals, the final arbiters of disciplinary decisions, in shaping racial disparities in exclusionary discipline; however, less attention has been paid to office (disciplinary) referrals and the role of teachers in initiating that process. Indeed, office referrals necessarily precede suspensions and the majority (84% in our data) of referrals are made by classroom teachers. However, little is known about the types of teachers who make the most referrals. This is in stark contrast to a large literature on teachers’ effects on a host of academic, behavioral, and non-cognitive outcomes including test scores, educational attainment, attendance, and earnings (Chetty et al., 2014; Gershenson, 2016; Jackson, 2018; Kraft, 2019; Ladd & Sorensen, 2017; Liu & Loeb, 2021).====The current study extends the large literature on teacher effectiveness–and specifically that on the impact of same-race teachers–by examining teachers’ impacts on office referrals. There are two reasons that teachers might vary in their ability to cause students to receive office referrals. First, teachers may vary in their proclivity to make referrals because they vary in their interpretation of classroom behavior (Girvan et al., 2017; Okonofua et al., 2016). Thus, all else equal, being assigned to a “frequent referrer” will increase the number of referrals a student receives. Second, teachers may affect student behavior, either directly via teaching socio-emotional skills or indirectly by changing the classroom climate, which in turn leads to changes in referral frequency (Kraft, 2019).====Teachers vary in how they perceive student (mis)behavior (Dee, 2005). However, there is little research that uses actual referral data, perhaps because it is rarely available. For example, an experiment in some California middle schools found that prompts about the utility of empathic (punitive) mindsets in the classroom caused teachers to change their stated response to hypothetical situations in the classroom to be less (more) punitive (Okonofua et al., 2016). A descriptive study that does utilize referral data is Skiba et al. (2002), who show that Black students are referred more often for arguably more subjective infractions, such as “disrespect” and “excessive noise.” Taken together, it is easy to see how variation in teachers’ perceptions of behavior can manifest in different referral rates across teachers and across student subgroups.====That said, we are aware of only two studies that explicitly examine teachers’ referring behavior. First, Holt et al. (2022) analyze longitudinal data from North Carolina to identify the variability of elementary school teachers’ punitiveness in the use of referrals. However, the authors do not observe the individuals who made the referrals; rather, they assume all referrals were made by the self-contained classroom teacher. Using a value-added model in which referrals are the outcome, they then identify more and less punitive teachers. More punitive teachers contribute to adverse academic and behavioral outcomes for Black students. Second, Liu et al. (2022b) use the same data analyzed in the current study to describe the distribution of teachers’ annual referral frequencies with an explicit focus on “chronic referrers.” The top 5% of teachers who make the most referrals per year effectively double the racial gaps in referrals between Black and white, and between Hispanic and white, students.====While the two studies discussed in the prior paragraph suggest that there is some variation in teachers’ use of disciplinary referrals, neither addresses our titular question of who refers whom. The current study fills this gap in the literature by providing causal quantitative evidence on how having a teacher of the same race affects a student's likelihood of receiving an office referral. We also investigate how these effects vary by student subgroups and how some other observable teacher characteristics, such as experience and credentials, affect referral probabilities. Our study is thus closely related to a line of research on teacher effectiveness that associates observed teacher characteristics and qualifications with achievement gains and other educational outcomes. For example, having a same-race teacher can improve student short-run academic achievement, reduce receipts of suspensions and absences, and boost educational attainment (Dee, 2004a; Lindsay & Hart, 2017; Holt & Gershenson, 2019; Gershenson et al., 2022, 2021). Qualifications such as experience and undergraduate performance and coursework matter as well for student achievement (Clotfelter et al., 2007; Kukla-Acevedo, 2009). Thus, it is plausible that observable teacher characteristics and qualifications explain some of the variation in teachers’ effects on student office referrals.====We conduct this research using unusually rich administrative data from a large and diverse urban district in California that track all disciplinary referrals and the identity of school personnel who issued them. We construct a novel panel data set that links student outcomes over time, including office referrals that do not result in a suspension, to the precise classroom and teacher who initiated the referral. These data allow us to estimate stacked two-way fixed effect (FE) regression models that compare (i) students across subjects (classrooms) within a given year and (ii) students within a single classroom (Fairlie et al., 2014). The student-by-year FE controls for unobserved time-invariant student traits as well as idiosyncratic shocks that might influence classroom assignments. Classroom FE control for other teacher or classroom characteristics that may be associated with teacher race.====Our findings suggest that Black students are significantly less likely to receive a disciplinary referral from Black teachers than from teachers of other racial backgrounds. We also provide suggestive evidence that having teachers who are more experienced or who hold a credential in teaching English language learners (ELL) or special education reduce referral rates. The race-match results are mainly driven by referrals for violence or interpersonal infractions in middle schools and in schools serving low-income neighborhoods. These results add additional evidence to the large literature on student-teacher demographic match and teacher effectiveness more generally from the novel angle of disciplinary referrals. They also contribute to our growing knowledge of the disciplinary referral process that results in unequal rates of exclusionary discipline (Liu et al., 2022a). It is here that our findings have rich policy implications: For example, to reduce the overall use of punitive strategies and ameliorate racial disparities in exclusionary discipline, providing targeted support for certain groups of teachers, such as novice teachers and white teachers in diverse schools, might prove fruitful. Similarly, the classroom management techniques incorporated in ELL and special education certification programs might be adopted more broadly in teacher training programs. We revisit these implications in the conclusion.",Who refers whom?

We examine whether increasing parental Medicaid eligibility had ","Access to public health insurance for low-income parents increased in the early 2000s as a result of expansions in Medicaid eligibility and increased again under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014, which expanded Medicaid eligibility to all adults earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) in participating states. Research has shown that expanding access to Medicaid to low-income parents (1) increased parental health insurance coverage and reduced the proportion of uninsured parents (Kaestner et al., 2017; McMorrow et al., 2017); (2) increased parental healthcare utilization (McMorrow et al., 2017; Miller & Wherry, 2019); (3) improved parental mental health (McMorrow et al., 2017); (4) improved parental self-reported health (Gopalan et al., 2022); and (5) increased time parents spent on childcare (Soni & Morrissey, 2022). Other studies have shown that, among non-elderly adults, expanding Medicaid eligibility is associated with (6) reduced out-of-pocket spending (Abramowitz, 2018); and (7) reduced debt collections and improved credit scores (Caswell & Waidmann, 2017; Hu et al., 2018).====These consequences of expanding Medicaid eligibility to low-income parents may have beneficial effects to their children. Reducing financial stress is associated with improved maternal physical and mental health (Evans & Garthwaite, 2014; Boyd-Swan et al., 2016; Gangopadhyaya et al., 2020) which could improve the quality of parental investments (Propper et al., 2007; Yamauchi, 2009; Podor & Halliday, 2012; Bratti & Mendola, 2014; Mühlenweg et al., 2016). Additionally, interventions that have raised family income have been found to have beneficial effects on children's health and education development (Dubay & Kenney, 2003; Aizer & Grogger, 2003; Dahl & Lochner, 2012; Bastian & Michelmore, 2018; Braga et al., 2020; Gangopadhyaya et al., 2020; Hamersma et al., 2018; Miller & Wherry, 2019). For example, Dahl and Lochner (2012) found that children of parents who received the Earned Income Tax Credit scored higher on math and reading tests, with larger improvements experienced by lower-income children. Lastly, previous studies have shown that expanding parental access to Medicaid reduces children's uninsured rates (Hudson & Moriya, 2017; Dubay & Kenney, 2003) which, in turn, is associated with improvements in educational achievement and attainment (Levine & Schanzenbach, 2009; Cohodes et al., 2016). However, recent evidence from Gopalan et al. (2022) suggests the direct effects of children gaining coverage may be limited, as they found that although parental self-reported health improved following Medicaid expansions, they found no evidence of changes in child doctor visits or parental assessments of their child's health.====In this paper, we assess the effects of recent parental Medicaid expansions on 3rd through 8th grade mathematics and reading achievement using data from 2009 to 2018 for all counties in the United States from the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA). Because Medicaid is means-tested, and because race/ethnicity is correlated with income, we further examine whether the expansions diminished socioeconomic and racial/ethnic gaps in achievement. We assess the impact of expanding parental Medicaid eligibility on test scores using a difference-in-differences design exploiting changes in state Medicaid eligibility income limits for parents throughout this panel.====We find evidence that parental Medicaid eligibility expansions significantly narrowed the socioeconomic and white-black achievement gaps in math. In counties with above-median poverty rates, a 50 percentage points increase in parental eligibility income limits (roughly the size of the average expansion) is associated with reducing the socioeconomic achievement gap in math scores by 0.11==== and the white-black achievement gap in math scores by 0.029====, representing a 1.7 and a 3.9% decrease in these respective achievement gaps relative to their means. Our evidence suggests that these gaps narrowed because of improved math scores for economically disadvantaged students and for black students; among non-disadvantaged students or white students, parental Medicaid expansions are associated with no change in achievement. We show that while socioeconomic gaps in math achievement reduced similarly regardless of county-level poverty, reductions in the white-black gap in math scores are concentrated in poorer counties. Finally, we find no evidence that parental Medicaid expansions had any association with achievement gaps in English-Language Arts (ELA) test scores during this period nor do we find any association between parental Medicaid expansion and math or ELA test scores for Hispanic children or corresponding achievement gaps. In analyses using data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we find that Hispanic parents in fact had lower Medicaid take-up effects and smaller reductions in uninsured rates following parental Medicaid expansions relative to white and black parents, the direct mechanism through which parental Medicaid is expected to affect children's education achievement. These diminished first-stage estimates may explain the absence of any association between parental Medicaid eligibility expansion and education achievement of Hispanic children.====Examining the impact of parental Medicaid eligibility on children's human capital development is critical. First, racial-ethnic and socioeconomic gaps in education achievement are large and persistent. These gaps emerge before kindergarten and persist throughout childhood (Jencks & Phillips, 1998; Reardon & Galindo, 2009), persist over time (Reardon, 2013; Hanushek et al., 2019), and are strongly correlated with adult success (Heckman et al., 2010; Chetty et al., 2011). Therefore, identifying factors that narrow these gaps, such as what we find with respect to parental Medicaid, is important to inform policies to reduce inequality and enhance human capital. Second, if Medicaid expansions to low-income parents are associated with improvements in their children's test scores, it suggests co-benefits that are important to quantify and have been previously ignored. Failure to account for these co-benefits risks undervaluing the program. Our findings complement two recent studies that explored spillover effects of Medicaid expansions on child academic achievement. Bullinger et al. (2022) use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to estimate the relationship between Medicaid expansions and find evidence of improvements in reading and mathematics scores, especially amongst Black children. Wehby (2022) finds improvements in reading scores in Iowa amongst children of mothers with a high school education or less. Our study contributes to this growing literature and, relative to Bullinger et al. (2022), evaluates education achievement among older children and, relative to Wehby (2022), reflects estimates representative of the whole nation.",Does subsidized public health insurance for parents improve children's human capital and close achievement gaps?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572300016X,21 February 2023,2023,Research Article,22.0

In this paper, I provide a detailed analysis of the STEM pipeline from high school to mid-career in the United States, decomposing the gender gap in STEM into six stages. Women are lost from STEM before college, during college, and after college. Men are more likely to be STEM-ready before college, scoring higher on science tests and having taken more advanced math and science courses. This accounts for 35% of the overall gender gap in STEM careers. During college, men are far more likely than women to start in a STEM major, accounting for 26% of the gap. After college, male STEM graduates are more likely to enter STEM jobs, accounting for 41%. Men’s higher persistence in STEM majors is a smaller factor, while women attend college at higher rates than men, which works to reduce the final gender gap in STEM. The results show that there is no single stage to focus on in understanding the gender gap in STEM.","Both policymakers and researchers acknowledge the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and jobs for economic growth and innovation (e.g., Jones, 2009). Yet women are underrepresented in these fields. Men make up about two-thirds of STEM college graduates and hold even higher share of STEM jobs. Because STEM fields typically pay well, women’s underrepresentation contributes to the overall gender pay gap (Brown and Corcoran, 1997, Jiang, 2021).====In this paper, I trace the experiences of women in this STEM “pipeline” from high school to the labor market in the United States.==== I investigate when women are lost from the pipeline, asking which stages of the pipeline are most important, and where these women go when they leave STEM.====Using two data sources – one for high school and college experiences and one for the labor market – I consider six stages of the STEM pipeline from high school to mid-career. These include STEM readiness in high school (based on courses taken and test scores), college attendance, initial college major choice, graduation with a STEM degree, and early- and mid-career jobs. By mid-career, men make up almost three-fourths of STEM employment. My main question of interest is what stages contribute the most to this gender gap. Knowing this allows policymakers to better target efforts to recruit and retain talented women in STEM.====The results show that women are lost from the STEM pipeline before college, during college, and after college. There is no single stage that stands out. Instead, there are three stages of the highest importance: STEM readiness before college, the initial major choice in college, and the transition to early-career employment after college.====Before entering college, women are, on average, less prepared for STEM majors than men are. They are less likely to have taken calculus, biology, and physics, and they also score lower on science tests. I define several criteria for STEM readiness and show that men meet more of them on average; importantly, men are overrepresented in the upper tail of readiness. This accounts for 35% of the overall gender gap in STEM careers.====In college, women are far less likely to choose a STEM major as their first major choice; this accounts for 26% of the overall gap. This is especially true among the most STEM-ready students entering college; of those who are highly prepared for STEM, 55% of men start in a STEM major, compared with about 35% of women. Women are also less likely to graduate with a STEM degree conditional on starting one, which accounts for a smaller share (13%) of the overall gap.====The gender gap in STEM continues to grow after college: among those who have persisted to complete a STEM college degree, women are far less likely to be found in STEM occupations at age 30 (48% of men vs. 32% of women). This transition to career accounts for 41% of the overall gap, the largest of any stage.====Women actually make up ground with their higher rates of college attendance, which works to reduce the final gender gap in STEM. But this is mediated by the fact that male attendees are more positively selected: both STEM-ready and less-STEM-ready women tend to go to college, while less-STEM-ready men attend at low rates. This means that among those who actually attend college, men are more STEM-ready on average than women, and in particular they dominate the upper tail of STEM readiness. Overall, college attendance narrows the gender gap in STEM by 6%. All of my main conclusions are qualitatively similar when I use very different definitions of STEM majors and occupations.====I interpret the exact percentage contributions with caution due to the fact that there are many pathways into and out of STEM in the U.S. One can “skip” a stage, for example – say, not starting in a STEM major – and still rejoin the STEM pipeline at a later stage. But the particular importance of STEM readiness, initial major choice, and early-career job choice holds up across different approaches I have used.====These results show clearly that there is no single stage at which women are being lost from STEM, meaning there are no easy remedies for closing the gender gap. There are fewer STEM-ready women by the time college begins, fewer of them choose STEM majors, and fewer of those choose STEM careers. Even when narrowing in on the highly qualified, well-educated women with STEM degrees, gender gaps in outcomes remain. I do not evaluate specific mechanisms or policy options in this paper, but my results suggest that multiple policy levers would be needed to meaningfully close the gender gap in STEM careers.====The gender gap in STEM fields has been studied extensively by researchers in economics, education, and other fields (see Kahn & Ginther, 2017 for a survey). Descriptive studies have established gender gaps in STEM that are larger even than racial gaps (Bettinger, 2010, Dickson, 2010). Potential explanations for these gaps are many, including differences in pre-college preparation (Speer, 2017), the gender makeup of faculty (Carrell et al., 2010, Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, 2009), the influence of peers (Fischer, 2017), and differences in taste for competition (Niederle & Vesterlund, 2011). Qualitative evidence from the education literature often highlights the culture of STEM fields that is male-dominated, highly competitive, and unfriendly to women (Brainard and Carlin, 1998, Seymour and Hewitt, 2000).====The primary contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive analysis of the STEM pipeline from high school to mid-career. My results speak indirectly to the reasons women leave STEM by looking at who leaves at each stage and where they go. While other researchers have studied parts of the pipeline (discussed in the next section), their focus has been narrower than mine. I show that several stages of the pipeline contribute to the end result. Even those women who make it over some significant hurdles may leave later on. Focusing only on the college experience, for example, misses the important roles of labor market and high school choices, and focusing only on the labor market misses the critical choices made before and during college. The gender gap in STEM appears prior to college, expands significantly in college, and continues to grow after college.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 defines the six stages of the STEM pipeline that I will consider and reviews the substantial literature on this topic.

I study a statewide postsecondary admissions policy in North Carolina which introduces minimum admission standards for students wishing to attend college in-state. Regression discontinuity estimates show that high school students respond by increasing GPA and decreasing absences and suspensions, suggesting increased engagement. However, I find that the boost in GPA is driven by students substituting away from demanding coursework. Finally, I document stark heterogeneity of response across ====, as minority and less affluent students have higher effort allocations but do not engage in strategic course-taking.","Most US elementary and secondary education policies seek to shift incentives for effort of teachers and schools rather than students. Despite being abundant in K-12 education settings, incentive structures that shape student behavior have received less attention from practitioners and policymakers as a lever to encourage students’ investments in school. Thus, researchers seeking to understand the effect of incentives on student effort focus mainly on evaluating the student incentive-effort connection via researcher-designed pay-for-performance incentives schemes (Bettinger, 2010, Fryer, 2011, Levitt et al., 2016).==== Incentive structures embedded within policies for access to higher education provide an alternative, more realistic, setting in which to examine student effort response to education policies.====This paper investigates how students’ effort responds to incentive structures in a salient and high-stakes setting driven by a change in admission requirements across one of the largest university systems in the US. In an attempt to improve graduation rates at all University of North Carolina (UNC) campuses and prevent dropouts by only admitting college-ready students, UNC set minimum GPA and SAT admission standards across the system in 2009, generating a discontinuity in the incentives for effort for high school students across SAT performance. Given that students take the SAT and learn about their admission eligibility before completing their high school coursework, students right below and right above the threshold face different returns to their effort in their last year of high school.====I leverage the discontinuity in the returns to effort generated by UNC’s 2009 admission policy to examine students’ response to sharp and transparent incentives. Under a regression discontinuity design, I rely on rich administrative data for the universe of high school students in the state of North Carolina to compare the effort allocation of students right above and below the SAT threshold.==== I find that students just above the SAT threshold have fewer 12th grade absences (−18.5%) and suspensions (−27.4%) than students right below. This suggests that students just above the threshold realize they have the possibility of getting admitted into a UNC campus, and increase effort in the form of attendance and less disruptive behavior. At the same time, students just above the SAT threshold obtain 12th grade GPAs that are 2.8% higher than students right below.====While the interpretation of fewer absences and suspensions is relatively straight forward, the interpretation of higher GPAs is less so. Higher student GPA can reflect either increased effort allocation, substitution away from more demanding courses, or both. To further explore the mechanisms driving this effect, I explore differences in course-taking patterns for students above and below the SAT admission requirement. I find that strategic course selection is an important dimension of student effort adjustments as higher GPAs of students right above the SAT cutoff are driven by students’ substitution away from more demanding coursework.====Finally, in unpacking these results, I document stark heterogeneity of student response across demographics. I find that minority and less affluent students just above the cutoff have higher effort allocations via decreased absences and suspensions but engage to a lesser extent in gaming practices via course selection. These results are in line with the literature examining student response to incentives in postsecondary settings in two important ways. First, this literature highlights how incentives have heterogeneous effects across student demographics and performance. Second, while incentives generated by postsecondary policy have been found to induce students to increase effort, they have also been found to induce students into less productive behaviors such as strategic course-taking, course withdrawal, and strategic effort allocation relative to the timing of eligibility criteria (Angrist et al., 2009, Casey et al., 2018, Cornwell et al., 2003, Lindo et al., 2010, Scott-Clayton, 2011, Scott-Clayton and Schudde, 2019).====A first order concern of the validity of the research design of this paper is SAT-retaking. Administrative records of NC student SAT performance includes only the last SAT administration. Given student SAT-retaking patterns (Goodman et al., 2020), test retaking can be an important source of endogeneity if students systematically retake the SAT in order to place themselves to the right of the cutoff to gain UNC admission eligibility. To address this concern, I provide several internal validity checks including tests of manipulation of the running variable, for policy relevance of the UNC cutoff, and of covariate smootheness. I further bound the regression discontinuity point estimates following Gerard et al. (2020) to correct for possible manipulation of the running variable (driven by SAT retaking). Taken together, results from these tests suggest that is unlikely that manipulation of the running variable and selection into treatment is such that is completely drives away the results of this paper.====This paper contributes to a recent and growing literature that examines student response to incentives schemes embedded in postsecondary admission policies, in particular, to preferential admission programs (such as percent plan and affirmative action programs). This literature documents important shifts in student effort and learning as a response to the implementation of preferential admission programs (Akhtari et al., 2020, Cortes and Zhang, 2012, Golightly, 2019, Khanna, 2013). Because the UNC system set ==== standards for admission, required GPA and test score cutoffs are low. Therefore, this paper adds to this literature by evaluating salient and high-stakes shift in incentives for students at the ==== end of the test score distribution.====Postsecondary admission policies have also been found to have unintended consequences of student response. For example, percent plan programs have been shown to induce students to sort into lower-achieving high schools (Cullen et al., 2013), decrease student effort for seniors who already know their admission guarantee (Leeds et al., 2017), and decrease effort for students who overestimate their probability of being in the top of their class (Tincani et al., 2020). This paper contributes to this literature by showing that while incentive structures can shape student effort, they can also induce students to adjust on less productive ways such as via strategic course selection.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Credit availability was tied to students successfully completing their education with the aim of increasing the local stock of human capital by discouraging cross-province migration. We analyze the efficacy of the graduate retention ==== credits within a difference-in-difference framework using confidential data from both administrative tax records and longitudinal surveys. Graduate retention credits were unable to decrease internal migration but were able to reduce the interest graduates paid on their loans.","Large increases in college and university==== enrollment over the past several decades has led to increasing drop-out rates (Turner, 2004) and stagnating completion rates (Oreopoulos & Petronijevic, 2013). According to ==== data from the National Center for Education Statistics, 58% of American students enrolled in a four-year college program graduated in six years, while in Canada, 84% of students enrolled in university graduated in seven years (Magazine, 2014). With drop-out rates being as high as they are, researchers and policymakers are asking what can done to increase college persistence.====Starting in ====, the Canadian province of New Brunswick began offering tax credits in an effort to encourage recent university graduates to remain in, and thus contribute to, the local economy. Nova Scotia released similar province-specific incentives in 2006, while Manitoba and Saskatchewan implemented their own graduate retention programs (GRPs) in ====. These GRPs offered tax credits between ==== and ==== (nominal Canadian dollars) to students who are enrolled in post-secondary education.====This paper examines the tax policies of Canadian graduate retention programs (GRPs) that are aimed at increasing the number of college graduates and retaining them in the provinces where they studied. We measure the impacts of these programs on university enrollment, university drop out, and interprovincial migration decisions using a difference-in-differences empirical design and restricted administrative and survey data. Our analysis using the Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD) suggests retention programs did not change enrollment or drop-out decisions for individuals age ==== to ==== in affected provinces. However, these individuals did show decreases in the amount of student loans by about 123.1 (real) dollars annually (relative to a pre-treatment mean of ==== real dollars). These results are robust when we compare the subsample of individuals who were already enrolled in post-secondary education with the sample of those who were yet to enter when the graduate retention program was announced. We further present event studies figures to understand potential dynamics of those affected by graduate retention programs and to give visual evidence of parallel trends prior to their rollout. While no point estimates following the GRPs are statistically significant at the 95% level, university graduates are trending upwards and university dropouts are trending downwards following the GRPs.====Individuals aged ==== to ==== in Atlantic Canada who were affected by the retention programs were 5.3 percentage points (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 57.7%) more likely to have graduated university following the program when compared with those who were unaffected. Affected males were 6.9 percentage points more likely to graduate (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 57.0%), while affected females were 4.1 percentage points more likely to graduate (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 58.2%). While we find null effects for changes in migration across the samples of all individuals and of only males, we find females in Atlantic Canada were 4.5 percentage points less likely to move provinces (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 31.1%).====We use the Survey of Labour Income and Dynamics (SLID) to further investigate educational attainment and migration decisions. We find that individuals aged ==== to ==== and affected by the graduate retention program were 4.5 percentage points less likely to drop out of university (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 9.5%), while the subsample of males was 8.3 percentage points less likely to drop out of university (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 11.3%). We found no statistically significant effects among individuals attending college or any post-secondary education program in GRP provinces and among females attending university. All individuals who were affected by GRP programs and who turned ==== after the program rollout were also less likely to drop out of university by 5.8 percentage points (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 9.5%). These results suggest that GRP programs decrease the willingness of individuals to drop out of university. While males in the SLID in Atlantic Canada and aged ==== to ==== who were affected by the programs were 17.7 percentage points more likely to move provinces (relative to a pre-treatment mean of 76.4%), we generally find no effects on educational attainment or migration decisions for females and for both sexes.====The results from both datasets suggest that graduate retention credits were not able to robustly decrease cross-province migration. Using the LAD, we found females may have been less likely to move; however, we could not confirm this using the SLID. Moreover, the use of either the combined sample of males and females or the sample of only males from both datasets suggests null effects or increasing likelihood of migration.====Our analysis emphasizes that, in settings with few treated clusters, traditional methods for cluster-robust inference can over-reject the null hypothesis (MacKinnon & Webb, 2017). Following the recommendation in MacKinnon and Webb (2020), we perform a Monte Carlo given the specific distribution of cluster sizes and treatment for our datasets. On the basis of this, we construct context-specific confidence intervals using both the six-point bootstrap (Webb, 2022) and the effective number of clusters (Carter et al., 2017).====The Canadian graduate retention programs are similar to several American state governments that have a merit scholarship program.==== Both the merit scholarships and the retention credits attempt to raise the average level of educational attainment within a jurisdiction. While both programs tie educational funding to a geographic location, there are three notable differences between merit programs and retention programs. First, merit programs do not restrict where recipients can reside following graduation. Second, merit scholarships offer incentives to ==== in college in a specified location, while retention credits offer incentives to ==== from college and ==== in a specified location after graduation. Third, merit scholarships offer financial assistance while the student is enrolled in college, whereas retention credits offer assistance after graduation.==== While the merit scholarships have received considerable attention, there has been relatively little analysis on graduate retention credits.==== This paper provides the first analysis of causal outcomes of these programs. The New Brunswick program is evaluated in Bhuyian et al. (2020) in terms of its stated goals. The local stock of human capital is increasingly considered important for developing regional economies. In particular, several researchers have studied the effectiveness of various policies at increasing the local stock.==== Yet, improving the local stock of higher education graduates is difficult because of the higher likelihood of graduates to migrate within a country (Kennan, 2018, Malamud and Wozniak, 2012). Other research suggests merit scholarships do not increase the retention of college-bound students after graduation (Sjoquist & Winters, 2013). Retention programs were introduced in Canada to discourage internal migration because many graduates move between provinces after they graduate.==== However, we find migration patterns unchanged as a result of the programs, possibly explaining why three of the four provinces have temporarily or permanently suspended their graduate retention programs.====The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 places the programs in the context of the literature. Section 3 provides an overview of the various graduate retention programs we study. Section 4 describes Canada’s Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD) and Survey of Labour Income and Dynamics (SLID).

We identify network effects from small changes in same-race/same-nativity shares across cohorts within college-majors. White native-born, Black native-born, and Black immigrant students who belong to cohorts with larger shares of same group peers experience higher earnings and employment in the 10 years after college entry. Benefits to Black immigrants are particularly large: a 1 ==== increase in the share of peers who are Black immigrants results in an approximate 2 percent increase in annual earnings. Among Hispanic immigrants, the effects of same-group peers on earnings and educational attainment are negative in the years immediately after college entry, while the effects on employment are large and positive. Hispanic native-born students do not receive earnings gains from a larger potential network.","The earnings of students with postsecondary training differ markedly across racial/ethnic and nativity groups in the United States. For example, the hourly wages of African-Americans with a college degree was approximately 78 percent that of Whites with a college degree in 2019 (Gould, 2020). White college graduates are also paid more than Hispanic college graduates, many of whom are immigrants (Gould, 2020; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Prior research offers a number of explanations for these raw earnings gaps, including differences in pre-college skills, college quality, major choices, discrimination, and for nativity gaps, the out-migration of high-wage immigrants.==== A handful of studies have also examined the role of the networks in which postsecondary students are embedded and how these networks influence their labor market outcomes. The previous findings suggest that college networks improve labor market outcomes among White native-born students who are often enrolled in selective institutions. Little is known, however, about the role of college networks among students who are less economically privileged, immigrants, or belong to other racial/ethnic groups.====In this paper, we investigate the effects of college networks on the annual earnings of students enrolled in a large urban public college and university system (hereafter, “the system”). Based on previous findings that physical proximity (e.g., sharing the same dorm, classroom, cohort) and shared race/ethnicity are strong predictors of the friendships that students form in U.S. schools and colleges (e.g., Quillian & Campbell, 2003; Marmaros & Sacerdote, 2006; Mayer & Puller, 2008), we define a network as a group of students in the same college, cohort, major, race/ethnicity, and nativity status. We identify the effects of these networks using variation in the share of classmates that are of the same-race/same-nativity across cohorts within the same college and major. This is a measure of exposure to same group classmates, which is not a direct measure of social interaction among students. Indeed, the correlation between network size and social interaction is determined by the strength of the social ties, which are often difficult to measure. We assume that exposure to more same-group students broadens the network of information with some of the ties being weaker than others (e.g., some students will become friends while others mere acquaintances). We use the phrase “potential network” in places as a reminder of this distinction.====Our sample is restricted to students who choose a major at college entry, thereby minimizing potential biases driven by endogeneity of major choice to peers’ decisions. Our identifying assumption is that students do not choose colleges and majors based on knowledge of the composition of each entering cohort such that deviations in the racial/ethnic and nativity composition across cohorts is uncorrelated with student traits that affect labor market outcomes. We show that this assumption holds true on most observable pre-enrollment student characteristics and that the effects of network shares on earnings and education are similar with and without these covariates.====Consistent with the previous literature on the role of networks in higher education, we find that White native-born students experience earnings and employment gains when the share of classmates that are also White, native-born students increases. We also find that Black native-born and particularly Black immigrants also benefit from their potential networks. Black immigrant students’ gains from larger potential networks significantly exceed the benefits received by other student groups, with a 1 standard deviation (2.8 percentage-point) increase in the share of peers who are Black immigrants resulting in a $571 (2 percent) increase in long-run annual earnings. There is no evidence that the employment gains among these groups are linked to increases in educational attainment.====Among Hispanic students, however, effects of larger potential networks operate quite differently than they do among the other racial/ethnic groups. Neither Hispanic immigrants nor native-born students experience earnings gains as a result of entering a major with a greater share of same-group peers; indeed most of our estimates suggest negative effects on Hispanic immigrant students’ earnings. Yet the effect of same group peers on the employment of Hispanic immigrants is large and positive, while effects on degree attainment over the same time period are negative. These results for Hispanic immigrants suggest that the reduction in earnings may be a result of students choosing to enter the labor force sooner at the expense of educational attainment and, ultimately, earnings. In contrast, Hispanic native-born students have lower employment rates when they enter majors with a larger share of same-group peers and their degree completion is unaffected, suggesting that a larger potential network may provide only limited referrals or other job-related information====Our paper informs and draws from research on network and peer effects in neighborhoods and postsecondary institutions. A long line of research has established that job market searches are at least partially dependent upon social networks and that networks operate differently (and lead to different outcomes) for White, Black, and Hispanic job-seekers.==== Networks of friends and neighbors can affect employment outcomes through career advice and information about jobs as well as direct referrals. For instance, Hellerstein, McInerney and Neumark (2011) find strong evidence of race-based neighborhood networks where individuals of the same race and zip code are more likely to work in the same establishment than what would be expected from a random allocation of individuals across organizations. Hellerstein, McInerney and Neumark (2011) also find larger network effects on same-establishment employment for Hispanic than for Black and White neighbors, indicating that the effect of a network is larger for job-seekers who face barriers to job searches through traditional channels (e.g., limited familiarity with English). Related to these results, McManus (1990) finds that living in a community with many co-ethnic members who speak the same language provides better jobs for Hispanic adults who are not fully English proficient than for those who are, thereby lowering the returns to English language ability.====These results highlight the substantial heterogeneity in effects: whether networks operate negatively or positively will depend on the opportunities and information that the network offers. High rates of immigrant entrepreneurship, for example, may lead to stronger network effects for some communities, particularly if the hiring managers are from the same ethnic group (Kerr & Kerr, 2016). At the same time, extensive ethnic networks may afford opportunities outside of the mainstream labor market or in lower-paying industries, which could lead to lower earnings for some groups (Loury, 2006).====In the postsecondary education literature, networks (or “peers”) have been shown to influence students, with effects on both non-academic (e.g., drinking, exercising) and academic outcomes.==== Thus, in addition to influencing labor market outcomes through job-related information and referrals, college classmates can influence the degree of effort that individuals put into their schooling and/or their job searches. A small set of papers explores the effect of college peers on labor market outcomes. In work most similar to our own, Zhu (2021) tests whether community college students receive job referrals from former classmates and finds positive, significant effects. We focus on earnings and employment and provide evidence of heterogeneous effects by race/ethnicity and nativity. Other studies focus on the effect of peers in relatively elite institutions, such as Harvard University (Shue, 2013; Josh Lerner & Ulrike Malmendier, 2013; Michelman, Price & Zimmerman, 2022), Dartmouth College (Marmaros & Sacerdote, 2002), Indiana University Business School (Hacamo & Kleiner, 2022), and top universities in Chile (Zimmerman, 2019). These inquiries overwhelmingly conclude that friendships with fellow elites leads to better labor market outcomes.====Our analysis contributes to this emerging literature by exploring network effects on employment outcomes among postsecondary students who come from a wide range of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds, including many immigrant students. With these expansive data, we can uncover heterogeneity in network effects that prior studies have been unable to examine. We also provide suggestive evidence on some of the mechanisms through which postsecondary networks may operate, specifically whether networks influence earnings through access to employment and/or indirectly through proxy measures of academic effort, including degree completion and credit accumulation.",Race and nativity earnings gaps: The role of college networks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775723000031,30 January 2023,2023,Research Article,26.0

This study compares weekday to weekend delivery of such a program focused on ====. Weekend texts are, on average, more beneficial to children's literacy and math development for initially lower-achieving children. The weekday texts show benefits for higher-achieving children on higher-order skills. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that lower-educated parents and parents of lower-achieving students face such high barriers during weekdays that light-touch supports cannot consistently overcome them, while during weekends barriers to parenting are well-suited to being addressed by these behavioral approaches.","Parental time investments impact children's development (Del Boca, Flinn & Wiswall, 2014; Del Bono, Francesconi, Kelly & Sacker, 2016; Greenman, Bodovski & Reed, 2011; Thomsen, 2015). These time investments can vary from year-to-year, month-to-month, week-to-week, and day-to-day. Since most parents work away from home, time spent with their children is limited to non-work hours and to their days off (Bianchi, 2000; Fox, Han, Ruhm & Waldfogel, 2013; Stewart, 2010). Responsibilities of work, household, and finances also create cognitive demands that may affect parenting practices and may vary day-to-day. As a result, parenting effectiveness may differ by day, and parents may systematically benefit more from parenting supports on some days than on others. On some days, parents have greater needs for suggestions of what to do with their children because they are facing greater barriers; yet, on some days, these barriers may be so great that supports are not enough to affect parent-child interactions. In this study, we test and find that the effects of a text-messaged based parenting program differ depending on the days of the week it is offered.====Parents face a number of barriers that hinder their ability to provide beneficial home learning environments for their children. Working during their children's waking hour is clearly one barrier. Information about how to create supportive environments may be another. On top of these difficulties, behavioral barriers can be strong. For instance, the demands of parenting can create a heavy ====. Parents need to make many choices each day about what questions to ask their children, what to feed them, and how to respond to their questions, requests and behaviors. These day-to-day decisions alone can burden parents with a heavy cognitive load, leading parents to interact sub-optimally with their children.==== Similarly, some of the gratifying aspects of parenting occur in the future, and ==== can cause suboptimal behavior such as underinvestment of time and effort in parenting.==== Moreover, strong cognitive demands can increase self-control problems when individuals make less mindful choices because of distractions (Shiv & Fedorikhin, 1999). Hence, parents may not engage in skill-building activities that are rewarded in the long-term on days with high barriers.==== Finally, day-to-day tasks may distract parents from more distant goals and cause parents to pay ==== to beneficial parenting practices.====These information, time, and behavioral constraints may be more detrimental for parents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Wealthier parents often have jobs with more flexibility, as well as greater access to child care (Galinsky, Sakai & Wigton, 2011), while parents in poorer families often have more restrictive work hours (Bianchi, 2011; Williams & Boushey, 2010). Moreover, the strains of poverty itself limit cognitive capacity for complex tasks (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir & Zhao, 2013; Shah, Mullainathan & Shafir, 2012). Parents with low incomes may use more of their cognitive capacity on daily financial challenges, aggravating the behavioral barriers to parenting. In part as a result, college-educated parents spend more time with their children (Guryan, Hurst & Kearney, 2008; Sayer, Gauthier & Furstenberg, 2004) and are able to engage more in educational activities (Hsin & Felfe, 2014). Furthermore, the default activities for parents who themselves were raised in highly educated families may be more helpful to children than the default behaviors of other parents, even if both groups face the same behavioral challenges.====Programs aimed at improving parenting practices may be most effective if targeted during times when parents can engage in parenting activities and interact with their children. Most programs have shown only limited success, perhaps because they are not flexible enough to accommodate timing nuances and they focus on information barriers instead of the behavioral barriers of parenting (Aos, Lieb, Mayfield, Miller & Pennucci, 2004; Duncan, Ludwig & Magnuson, 2010; Karoly et al., 1998). More recently, text-messaging interventions have emerged as a promising alternative or supplement to traditional approaches due to their low cost, the widespread use of mobile phones, and their ease of scalability. They have shown to positively influence both student and parent outcomes in a wide array of educational settings.==== Text messaging interventions also can readily target particular times and days when advice may be more useful for parents.====This study asks whether the effectiveness of text-message-based parenting support depends on when the support is provided. Specifically, it compares the effects of an early childhood text-messaging program sent during the weekend to those of the same program sent on weekdays. The text-messaging program, which we will call ==== (also known as ====), has shown positive effects on parental engagement and children's literacy development (Doss, Fahle, Loeb & York, 2019; York, Loeb & Doss, 2019). This intervention breaks down the complexities of parenting by providing a combination of ==== about important literacy skills and parent-child activities (i.e., “FACT” text messages), ==== with specific examples of parent-child literacy activities (i.e., “TIP” text messages), and ==== (i.e., “GROWTH” text messages).==== Starting from the hypothesis that most parents face greater distractions from positive parenting during weeknights than on weekends, if the program is more effective during the week, then the mechanism is likely through reducing barriers that are higher. If it is more effective on the weekend, then the mechanism is likely through reducing barriers that are not so high as to be insurmountable. We expect effect heterogeneity given that some parents may face higher barriers and have less strong defaults.====We randomly assign parents of pre-kindergarten children into three treatment groups. The first group of parents receives the original program, that is, a “FACT” message on Monday, a “TIP” message on Wednesday, and a “GROWTH” message on Friday, henceforth the ==== program. The second group receives the “FACT,” “TIP,” and “GROWTH” messages on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively, henceforth ==== program. The ==== program differs from the ==== program in that it sends the text messages on different and consecutive days. Therefore, a third group of parents receives the “FACT,” “TIP,” and “GROWTH” messages on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, respectively, in order to parse out the ==== from the ====. This program henceforth will be called the ==== program.====We find that sending text messages with parenting support on weekends is more beneficial to children's development, on average, than sending texts on weekdays. Moreover, we find that the benefits of the weekend program were particularly pronounced for parents with less educational attainment and for children who started pre-Kindergarten in the lower half of the baseline skill distribution on easier sub-components, such as rapid letter naming, rote counting, and shape naming, whereas the weekday program was somewhat more beneficial for higher educated parents and for the initially higher achieving children. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the lower-educated parents and parents of lower-achieving students, on average, face higher barriers during weekdays, and supports are not enough to overcome these barriers. For the parents of higher-achieving students and those with more education, weekday texts are more effective because weekdays are not so difficult as to impede positive parenting. These findings suggest that parenting support works best when parents have time, attention, and need.",When behavioral barriers are too high or low – How timing matters for text-based parenting interventions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572200125X,9 January 2023,2023,Research Article,27.0

However, little is known about how teachers value various elements of their retirement benefits versus other aspects of their jobs and compensation. To help alleviate this gap, we use a discrete choice ","Retirement benefits are an important part of teachers’ compensation packages and millions of retired teachers rely on government-sponsored pension plans for their livelihood. Unfortunately, states and school districts across the United States have not set enough money aside to fully cover the benefits teachers have already earned. Teachers’ pensions in the United States are only 72% funded on average and have total unfunded liabilities exceeding $600 billion, a sum that is likely to increase in the coming years as plans adopt more conservative assumptions and grapple with a challenging investment environment (McGee, 2019; Novy‐Marx & Rauh, 2011; Public Plans Data, 2020).====Teachers’ pension funding shortfalls have resulted in large cost increases and potentially reduced investment in other important areas. Annual per-pupil teacher retirement costs have nearly tripled since 2004, rising from $599 to $1763, and now account for 11.6% of the total per-pupil education expenditures (Costrell, 2022a). Soaring pension costs crowd out other expenditures, leaving less money to pay today's teachers, affecting both take-home salary and benefits (Aldeman, 2016; Anzia, 2020; Backes et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2020; McGee, 2016; Nation, 2018). Unfortunately, pension costs may increase further. Adequate state and local government pension funding would require expenditures to roughly double (Rauh, 2017).====In recent years, many states have changed teachers’ retirement benefits in response to rising costs. Most changes to teachers’ retirement plans maintain the traditional final-average-salary defined benefit (FAS) design but alter parameters like retirement age, how much teachers earn for each year of work, and how much teachers contribute to the plan. Several states have considered, but relatively few have adopted (e.g., Kansas, Washington, etc.), alternative pension plan designs like defined contribution (DC), cash balance (CB), and hybrid plans that combine elements of two or more models.==== Benefit changes have disproportionately affected new teachers, sometimes substantially reducing the value of retirement benefits for the next generation of educators.====These changes to teachers’ retirement plans have the potential to substantially alter teacher labor markets (e.g., Brown, 2013; Costrell & McGee, 2010). Advocates for traditional FAS pensions contend that benefit reductions and/or plan design changes will harm states’ ability to recruit and retain talented teachers (Boivie, 2011, 2017; Bond, 2017). They argue that teachers prefer FAS plans to alternative plans and that traditional pensions are effective workforce management tools that incentivize retention and orderly turnover at known retirement ages.====However, when offered alternative plans, a substantial percentage of teachers choose the alternatives, and the evidence on traditional pensions’ effectiveness as a workforce management tool is limited and mixed at best (Chingos & West, 2015; Friedberg & Webb, 2005; Goldhaber et al., 2017; Ni et al., 2020b). Additionally, teachers must be aware of and value specific plan features for retirement plans to affect teacher labor markets, but evidence suggests that teachers exhibit limited retirement knowledge (Brown & Weisbenner, 2014; Chan & Stevens, 2008; DeArmond & Goldhaber, 2010; Fuchsman et al., 2021; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1999) and that they have a difficult time accurately valuing retirement benefits (Brown et al., 2017, 2021; Kim, 2020).====Of course, teachers care more broadly about their overall compensation package and job conditions. As a result, policymakers and school leaders must weigh important tradeoffs when making changes. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how teachers value various features of their retirement plans versus other aspects of their jobs and compensation.====Over the coming years, pension reform will almost certainly continue to be a topic of conversation in state legislatures due to ongoing funding challenges. To inform the tradeoffs that policymakers are likely to face, we designed an experiment to quantify how teachers value various job attributes, including retirement plan design and characteristics. We administered a survey to a nationally representative sample of teachers from the RAND's American Teacher Panel. We embedded a discrete choice stated preferences experiment in this survey.====The design of our experiment closely follows work by Maestas et al. (2018) and Mas & Pallais (2017). We repeatedly asked respondents to choose between two jobs that are the same in every way except they have different randomly assigned salaries and vary on one non-salary characteristic (e.g., retirement plan type, retirement age, Social Security enrollment, etc.). We use respondents’ choices to estimate their willingness-to-pay for specific job characteristics. We explore potential heterogeneity in preferences based on respondents’ teaching experience, cognitive ability, conscientiousness, financial literacy, risk tolerance, and teachers’ self-reported probability of leaving the profession within five years.====Our results indicate that early-career teachers do not have a strong preference for a specific retirement plan type, but that teachers’ willingness-to-pay for traditional pensions over alternative plans might increase with experience. However, we also find that, on average, teachers have stronger preferences around their expected salary replacement in retirement and retirement age than plan type. Respondents also valued participation in traditional pension plans less than many other elements of their compensation, including salary growth, health insurance coverage, and Social Security enrollment. Additionally, we find that teachers with higher cognitive ability, higher financial literacy, and lower levels of risk tolerance are willing to pay more for FAS plans.====These findings make three key contributions to the literature. First, our nationally representative stated preferences experiment allows us to quantify teachers’ preferences for various job characteristics, including retirement plan design, in dollar terms. While others have asked teachers about their preferences around retirement plans (DeArmond & Goldhaber, 2010; Johnston, 2021), we are not aware of any prior research that estimates willingness to pay using a nationally representative sample. Second, we are the first to estimate teachers’ preferences around CB plans, which several states have considered and Kansas recently adopted for new hires (Costrell, 2022b).====Finally, we estimate preferences for a variety of job conditions across several potential values. While others infer preferences for deferred versus current compensation given a real-world policy change (Biasi, 2019; Fitzpatrick, 2015; Goldhaber & Holden, 2020), their estimates are limited by the specifics of the choice offered to workers, which constrains their utility for informing new retirement policy.

We utilize a gradual rollout of the work-first approach (on-the-job training within the first year after arrival) combined with a dispersal policy of refugees across municipalities in Denmark. We find that being placed in municipalities emphasizing the work-first approach is positively associated with later employment and earnings but show that the associations are temporary. A higher local propensity to use the work-first approach is negatively related to time spent in language courses, level of courses completed and the grade point average for language course exam attendees. We discuss whether the reduced language course attendance could be an explanation of the lack of a persistent labor market effects.","The integration of refugees into the labor market remains a serious challenge in most Western countries, and unlike the case in the US many refugees in Europe never catch up with natives (Cortes, 2004; Dustmann et al., 2017; Zimmermann, 2017; Brell et al., 2020; Bevelander, 2020). Two dimensions of refugee integration are predominant in the national integration policies in the EU: host country language knowledge and labor market participation (Martín et al., 2016; Hernes et al., 2022). Yet, there is limited evidence as to which modalities foster better outcomes in these dimensions. While language courses have been offered to newly arrived refugees for decades in some countries====, an emphasis on work-first strategies has gained popularity in many Northern European countries, particularly in the aftermath of the surge in the number of refugees from Syria in 2015 (Martín et al., 2016; Konle-Seidl & Bolitz, 2016). Work-first strategies may include interventions such as early skills assessment, fast-track options, early job training, economic incentives for labor market participation, and work permits during the asylum-seeking phase.====This study compares the work-first and language-first integration strategies for persons with asylum or subsidiary protection (henceforth referred to commonly as refugees). We only include refugees who participate in language courses during the first year since arrival (93% of the refugees in the working age range in our context, because language course enrolment is compulsory) and among them we contrast the refugees who are placed in municipalities that emphasizes a work-first approach to a different extent. The work-first approach consists of the use of early on-the-job training during the first year after arrival. Since all refugees in our sample participate in language courses during the year of arrival, we refer to a higher use of early on-the-job training as the treatment. We examine how a higher use of early on-the-job training in the arrival municipality affects host country language course participation and completion, as well as labor market outcomes in the medium-long run; 3½ years after arrival.====We hypothesize that a more frequent use of early on-the-job training may affect formal language acquisition directly through increased exposure to the native language but that it may also have a negative indirect impact through a time constraint that leads to less time spent on language courses. Likewise, early on-the-job training may affect labor market outcomes directly, e.g., by providing training of job-specific skills and networks, or indirectly through changes in language acquisition. We therefore emphasize that work-first strategies may involve a trade-off between early labor market entry and other skills investments. These hypotheses are further developed formally in Appendix A.====We benefit from rich administrative registry data covering all refugees aged 18–64 who were granted a residence permit for the first time in Denmark in 2012 to the first quarter of 2016 and combine it with unique information on monthly employment outcomes, monthly participation patterns in language courses and job training and scores in the final language tests.====To identify the effect of a more intensive use of early job training, we use two sources of variation: First, we utilize the Danish dispersal policy for refugees, that allocate refugees to municipalities mainly based on the number of inhabitants, adjusted for the number of immigrants already residing in the municipality. This mitigates selection of refugees into areas with better labor market opportunities. Second, we argue that a series of governmental recommendations paved the way for a gradual rollout over time of the use of early on-the-job training for refugees in Denmark (see Section 2.2). We use this variation to separate the effect of local use of early on-the-job-training from local labor market conditions. Over a matter of a few years, the fraction of refugees who participated in on-the-job training in the first year since arrival increased from 20% to close to 50%, but with substantial differences in the take-up across municipalities====. We compare refugees who by chance end up in municipalities with a more frequent use of early job-training to refugees who end up in municipalities where refugees are primarily subjected to a language-first approach. Dispersal policies have previously been applied for identification of the effect of local characteristics on refugee employment (Edin et al., 2003, 2004; Åslund & Rooth, 2007; Damm, 2009; Beaman, 2012; Godøy, 2017; Marténs et al., 2019; Bratsberg et al., 2020; Azlor et al., 2020), but the use of the gradual roll-out of early on-the-job training is new.====We find that increased local use of early on-the-job training is positively associated with employment during the second year after arrival, but that the association disappears during the third and fourth year. The results condition on place and time of arrival as well as local unemployment and employment rate at arrival. We also find that increased use of early on-the-job training is negatively related to time spent in language courses and the final completed course level. Finally, we show that refugees who are placed in municipalities with a higher use of early on-the-job-training perform substantially worse at the final language course test, and that there are no significant effects on exam attendance. We present evidence that supports a causal interpretation of these associations but cannot rule out potential selection effects because use of early on-the-job training is correlated with the local employment rate.====Instrumental variables (IV) estimates, where individual participation in early on-the-job-training is instrumented by previous local use of early on-the-job-training, reproduce the same results: Significant but temporary positive labor market effects and a permanent significant reduction in language course participation. The IV results should be interpreted with care, as they are only causal under auxiliary assumptions. Nevertheless, the results suggest that increased use of a work-first strategy that emphasizes early participation in on-the-job-training only produces positive effects in the short run, at the expense of time spent in language courses. The absence of long-term effects in the labor market suggest that time spent in the labor market (job training or employment) is not superior to time spent on language courses, but that the two approaches are substitutes in the medium run.====Our study contributes to different strands of literature, each of which examines how different modalities of integration support can foster refugee integration. One strand of literature has shown that job search support and on-the-job training produce positive effects on labor market integration in the short run (Joona et al., 2016; Clausen et al., 2009; Heinesen et al., 2013; Arendt, 2022; Foged et al., 2022b). All these studies consider the impact of on-the-job training for up to two years, and we add to these studies considering impacts for up to 3½ year. Another strand of literature has emphasized host country language acquisition as an important determinant of labor market integration in Western countries (Chiswick & Miller, 1995; Dustmann & van Soest, 2001, 2002; Dustmann & Fabbri, 2003; Budría & Martínez-de-Ibarreta, 2021). In this literature, exposure to the native language is considered a key determinant, though this has mainly been studied indirectly (Espinosa & Massey, 1997; Chiswick, 1998; Espenshade & Fu, 1997; Warman, 2007; Chiswick & Miller, 2014). Though we do not consider language proficiency per se, we contribute to this literature by examining a new measure of exposure – time spent in the labor market. The finding that time spent in the labor market reduces participation in language training is in accordance with findings in Arendt (2022) and Damm et al. (2022). We add to these results by showing that also language course level is also affected. Reduced language course participation and performance is potentially important in the longer term, since recent studies suggest that language course training may produce substantial long-term labor market effects (Sarvimäki & Hämäläinen, 2016; Foged et al., 2022a). Foged et al. (2022a) find that a reform that raised language course instruction hours by 200 h produced substantial and positive earnings effects 18 years after arrival. By comparison, refugees ending up in municipalities where all refugees are subjected to the work-first approach spent 152 fewer hours in language courses than refugee in municipalities that do not use the work-first approach. Therefore, even though the work-first and the language-first approach produce similar employment effects in the medium run, there is a risk that the work-first may produce negative earnings effects in the longer run if additional time spent in the labor market does not compensate the loss from less time spent in language training.",Trade-offs between work-first and language-first strategies for refugees,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722001261,5 January 2023,2023,Research Article,29.0

Using within-municipality variation in per capita oil revenues transferred to municipalities, we find that receiving more oil royalties increases municipal education expenditures, which translates into more teachers, classrooms, and schools per capita. These effects are present only for municipally funded schools, implying that increased educational provision is due to better funding and not through increased demand for schooling. We also find, however, that some evidence that some types of school infrastructure and services may be affected by oil royalties, implying that this additional schooling coverage may be of lower quality. Interestingly, despite the increased provision of education student outcomes like the dropout rate worsen with higher oil royalties, although this may be due to changes in student composition.","Understanding whether the blessing of natural resource abundance is beneficial to the long-term economic growth of developing countries is an important but unanswered question. Two main mechanisms hinder any potential benefits accrued from resource windfalls from translating into economic gains. First, the natural resource sector could incentivize workers to take high-paying but relatively low-skilled jobs at the expense of educational attainment. Second, weak institutions could divert revenues from resource windfalls to the hands of elites, preventing those revenues from being used for public goods provision and other types of investment.==== More specifically, if resource windfalls do not translate into better schooling provision this could reduce the likelihood of those windfalls translating into better long-run outcomes. In this paper, we use legally mandated oil revenues passed from oil production to Brazilian municipalities to determine whether or not resource windfalls can improve the provision of education in Brazil.====In our analysis, we combine data on oil royalties provided to municipalities with detailed school census data that cover all schools in Brazil and a wide array of their characteristics. We first find that these oil royalties increase per capita municipal education expenditures. We then find that increases to oil revenues received by municipalities increase the number of schools, staff, and classrooms per capita in those municipalities. Importantly, we show that these increases are driven purely by municipally funded schools, ruling out contemporaneous shocks to demand for schooling. We also show that the proportion of municipal schools with electricity and computer labs decreases, and that the proportion of schools offering free activities and meals also declines. We then turn to the teacher-level data and show that municipal teaching staff that are hired with oil royalties are teachers, not other education support workers.====Finally, we show that municipalities that received more oil royalties experienced lower pass rates and higher dropout rates for students in municipally funded primary schools. Taken together, the evidence in this paper suggests that extending schooling coverage through oil royalties improves schooling provision, but this increased provision may extend to a group of students that have worse outcomes due to differences in composition, although worsened provision of certain school infrastructure or services on average may also have played a contributing role. The empirical evidence in this paper does not provide a definitive answer to why student outcomes are worsening despite better education provision, however, so the mechanism behind this result remains an important puzzle.====Our paper ties into a literature examining the effects of various economic and natural resource shocks on outcomes, and education in particular. Shah and Steinberg (2017) find that positive rainfall shocks in rural India increases the opportunity cost of schooling for older children, through raising the earnings from working in agriculture.==== Using another type of natural resource shock, Kruger (2007) shows that increases to coffee production in Brazil induced children to exit schooling and enter the labour force; this was particularly true for poorer children. Hægeland et al. (2012) examine the effect of higher local tax revenues from hydropower plants induced by the location of waterfalls in Norway on student achievement. Like our paper, they find that the higher tax revenues led to higher school expenditures. Unlike our paper, they also report that student performance improved at age 16, in part due to more teacher hours per student.====More generally, there is work by Mideksa (2013) that shows that natural resources, as measured by the endowment of petroleum resources, increases GDP growth in Norway. There is also work examining how other types of positive economic shocks or programs affect educational provision and attainment; (Atkin, 2016), for example, uses variation in export opportunities in Mexico and finds that more jobs in export industries induce students to drop out of school due to the higher opportunity cost of education. Another example is Glewwe and Kassouf (2012), who find that conditional cash transfers tied to children’s education in Brazil can improve educational attainment. In the Brazilian context, Litschig and Morrison (2013) find that exogenous increases to municipal revenues from intergovernmental transfers increased schooling provision and education. A final example is (Asher & Novosad, 2017), who look at mining booms driven by price shocks in India and show that resource rent shocks increase the hiring of criminal politicians and increase criminal behaviour by politicians. Our paper will differ from these other analyses by focusing on how one particular type of shock, oil windfalls, can impact the provision of education through potentially higher municipal revenues and the characteristics of the schools that provide this education.====More specifically, our paper ties into a very large literature examining the role of oil-related shocks in education and other outcomes. Bhavnani and Lupu (2016), similar to our work, use oil royalties given to municipalities in Brazil to explore their effect on local political outcomes. Using the energy boom in Western Canada as a natural experiment, Marchand, 2012, Marchand, 2015 examine the effects of natural resource-driven windfalls on local labour market outcomes such as inequality, earnings, and employment.==== Black et al. (2005) study the coal boom and bust in 1970s US Appalachia and find that coal booms increased high school dropout rates as low-skilled wages increased, while the subsequent coal bust did the opposite.==== Marchand and Weber (2020) examine the shale oil boom in Texas and find that oil revenues did not go towards hiring more, or better teachers, contributing to lower test scores. Finally, Maurer (2018) finds that, in early 20th-century America, oil field discoveries led to better provision of education but had no measurable improvement in attendance rates.====Relative to these papers, our work contributes to this literature by using the natural experiment from Bhavnani and Lupu (2016) to examine how natural resource shocks can improve the provision of education; in contrast to Marchand and Weber (2020), we find that both capital projects (in the form of schools and classrooms) as well as hiring of teachers (in the form of staff increases) can occur as a result of increases to municipal revenues from oil windfalls. However, similar to our paper, Marchand and Weber (2020) report that student achievement declined as a result of the revenue windfall. They attribute this to greater teacher turnover and the hiring of more inexperienced teachers. This is a mechanism that is potentially present in the Brazilian context as well because we find that the greater oil revenues lead to younger teachers being hired more. Our findings are also consistent with those of Maurer (2018), but in a very different (contemporary, non-developed country) context. In contrast to Maurer (2018) and most of the above work, we also use a Brazilian government policy that allows us to arguably better disentangle the effect of municipal revenue increases from schooling demand shocks driven by employment effects from local natural resource booms. While we are not the first to exploit this policy change,==== we present the most comprehensive examination of the provision of education in Brazil in response to oil royalties.====The work most related to our own is that by Caselli and Michaels (2013), who examine how oil windfalls affect municipal expenditures and the provision of public goods, including education. They find evidence that oil output-driven increases in municipal revenues correlate with higher spending on public goods and services, but they also find very mixed results in terms of actual increases to the provision of public goods. In particular, when looking at purely cross-sectional specifications (Caselli & Michaels, 2013) find relatively strong evidence of municipal revenues from oil increasing teachers and classrooms per capita. However, when using pseudo-first differences specifications, they find that there is no statistically significant evidence of increases to the numbers of teachers or classrooms, which they attribute partly to corruption. One key limitation of their study is that they have only cross-sectional data on oil output.==== In contrast, we have detailed annual data on oil revenues per municipality, allowing us to use fixed effects to control for unobservable municipality characteristics and obtain precise within-municipality estimates of the effects of oil revenues on schooling provision. Accordingly, we find that oil revenues translate to higher levels of schools, teachers, and classrooms per capita, a finding that stands in contrast to the more pessimistic results of Caselli and Michaels (2013). Our work is instead more consistent with that of Gadenne (2017) and James (2017), who show that increases to tax revenues in Brazilian municipalities and high energy prices in energy-rich US states, respectively, can improve municipal education outcomes.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

We find no impacts on mental health.,"A large share of university students never obtain a degree, and those who do often take much longer than the program design would suggest.==== This issue in higher education is at risk of worsening with more students studying virtually since the literature has largely found online teaching to be less effective than classroom-based teaching (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017, Figlio et al., 2013). In the recent pandemic, many students struggled to study successfully due to the shift to online teaching (Aucejo et al., 2020, Bird et al., 2022, Kofoed et al., 2021). Students’ mental health may also be affected by a lack of interactions when studying online, as suggested by evidence of worse student mental health during the Covid pandemic (e.g., Browning et al., 2021, Giuntella et al., 2021, Lai et al., 2020, Logel et al., 2021, Son et al., 2020).==== Since three in ten Americans state that they would prefer an online-only learning option even in the absence of the Covid threat (Strada Education Network, 2020), it is important to understand how to improve online learning.====Personalized remote tutoring is a promising way to tackle central problems in (online) higher education and improve student outcomes. In-person tutoring interventions have been shown to be effective across differing settings and for a wide variety of students (de Ree et al., 2021, Fryer, 2017). The experimental literature on tutoring has so far primarily focused on PreK-12 interventions, finding increases in learning outcomes of around 0.37SD on average, a large effect in comparison to other education interventions (Nickow et al., 2020). This remarkable success of tutoring is in contrast to mentoring interventions that have at best shown small improvements in average student performance or improvements only for subgroups of students (e.g., Angrist et al., 2009, Oreopoulos and Petronijevic, 2019).====To date, little is known about whether tutoring is effective in higher education settings. This is why peer tutoring has not been labeled a high-impact practice by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (Kuh, 2008).==== However, tutoring is one element of highly successful student support programs such as the City University of New York’s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP, see Scrivener et al., 2015, Sommo et al., 2018, Weiss et al., 2019). Remote tutoring is also a large and growing market served by private sector firms. Market analysts estimated the global market size for online tutoring at around USD 150bn in 2020 and it is projected to reach about 280bn by 2026 (Valuates Reports, 2021).====In this paper, we report results of a randomized trial designed to test whether small-group remote peer tutoring affects student outcomes in (online) higher education. Our sample comprises second term students from the core undergraduate program at a large Germany university’s ====. Each fall, students can enroll in the three-year bachelor’s program ====. In each of the first two semesters, students are supposed to take six courses, each of them worth five credits. The second term includes more rigorous courses relative to the first semester. As a result, many students struggle in the second term.====Our program provided personalized remote tutoring in two economics courses. The program featured small groups of two or three students. These small groups met every week via ====, in alternating weeks with and without a more senior student tutor. In these meetings, students discussed problems in micro- and macroeconomics taken from problem sets and past exams that were available to all students. The student tutors were students from a more advanced term in the same study program. One implication is that similar programs could be introduced at modest cost elsewhere. In our setting, the additional cost for including one additional student into the program for a three-month period would be about €60.====Our results show that the remote tutoring intervention was highly effective in improving learning outcomes. First, relative to the control group, treated students are more likely to state that they studied throughout the term and report being more in contact with other students. Second, treated students earn 30% more credits and obtain a GPA across both tutoring subjects that is better relative to control group students by around one grade level. Studying the students’ performance in both tutoring courses’ written exams, we find that treated students perform about 30% of a standard deviation better than students in the control group. This is of comparable magnitude than the impacts of tutoring in K-12 education (Nickow et al., 2020). Third, the largest improvements in academic performance occur among students who previously did not perform well. As a result, the program reduced the inequality of academic outcomes among students. Fourth, because of the induced small-group peer interactions, we also hypothesized that the tutoring intervention would improve students’ mental health, especially in light of the pandemic setting. However, we find no impacts on any survey outcome related to mental health.====This paper contributes to several literature strands. First, we add to research on the effectiveness of online higher education. Most of this literature has found online teaching to be somewhat less effective than classroom-based teaching (Bettinger et al., 2017, Figlio et al., 2013). A driver of this lower effectiveness seems that students have problems of disorganization when taught online, a culprit that could be well addressed by personalized tutoring (e.g. Banerjee & Duflo, 2014).==== There is substantially less research on interventions aiming at improving student outcomes within an online environment.==== Our results show that remote tutoring in small groups substantially raises student outcomes in such an environment. In addition, online tutoring offers substantial cost savings over in-person tutoring. Besides savings on physical space on campuses, it does not require students or tutors to physically meet. This is likely to be especially important at non-elite institutions where many students live off campus and work besides their studies. Thus, remote tutoring may prove an effective and efficient way to personalize and improve online education.====Second, we also contribute to the experimental literature on tutoring interventions. Tutoring has been shown to be highly effective in PreK-12 education (de Ree et al., 2021, Fryer, 2017). In a recent review, Nickow et al. (2020) report that tutoring increases learning outcomes by around 0.37SD on average, a large effect in comparison to other education interventions. There is much less evidence on the effectiveness of tutoring in higher education, and the available evidence does not provide a clear picture of the effectiveness of such interventions (see, e.g., Gordanier et al., 2019, Munley et al., 2010, Paloyo et al., 2016, Parkinson, 2009, Pugatch and Wilson, 2018, Pugatch and Wilson, 2022). However, tutoring is an important part of CUNY’s ASAP program that seems highly effective (Scrivener et al., 2015, Sommo et al., 2018, Weiss et al., 2019). We contribute to this literature by providing the first estimates of the effect of a pure tutoring program on student outcomes. We show that remote small-group peer tutoring is similarly effective in higher than in PreK-12 education. We also find that online tutoring can generate large benefits for middle and low achieving students. This is relevant since many of low performing students who work besides their studies may be unlikely to attend in-person tutoring sessions on campus.====Finally, we contribute to emerging research on effective education policies during the Covid pandemic. Most papers in this literature have focused on primary or secondary education (e.g., Angrist et al., 2022, Bacher-Hicks et al., 2021, Grewenig et al., 2021). The paper closest to ours is Carlana and La Ferrara (2021), who experimentally assigned Italian middle school students an online tutor during the pandemic and report positive effects on performance and well-being. The magnitude of their results is comparable to the magnitude we find in the subjects covered by the program. There is only little research on higher education interventions during the pandemic, despite worse student outcomes in higher education (Altindag et al., 2021, Bird et al., 2022, Kofoed et al., 2021, Rodriguez-Planas, 2022a, Rodriguez-Planas, 2022b). In an earlier paper, we show that mentoring focused on student self-organization improves student motivation, but only raises student achievement among already well-performing students (Hardt et al., 2022). We thus contribute by studying the effectiveness of remote tutoring in (online) higher education during the pandemic. While the pandemic is a special situation for many students (Jaeger et al., 2021), we are convinced that the sizable, plausible, and comparable effects of our intervention carry lessons for improving higher education after universities have fully returned to their (new) normal way of teaching that may include online-only or hybrid delivery options.",Tutoring in (online) higher education: Experimental evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722001236,20 December 2022,2022,Research Article,32.0

We exploit a unique feature of the admissions system at a large university in Singapore, the National University of Singapore, that has two admission tracks – a regular admission track where admission is based exclusively on ","Selective colleges and universities with capacity constraints face a choice problem. They need to decide which students to admit, among those who apply. Conceptually, one can think of each student as possessing two broad types of attributes – academic skills and non-academic skills. Selective colleges with the aim of admitting students meritoriously would presumably like to admit those who are strong on both measures. However, they face a trade-off, since there may be some students who are strong in terms of academic ability but somewhat weaker in terms of non-academic ability. Conversely, there may be students who are strong in terms of non-academic ability but somewhat weaker in terms of academic ability. Colleges must therefore weigh these qualities in deciding which students to admit. A college's preference manifests in its selection criteria.====Colleges are confronted with a question of how best to select students. Two common selection modes have emerged. Some colleges select students exclusively on the basis of academic performance, whereas other colleges use a combination of academic performance and demonstrated non-academic ability. In the former case, no weight is given to non-academic skills; instead, the focus is solely on whether an applicant is well prepared academically to attend college. In the latter case, non-academic qualities are given some weight. These non-academic considerations may include, for instance, whether a student possesses certain special skills or talents, whether she has an outstanding record of extracurricular activities, or whether she can demonstrate having interests aligned with a specific choice of study. The weight given to non-academic qualities and the precise non-academic qualities considered for admission varies widely across colleges.====Globally, most higher education systems rely primarily on measured academic achievement and/or general cognitive ability to admit students (Edwards et al., 2012; Freeman, 2015; Helms, 2008). In these systems, selection is typically based on students’ performance on some academic assessment (often in the form of standardized assessments such as secondary school leaving examinations, university entrance examinations, and aptitude tests). Often, these assessments are administered nationally or regionally and coordinated by a government agency, though many may also be institution-based. Notable systems which rely heavily on performance on standardized academic assessments for undergraduate selection include universities in China (====), France (====), Australia (====), Japan (====) and South Korea (====). Admissions with consideration partly given to non-academic qualities appear to be less prevalent globally and practiced commonly only in a few countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada (Edwards et al., 2012; Freeman, 2015; Helms, 2008). In the United States, for instance, where individual colleges possess relatively high levels of autonomy over their own admissions policies, many colleges select their undergraduates based on a wide array of application materials – from teacher recommendation letters to extracurricular activities, personal statements, and essays, apart from academic performance (such as high school grade point averages / rank and performance on standardized tests such as the ACT or SAT), arguing that these serve to make admissions more “holistic” (Rosinger et al., 2021); of course, this is far from universal and not all colleges in the United States practice such “holistic admissions”. Those that do tend to be more selective and well-resourced (Gentsch, 2016; Helms, 2008).====There are arguments both for and against “holistic admissions” (relative to academic- only based admissions). Holistic admissions may allow for a more diverse student body but are costlier to implement since colleges need to expend time, effort, and financial resources to understand and evaluate individual application portfolios and their merits before they can select applicants. Selection is more subjective and easier to game since whether one type of non-academic ability (say ability in sport) is preferred to another (like ability in music) depends on the subjective preferences of the selection panel and their interpretation of the information provided. In contrast, academic-merit-only based admissions focus only on a single dimension of student ability, but the admission standard is easier to measure and more transparent. Whether a college chooses to employ “holistic” or “academic-only based” admissions depend on what the institution's goals==== are and whether it has the ability to be selective.====These differences in selection methods raise a natural question: Does the type of selection method matter? More specifically, does selecting based on a broader array of applicant attributes, beyond just academic achievement, allow colleges to better pick up individuals who will be more successful in the labor market?====There is now increasing evidence that noncognitive skills are just as important as cognitive skills for worker productivity, and therefore, for how individuals perform in the labor market (Almlund et al., 2011; Cubel et al., 2016; Heckman & Rubinstein 2001; Heckman et al., 2006; Lindqvist & Vestman, 2011; Weinberger, 2014). It is therefore natural to ask whether admission criteria that consider broader non-academic qualifications would be more successful at picking up individuals with skills that are valued in the labor market. Despite the importance of such questions for the choice of admissions policies and for education policy in general, they remain understudied.====Existing studies on college admissions criteria have focused on evaluating the impact of affirmative action practices on the composition of the entering class (Blume & Long, 2014; Hinrichs, 2012), student outcomes (Alon & Malamud, 2014; Cortes, 2010), and student behavior (Grau, 2018), the impact of early decision programs on the composition of the entering class (Antecol & Smith, 2012), likelihood of being admitted (Avery & Levin, 2010), and college performance (Jensen & Wu, 2010), the role of admissions guarantees in influencing academic fit (academic “undermatching” or “overmatching”) (Black et al., 2015; Cortes & Lincove, 2018) and the composition of applicants and enrollees (Long & Tienda, 2010; Niu & Tienda, 2010), as well as the impact of gaining or losing access to a selective college induced by changes in admissions rules on students’ graduation and subsequent labor market outcomes (Black et al., ). Only a handful of studies have attempted to evaluate the impact of holistic college admissions practices. Much of the work concerning holistic admissions tries to understand how admissions officers make admissions decisions, conditional on colleges adopting holistic admissions policies (Bastedo et al., 2018; Hossler et al., 2019; Rosinger et al., 2021). Rosinger et al. (2021) find that instead of boosting admission and enrollment among racial-minority and economically disadvantaged students, holistic admissions practices may in some cases serve to decrease access to these students instead. A series of experimental studies shows that the way admissions officers contextualize information has implications for the type of student being admitted. For instance, Bastedo and Bowman (2017) find that providing detailed information on high school contexts increases the likelihood that admissions officers recommend admitting low socioeconomic status applicants. Similarly, Bastedo et al. (2018) find that when provided with high quality information on applicants’ high school contexts, admissions officers that espoused a definition of holistic admissions emphasizing educational and family contexts were more likely to admit a low-income applicant. It is worth noting that these experimental studies are aimed at evaluating whether information provided to admission officers and the way that admission officers interpret the concept of holistic review affects their choice of students to admit (conditional on colleges adopting holistic admissions), not at understanding whether the types of students being admitted differ based on college admission criteria.====A few studies have tried to compare the college performance of students admitted based on holistic considerations with those admitted based on academic achievement. But these have been done narrowly in the context of medical school (Grabowski, 2018; Urlings-Strop et al., 2013) and engineering program admissions (Hilliger et al., 2018), and are typically based on simple comparisons between students admitted through different regimes. Still, these studies have found that the use of holistic review to determine admissions is associated with greater diversity in student composition as measured by gender and socioeconomic status (Grabowski, 2018). Also, they find that students admitted based on holistic review perform either just as well or better in college (Hilliger et al., 2018; Urlings-Strop et al., 2013).====To our knowledge, no study has yet tried to understand whether the use of holistic admissions practices (as opposed to admissions based solely on academic achievement) allows colleges to admit different types of students and whether students selected on the basis of holistic review subsequently perform differently in college and in the labor market compared to peers of similar incoming academic achievements selected on the basis of academic achievement. In this paper, we exploit a unique feature of the admissions system of the National University of Singapore (NUS) – Singapore's largest public university – to provide some answers to the question of how students admitted to the same university under two different admissions schemes – one that focuses only on academic achievement vs. one based on holistic considerations – fare in college and in the labor market.====Specifically, regular admission to NUS was based exclusively on the academic performance of students. However, starting in 2004, the university had also set aside a small share of places (up to 10 percent each year) for admission on the basis of a holistic set of aptitudes beyond academic achievement. Through this scheme, known as “Discretionary Admissions” (DA), applicants who did not meet the usual academic cutoff requirements for regular admission might nonetheless be able to gain admission, if they were able to demonstrate that they possessed certain traits or achievements, including “ability and interest, work experience, leadership, community service [or] exceptional talent, subject to a minimum level of academic competence”. In practice, the latter clause guaranteed that students admitted through the DA route were those who missed the academic threshold requirement narrowly for regular admission. The academic cutoff requirement was set prior to the start of the university's admission exercise each year and was determined based on the targeted intake for each program and the expected demand from students. Students were unaware of these admission cutoffs when they applied to NUS.====In order to evaluate whether selection based on non-academic achievements makes a difference in the types of students enrolled, we compare students admitted through the DA track – that is, students who narrowly miss the academic cutoff requirement but who are able to demonstrate that they possess certain non-academic skills or talents – to students admitted through regular admission. In many cases, we pay special attention to students in the first decile of regular admission (based on incoming academic achievement), since these students are most comparable, in terms of incoming academic ability, to those admitted through DA. Comparing the outcomes of students admitted through DA to those narrowly admitted through regular admission provides one answer as to whether the types of students entering through a regime that selects based on both academic and non-academic achievements are different from those entering through a regime that selects exclusively based on academic ability within a single institution. In other words, the (causal) treatment effect that we seek to estimate is the extent and nature of selection on non-academic characteristics and skills induced by the admissions regime and how this selection matters for subsequent educational choices and labor market outcomes of students.====It is worth noting that while our setup does not allow us to examine how the selection of students varies if admissions had been entirely holistic versus if it had been entirely based on incoming academic achievement, it does provide insights as to how student composition would change if a college that has an existing policy of admitting students based exclusively on academic achievement were to expand the number of places available to allow students who would otherwise not have been admitted through the regular admissions process (based on incoming academic achievement) a chance to be considered based on a more holistic set of factors. Given that there may be a sizeable number of colleges with an interest to adopt such “holistic” admissions processes, we believe that the results from this study would be valuable.====We find that, while DA students enter with slightly lower academic achievement scores compared to students marginally admitted through regular admission (specifically, they enter with an admission score that is 2.7 points lower on average, or in terms of standard deviation units, with an admission score that is 0.47 of a standard deviation lower on average), they do better than expected eventually, faring similarly compared to those marginally admitted through regular admission in terms of university academic performance, and consistent with the DA process selecting students with more non-academic skills, DA students are more likely to be involved in certain optional academic and non-academic college activities. More interestingly, we find that DA students obtain substantially higher labor market earnings after graduation compared to students marginally admitted through regular admission. We are able to rule out that the results are driven by differences in family background or unobserved academic ability that may not be adequately captured by pre-university admission scores. In particular, DA students and students marginally admitted through regular admission are comparable in terms of parents’ education, housing type, and academic grades achieved in primary and secondary school, suggesting that the DA admission process is unlikely to be differentially selecting students on the basis of family background or unobserved academic ability. Therefore, the fact that DA students outperform students who were marginally admitted via regular admissions suggests that the non-academic skills that DA students are selected on are highly rewarded in the labor market.====Overall, our findings imply that because DA and regular admission students (at least regular admission students in the first decile of incoming academic achievement) exhibit similar levels of academic ability, admissions policies that consider not just academic performance but also other non-academic achievements, can allow colleges and schools to pick up students with certain non-academic skills who would subsequently be more successful in the labor market. While we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that differences in outcomes between DA students and students marginally admitted through regular admission could have partly arisen due to behavioral changes in DA students (it is conceivable that DA students may have altered their effort levels in response to being branded a “discretionary admit”), we believe that such behavioral responses are unlikely to be a primary driver of the observed differences. First, the track through which an applicant enters NUS is not observable to anyone else except the student, limiting to some extent the need to have to “prove one's worth.” Nevertheless, such desire could be internal to the student; however, we find that DA students, in fact, do as well academically in university as marginal students admitted through the regular route, suggesting that they are not simply making up for inferior academic performance with increased extra-curricular involvement. Finally, it is hard to imagine that such “branding effects” (that are not observable to others) would be so strong as to lead to the large and persistent differences in labor market outcomes seen between DA students and students marginally admitted through the regular process for up to 7 years after admission into NUS. Because any behavioral responses are likely to be more short-term in nature, we believe the observed differences are more likely to be reflecting differences in the types of students being picked up by the DA process.",Do college admissions criteria matter?

We investigate the effects of making these insights salient to students by sending out goal-setting prompts in a blended learning environment with bi-weekly quizzes. The randomized field experiment in a large mandatory economics course shows promising results: the treated students outperform the control group. They are 18.8% (0.20 SD) more likely to pass the exam and earn 6.7% (0.19 SD) more points on the exam. While we cannot causally disentangle the effects of goal-setting from the prompt sent, we observe that treated students use the online learning platform earlier in the semester and attempt more online exercises compared to the control group. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that higher ==== are associated with low performance at the beginning of the course.","Higher education can be tough. The OECD average dropout rate amounted to 33% in 2017 (OECD, 2019). University drop-out is often driven by poor performance (Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner, 2014) and associated with behavioral bias such as time-inconsistency and self-control issues (Lavecchia et al., 2016). Online higher education appears even more demanding and especially challenging for some student populations, most prominently, male students and low achievers (Figlio et al., 2013). Yet, with the recent pandemic accelerating technological change in the educational sphere, some form of online education is likely to remain in higher education. It is important to make it work to the benefit of students who struggle with higher and online education.====In this paper, we test whether a blended learning environment can make the benefits of task-based goal setting and distributed learning salient to students and improve their course performance. For this, we send specific information on this learning approach as well as reminders to a randomly selected group of students and investigate how their study effort and study timing on the online learning platform differs from the control group.====We build on two strands of literature. First, the behavioral economics of education.==== has seen a surge in experimental studies that have yielded mixed results. Studies on task-based goal-setting (Clark et al., 2020) and reminders (O’Connell & Lang, 2018) have proven to be effective in improving course-level performance, especially among male students likely to be more prone to low self-control. Yet, there are a few studies which tackle study time or test goal-setting in a broader setting that record null results. For instance, Dobronyi et al. (2019) and Oreopoulos et al. (2019) link goal-setting to academic and personal life in general. Himmler et al. (2019) send non-course specific reminders for staying on track, and Clark et al. (2020) and van Lent (2019) ask for grade-based goals for a course. Based on these results, we expect that prompting students to set task-based goals in a blended learning environment of a single course should improve student performance, especially for male students.====Second, we use insights from the psychological literature on effective study strategies and make these insights salient to students using the blended learning environment. This provides guidance to students at a scale that is not fathomable in traditional classroom settings. First, while “cramming” may be effective for academic performance, it has proven less effective for long-term retention of material than spaced learning (Carpenter et al., 2012, Kerdijk et al., 2015, Küpper-Tetzel, 2014). Second, self-testing is deemed a very effective learning strategy by psychologists, but students may need guidance to implement it (Tullis et al., 2013). In our blended learning environment, we combine prompts to task-based goals with bi-weekly quizzes. Hence, we use educational technology to communicate these insights to students in an action-driven way.==== We expect the combination of prompts and bi-weekly quizzes to shift student learning over a longer period of time and funnel student efforts into active learning and testing practices, i.e. attempting more exercises on the online learning platform.====We ran a randomized controlled trial in the field, specifically a large introductory economics class with a diverse student body. For several years, the class had already multiple blended learning elements and incentives for starting to study early in the semester. Most importantly, students have access to JACK, a computer-assisted online learning platform that provides a range of online exercises, including parameterized methodological exercises. They assist students in overcoming deficits in mathematical skills, grasping, and applying the course material. Furthermore, bi-weekly extra-credit online quizzes provide an incentive for all students to start early with studying for the course. Yet, in past years students have tended to use JACK only sporadically during the semester and bunch their studying just before the quizzes and exam. Therefore, our experiment was intended to tackle potential behavioral biases, make students more aware of the benefits of the online platform, and ultimately improve their self-regulated learning (Tullis et al., 2013, Tullis and Maddox, 2012). For this purpose, we randomly assigned students to a treatment and control group after the first quiz. The treated students were encouraged to set a goal on how many online exercises they planned to complete in preparation for the next bi-weekly extra-credit quizzes. We analyzed the timing as well as the total amount of individual usage of JACK exercises for both the control and treatment groups, and compared it to the level of success in the final exam. At the end of the semester we elicited a range of demographic and personality indicators such as high-school level grade point average, parental education background, self-control (using the Tangney et al., 2004 scale), and patience. These all help us to decipher heterogeneous treatment effects.====The intervention increased the usage of JACK, the computer-assisted online learning platform, among the treated group, and improved their exam performance. We observe that treated students are 0.19 standard deviations more likely to take the early exam==== than the control group, they earn 0.19 standard deviations more net points, and achieve better grades (0.16 standard deviations). The results for the intermediary outcomes, i.e. engagement with the online learning platform, corroborate the positive course-performance findings. The treated students complete 0.2 standard deviations more sessions and more unique exercises on JACK. In addition, the relatively large effect sizes suggest that such interventions may be particularly well-suited for diverse student groups.====The results offer several reasons why the intervention worked. First, there was some revealed take-up of goal-setting among the treated. 22% of students in the treatment group set a goal at least once on the interface provided to the treatment group. Second and more pervasively, students beyond the goal-setting group responded to the prompt itself with changes in study behavior. We observe that treated students engage with the online platform earlier in the semester and attempt more exercises. While we cannot disentangle the effects of goal-setting from the prompt sent, this suggests that the main effect may be coming from the prompt itself not the actual goal-setting.====Using causal forests, we reveal heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates (Wager & Athey, 2018). While nearly all treated students benefit from the intervention by earning more net points in the final exam, we show that larger positive effects are found for student populations who the literature has identified to be at risk of falling behind in online education, especially low achievers. The results suggest male students benefiting more from the treatment than female students; yet, the difference is not as pronounced as (Clark et al., 2020) observe in their study. Moreover, while indicators of self-control, patience, and prior achievement are significantly associated with effect heterogeneity, we find that measures capturing pre-determined online learning behavior explain more of the treatment effect heterogeneity. This suggests that early-course behavior can be used to target interventions.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the experimental design. Section 3 presents and discusses the main results, effects on study timing and usage of the online learning platform as well as goal-setting on the online platform. Section 4 quantifies effect heterogeneity using causal forests, and considers what factors determine this heterogeneity.

These losses can be mitigated by returning to school, yet the extent to which such workers enroll in post-secondary education in response to displacement is poorly understood. Using employer-employee-student matched administrative data from Ohio, we provide the first direct evidence of workers’ enrollment responses following mass layoffs in the United States. We estimate that for every 100 displaced workers, only 1 is ever induced to enroll in a public college. This effect is concentrated almost entirely among displaced manufacturing workers, who enroll at a rate of 2.5 per 100. Workers with relatively low earnings at their layoff firms are the most likely to enroll in public institutions.","Highly-tenured workers who lose their jobs in mass layoffs suffer large and persistent earnings losses many years after their initial separations. This “scarring effect” curtails earnings by 15 to 20% even two decades after displacement (Davis & Von Wachter, 2011). Community college credentials and retraining programs that specifically target displaced workers can ameliorate these losses, even for older workers and those in particularly distressed industries and regions (Hyman, 2018; Jacobson et al., 2005a,2005b). In the absence of other constraints, job displacement decreases the opportunity cost of postsecondary enrollment and such workers might seek to reduce the risk of future displacement by upskilling when faced with grim economic prospects.====College enrollments and major choices have been shown to be responsive to labor market conditions in general, in line with predictions from economic theory that students will invest more in education when the expected returns are greater and when opportunity costs are lower (Blom et al., 2021; Charles et al., 2019; Ersoy, 2020; Liu et al., 2019).==== Prior work has also established that community college enrollment specifically rises when the labor market is weak (Barrow & Davis, 2012; Betts & McFarland, 1995; Foote & Grosz, 2019; Hillman & Orians, 2013). But surprisingly few studies have attempted to directly estimate the causal effect of job displacement on postsecondary enrollment among those workers who are actually displaced, as broader enrollment patterns are not necessarily informative regarding the effects on displaced workers themselves. In prior work, the enrollment induced by poor labor markets may come primarily from individuals besides those who lost their job: workers who voluntarily leave their jobs to return to school, recent high school graduates who opt to pursue college instead of entering a weak labor market, and those whose college choices are indirectly affected via the financial situations of their parents.====One paper which directly examines job displacement and subsequent postsecondary enrollment is Frenette et al., and Wright (2011). The authors use the Canadian Longitudinal Worker File to compare enrollment for workers displaced in 2003 versus similar workers who were not displaced. They find that job displacement for Canadian workers age 25-44 increases postsecondary enrollment by 0.6 to 1.3 percentage points over the subsequent four years, from a baseline enrollment rate of about 10% among a non-displaced comparison group.====It is not clear whether the findings of Frenette et al. (2011) would translate to an American setting, given the differences in UI policies, educational options, and safety net programs (Card & Oreopoulos, 2019; Card & Riddell, 1993; Jones & Riddell, 2019). For example, Barr and Turner (2015, 2018) find that specific UI policy factors influence the enrollment response of unemployed workers in the United States==== – among them, UI benefit duration, the ease with which UI recipients can claim benefits while enrolled, and whether agencies are proactive about informing unemployed workers of available financial aid. Further, the relative “push” of weaker labor markets and “pull” of more generous disability insurance (DI) in the U.S. compared to Canada may induce some American workers who would have otherwise sought retraining to instead take up DI (Milligan & Schirle, 2019). To illustrate this point, in U.S. regions that were highly exposed to Chinese import competition in the 1990s and 2000s, the per capita increase in Social Security DI payments was more than thirty times that of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), the federal program which incentivizes retraining for workers displaced by foreign trade (Autor et al., 2013). For these and other reasons, it is not obvious whether Frenette et al. (2011) findings would generalize to an American setting. Our paper provides the first direct evidence using micro-level data of the effect of job displacement on college enrollment in the United States.====Using employer-employee-student matched administrative data from Ohio, we identify workers who lose their job in a mass layoff between 2002 and 2009 and find 9% enroll in public two- or four-year colleges after displacement. The typical enrollment spell persists for five semesters, and 29% of these displaced workers attain a degree after being laid off. However, much of this enrollment may have occurred regardless of an individual's career disruption. Using a dynamic two-way fixed effects approach similar to Jacobson et al. (1993), we estimate the causal effect of job displacement on postsecondary enrollment. Our preferred model includes linear worker-specific time trends in addition to worker fixed effects, and all specifications include a comparison group of non-displaced workers. We find that the enrollment response to job displacement of roughly 1%: for every 100 displaced workers, only 1 is ever induced to enroll in a public college within four years of layoff. Nearly all of this “enrollment effect” occurs within the first year of displacement.====On one hand, this estimated effect is small relative to the number of displaced workers who are non-employed following layoff. Using the same administrative records, Moore and Scott-Clayton (2019) document that 10% of workers are consequentially non-employed in the years following a mass layoff, implying that the vast majority of even those workers without jobs after displacement are not induced to enroll in college. On the other hand, baseline enrollment rates among stably-employed workers is quite low (upper bound of 17%, see Table 1), and therefore among those with a low likelihood of enrolling, our effects translate to a larger relative enrollment boost that should not be understated.====Our identifying assumption is that displacement, as proxied by separation during the quarter of a mass layoff, is orthogonal to unobserved, non-linear trends in employment or human capital. If a worker receives a positive or negative shock that affects both postsecondary enrollment decisions and displacement, our approach will incorrectly attribute any change in enrollment trajectories to the effect of displacement. While it is not possible to rule out every possible alternative explanation, we find that our results are robust to a range of sensitivity checks, including models that exclude the individual-specific trends, models that utilize alternative measures of enrollment, and models examining effects for shutdowns versus mass layoffs separately.====After presenting our main results, we then explore how these enrollment effects differ by industry of displacement. We show this effect is almost entirely concentrated in the manufacturing sector, which comprises just 29% of our displaced sample. Within a year of displacement, more than 2 workers per every 100 laid off from manufacturing firms enrolled in college. After three years, this effect grew to 2.5 workers. Our sample (laid off between 2002 and 2008) spans the period when U.S. manufacturing employment's decades-long decline fell at its fastest rate (Pierce & Schott, 2016). Thus, the relative value of switching industries may be particularly high for these workers, potentially driving these results.====We then restrict our sample to manufacturing employees to explore whether heterogeneity in these effects follows the patterns we would predict based upon economic theory. First, we present evidence that a worker's likelihood of enrollment depends strongly on her income prior to layoff, specifically relative to coworkers. Because lower earners (within a firm) are typically younger and have less educational attainment, one would predict these workers may be differentially more likely to pursue schooling after displacement.==== Although we document that even the highest-paid displaced manufacturing employees are drawn to college after layoff, middle- and low-earners are more likely to seek retraining. For instance, three years after layoff, the displaced from the bottom-tercile of firm earnings distribution are more than three times as likely to enroll in college than those laid off from the top tercile.====Next, we examine whether a displaced workers’ geographic proximity to Ohio institutions of higher education relates positively with likelihood of enrollment, consistent with economic theory (lower economic cost of enrollment for workers nearby) and past empirical evidence (Card, 1993). We find that proximity to a higher concentration of public colleges doesn't predict increased public enrollment. In the appendix, we document that enrollment in public institutions are depressed in local labor markets with a higher concentration of for-profit schools. Our study complements previous evidence that public and for-profit schools are substitutes (Cellini, 2009; Cellini et al., 2020; Laband & Lentz, 2004).====We find that other dimensions of heterogeneity do not predict a displaced worker's likelihood of college enrollment. For example, despite the fact that those laid off in the third calendar quarter (July to September) may be better-positioned to swiftly transition to college in the autumn semester compared to those displaced in the fourth quarter, we conclude that the season of one's layoff does not explain variation in subsequent enrollment. Similarly, while firm size or whether the firm closes permanently (as opposed to simply shedding workers) could theoretically influence workers’ post-layoff educational decisions, we detect no empirical relationship. Our heterogeneity analysis lends credibility to our causal interpretation of the effects of job loss on enrollment. To the extent that our baseline estimates were driven by selection bias rather than a causal mechanism, we would not necessarily expect our estimation to yield these patterns of heterogeneity. Further work is needed to determine how many displaced workers retrain at private, for-profit, or non-college institutions and whether the postsecondary training programs effectively match displaced workers with new jobs. We proceed by summarizing related literature in section 2 and describing the data in section 3. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy. Section 5 reviews our findings, and section 6 discusses and concludes.",The effect of job displacement on public college enrollment: Evidence from Ohio,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722001005,6 December 2022,2022,Research Article,35.0

Gender gaps in these skills emerge between grades 4 and 6 and persist.","Over the past 17 years, the non-profit Pratham has conducted annual assessments of children’s language and math skills across rural India (Banerji, 2015). These Annual Status of Education Reports (ASER) have played a pivotal role in shaping domestic and global education-policy debates, given that one in five school-age children lives in India (World Bank, 2019).====In math, the ASER assessments—which focus on number recognition, subtraction, and division—have documented four very important patterns. First, many children start primary school without recognizing numbers: 36% of children in grade 1 cannot recognize single-digit numbers (ASER, 2018). Second, most children graduate from primary school without performing basic arithmetic: 48% of students in fifth grade (i.e., the last year of primary school) cannot solve two subtractions of a two-digit number by another or a division of a three-digit number by a one-digit number (ASER, 2018). Third, these two facts have changed relatively little over the past decade: in 2005, the share of first graders who could not recognize numbers was 58% and the share of fifth graders who could not solve arithmetic operations was 27% (ASER, 2006). Fourth, math skills vary widely across India. For example, while nearly 51% of fifth-graders in Haryana can do division, less than 18% of those in Assam can (ASER, 2018).====The focus of these assessments on number recognition and arithmetic has had several advantages. First, it rendered the assessments relatively simple to administer, enabling universities, teacher-training institutions, and other community organizations to do so, not only evaluating over a million children annually, but also building local assessment capacity (ASER, 2014). Second, it raised public awareness of the abysmally low learning levels in the country, generating consensus about what is now widely acknowledged as a “learning crisis” (Pritchett, 2013). Lastly, it made the ASER tests useful data-collection instruments for impact evaluations of education interventions, which have been key to identifying effective programs (e.g., Banerjee, Banerji, Duflo, Glennerster, & Khemani, 2010; Banerjee, Banerji, Duflo, & Walton, 2011; Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, & Linden, 2007; Duflo, Berry, Mukerji, & Shotland, 2015).====Yet, the focus on number recognition and arithmetic has arguably also detracted attention from other foundational skills, such as fractions and decimals, geometry, and measurement. The only other periodic representative assessment of children's math skills in India, the National Achievement Survey (NAS)—a survey of a sample of roughly two million students in grades 3, 5, 8 and 10 conducted by the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT)—includes domains such as measurement and geometry. Yet, the fact that the NAS results are consistently more sanguine than ASER and other domestic studies has raised questions about whether they offer accurate and reliable estimates of children's learning (see CABE, n.d., p. 58). Some cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have offered richer descriptions of the math skills of Indian children (see, e.g., Banerjee et al., 2022; Das & Zajonc, 2010; Muralidharan, Singh, & Ganimian, 2019; Muralidharan & Sundararaman, 2011; Singh, 2019), but their focus on specific cities and states does not allow for a national diagnostic of children's foundational math skills.====Evidence from developed countries suggests that fractions and decimals, geometry, and measurement matter for children's learning during school and beyond. Students who struggle with fractions have trouble making progress in math and related areas, and are likely to face difficulties as adults. It is crucial that they are not only exposed to basic geometric shapes, names, and concepts early in their schooling, but that they transition from concrete to abstract representations (National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008). The importance of these skills was recently recognized in India's new National Education Policy (MHRD, 2019).====In this paper, we try to address this gap by presenting detailed, representative, and previously unpublished learning outcomes data on 101,084 public-school students across 18 Indian states and one union territory. According to the 2011 Indian Census, the area covered by our data represents 861.2 million individuals (MHA, 2012)—or 12% of the world's population. These data were collected as part of the Student Learning Study (SLS), conducted by Educational Initiatives, a leading assessment firm in India, in collaboration with state governments in 2009. They cover three grades spanning elementary and middle school (grades 4, 6, and 8) and include not only the arithmetic skills reported by ASER (number recognition and arithmetic), but also three other skills on which—to our knowledge—there has been no prior reporting at the national level in India (fractions and decimals, measurement, and geometry).====We take advantage of the fact that students across grades are assessed on the same skills to map their performance onto a common scale. The analytical approach we use, known as Cognitive Diagnostic Models (CDMs), allows us to compare the performance of fourth, sixth, and eighth graders side by side. Specifically, we express the performance of all students in terms of whether they have mastered the skills expected of a typical fourth grader.==== This comparison cannot be achieved by calculating the proportion of items assessing each skill that were answered correctly by students at each grade because each test contains a very small number of common items across grades for each skill.==== It cannot be achieved by using other analytical methods based on Item Response Theory (IRT) because there are few items overall for each skill.====We present three main findings. First, while we confirm that primary- and middle-school students perform poorly in the basic skills regularly assessed by ASER, they fare even worse on other foundational skills not captured by those tests: 52% of all students in our data have mastered number sense and arithmetic, but only 27% have mastered fractions and decimals, measurement, and geometry. Second, while student achievement in previously assessed skills improves across grades, the corresponding trajectory in the previously unassessed skills is flat: the percentage of students who have mastered number sense and arithmetic increases—from 43% in grade 4, to 50% in grade 6, to 61% in grade 8—whereas the share of students who have mastered the remaining three skills remains virtually unchanged—from 22% in grade 4, to 28% in grade 6, and 29% in grade 8. Third, girls perform below boys for these previously unassessed skills. The gap emerges between grades 4 and 6 and remains unchanged in grade 8. In grade 4, the percentage of boys and girls who have mastered these skills is equal (22%); by grade 6, 25% of girls and 31% of boys have done so, and this gap persists in grade 8.====This study makes three main contributions to existing evidence on the foundational math skills of Indian children. First, it offers one of the most geographically representative accounts to date of the performance of such children that goes beyond number recognition and arithmetic operations, showing that the learning crisis in India may go farther than previously shown—affecting fractions and decimals, geometry, and measurement more severely. Second, it builds on prior studies that track students’ achievement through the school system (see Muralidharan et al., 2019; Muralidharan & Zieleniak, 2014; Pritchett & Beatty, 2015), documenting that growth in these less frequently assessed skills may be even slower than in those assessed more regularly. Finally, to our knowledge, it is one of the few studies that disaggregate achievement in these skills by students’ sex, raising the urgency of addressing gender inequality in the country—particularly, given the importance of science, technology, engineering, and math skills in the Indian economy (World Bank, 2018).",The foundational math skills of Indian children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722001091,5 December 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

We exploit the quasi-random reassignment of students across schools in the Wake County Public School System to estimate the academic and behavioral effects of being reassigned to a different school and, separately, of shifts in peer characteristics. We rule out all but substantively small effects of transitioning to a different school as a result of reassignment on test scores, course grades and chronic ====. In contrast, increasing the achievement levels of students’ peers improves students’ math and ELA test scores but harms their ELA course grades. Test score benefits accrue primarily to students from higher-income families, though students with lower family income or lower prior performance still benefit. Our results suggest that student assignment policies that relocate students to avoid the over-concentration of lower-achieving students or those from lower-income families can accomplish equity goals (despite important caveats), although these reassignments may reduce achievement for students from higher-income backgrounds.","Recent scholarship and extensive associated media attention have shed light on growing rates of U.S. income and wealth inequality and declining rates of social mobility.==== Simultaneously, differences in academic achievement between children from high- and low-income families remain large (Hanushek et al., 2019, Hasim et al., 2020, Reardon, 2011).==== Policy makers regularly express interest in opportunities to reduce the strength of the relationship between students’ socio-demographic characteristics and their educational outcomes. One such strategy involves changing children’s within-school peer groups by reassigning students to attend school with peers of different socio-economic and academic skill backgrounds (e.g., Belsha and Darville, 2020, Strauss, 2017).====This strategy makes several assumptions about the ways in which students’ peer groups influence their academic outcomes and about the consequences of changing schools. First, such a strategy assumes that lower-family-income or low-performing students might learn more effectively if exposed to classmates with socio-economic or====academic-skill backgrounds different from their own. Second, this approach assumes that higher-family-income or higher-performing students either experience no harm from such school reassignments or that the harm is sufficiently minimal to justify the benefits to higher-need students. These first two assumptions implicitly argue that the structure by which peers influence each other is not identical among all students or, more formally, that the linear-in-means model of peer effects (Hoxby, 2000, Manski, 1993) does not hold. Third, such a strategy assumes that the potential benefits of changing the composition of one’s peer group by switching schools dominate any potentially disruptive effects of adjusting to a new school.====As a result, the implementation and comprehensive evaluation of student reassignment policies should be informed by the answers to two key questions: (1) what impact does changing schools have on students who are required to switch as a result of school reassignment; and (2) how do changes in peer composition that result from school reassignment policies affect students’ outcomes?====In this paper, we exploit a quasi-random selection of students who were reassigned to different schools to inform these two key questions. We rely on administrative data from the 2005–06 to 2011–12 school years in the Wake County Public School System (WCPSS). During these years, WCPSS regularly reassigned a small share of its overall student body to attend different schools. These moves served both to address over-crowding in a rapidly growing metropolitan area and to limit the concentration of lower-family-income and academically struggling students in any one school. The reassignment policy we consider relied on students’ family-income and prior achievement to promote socio-demographic integration; accordingly, these are the dimensions of peer effects on which we focus.====Our identification strategy leverages the fact that, conditional on observable characteristics used to inform the assignment process, groups of students were selected arguably at random to attend different schools. Our critical assumption, which we justify with policy details and empirical tests, is that selection for assignment is ==== ignorable. We employ instrumental variable approaches to estimate the effect of changing schools and, separately, the effect of shifts in peer composition driven by the district’s practice of reassigning some students. For school movers, selection for reassignment, conditional on a set of baseline characteristics, serves as an instrument for switching to a different school without changing residence. For those not selected for reassignment, the policy-assigned change in peer composition serves as an instrument for the change in peer composition actually experienced.====Our analysis of peer effects builds most directly on Hoxby & Weingarth’s (2005) study of the same (and the prior) school assignment policy in WCPSS. Our paper innovates beyond theirs in several important ways. First, as a result of our access to WCPSS administrative data associated with the school assignment process, we directly observe student-level school assignment and compliance with reassignment. Capitalizing on these data, we model selection for reassignment at the geographic level at which it occurred and address the endogenous bias resulting from students selectively complying with reassignment to different schools. To the best of our understanding, Hoxby and Weingarth did not have access to such student-level assignment data and, therefore, they assume a high level of compliance (see also Weingarth, 2005). In contrast, during the time period that we consider (one that does not overlap with their analytic window), almost one-half of students who are selected to switch schools do not comply. Second, relying on more recent insights from Angrist (2014), our approach to estimating peer effects relies only on the subset of students who experience exogenous changes in their peers’ characteristics with no other contemporaneous changes in their educational experience. More specifically, our estimates of peer effects rely only on those students who are ==== selected for reassignment in a given year. Third, we examine outcomes beyond standardized test performance, including course grades and attendance.====To preview our results, we observe no substantively meaningful effects on test scores, absenteeism or course grades for students who change schools as a result of being reassigned, on average. We estimate null effects, on average, on test-score and attendance outcomes with relatively precise zeros. Domina et al. (2021) examine the effects of being selected for reassignment in Wake County between 2000 and 2010 in an event study framework. Despite only partially overlapping analytic windows and different identification strategies, our estimates of the average effect of being reassigned to a different school are comparable to theirs. An important advantage of our research design is our ability to model the behavior and outcomes of those who actually switch schools as a result of reassignment, rather than the intent-to-treat estimates of Domina and co-authors. Further, our data provides us information unexplored in Domina et al. permitting us to consider variation in effects by students’ socio-demographic characteristics and prior achievement. We find suggestive evidence that switching schools due to reassignment negatively affects test-score outcomes for students with lower prior achievement.====Our central peer effects finding is that students’ academic skills, as measured by standardized test scores, improve from having higher-achieving peers. A one-tenth of a standard deviation increase in students’ peer-achievement level produces improvements in students’ own test scores of 0.05 ====s [95% CI: 0.01, 0.08] in math and 0.03 ====s [95% CI: 0.01, 0.04] in English Language Arts (ELA). However, such an increase in peer achievement decreases students’ course grades by 0.02 ==== units, potentially through a mechanism of relative-rank comparisons. Similar to Denning et al. (2018), though in contrast to Murphy and Weinhardt (2020), we observe this phenomenon in ELA but not mathematics courses.====Test score benefits derived from higher-achieving peers are largest for students who do not qualify for free- or reduced-price school meals (FRPL) and are greatest in math (but not ELA) for higher-achieving students. However, FRPL-qualifying students and students with lower baseline achievement nevertheless benefit from higher-achieving peers. Thus, our estimates reject both the strictly linear-in-means model of peer effects as well as the Single-Crossing model (e.g., Bénabou, 1996, Epple et al., 1993). In math, students throughout the performance distribution experience course grade benefits from higher-achieving peers, whereas weaker-performing students experience the bulk of the negative effects on their ELA course grades.====Our findings contribute in two important ways to the understanding of peer effects and policies on school integration. First, we add to the broad body of causal literature on the impacts of changing the characteristics of one’s peers. We find that, on the whole, students learn more when their peers are higher achieving. On the other hand, students receive worse course grades in ELA when they have higher-achieving peers, and these harms accrue primarily to low-achieving students. Our focus on changes in peers’ family-income and prior-achievement levels underscores the policy-relevance of our study compared to others that emphasize changes in peer ethnoracial composition because, in the current legal climate, the use of students’ race in K-12 student assignment policy is largely curtailed (see ====, 2007). Second, we find minimal evidence of negative effects from mandated school reassignment, on average, across multiple outcomes; however we do find suggestive evidence of negative effects of switching schools due to reassignment for low-achieving students.====Although understanding the consequences of school reassignment for movers and for stayers are critically intertwined research aims, their analytic approaches and associated assumptions are distinct. As a result, we structure our paper in an atypical manner. In Section 2, we motivate our study in the research literature and local policy context. We provide details of our data in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, we address the effects of the school assignment policy for those who are selected for reassignment and move to a different school as a result. Within this section, we provide details of our analytic strategy, test its assumptions and provide results. Next, in Section 5, we address the effects of the school assignment policy for those who are not selected to move but who may nevertheless have been affected through changes in their peers’ demographic characteristics. We introduce a separate analytic approach, test its distinct assumptions and share our results. Finally, in Section 6, we integrate our results and conclude.",New schools and new classmates: The disruption and peer group effects of school reassignment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000899,23 November 2022,2022,Research Article,37.0

Using administrative data from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and conditional exogeneous assignment of employees to workplace, I provide empirical evidence that coworkers’ education investment behavior increases the likelihood of using Employer-Provided Educational Assistance (EPEA) benefits to start and eventually complete a graduate degree. I find a 10 percentage point (p.p.) increase in the proportion of peers using Tuition Assistance (TA) increases the probability of starting a master’s degree by 4.99 p.p. Additionally, a 10 p.p. increase in the proportion of coworkers that have finished an advanced degree increases completion rates by 2.71 p.p. within eight years in the organization.","Firms are increasingly advertising tuition assistance programs for incoming employees (Dickler, 2021) in which an estimated $1.3 billion is spent each year on tax exempt postsecondary education benefits (The Joint Committee on Taxation, 2019). Employers can offer up to $5,250 in annual tax-free educational assistance to employees, commonly referred to as Employer-Provided Educational Assistance (EPEA), that can be used for both undergraduate and graduate coursework (Internal Revenue Service, 2021). Firms may offer these benefits either to attract more productive workers (Rosen, 1987) or enhance existing employees’ general human capital (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1998). Alternatively, Cappelli (2004) and Manchester, 2008, Manchester, 2012 argue that tuition reimbursement programs exist primarily to reduce costly turnover of higher quality employees who will stay long enough to exercise the benefit.====Regardless of the reasoning for offering EPEA benefits, the impact of peers in the workplace on both take up of tuition assistance programs and completion of an advanced degrees is an important and understudied research topic. Echoing the findings of the Coleman (1968) report, Bursztyn and Jensen (2015) provide evidence that peer pressure is a powerful motivator for young adults in both scholastic effort and investment. Additional studies have confirmed that social spillovers influence individual schooling decisions, yet the literature primarily focuses on student effort in secondary school preparing for college (Abramitzky et al., 2021, Ballis, 2021, Barrios-Fernandez, 2022) and choices on field of study (Altmejd et al., 2021, Dahl et al., 2020, Joensen and Nielsen, 2018). Moreover, there is little empirical work on master’s degree completion, a rapidly growing area of education attainment and potential contributor to wage inequality growth (Autor, Goldin, & Katz, 2020).==== Outside of the classroom, there is a second arm of the peer effects literature that focuses on the workplace. These studies highlight the role of social spillovers on employee productivity (Bandiera et al., 2010, Brune et al., 2020, Mas and Moretti, 2009, Park, 2019) and takeup of public benefits (Dahl et al., 2014, Welteke and Wrohlich, 2019). However, there is no research about the intersection of workplace peer effects and advanced education attainment.====This paper fills the gap by addressing how coworkers’ education investment decisions affect the likelihood of starting and completing a graduate degree. I answer this question by studying a subset of newly trained U.S. Air Force (USAF) Officers from 2000–2020. There are several factors that make both the setting ideal for analyzing social spillovers. First, USAF Officers must possess at least a bachelor’s degree when they begin their career (SAFPA, 2021). This makes my analysis comparable to a growing number of organizations that require, or strongly desire, new employees to have completed a four-year degree (Fuller & Raman, 2017). Second, wage adjustments are not directly tied to holding an advanced degree. In certain public and private sector jobs, pay raises are linked to academic credentials which makes estimation of peer effects on education investment challenging due to confounding incentives. In this paper, I can separately estimate peer effects during a period of time when a master’s degree either enhances the probability of career promotion or has no effect at all. This feature provides a unique insight into how employers influence social spillovers in the workplace. Third, these U.S. government employees have access to subsidies for advanced education through Military Tuition Assistance (TA). This education benefit closely resembles EPEA in both available funding, $4,500 a year, and usage requirements.====The final advantage is initial employee placement to workplace is driven by the needs of the organization and is uncorrelated with individual characteristics. The quasi-random assignment of military service members has been leveraged previously to answer a wide range of policy relevant questions (Carrell and Zinman, 2014, Lleras-Muney, 2010). In this paper, the assignment system aids in estimating unbiased causal effects from social interactions. According to Manski (1993), identification of peer effects is challenging because self-selection and reflection confound estimates. This research setting does not suffer from these issues since new employees are exogeneously assigned to workplace peer groups.====For this analysis, I compile a novel dataset constructed from Department of Defense (DoD) quarterly administrative records from 2000–2020. I estimate a traditional linear-in-means model that exploits conditional exogenous assignment of new USAF fighter pilots and weapon systems officers to their first operational squadron, synonymous with workplace. I focus on two key outcomes: starting a master’s degree using TA and completing it. I leverage rich naturally occurring variation in the workplace using the education levels and TA utilization of coworkers. The peer effect estimates are derived from the lagged mean education decisions of coworkers upon a new individual’s arrival in the workplace. I find a 10 percentage point (p.p.) increase in the number of peers who have used TA increases the likelihood of starting a master’s degree by 4.99 p.p. However, this peer effect has a very small impact on the probability of completing a graduate degree.====The strongest effect on master’s degree attainment stems from coworkers who have already completed a graduate degree. I find a 10 p.p. increase in the proportion of coworkers that have completed an advanced degree leads to a 2.71 p.p. increase in the probability of obtaining a master’s degree by 8 years of total service. Interestingly, the fraction of coworkers with advanced degrees has a small, statistically insignificant, and negative influence on starting an advanced degree. Follow-on heterogeneity analysis shows that women are less likely to start or finish a graduate degree in response to the same peer effects.====Finally, I exploit a natural experiment to examine how incentives on the part of an employer influence the magnitude of social interactions. Within the USAF, career promotion boards between 2000–2004 and 2008–2014 utilized education history as an explicit signal for advancement. Starting in December 2014, all education information was permanently removed from early and mid-career promotion consideration (SAFPA, 2014). Initially, I find a 10 p.p. increase in peers having used TA causes a 4.99 p.p. increase in the likelihood of starting an advanced degree. When I estimate these effects separately based on the period an individual arrives, I find the coefficient decreases to 4.84 p.p. during the unmasked period (2000–2004, 2008–2014), and increases to only 5.21 p.p. during the masked period (2005–2007, 2015–2019). These results suggest that the policy change had only a marginal impact on social spillovers in education investment.====These findings are significant for the following reasons. First, the peer effects literature on education is expansive, yet few studies have explored how social interactions impact advanced schooling. Previous studies have shown peers can influence graduate education decisions in the university setting (Lépine & Estevan, 2021), but there has been limited research elsewhere. This is an important topic given the growing pool of eligible graduate students due to the rise in undergraduate completion rates (Denning, Eide, Mumford, Patterson, & Warnick, 2022). The lack of studies on this research area could be due to data limitations. For example, information on firm-specific provision of tuition reimbursement benefits has not been widely reported in the United States over the past 25 years.==== As a result, this analysis provides rare, and much needed, insight on the relationship between social interactions and advanced education attainment.====Second, my findings complement the literature of coworker influence on general human capital investment. Many prominent studies have shown early neighborhoods (Chetty, Hendren, & Katz, 2016) and peers (Abramitzky et al., 2021) have long lasting effects on future education outcomes. Beyond the period of childhood and adolescence, there is a rich literature that demonstrates how social interactions also affect individuals in the workplace. For example, there is strong evidence from (Jarosch, Oberfield, & Hansberg, 2021) that peers influence learning at work and subsequently increase total compensation of coworkers by as much as 9 percent. With respect to undergraduate education investment, previous research by Murphy (2017) found U.S. Army soldiers randomly assigned to units were 4.39 p.p. more likely to work on schooling in response to a 10 p.p. increase in peer continual education participation. To my knowledge, this paper provides the first empirical evidence that coworkers also shape graduate schooling decisions with magnitudes similar to previous studies on undergraduate education.====Lastly, my findings contribute to a growing literature on employer tuition reimbursement and its impact on education outcomes. EPEA benefits were originally set at $5,250 in 1986 and have experienced rapid growth in usage among U.S. workers. In 1992, over 431,000 employees used Section 127 benefits through their employer for postsecondary education. By 2012, this number nearly doubled to 850,000 people, or 20 percent of all U.S. graduate students, exercising tuition reimbursement programs (Association of American Universities, 2021).==== The growth in both EPEA benefit usage and cost of higher education motivated the proposed 2019 Upward Mobility Enhancement Act, H.R. 4849, which would raise Section 127’s cap from $5,250 to $11,500 (Fitzpayne, Pollack, Fife, & Greenberg, 2020).====Despite the rising popularity of these benefits, research in this area is relatively scant given its $1.3 billion yearly valuation. Previous studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between EPEA usage and postsecondary persistence, yet this analysis is limited to only workers attending community college (Tran & Smith, 2017). Additional studies have shown expanded access to Section 127 benefits for graduate students in 2001 reduced debt levels by $1530 on average. However, access to these benefits induced workers to attend more expensive graduate programs (Gilpin & Kofoed, 2020). This paper contributes to the literature by showing how access to TA and the percentage of peers who have used this benefit strongly influence starting a master’s degree. My findings also demonstrate that completion of a master’s degree is mostly affected by the percentage of peers who have also finished a graduate program.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional background and the data; Section 3 explains the methodology; Section 4 provides the results; Section 5 concludes.",Should I get a master’s degree?: Evaluating peer effects on education investment decisions in the workplace,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722001029,7 November 2022,2022,Research Article,41.0

To do so, we draw on panel data from the first two waves of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) and take advantage of exogenous variation in classroom gender composition brought by the random assignment of students to classes when they entered junior high school. Results from the value-added model show that having more female classmates helps to improve the physical health outcomes of junior high school students in China. Specifically, a one-percentage-point (pp) increase in the proportion of female classmates in Grade 7 explains a 0.003-0.004 pp increase in one's probability of staying normal BmiAZ or going from abnormal to normal BmiAZ, a 0.029-0.031 increase in the BmiAZ score of those with low starting BmiAZ, a 0.003 increase in one's HAZ score, and a 0.157-0.165% or 0.166-0.177% decrease in the diopter of one's left or right lens of glasses from Grade 7 to Grade 8, respectively. One possible mechanism underlying these relationships is that more female classmates bring healthier behaviors. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that the beneficial effects of having more female classmates on health outcomes are more prominent among boys, students with less-educated parents, and those attending rural schools or schools with bigger class sizes.","The latest statistics show that adolescents represent over 16 percent of the world's population, with almost 90 percent (or 1.11 hundred million) of them concentrating in low- and middle-income countries.==== Although significant progress has been made in improving adolescents’ health in developing countries in the 21==== century, the pace has been slowing down in recent years (UN IGME, 2020; Ward et al., 2021). As a critical and unique stage of human development, investments in adolescence can bring benefits today, for decades to come, and for the next generations (Patton et al., 2016). Hence, it is of particular importance for developing countries to explore possible measures to promote adolescent health.====How to promote adolescent health? There has been growing evidence highlighting the strong impacts of social environment factors at various levels on adolescents’ health. Specifically, at the national level, war and conflict (Klasen et al., 2010; Kohrt et al., 2010), national wealth (Torsheim et al., 2004), and income inequality (Due et al., 2009) are found to strongly affect adolescents’ health in various aspects. At the community level, exposure to pollution (Gauderman et al., 2004), educational pressure (Morgan et al., 2012), and poor public infrastructure (Boehmer et al., 2007) have been blamed for adverse effects on adolescents’ health. At the school level, adolescents’ health is found strongly affected by school sanitation facilities (Freeman et al., 2012), classroom peer environment (Alexander et al., 2001), and student-teacher relationships (Kim, 2021). At the family level, some studies suggest consistent inequalities in children's health are closely related to family socioeconomic status (Currie et al., 2008; Elgar et al., 2015; Reiss, 2013), family structure (Blum et al., 2000), parenting style (Rhee et al., 2006), as well as family norms and attitudes (Malcolm et al., 2013).====Among those social environment factors, peers begin to play increasingly important roles in children's physical health as they reach adolescence (Viner et al., 2012). Classmates represent one crucial group of peers with whom students interact the most over the school day. Especially in countries where students usually stay with the same classmates for all subjects in the same class throughout the academic year, China is a good case in point. Previous studies have shown certain groups of classroom peers can help reduce multiple health-risk behaviors and enhance one's physical health (Anteghini et al., 2001; Campbell et al., 2008; Viner et al., 2012).====Females are one of such groups. Compared with their male counterparts, females have been widely observed to be less antisocial, violent, aggressive, and less likely to engage in smoking, alcohol using and drug addiction (Bertrand and Pan, 2013; Cornwell et al., 2013; Duckworth and Seligman, 2006; Jacob, 2002; Kritsotakis et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014). Along this line, it seems that females may be more likely to help create a protective environment against a broad range of health-risk factors. Thus, an interesting question arises: is it beneficial to have more female classmates for one's physical health?====In this paper, we investigate whether having more female classmates positively affects junior high school students’ physical health. This paper relates to the gender peer effects literature. The identification of gender peer effects may face two empirical challenges, including endogenous sorting and contextual confounding (Epple and Romano, 2011; Manski, 1993). The present study addresses these challenges by applying a quasi-experimental approach. To do so, we draw on data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey of junior high school (Grades 7-9) students in China. The CEPS offers two helpful features that facilitate our identification strategy. First, over 40 percent of the CEPS project schools randomly assigned incoming students to different Grade 7 classes, which helps to eliminate the endogenous sorting in these schools. Second, the rich information in the CEPS data enables us to address contextual confounding by controlling for a large set of covariates at the student, parent, household, and class levels, as well as a full set of school fixed effects in the estimation.====There has been substantial evidence across cultures that adolescents benefit from having more female classmates in terms of academic performance (Gong et al., 2021; Hill, 2015; Hoxby, 2000; Hu, 2015; Lu and Anderson, 2015; Briole, 2021), cognitive skills (Black et al., 2013; Lavy and Schlosser, 2011), non-cognitive skills (Gong et al., 2021), and mental health (Guo et al., 2021). However, to the best of our knowledge, little is known about whether having more female classmates would benefit adolescents’ physical health. Hence, this study seeks to fill the knowledge gap by identifying the causal relationship between the proportion of female classmates and one's physical health in junior high schools in China. We believe understanding this causal relationship is particularly relevant for the optimal grouping of students in classrooms and schools in the broad context of mixed-gender education.====Our results show that being assigned to a class with more female classmates in Grade 7 has a statistically significant and positive effect on one's multiple physical health indicators in China. Specifically, a one-percentage-point (pp) increase in the proportion of female classmates in Grade 7 explains a 0.003-0.004 pp increase in one's probability of staying normal BmiAZ or going from abnormal to normal BmiAZ, a 0.029-0.031 increase in the BmiAZ score of those with low starting BmiAZ, a 0.003 increase in one's HAZ score, and a 0.157-0.165% or 0.166-0.177% decrease in the diopter of one's left or right lens of glasses from Grade 7 to Grade 8, respectively.====Our results also show that the mechanism underlying the observed gender peer effects works this way: more female classmates, more (less) likely to engage in healthy (unhealthy) behaviors. Specifically, a one pp increase in the proportion of female classmates in Grade 7 is associated with 0.973 minutes more on physical exercise per week, a 0.004 pp increase in one's probability of decreasing the amount of time spent on watching TV on both a weekday and a weekend day, as well as a 0.003 pp increase in one's probabilities of decreasing the amount of time spent on playing online games on a weekday. We further provide suggestive evidence that the observed positive gender peer effects on certain health measures (including the BmiAZ score for the subsample of BmiAZ<-2 in wave one, the HAZ score, as well as the diopters of left and right lens of glasses) were mainly driven by female classmates within homogeneous sub-groups (say, in terms of the ==== and left-behind status).====Finally, our results also reveal heterogeneity in the effects of having more female classmates. Specifically, the impacts of having more female peers on health outcomes are larger among boys, students with less-educated parents, and those attending rural schools or schools with bigger class sizes, which are consistent with the observed heterogeneous gender peer effects on health behaviors in this paper.====This study contributes to the literature in at least four ways. First, we add to a growing economic literature on the effects of external factors (including family, school, and other social environment factors) on adolescents’ physical health. Second, we extend the gender peer effects literature by explicitly considering physical health as an output of the human capital production process. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide quasi-experimental evidence on the impacts of having more female classmates on adolescents’ physical health. Third, beyond the gender peer effect analyses at the classroom level, we further extend it to the sub-classroom level by providing suggestive evidence that the observed effects were mainly driven by female peers within homogeneous sub-groups. Finally, we explore the potential working channels of gender peer effects, which helps improve our understanding of why classmates’ gender composition matters during adolescence.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II introduces the data, followed by an empirical framework in Section III. Section IV presents our empirical findings.

The evidence shows a decrease on standardized test scores, especially for male students (−0.072SD in Reading, −0.06SD in Math). Said effects are considerably greater in Reading when examining the migration of non-Spanish speakers (−0.099SD). When the shock is motivated by Venezuelan students, a decrease in Mathematics/Reading are observed in both male (−0.56SD/−0.067SD) and female students (−0.04SD/−0.035SD). Two hypotheses that may account for these effects are evaluated. First, a lack of human and financial resources to address these new educational demands. Second, native flight from public to private schools, especially involving higher SES or higher ====. Results indicate that only the first hypothesis may account for the possible underlying mechanisms.","Over the last decades, migration has become one of the most relevant topics worldwide. We have seen a heated debate on the human rights of immigrants, the economic consequences of immigration, and public policies related to immigrants and their relationships with natives. In this context, the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) plays a major role in the world’s migratory flows, as nearly 40 million migrants came from this region in 2017 (United Nations, 2017). Even though the favorite destination of LAC emigrants is North America, intra-regional migration emerges as the second preference, with 1 out of 6 migrants moving to a LAC country (Idem).====In this context, Chile has received one of the largest migrant flows over the last years. Between 2011 and 2018, migrant population increased nearly five-fold relative to the total population, jumping from 1.4% to 6.6%.==== Since 2015, migratory flows to Chile have been strongly determined by foreigners coming from Venezuela and Haiti. This migration was motivated by political and economic difficulties in their countries of origin. Nowadays, these groups constitute the first and third largest foreign communities in the country. As a result, Chile provides an interesting opportunity for empirically examining the consequences of a rapid mass migration phenomenon.====The empirical literature that has examined the effects of migration has typically focused on the labor market outcomes of native workers,==== but there also exists a growing literature focused on educational outcomes, specifically on the academic performance of native-born students. This literature has reported mixed results. For instance, Diette and Uwaifo Oyelere (2014) explore the peer effects of Limited English students on the Reading and Math grades of native-born school students, differentially by gender and race. Using 1998–2006 administrative data of 4th to 8th grade students from North Carolina and a school-by-year fixed effect approach, the authors find zero effect on native female students, both white and black. However, they also report a modest negative effect on males, particularly on black males’ scores in both subjects and on white males’ math scores. In a previous paper, using the same data and similar specifications, these authors had provided evidence of heterogeneous effects on native-born students (as reflected by their Math and Reading test scores). Positive effects are found in the bottom and middle parts of the performance distribution, while small negative effects are found at the top (Diette & Uwaifo Oyelere, 2012).====In another study, Conger (2015), using administrative records from the Florida Department of Education, evaluates the effects of different shares of immigrant English language learners (ELL) and non-English language learners (non-ELL)==== on four cohorts of 9th graders attending Florida public high schools between 2000 and 2004. Using fixed effects by school and cohort, results indicate that immigrant peers have no effect on their classmates’ academic achievement.====In contrast, Jensen and Rasmussen (2011), using matched administrative records and PISA results of 9th graders from Denmark in 2000, found a negative effect of immigrant concentration in schools on both Reading and Math. However, the authors acknowledge that these results are only robust with an IV approach for Math.====Bossavie (2018), in a longitudinal study in the Netherlands, examines the effect of migrant concentration on the academic performance of native-born students using a panel of primary schools observed in grade 2, 4, 6, and 8 every two years. To estimate this effect, the author considers the duration of stay of immigrant classmates, with cohort-by-cohort variation in immigrant concentration in schools having no significant effects overall, but a small negative one on Language scores for those who have spent less than 4 years in the country.====As for the literature on refugee migrants, Van Der Werf (2021) studies how the arrival of refugees from Indochina toward the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 affected the academic performance of native-born students in the USA. Using novel data from the U.S. National Archives that contain refugees’ first county of destination, the author finds a null effect or small positive effects that may have been due to the positive selection of refugees (more educated individuals) and government benefits.====Morales (2021), using more recent individual-level administrative data of students in grades 3 through 8 in a district in Georgia between 2008 and 2017, finds a positive effect of refugee concentration on the Mathematics scores of non-refugee students, while also finding evidence for non-linear on the English Language Arts (ELA) test. Despite these findings, the author also found that refugees have significantly lower test scores. Evidence shows that this may be due to changes in classroom resources and access to academic support programs.====Tumen (2021) analyzes the impact of the arrival of Syrian refugees on the PISA scores of native-born adolescents in Turkey. Using the IV-Diff-in-Diff specification, the author evaluates the magnitude of the job market mechanism whereby the arrival of migrants who occupy positions in the lower segment increases competition in the low-qualification sector and provides additional incentives for natives to improve their educational outcomes. This mechanism is found to have positive effects on native outcomes, while the educational experience mechanism is found to have negative effects as a result of the interaction between refugees and natives.====Figlio and Özek (2019), using administrative schooling and birth records, examine how Haitian refugees to Florida after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti influenced the educational outcomes of 3th to 10th grade incumbent students in public schools. Adopting different specifications to address the non-random sorting of refugees within the Florida school system, they found very modest positive effects on the academic performance of native students (particularly in Reading) the year of the earthquake and two years later.====In another study, Özek (2020), using student-level administrative data from a district in Florida, examines the effects of the arrival of internal migrants from Puerto Rico to schools after Hurricane Maria. The author finds significant adverse effects on student test scores, disciplinary problems, and student mobility, especially for high-skill natives. Evidence suggests that this may be a result of compensatory resource allocation within schools.====Finally, Padilla-Romo and Peluffo (2020) analyzes the effect of migration by focusing on the prior exposure of migrant peers to violence. Using individual-level administrative data from Mexico, they examine how incumbent students in relatively safe municipalities are affected by the arrival of migrant peers who were exposed to drug-related violence in their municipalities of origin. The authors found a negative effect on composite test scores (math and reading), more pronounced among girls and high-achieving students.====This study aims to identify the effect of recent mass migratory influxes on the academic performance of native-born Chilean students. To do so, we take advantage of the quasi-experimental situation generated by the migratory shocks from Venezuela, who speak Spanish which is the same language as the Chilean students, and Haiti, who do not speaks Spanish,==== between 2016 and 2018. Using census and longitudinal data from the SIMCE test==== provided by the Education Quality Agency and the General Student Information System, provided by the Ministry of Education’s, we applied a Difference-in-Difference strategy on the change in SIMCE scores between 4th and 6th grade. Native students whose schools received migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, or other non-Spanish-speaking countries in 2018, after having none in 2016, were the treatment group, while those who had no peers from these countries during this period were the control group. Both groups were highly balanced in terms of their observable characteristics using a nearest neighbor matching strategy with no replacement. In addition, we employed the same strategy to evaluate the effect separately, that is, when the shock affecting a school was due to Venezuelan students only or when it was exclusively produced by non-Spanish-Speaking students, largely driven by influxes of Haitian peers.==== Results indicate that the shock motivated by the arrival of migrant students between 2016 and 2018 caused a decrease on the SIMCE Reading/Math scores of male native-born students between 4th and 6th grade (−0.072SD/−0.06SD). This effect appears to be greater in Reading when the shock is due to influxes of migrants from non-Spanish-speaking countries (−0.099SD). In mathematics/reading, both male and female students exposed to the shock of Venezuelan migrants performed more poorly between 4th and 6th grade compared to the controls (−0.056SD/−0.067SD for boys, −0.04SD/−0.035SD for girls). Results suggest that there are insufficient human and financial resources to address these new educational demands in the region. Indeed, it can be observed that the student/teacher ratio increased due to the shock, which is consistent with the idea that limited resources are the mechanism behind the results obtained. The Chilean educational system allocates resources to schools according to student enrollment, but does not grant any additional resources to those that serve immigrant students.====Additionally, we evaluated whether there is evidence of native flight –of students from higher socioeconomic status backgrounds or better performing students prior to the shock– as a result of the foreign immigrant shock. This enabled us to determine whether the decrease on standardized test found for native students could be explained by a decrease in the peer effect that students with more resources –in terms of economic or academic skill– generate in the classroom. Results show some evidence for native flight==== as a response to the migratory shock, but is not motivated by those with higher socioeconomic status or higher academic performance.====The results are robust to a variety of specifications. In any case, they are not representative of the effect on the entire educational system and only refer to the effect on the 6th grade cohort in 2018. The foregoing, due to the fact that it is possible to control for the non-random sorting of immigrant students through of the different courses within the school only partially.====This study contributes to the literature on the peer effect of migrant students at the school-grade level on various educational outcomes. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to show evidence about immigrant peer effect in LAC. Second, by taking advantage of the quasi-experimental situation generated by the migratory influxes of recent years, we provide causal evidence of the short-term classroom effects of migrant student flows, considering that native-born students had no foreign classmates==== beforehand. Third, we provide an early examination of the mechanisms that may be influencing outcomes, such as greater restrictions on school resources due to the higher student/teacher ratio and the native flight of higher-SES or higher achieving native-born students. Lastly, the quality of the longitudinal and administrative census data in this study supports the accuracy of the results found.====After this introduction, Section 2 provides a brief description of the chilean school system and some statistics to contextualize the recent situation of migration within the Chilean educational system. Then, in Section 3, we explain the data and the strategy to be used to evaluate the effect of recent mass migratory inflows on the academic performance of native Chilean students, along with their possible underlying mechanisms.

In both data sets, we find that FIFS enter university with lower levels of cognitive skills than non-FIFS but with similar levels of non-cognitive skills. The only exception is that male FIFS report lower levels of Openness to Experience. FIFS at the elite institution have lower grade-point averages and are more likely to drop out after Year 1 than non-FIFS, a finding driven by females. The higher risk of dropout is not observed in the broader Australian tertiary education context, suggesting that female FIFS struggle at this elite university. Gaps in cognitive skills are the dominant channel through which FIFS experience achievement penalties, while non-cognitive skills play no role. However, very low levels of Conscientiousness exacerbate the achievement penalties due to social origin.","Higher education is arguably the single most important facilitator of social and economic mobility (Breen & Müller, 2020, Blanden, Gregg & Machin, 2005, Blanden, Gregg & Macmillan, 2007, Chetty et al., 2014, Haveman & Smeeding, 2006). However, children from disadvantaged homes find it harder to pursue higher education opportunities (Jerrim, Vignoles, & Finnie, 2015). In response, universities worldwide have begun to pay heightened attention to the educational barriers faced by disadvantaged students. Many have taken affirmative action to ensure equal access opportunities (Bonadies Torres, 2020).==== Definitions of disadvantage vary widely, ranging from general (residential location information) to specific (student is eligible for high school meals). Some institutions use information on whether an applicant is first-in-their family to attend university (so-called FIF students or FIFS) (see Adamecz-Völgyi, Henderson, & Shure, 2020 for an overview). FIFS status is of particular interest, because the fact that neither parent has university education means that the student lacks family capital in education and experience critical for navigating the tertiary education system.====Recently, Adamecz-Völgyi et al., 2020 validated this marker in the context of the British tertiary education system. They show that FIFS status is an important barrier to both university participation and graduation, over and above the influence of standard measures of disadvantage (e.g. parental income). FIFS are also less likely to study at elite institutions and more at risk of dropping out after the first year of studies (Henderson, Shure & Adamecz-Vöglyi, 2020). For female FIFS, these constraints also translate into lower wages (Adamecz-Völgyi, Henderson & Shure, 2022). To date, little is known about FIFS academic preparedness and academic performance outside Britain (see references above) and North America (Beattie, Laliberte & Oreopoulos, 2018; Pascarella, Pierson, Wolniak & Terenzini, 2004).====In this study, we present the first evidence on the university preparedness, academic performance and dropout propensities of FIFS attending an elite Australian university. We answer the following questions. First, are FIFS in Australia less well equipped for university studies in terms of their cognitive and non-cognitive skills than students whose parents have some university education? Second, do FIFS have lower grade point averages (GPA) at university and are they more likely to drop out? And third, do skills compensate for academic disadvantage due to social origin?====To answer these questions, we use data from both a bespoke survey which we collected on over 1000 incoming students in 2015 at a leading Australian university and the nationally representative Household, Income, and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. We linked our survey to administrative academic performance data over four semesters (2015–2016). In both HILDA and the student survey, we have comparable information on students’ skills and their parents’ education. We measure non-cognitive skills with three of the Big-Five personality traits (Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion), Locus of Control, and Grit, all of which have previously been shown to predict academic performance (see Section 2 for a justification). A novelty of our paper is that we also designed and collected so-called anchoring vignettes for a subset of non-cognitive skills which allow us to control for measurement error in non-cognitive skill assessment (Mõttus, Allik, Realo, Rossier, Zecca & Ah-Kion et al., 2012), Bolt, Lu & Kim, 2014; Primi, Zanon, Santos, De Fruyt & John, 2016).====We focus on non-cognitive skills, because the decision to attend university depends on more than financial and opportunity cost considerations (Page & Scott-Clayton 2016). It requires the right “mind-set”. Navigating university requires intellectual engagement, a sincere enjoyment of challenge, as well as “willingness to accept critical feedback and to adjust based on such feedback, [and] openness to possible failures from time to time” (Conley, 2003). Thus, non-cognitive skills are likely to be instrumental in facilitating access to and performance during university study. Previous studies have shown how non-cognitive skills shape the human capital accumulation process (Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman & Kautz, 2011; Beattie et al., 2018; Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman & Weel, 2008; Bowles, Gintis & Osborne, 2001; Lundberg, 2013). Some argue that they are at least as important as cognitive skills in determining life outcomes (Heckman, Stixrud & Urzua, 2006; Lindqvist & Vestman 2011, Bütikofer & Peri, 2021). Critically, strong socioeconomic inequalities in non-cognitive skills have been documented both in childhood (Attanasio, Blundell, Conti & Mason, 2020; Elkins & Schurer 2020; Heckman & Mosso 2014) and adulthood (Gensowski, Goertz & Schurer, 2021).====We find that FIFS in Australia are not disadvantaged in terms of their pre-university non-cognitive skills (except for lower levels of Openness to Experience by at least 0.2 standard deviations among males). However, they start university with significantly lower pre-university achievement test scores. This finding holds for both nationally representative data and for our specific university sample. Unsurprisingly, in our survey sample we observe that FIFS's GPAs at university are 0.3 standard deviations lower than those of non-FIFS. Controlling for observable characteristics, cognitive and non-cognitive skills and demographics factors reduces the FIFS gap to 0.18 standard deviations, but around 70% of the change in the coefficient estimate is due to differences in pre-university cognitive skills. Very little of the FIFS achievement gap is explained by non-cognitive skill gaps.====FIFS also experience higher dropout probabilities. They are 44% more likely than non-FIFS to drop out after Year 1, relative to the base probability of 13.6%. Only female FIFS experience a higher risk of dropout. This dropout rate for students at an elite institution differs from the dropout probabilities estimated for female FIFS in nationally representative data. Across all Australian tertiary institutions, female FIFS are not more likely to drop out after Year 1. Thus, female FIFS appear to struggle more at this elite institution than at other Australian universities.====Both pre-study cognitive and non-cognitive skills are strong predictors of subsequent academic performance at university for both FIFS and non-FIFS. Conscientiousness is a particularly beneficial skill. High levels of Conscientiousness help compensate for the performance penalty experienced by FIFS; low levels exacerbate it. Correcting for measurement error in Conscientiousness using the anchoring vignettes widens the FIFS performance penalty for low levels of Conscientiousness, while it narrows the FIFS performance premium for high levels, suggesting that FIFS’ self-reports of Conscientiousness are overstated at both the bottom and top of the distribution of Conscientiousness.====One limitation of our study is that some findings are based on a selective sample of university students that is not representative of the overall population, but representative for students at elite institutions. In our student-survey sample, compared to the broader tertiary student population, we have a slightly lower proportion of FIFS, a higher proportion of female students, and a lower proportion of international students or students from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, we have some confidence that our findings are not entirely sample specific, as we find similar FIFS gaps in pre-university cognitive skills and Openness to Experience (for males) in nationally representative data. We can therefore say that our findings on university preparedness of FIFS are representative for the whole Australian youth population, while our findings on FIFS gaps in academic performance and dropout are specific to university students in the context of elite university education.====Studying FIFS gaps in academic performance in the Australian education policy context is of great interest to an international dialogue on the environments necessary to expand university participation. In OECD countries, only 1 in 5 adults whose parents did not complete upper secondary education, complete tertiary education. In contrast, 2 in 3 adults whose parents were university educated, complete tertiary education (OECD 2018, based on PIAAC data). Even though Australia has prided itself on being a country of a ‘fair go’ (Bolton, 2003), we also observe remarkable inequities in higher education. Youth from family backgrounds without university education have significantly lower tertiary education participation rates than youth from households where at least one parent has a university degree. Fig. 1 reveals a striking socioeconomic gradient in university education using HILDA data for 2005–2018. Among youth who graduated from high school, those whose parents did not attend university are around 20 percentage points less likely to attend university than youth from family backgrounds with university education. Moreover, gaps in university participation have not narrowed over the period from 2005 to 2018 despite a rapid expansion in university participation between 2009 and 2015, leading to an increase of 30% in domestic enrolments (Czarnezki, 2018). Not shown here, the HILDA data also reveal that students from a non-tertiary education background are even less likely to study at the so-called Group of Eight (Go8) universities, Australia's leading research-intensive and elite universities.====Although the Australian gap in university participation by socioeconomic background is not as extreme as the OECD average, it is surprising. Australian students are not constrained by high tuition fees, not even at elite institutions, which promise higher lifetime earnings.==== More than three quarters benefit from public loans or scholarship grants. This is comparable to Norway, a country known for its success in creating equal opportunities (Jongbloed & Vossensteyn 2016). Thus, financial considerations play less of a role than in other English-speaking countries, allowing for other factors, including skills, to influence tertiary education choices. This environment creates an ideal setting to study the role of skills and family factors abstracting from tuition-related borrowing constraints.====Our findings contribute to a new international literature on the university experiences of FIFS (Adamecz-Völgyi et al. 2020, Adamecz-Völgyi et al., 2022, Henderson et al., 2020). We provide novel insights into their preparation for and experiences at an elite university, a relatively understudied setting (Beattie et al., 2018). Thus, we draw conclusions for a cohort of disadvantaged students who excelled by accessing elite university education, a strong indicator for upward mobility. We furthermore contribute to a better understanding of FIFS achievement gaps in the context of a country with de-facto universal access to tertiary education, a national identity built on equity, and recent political attempts to broaden higher education participation. This is an important contribution, because most studies on socioeconomic barriers to higher education are from countries where socioeconomic disadvantage is considered a more considerable barrier to educational mobility than in Australia.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. We present a theoretical framework for the decision to pursue a university education and an overview of recent literature in Section 2. Section 3 describes our linked survey and administrative data. In Sections 4 and 5 we present results on university preparedness, academic performance, subject choice and risk of dropout. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of our findings for policies that promote upward mobility and conclude.",First-in-their-family students at university: Can non-cognitive skills compensate for social origin?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000917,13 October 2022,2022,Research Article,45.0

In a randomized experiment to promote learning about COVID-19 among Mozambican adults, we study the interaction between a supply and a demand intervention, respectively: teaching via targeted feedback, and providing financial incentives to learners. In theory, teaching and learner-incentives may be substitutes (crowding out one another) or complements (enhancing one another). Experts surveyed in advance predicted a high degree of substitutability between the two treatments. In contrast, we find substantially more complementarity than experts predicted. Combining teaching and incentive treatments raises COVID-19 knowledge test scores by 0.5 ====, though the standalone teaching treatment is the most cost-effective. The complementarity between teaching and incentives persists in the longer run, over nine months post-treatment.","Societies devote substantial resources to helping people acquire knowledge. These efforts often take place in educational institutions. In addition, outside of school settings, there are many efforts to promote learning about financial decision-making (raising “financial literacy”), public health (promoting “health literacy”), and many other areas. Efforts to promote learning commonly take one of two approaches. First, one can ====, via classroom instruction, broadcast media, advertising, social media, or other means. Second, one can improve learners’ ==== to acquire knowledge, such as by informing them about the returns to education, or providing incentives for good performance on learning assessments (e.g., merit scholarships or other rewards based on test scores). These two broad approaches are often described as operating on the “supply” and “demand” sides of education, respectively (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011; Glewwe, 2014). Supply interventions provide educational inputs (e.g., teaching and instruction), reducing the marginal cost of learning. Demand interventions seek to raise learners’ perceived marginal benefit of learning.====Supply and demand educational interventions often operate at the same time. Existing research, however, says little about ==== between such interventions. Crucially, are supply and demand interventions ==== or ====? Understanding complementarities between interventions is key for cost-effectiveness analyses, and thus decision-making on optimal combinations of policies (Twinam, 2017). If two interventions are complements, the gains from implementing both exceed the sum of the gains of implementing each one singly. The greater the complementarity, the more attractive it could be to implement both policies together, rather than either one alone. If they are substitutes, by contrast, the gains from implementing both are less than the sum of the gains of implementing each one singly. In this case, it becomes more likely that the optimal course would be to implement just one or the other of the policies, not both together.====We implemented a randomized controlled trial of a supply and a demand intervention to promote learning, estimating the degree to which the two are substitutes or complements. We study learning about COVID-19 among adults in Mozambique, and implement treatments that are representative examples of supply and demand interventions to promote learning. Our supply treatment ==== about COVID-19. It provides information targeted at individuals’ specific knowledge gaps, a pillar of the “teaching at the right level” (TaRL) pedagogical approach (Banerjee, Cole, Duflo & Linden, 2007; Duflo, Dupas & Kremer, 2011). We view this feedback as an important component of teaching; however, we do not attempt to teach principles (e.g., of immunology) which would allow respondents to answer new questions correctly (“in-depth” teaching). The demand-side treatment offers individuals financial ==== for correct responses on a later COVID-19 knowledge test. This treatment is analogous to educational testing with non-zero stakes for test-takers.====Abiding by COVID-19 health protocols, we interacted with our 2117 Mozambican study respondents solely by phone. We registered a pre-analysis plan prior to implementation. We assessed respondents’ COVID-19 knowledge in a baseline survey, and then implemented the teaching and incentive treatments in a 2 × 2 cross-randomized design. The design created a control group and three treatment groups: “Incentive” only, “Teaching” only, and “Incentive plus Teaching” (or “Joint”). We measure impacts on a COVID-19 knowledge test several weeks later.====To theoretically examine interactions between teaching and incentives, we write down a simple model of knowledge acquisition. Individuals can exert effort to search for knowledge on their own, and can also learn from teaching. In the model, the Incentive and Teaching treatments can be either substitutes or complements, depending on the magnitudes of two countervailing effects. The Incentive treatment has a ==== effect, potentially enhancing the impact of Teaching. But Teaching can have a ==== effect, by reducing the need to search for knowledge, thus lowering the effectiveness of the Incentive treatment. We define a parameter ====, representing the degree of complementarity. If motivation effects dominate crowding-out effects, then Incentive and Teaching are complements (==== 0). Otherwise, they are substitutes (==== 0).====In advance of sharing our results publicly, we determined a reasonable “benchmark” ==== by collecting expert predictions of our treatment effects. The vast majority of surveyed experts expected the two treatments to be substitutes, predicting that the effect on test scores of the combination of both treatments would be less than the sum of the effects of each treatment implemented singly. In the context of the theoretical model, expert predictors believed that when offering the Incentive and Teaching treatments together, the crowding-out effect would dominate the motivation effect.====We find substantially more complementarity than experts predicted: actual estimated ==== is positive, and highly significantly different from experts’ negative prediction of ====. The Incentive treatment raises COVID-19 knowledge test scores (fraction of questions answered correctly) by 1.56 percentage points, while Teaching does so by 2.88 percentage points. By contrast, the Joint treatment raises test scores by 5.81 percentage points, 31% larger than the sum (4.44 percentage points) of the effects of each treatment provided separately. Actual estimated ==== is also marginally statistically significantly different from zero, another benchmark of interest. These results are consistent with the theoretical case in which the motivation effect dominates the crowding-out effect when providing both treatments together. The effect of the Joint treatment is large in magnitude: 0.5 test score standard deviations. Additionally, the Joint treatment's significant positive effect and complementarity pertain to newly asked questions (not just questions previously asked) and persist over nine months after the intervention.====We provide a simple illustration of the importance of the estimate of ==== for cost-effectiveness comparisons. We use our actual treatment effect estimates and implementation costs to calculate cost-effectiveness of the individual Incentive and Teaching treatments, as well as the cost-effectiveness of the Joint treatment for different values of ====. Our estimated ==== is below the threshold at which the Joint treatment would be the most cost-effective of our three treatments. That said, governments or NGOs implementing our treatments in different contexts may come to different cost-effectiveness rankings given their specific implementation costs.====This research contributes to economics research on education and learning. There is a substantial literature examining the impacts of supply- and demand-side educational interventions (Conn, 2017; Evans & Popova, 2015; Glewwe, 2014; Le, 2015; McEwan, 2015; Muralidharan, 2017).====On the supply side, studies have examined provision of educational supplies (Glewwe, Kremer, Moulin & Zitzewitz, 2000, 2009), school facilities (Duflo, 2001), new teaching technologies (Muralidharan, Romero & Wuthrich, 2019), and “teaching at the right level” (TaRL) (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011; Duflo et al., 2011). Angrist et al., (2020c) show that teaching via cellphone can offset learning loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mbiti et al. (2019) show complementarity between two supply-side interventions (increased school resources and teacher incentives). Outside of school settings, supply-side efforts are made to provide health education to promote “health literacy” (Batterham, Hawkins, Collins, Burchbinder & Osborne, 2016), financial education to promote “financial literacy” (see Kaiser and Menkhoff (2017) for a review), and agricultural “extension” to improve farming knowledge (Anderson & Feder, 2007; Fabregas, Kremer, Lowes, On & Zane, 2019).==== Our Teaching treatment implements a targeted approach to promote COVID-19 health literacy.====Demand-side educational interventions seek to increase the perceived returns to learning. In school settings, studies have examined impacts of providing information on the wage returns to schooling (Jensen, 2010), merit scholarships based on test performance (Berry, Kim & Son, 2019; Kremer, Miguel & Thornton, 2009), or incentives for test performance (Angrist & Lavy, 2009; Behrman, Parker, Todd & Wolpin, 2015; Fryer, 2011; Levitt, List, Neckermann & Sadoff, 2011; Burgess et al., 2016; Fryer, 2016; Hirshleifer, 2017). Outside of school settings, studies have evaluated incentive-based strategies such as cash payments, deposit contracts, lotteries and non-cash rewards to promote healthy behaviors (Finkelstein, Bilger & Baid, 2019), but do not target learning outcomes. Our Incentive treatment is analogous to policies providing financial incentives for test performance, making it a rare example of a demand-side policy to promote learning among non-students.====The most novel feature of our work is that we explicitly highlight and measure the complementarity between a supply-side and a demand-side educational intervention. Behrman et al. (2015) and List, Livingston and Neckermann (2018) study the interactions between test-score incentives for teachers (supply-side) and students (demand-side), but do not estimate a complementarity parameter, as we do.==== In addition to being of policy interest, we view this interaction as of particular theoretical interest due to the countervailing motivation and crowding-out effects of combining supply- and demand-side educational interventions.====Our study also contributes to understanding adult education in health crises. Broader research suggests that adults have higher economic and physiological barriers to learning (Aker & Sawyer, 2021), and that successful health informational interventions are comprehensive but not overly complex (Dupas et al., 2011). Additional challenges in health crises often include underlying institutional mistrust and misinformation (Vinck, Pham, Bindu, Bedford & Nilles, 2019) and logistical obstacles to needs assessments and outreach with vulnerable populations (Checchi et al., 2017). In this context, we demonstrate simple interventions that can complement phone data collection during epidemics (Angrist et al., 2020; Maffioli, 2020; Magaço et al., 2021). In particular, our Teaching intervention shows that providing feedback on knowledge-based questions is a feasible and impactful add-on to health surveys—for example, on ""knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP)"" surveys common in public health.====Related studies seek to improve COVID-19-related knowledge among adults. Alsan et al. (2020) show that messaging tailored to minorities improves their COVID-19-related knowledge. Mistree et al. (2021) and Maude et al. (2021) find that randomly assigned teaching interventions improve COVID-19-related knowledge in India and Thailand, respectively, while Bahety, Bauhoff, Patel and Potter (2021) find no evidence that COVID-19 SMS-based information campaigns improve knowledge in rural India. Angrist et al. (2020c) and Banerjee et al. (2020) use phone-based interventions to address issues during the pandemic.",Teaching and incentives: Substitutes or complements?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000905,10 October 2022,2022,Research Article,46.0

Treatment impacts are evaluated through university enrolment, choice of field of study, and performance either at university or in the labour market. Thanks to the large sample size, ==== can also be assessed for subgroups (by gender and parental education).====We find that treated females from high-educated families chose more economically rewarding fields of study, while treated males from low-educated families were more likely to enter the labour market. Although not necessarily in line with policy goals, choices induced by additional information were not detrimental to students’ opportunities, as treated students displayed a similar ==== and higher employment rates.","The choice between entering the labour market and pursuing Higher Education (HE), and in the latter case the choice of a Field of Study (FoS), can be modelled as a classic instance of decision under uncertainty. The human capital model of school choice (Becker, 1964) is based on the subjective evaluation of the expected costs and benefits of each option, given student’s ability.====Two stylized facts, however, are difficult to reconcile with optimal choices simply driven by heterogeneous individual preferences: (i) students with a higher socio-economic family background enrol more often in HE than their less advantaged counterparts with the same school performance (Boudon, 1974); (ii) females disproportionately choose less occupationally rewarding FoS (Charles and Bradley, 2009, Gabay-Egozi and Yaish, 2020, Zafar, 2013). To rationalize these patterns of choice in the human capital model it is necessary to identify behavioural traits that differ at the aggregate level. In principle, a possible candidate is risk aversion, which is a correlate of both family background and gender. However,  the evidence shows that  risk====attitudes cannot account for the aforementioned stylized facts.==== Alternative explanations of the observed patterns of HE decisions rely upon behavioural perspectives entailing group-level status maintenance concerns (Breen and Goldthorpe, 1997, Malloy, 2015), or identity and social belonging mechanisms (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Akerlof and Kranton, 2002).====Even though raising concerns from a perspective of equality of opportunity and efficiency, different educational choices merely based on heterogeneous preferences would still satisfy individual rationality. However, choices can be suboptimal when driven by an incorrect representation of the underlying prospect, i.e. when the potential outcomes and the corresponding probabilities are misperceived. This explanation may seem counter-intuitive at first sight because objective information concerning the consequences of educational choices is available. However, such information is difficult to collect and to process. We know from the behavioural economics literature that individuals tend to rely upon readily available information and fast and frugal heuristics in order to reduce the cost and the cognitive burden of decision-making processes. As a result, biases and sub-optimal choices can be observed.====Importantly, a growing literature reviewed in the next section suggests that these information biases can be stratified along socio-economic and gender dimensions. High-educated parents are better equipped with the information-processing skills needed to navigate HE. Moreover, families rely upon their social networks when considering the costs and benefits of HE, but the quality of the available information correlates with socio-economic status (Erikson, Jonsson, et al., 1996). Furthermore, gender stereotypes may also operate as cognitive shortcuts to reduce the cost of information acquisition, at the expenses of the choices’ optimality (Barone et al., 2019, Favara, 2012). Information biases may therefore contribute to explain the persistence of intergenerational inequality and gender segregation. In this context, the provision of ready to use, reliable, evidence-based information on the costs, benefits and chances of success of different educational options may constitute an effective intervention towards levelling the playing field. This paper reports evidence from a randomized field experiment in which treated high school students were provided with information concerning the expected costs and benefits of HE, conditional on their possible career choices and on their chances of success across different FoS. The experiment involved a large, representative sample of students attending the last year of high school in four Italian provinces. All students were surveyed at the beginning of their senior high school year, when they had to choose about HE enrolment and FoS. Afterwards, schools were randomly assigned to the treatment or control condition. Students from treated schools were then provided with a five-hour outreach program, based on a face-to-face intervention at the classroom level, while control schools did not receive this type of information (usually not so easily accessible otherwise). Treated and control students were surveyed longitudinally three more times afterwards. In the last of these interviews, that took place at the start of their (possible) second year of university, we gathered information concerning their performance either at the university or in the labour market.====We compare the educational choices and performances of treated students with those of a control group in which decisions were taken in the usual information setting. If information biases are socially patterned, the information campaign should be more relevant to students from low-educated families. Moreover, this intervention should increase the salience of objective information relative to cognitive shortcuts and stereotypes that may magnify the influences of family background and gender.====As explained in more detail in Section 2, the scale of our intervention allows us to make significant contributions to the existing literature from different viewpoints. First, the treatment does not focus on enrolment decisions only but it also extends to the choice of FoS. Second, the statistical power of the experiment allows us to break down the effects simultaneously by family background, as measured by parental education, and gender.==== Third and foremost, the analysis of the outcomes of the information campaign is not limited to the immediate impact on students’ enrolment decisions, but also extends to their consequences for FoS choices, performance at university and labour market entry.====Our experiment indeed provides evidence of the causal impact of information barriers on HE decisions, although not always in line with theoretical expectations and policy goals. In fact, treated students displayed significantly lower university enrolment rates. On the other hand, they were also less likely to choose the FoS providing relatively low occupational returns. The magnitude of both effects is about 2–3 percentage points (pp). Splitting the sample into sub-groups defined by gender and parental education, we find that the former effect is concentrated among males coming from low-educated families, while the latter involves females coming from high-educated families, with a treatment effect of about 5 pp for both sub-groups.====These effects are persistent after enrolment and are not detrimental to students’ opportunities. Indeed, students switching towards more rewarding FoS did not display negative effects on their academic performance as compared to control students. Moreover, the sub-group directly entering the labour market displayed instead a significantly higher probability of being employed one year after the end of high school, once compared to their counterparts in the control group. From a policy perspective, this experiment provides support to invest in cost-effective counselling interventions aimed at improving the efficiency of HE decisions, focused in particular on a better match between labour market demand and students’ choices.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we summarize the relevant literature and outline the contribution of our study.

We leverage the administration of phone-based assessments (PBAs) measuring numeracy and literacy for primary school children in Kenya, along with in-person standardized tests administered to the same students prior to school shutdowns, to assess the validity of PBAs. Compared to repeated in-person assessments, PBAs did not severely misclassify students’ relative performance, but PBA scores did tend to be further from baseline in-person scores than repeated in-person assessments from each other. As such, PBAs performed well at measuring aggregate but not individual learning levels. Administrators can therefore use these tools for aggregate measurement, such as in the context of impact evaluation, but should be wary of PBAs for individual-level tracking or high-stakes decisions. Results also reveal the importance of making deliberate efforts to reach a representative sample and selecting items that provide discriminating power. Finally, in cases when collecting in-person data is possible, this study illustrates that, depending on the logistical capabilities of the data collecting agency, PBAs do not always have a cost-effectiveness advantage over in-person data collection.","The 2020 COVID-19 outbreak induced almost universal school closures around the world, placing heightened emphasis on methods for monitoring student learning at a distance. Even prior to these shutdowns, tracking academic outcomes has historically been challenging for out-of-school children, children living in remote areas or who are mobile, and those experiencing humanitarian or natural disasters. These monitoring difficulties add a layer of complexity to the process of designing policy, especially in developing countries for students experiencing learning disruption. This is particularly worrying given that even prior to the pandemic the World Bank estimated that over half of all children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) could not read a short passage with minimal comprehension by the end of primary school—often described as the “learning crisis.” Some project that this share could increase to almost two thirds post-pandemic (World Bank, 2020a; Azevedo, 2020). Still, the unprecedented nature and magnitude of these school closures, along with the diverse set of governmental responses, add a layer of uncertainty about the state of learning outcomes during and after the pandemic, overall and for different subgroups of students. As such, the measurement of academic skills for hard-to-reach populations is a key first step towards the design of interventions that minimize the long-term consequences of COVID-19 and other educational disruptions on educational equity in the developing world.====Given the high degree of market penetration of cell phones even in some of the world's poorest areas, phone-based assessments (PBAs) emerge as a potential tool to assess learning levels for hard-to-reach groups. Researchers including Angrist et al. (2020a), Crawfurd et al. (2021), and Schueler & Rodriguez-Segura (2021) have already used these assessments as outcomes in the context of impact evaluations, and both Angrist et al. (2020) and Luna-Bazaldua et al. (2021) provide logistical and empirical recommendations for researchers and policymakers assessing children by phone. In spite of this rise in the use of PBAs, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been much examination of the validity of these assessments. How representative are PBA samples? How well do PBAs appear to discriminate between students of different ability levels? How well do they assess the constructs they are intended to measure? Do they work better for assessing certain subjects than others? These questions are the focus of our paper.====A careful examination of phone-based assessment validity is valuable given the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with PBAs relative to in-person assessments. The clearest advantage of PBAs is that they allow assessors to reach students remotely through a fairly ubiquitous technology. As a result, PBAs allow assessors to be centrally located without the need for travel time between assessments, potentially reducing costs. Other researchers have found that the costs of phone surveys in Sub-Saharan Africa could potentially decrease total costs by one or two orders of magnitude per completed assessment (Zezza, et al., 2021; Crawfurd et al., 2021). However, it is possible that the costs and benefits of PBAs may differ across communities or are dependent on the data collection capabilities of the organizations administering the assessment, providing more reason to study these types of tests in additional contexts. This feature is particularly enticing for increasing the potential reach of large-scale formative assessments growing in popularity in LMICs. In the most extreme cases, such as during school closures, remote assessments like PBAs, may be the only practical way to reach certain students safely.====On the other hand, PBAs also have potential disadvantages that could threaten the extent to which the information obtained through them is useful for policy design. First, cell phone use – although high – is not yet universal in the developing world. Phone numbers may more often change for families experiencing other forms of disadvantage. As such, PBAs might disproportionately exclude the most disadvantaged students who, in turn, might be those that policymakers are most interested in assessing. Relatedly, there may be serious logistical challenges to reaching parents at a convenient time, when their children are nearby, and when children are in a physical and mental space conducive to being accurately assessed, as documented for a PBA conducted in Sierra Leone (Sam-Kpakra, 2021). Another potential disadvantage is that PBAs may lend themselves to cheating or “prompting”—friends and relatives helping pupils as they solve the exercises even if they were instructed not to—as documented in Sierra Leone (Sam-Kpakra, 2021; Crawfurd et al., 2021) and India (Gupta, 2022). For example, Gupta (2022) finds that pupils enumerators grading pupils who were randomly assigned to take a PBA (relative to pupils randomly assigned to take the same assessment in-person) were 12 percentage points more likely to report a suspicion that the pupils were being “prompted.” In Sierra Leone, researchers suggest that at least part of the large gap of 0.45 SD in scores between the in-person and phone-based assessments (favoring the PBA) was due to parents explicitly helping pupils (Sam-Kpakra, 2021). This worry around cheating might grow if the perceived importance of and stakes attached to PBAs also increase. Finally, PBAs may not allow for the measure of all skills and subjects equally. For example, assessing some skills may require visual prompts not available during a PBA or requiring distribution. Therefore, in spite of the promise of PBAs, logistical challenges and empirical questions remain that should be investigated further before PBAs are used more broadly and to interpret results from studies that have already used PBAs as outcome measures.====In this paper, we address these gaps in the literature by examining the validity of a phone-based assessment measuring foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) for primary school students in Kenya. To do so, we leverage a unique longitudinal, student-level dataset that includes, for the same students, data from two PBAs—one of math and one of literacy skills—along with baseline test scores obtained via in-person testing in math, English, and reading fluency on an exam for which significant validity evidence has already been collected. Importantly, we are able to link standardized in-person and PBA scores for a large sample of the same third, fifth, and sixth graders, and compare pupils’ performance on each of these assessments. As such, this paper's contribution to the literature is to provide empirical evidence on the validity, strengths, and limitations of PBAs as tools to accurately measure FLN across multiple subjects.====We find evidence that deliberate attention to prioritizing groups that are less likely to be reached via phone is needed to achieve a representative sample of students assessed with PBAs. We also find that PBAs, while on aggregate positively correlated with in-person performance, are significantly noisier than repeated in-person assessments. Despite this, the numeracy PBA, but to a lesser extent the literacy PBA, is generally as rank-preserving as a repeated in-class assessment. In other words, the PBAs did not systematically misclassify students on the relative distribution of performance. As a result, we conclude that PBAs appear to be appropriate tools to track aggregate measures of numeracy and literacy, such as in the context of impact evaluation research but may not be reliable tools to track individual-level student performance or for the purpose of individual-level high-stakes decision-making without further development. Additionally, PBAs do not appear equally effective at measuring all sub-skills. For example, we find evidence that more research is needed before phone-based fluency assessments are adopted widely, if at all. Finally, as we discuss in the discussion section, it is not obvious that PBAs are always more cost-effective than in-person assessments, although they do have the benefit of allowing test administrators to reach at least some pupils who are not enrolled in school or whose schools would be logistically hard to visit.",Can learning be measured by phone?

The country comprises 54 different ethnic groups with one dominant (Kinh) ethnicity, making it an especially appropriate venue to study this question. Vietnam exhibits high vulnerability to climate risks (Eckstein, Künzel, Schäfer, & Winges, 2020), but has also enjoyed favorable economic growth and improved living standards over the last two decades, although such progress has not been shared by ethnic minorities, who constituted only 14% of the population but 73% of the country’s poor in 2016 (World Bank, 2018). Ethnic disparities in education not only persist but have increased, with a particularly worrisome declining rate of enrollment in upper secondary schools among ethnic minorities especially since 2004 (Dang & Glewwe, 2018). Similarly, minority children are disproportionately undernourished, with one in three suffering from stunting, and one in five underweight (Mbuya, Atwood, & Huynh, 2019)–an alarming rate that is similar to that of many Sub-Saharan African countries. Earlier explanations for the observed ethnic inequality in the country include geographic disparities arising from the fact that minorities tend to live in less productive, rural areas with less access to markets and non-farm work opportunities, to public infrastructure, as well as differential returns to individual characteristics (Van de Walle & Gunewardena, 2001), or differences in family background and endowment, especially parental education and household income (Arouri et al., 2019, Nguyen, 2019, Trieu, 2018). Given the importance of weather shocks to human capital formation (Maccini and Yang, 2009, Shah and Steinberg, 2017, Tiwari et al., 2017), differential exposure to or capacity to manage weather risk could be an important understudied channel for perpetuating ethnic inequality intergenerationally.====Exploring the relationship between weather shocks and ethnic disparities in human capital can be challenging for several reasons. First, data constraints often confound causal inference. Previous work often compares those who were exposed to a shock with those who were not, which can fail to distinguish the effects of weather shocks on human capital outcomes from other underlying characteristics that are potentially correlated with the shock (Dell et al., 2014). If there is spatial sorting or selection such that ethnic majority households who choose to live in low-risk areas differ systematically from ethnic minorities who live in high-risk areas – which is often the case – then children exposed to shocks might have had different educational and health outcomes in comparison to other children even had the shock not occurred (Kousky, 2016). Second, even with a panel dataset, attrition caused by mortality or out-migration associated with the shock could bias estimates. Third, the estimated impacts of rainfall shocks include not only the direct effects of adverse rainfall but also any actions taken in response (e.g., relief aid) by governments and other organizations, thus may understate the risks the shocks pose and the value of emergency relief.====I overcome these challenges by studying the impacts of frequent, small-scale rainfall shocks in rural Vietnam over the 2008–2017 period. By linking satellite-based weather data to a rich longitudinal dataset that covers individual members of approximately 2000 households from three provinces in the Northern Central Coast and Northwestern Central Highlands regions, I can compare a given individual’s health, and education under various rainfall conditions. In particular, I focus on extreme rainfall during the annual typhoon season (July to November), which overlaps with the summer-autumn and monsoon harvest of rice, the main staple crop. This approach controls for potential confounding factors by utilizing unpredictable and presumably random year-to-year local variation in rainfall realization during the typhoon season after controlling for individual and province-year fixed effects. The model includes both current year and previous year rainfall shocks, which allows me to separately examine the contemporaneous and lagged effects of rainfall shocks on human capital, a strategy similar to Shah and Steinberg (2017). The data set has low attrition, which is not significantly correlated with rainfall shocks. And although the rainfall shocks were significant enough to impact household and individual behaviors, they were not catastrophic enough to elicit emergency relief efforts by government or external donors, enabling estimation of impacts uncontaminated by endogenous efforts to cushion shocks’ effects. As a further benefit, the longitudinal household data also allow me to directly examine potential mechanisms and remedies.====Two main findings emerge about the effects of adverse rainfall shocks on health and education of children. First, exposure to rainfall shocks in one year neither do not affect same year health status, the likelihood of getting an infectious disease, nor on-time grade progression conditional on being enrolled. The prior year’s rainfall shocks, however, lower current year subjective health status but do not affect infectious disease incidence and grade progression once the child is enrolled in school. Both current-year and previous-year rainfall shocks negatively affect school enrollment.====Second, these results mask significant heterogeneity across ethnic groups. The impacts of rainfall shocks on school enrollment and perceived health are concentrated among children of minority groups. Specifically, while one unit increase in rainfall shocks last year lowers the probability of being in good health for Kinh children by roughly 10 percentage points this year, the effect for minority peers is 17 percentage points. Similarly, while previous year rainfall shocks virtually do not affect this year enrollment status of Kinh children, one unit increase in previous year shocks reduces the probability of being enrolled for children of minority group by about 9 percentage points (roughly 10% of the corresponding sample mean). In addition, last year adverse rainfall shocks result in lower likelihood of enrollment for ethnic minority children who are around the age of starting primary school (i.e., 6–9 years old) but virtually do not affect Kinh peers. Previous literature has documented different shock–coping strategies by poor households such as changing diet composition (Hou, 2010), liquidating assets (Kazianga & Udry, 2006), migrating (Gröger & Zylberberg, 2016), and adjusting the timing of child marriage (Corno, Hildebrandt, & Voena, 2020). This finding suggests another (imperfect) strategy with potentially big negative long-run effect: assuming rainfall shocks cause the child to complete one less year of schooling (i.e., the age at which schooling is finished does not change) and the rate of return to one year of schooling is 8%, then rainfall shocks-induced delayed school entry can result in a decrease of as much 8% in present discounted life-time earnings.====Finally, rainfall shocks appear an important contributor to ethnic disparities in upper-secondary education in Vietnam. Specifically, one additional month of extreme rainfall this year lowers school enrollment of minority students of upper-secondary school age (i.e., 16 to 18 years old) by roughly 8–9 percentage points, as compared to their Kinh peers who are virtually unaffected. This is consistent with the observed persistent and increased ethnic enrollment gap in upper-secondary education, which is almost completely driven by declining enrollment among ethnic minorities, as opposed to increasing enrollment among Kinh students (Dang & Glewwe, 2018). Roughly 28% of the gap in upper-secondary education enrollment between ethnic majority and minority groups can be explained by rainfall shocks during the typhoon season over the study period.====Previous literature on the impacts of extreme weather events in general, and rainfall shocks in particular, on child human capital has focused on four main channels: elevated risk of infectious diseases, worsen household economic conditions, damages to healthcare and education facilities, as well as weakening aggregate local economy (labor wages) (e.g., Shah and Steinberg, 2017, Tiwari et al., 2017, Zimmermann, 2020). The null effects of both current and previous year rainfall shocks on infectious disease incidence suggests that it is not the disease environment associated with excess rainfall that worsens child health, as observed in other settings.==== The healthcare and education supply channel likewise does not support the findings on perceived health and school enrollment. Additional analyses rule out the labor wage channel, and suggest a negative association between child health (education) and labor participation following rainfall shocks.====Most analyses in the ethnic disparity literature have focused on geographical factors such as access to public infrastructure, or social factors such as teacher quality, ethnicity and cultural bias (DeJaeghere et al., 2021, Redding, 2019). There is especially a dearth of evidence from developing countries when it comes to the relationship between the physical environment, natural hazards, and ethnic disparities. Islam and Winkel (2017) propose three channels through which disadvantaged groups can be more affected: (i) higher exposure, (ii) higher susceptibility, and (iii) less ability to deal with and recover from climate shocks. These three together result in a vicious cycle of inequality and climate shocks. In this paper, I show that it is not the differences in exposure to rainfall shocks that could have driven more negative effects of rainfall shocks on children of minority groups. Several studies document that weather-induced agricultural productivity shocks have disproportionately affected children of less educated households and marginalized socioeconomic groups, for example, through decreased spending on education and increased child labor in India (Nordman, Sharma, & Sunder, 2022). In this setting, however, despite no significant ethnic difference exists in the estimated lagged effects on household spending and diet composition, the differential lagged effects of rainfall shocks on child health and enrollment status by ethnicity are significant, suggesting that mechanisms other than parental investments could have driven these results.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data, including construction of the rainfall shocks variable with summary statistics, and presents the empirical strategy. Section 3 discusses the effects of rainfall shocks on child human capital, placebo test and robustness checks of the main results. Section 4 provides heterogeneous analysis along the ethnic group dimension, as well as links rainfall shocks with ethnic disparities in school enrollment rates at upper-secondary education.

Indeed, previous research provides vast evidence on the positive effects of central exams on student test scores. But critics warn that these effects may arise through the strategic behavior of students and teachers, which may not affect human capital accumulation in the long run. Exploiting variation in examination types across school systems and over time, we provide the first evidence that central exams positively affect adult skills. However, estimated effects on skills are small and we find no significant average effect on earnings.","Central exams are associated with substantially higher test outcomes of students (see Bishop, 1997, Woessmann, 2003, Woessmann, 2005; Jürges et al., 2005b; Fuchs & Woessmann, 2007). While this reduced-form pattern is well documented, critics warn that this result may simply reflect differences in students’ test-taking ability, rather than actual differences in knowledge and skills. If that were so, central exams might not genuinely improve the productive skills of adults. Indeed, the existing evidence on the relationship between central exams and labor market outcomes is at best mixed (Backes-Gellner and Veen, 2008, Bishop et al., 2000, Piopiunik et al., 2013). However, there is no evidence on the direct effect on cognitive skills of adults, and the available evidence on the long-term impacts of central exams on labor market outcomes rests entirely on observational studies that estimate cross-sectional regression models.====This is the first paper to study the relationship between the type of exit examination at the end of secondary school and the cognitive skills of adults, as well as labor market outcomes in a panel framework. For this purpose, we draw upon data from OECD’s survey of adult skills (OECD, 2013b). Internationally, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) is the most comprehensive survey of adult skills ever undertaken. It assesses literacy and numeracy skills and the ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. It also collects information on labor market outcomes and background characteristics of representative samples of respondents aged 16–65. We supplement the PIAAC data with data on reforms of examination regimes since 1960 for 30 countries participating in PIAAC. We collected these data specifically for this analysis from a wide variety of sources (cf. Table A.1). The data allow us to assign to each participant of PIAAC the type of exit exam that was in place at the time when the participant graduated from high school. Our classification of exam regimes focuses on the central versus local nature of high school leaving exams and employs the definition of central exams of Bishop (1997).====We leverage the panel structure (by graduation cohort across countries) of our data to identify the long-term effects of central exams by exploiting within-country variation in exam types over time and across countries.==== In particular, we estimate regression models that include country fixed effects as well as country-specific linear trends, which ensure that unobserved time-invariant differences in relevant characteristics or differences in linear trends across countries do not confound our estimates. To benchmark our panel estimates, we also present results based on commonly estimated cross-sectional models that rely entirely on strong selection-on-observable assumptions.====Our findings reveal a positive effect of central exams at the end of secondary school on adult skills. We find that central exams on average increase cognitive skills of adults by about 7 percent of a standard deviation. Effect sizes are similar for numeracy and literacy, and only slightly higher for problem-solving skills. We find no significant effects on earnings, employment, or the probability of holding a tertiary degree. In terms of earnings, we can rule out effect sizes larger than 4.6 percent.====Our estimated average effects on skills are small compared to the results of studies that examine student skills, which typically find central exam effects of more than 10 percent of a standard deviation. This difference might be the consequence of some fade-out in central exam effects. Given recent estimates of the returns to adult skills based on the same data (Hanushek et al., 2017), our small estimate of the skill effect is consistent with not finding any earnings effects above 4.6 percent.====However, we also find evidence for effect heterogeneity across countries and population groups. In particular, while all groups benefit from central exams, we find some evidence for stronger effects on skills for second-generation migrants and also some evidence for positive earnings effects for females and individuals with low parental education background. Most interestingly, we also find some evidence suggesting that central exam effects positively depend on the level of school autonomy in a country. Overall, these findings are in line with previous evidence on heterogeneities of central exams on student achievement (see Woessmann, 2005).====We also conduct a series of robustness checks that reveal some interesting aspects. First, our main results are robust to a large set of sensitivity checks. In particular, we present a decomposition of our two-way fixed effects estimate as recently proposed in Goodman-Bacon (2021) and additionally report results based on Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021)’s doubly robust difference-in-differences estimator to show that our two-way fixed effects estimates of the average reform effect are not biased because of time-varying treatment effects. Second, we supplement our main analysis with comparable estimates of the central exam effect on student skills. While these results are purely descriptive, they support the conjecture that central exam effects on skills fade out to some extent over time. Finally, we also provide some evidence for the existence of a positive relation between central exams and adult skills by exploiting the variation in exam types across German federal states. This finding within a single country concurs with our international results.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing evidence on the effects of central exams. In Section 3, we describe our self-collected longitudinal data on exit examinations, the PIAAC data as well as the construction of our estimation sample.

We estimate the model using data on teenagers’ beliefs regarding college participation, controlling for preferences and academic achievement. While we find that, on average, friends’ beliefs account for about 8% of the updating process, we also find strong heterogeneity among schools and individuals. In particular, we find substantial unobserved individual heterogeneity (ranging from close to 0 to more than 75%), which casts doubt on the efficiency of network-targeted public policies.","It is not news that teenagers often have biased views about the world. Indeed students’ subjective expectations affect many of their decisions, ranging from career choices (e.g. Ashby & Schoon, 2010) to risky sexual behavior (e.g. Sipsma, Ickovics, Lin, & Kershaw, 2015). Typical predictors of teenagers’ subjective biases include gender and the characteristics of their parents, such as parental education level (e.g. Attanasio & Kauffman, 2010). For college participation in particular, teenagers’ beliefs has been shown to be strongly dependent on their friends’ beliefs (e.g. Miranda, 2020). Yet, while we may expect some teenagers to be more susceptible than others to their friends’ beliefs, the literature almost exclusively assumes homogeneous peer effects.====In this paper, we explore the heterogeneity of the effect of friendship in explaining teenagers’ subjective beliefs regarding college participation. In particular, we elicit student-level unobserved heterogeneity and find substantial variation. Overall, we find that the average belief of a student’s peers accounts for 8% of the belief updating process, while the remaining percentage is due to individual characteristics. However, we find substantial heterogeneity among schools and individuals. In particular, we find evidence of strong ==== individual heterogeneity: the importance of peers’ beliefs on the updating process ranges from 0.2% to 76.5%. Crucially, differences in the magnitude of peer effect cannot be well predicted using observable characteristics; an observation that has important policy implications. In particular, we show, using calibrated simulations, that without accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, network-targeted policies such as ==== analysis (Ballester, Calvó-Armengol, & Zenou, 2006) are particularly ineffective.====We present a model where, at each period, individuals update their beliefs according to their friends’ average beliefs (e.g. DeGroot, 1974) and also according to their own particular characteristics (e.g. age, gender, parental education, etc.). Accordingly, the steady-state distribution of beliefs is affected by the shape of the social network, but it is not consensual (e.g. Friedkin & Johnsen, 1990).====We estimate the model using data related to students’ beliefs regarding college participation. Specifically, each student is asked: ====.==== Since beliefs are only measured using an ordinal scale, we develop a multivariate ordered probit model. We show that all of the model’s parameters are identified and estimate the model using a Bayesian approach, which allows for greater flexibility regarding the heterogeneity of social learning. While we assume that the friendship network is exogeneous, conditional on covariates (including school fixed effects), we also perform a robustness analysis, controlling for time-invariant student-level unobserved factors and show that our baseline specification is somewhat conservative.====Estimating the model over the entire sample (16 schools), we find an average peer effect on beliefs of 8%. We also separately focus on the two largest schools in our sample and find effects of 11.5% and 25.8%. In addition, we study this heterogeneity in greater depth by then estimating a latent class (or finite mixture) model. Specifically, students are sorted into two (unobserved) groups according to the strength of peer effect on their beliefs. Estimating the model for the largest school in our sample (the school having an average effect of 11.5%), we observe marked differences between the two latent classes; peer influence on beliefs are respectively 0.2% and 76.5%.====To study the source of the students’ heterogeneity, we try to find predictors for the probability of belonging to either class. We find that students having lower beliefs are slightly more likely to belong to the low-influence group. Overall, however, the predictive power is very weak. This is of great importance for policy making.====Indeed, one of the key implications of the literature on peer effects in social networks is that it allows the policy maker to target the individuals that would generate the largest spillovers (i.e. the ====, see for example Ballester et al., 2006 and Zenou, 2016). Importantly, however, this literature mostly assumes that peer effects are homogeneous.====Since we observe (1) a high variation in peer influence among individuals, and that (2) this heterogeneity cannot be predicted using observables, targeted policies will be likely ineffective. That is, the most central individual in the network is not necessarily the key player when accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. We show this numerically by presenting calibrated policy simulations. Since the heterogeneity of peer influence cannot be approximated by observable characteristics, this casts doubt on the efficiency of network-targeted public policies.",Peer-induced beliefs regarding college participation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000802,12 September 2022,2022,Research Article,51.0

Five different class-year cohorts at the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) comprise our panel dataset with over 19,000 exam grades from more than 5,000 students. Exam schedules vary exogenously across years, and first semester freshmen have no say in their course schedules nor can they reschedule their exams. We find consistent empirical evidence that a day-long break situated in the middle of a final exam period increases the average exam grade after the break. This occurs even after we control for idiosyncratic scheduling characteristics during the exam cycle, other timing-related variables, and both course and student-specific variables. In particular, the average final exam grade taken one day after a break is 20%–30% of a letter grade higher than exams taken one day prior to the break. We also estimate that each passing day of a final exam cycle decreases performance by approximately 10%–15% of a letter grade, and that morning exams exhibit a 20%–25% of a letter grade decline in performance, compared to the afternoon.","A challenging but crucial goal of education policymakers is to design effective assessment of student learning. Assessment can of course take many forms, but in the higher education setting, the individual-based, timed examination is perhaps the most prominent instrument. While test design is typically up to individual instructors or course coordinators, university administrators generally schedule testing periods broadly across an entire school or college. This is particularly prevalent for final examinations, which are often scheduled months in advance. If exam grades respond to periodic breaks from exams, the time of testing during the day, or to the amount of time between individual exams, university administrators may wish to consider such effects as they develop testing schedules.==== Changes to exam schedules may be relatively low cost interventions for improvement, and may provide a useful signal before implementing related but larger scale policy changes such as shifts in school start times or nudges of students towards selection of more optimal course schedules.====This paper uses quasi-experimental data and Interrupted Time Series (ITS) methods to estimate causal effects of a study day dropped into the middle of an exam cycle on performance. It also identifies the effect of three other dimensions of final exam timing on performance: the number of days between exams (given one’s idiosyncratic testing schedule); the day number at which a given exam occurs within the testing period (which often spans more than one week in our setting); and whether a given exam is administered in the morning, afternoon, or evening.====To examine these issues, we exploit a quasi-experimental environment provided at the United States Naval Academy (USNA), specifically for freshmen. At USNA, freshmen are required to pass a set of 11 “core” courses in various humanities, social science, math, and natural science disciplines. Students have limited opportunity to test out of (or “validate”) these requirements, thus most freshmen possess similar course schedules. Core courses are large (but split up into classroom sections of approximately 20 students), closely coordinated across instructors and sections, employ the same final exam in a given year, and maintain matched rubrics for exam grading. Importantly, all students in a course sit for final exams concurrently, and students in these core courses cannot request alternate exam times (except under very rare circumstances described later in the paper). Exam schedules change from year to year based on exogenous variation in the academic calendar, which allows us to identify causal effect of an exam cycle break. Our data come from academic years 2013–2017 and include various student level characteristics from high school (e.g., SAT scores) as well as midterm course grades.====We estimate various specifications for an interrupted time series approach, with final exam grades regressed on the exam timing dimensions, observable student characteristics, course fixed effects, and a time trend. Initial estimates provide empirical evidence that indicates that an entire day situated in the middle of final exam cycle increases average exam grades taken after the Sunday break. This occurs even after model specifications control for typical break days during the exam cycle, other timing-related variables and both course and student-related variables. In particular, our results indicate that the average final exam grade taken one day after the common break is 20%–30% of a letter grade higher than exams taken one day prior to the break. We also find that students perform substantially better on afternoon exams compared to morning exams. The data used for this is quasi-experimental, since USNA freshmen during their first (fall) semester have little to no say in course schedules or (non-academic) day-to-day activities. It is also nearly impossible for students to reschedule the timing of a final exam, and final exam schedules are randomized across the years of our sample as well. Each of these factors mitigate or essentially eliminate potential sources of selection bias that can interfere with the identification of this causal effect of exam-cycle breaks.====We then examine course-level fixed effects regressions, which indicate a ==== decrease in final exam grades from each passing day of a final exam cycle. Each day decreases grades by approximately 10%–15% of a letter grade, a result that remains robust to numerous specifications and sub-sample sensitivity checks. Furthermore, exams taken relatively early in the morning exhibit approximately a 20%–25% of a letter grade decline compared to afternoon exams. Finally, we find that each day of rest between exams (due to idiosyncratic differences across students’ exam schedules ==== the Sunday break given to all students) improves grades by approximately 5% of a letter grade.====This paper is laid out as follows.

We exploit the geographical and cohort variation in exposure to the 1976 Tangshan earthquake as a natural experiment. We separately estimate the effects of in utero exposure to high-intensity and low-intensity earthquake shaking. Difference-in-differences results indicate that individuals who experienced either high-intensity or low-intensity earthquake shaking in utero have lower educational attainment in adulthood. Since almost all the casualties and economic losses were concentrated in high-intensity regions during the earthquake, we argue that maternal psychological stress is a potential mechanism behind the effects of low-intensity shaking. We also find that females are more affected than males. However, we find no evidence of adverse effects on labor market outcomes.","Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods can have immediate adverse effects on the economy, but their impacts on economic development in the long run are still under debate (Cavallo et al., 2013; Heger & Neumayer, 2019). The macroeconomics literature has generally overlooked the impacts of early-life exposure to disasters on long-term human capital accumulation, which may contribute to the sustained economic effects of natural disasters (Karbownik & Wray, 2019). For example, an earthquake can adversely affect the health of fetuses and infants (Torche, 2011; Aizer et al., 2009) who may further obtain lower educational attainment due to poor initial health. Thus, an earthquake that occurred decades ago can affect a region's current human capital and economic growth.====This paper analyzes the effects of fetal exposure to an earthquake in China on educational attainment in adulthood. We exploit the geographical and cohort variation in exposure to the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, one of the deadliest earthquakes in recorded history, as a natural experiment. We separately estimate the effects of in utero exposure to high-intensity and low-intensity earthquake shaking. Our study combines the 1% microdata from China's 2000 population census with information on the seismic intensities of the Tangshan earthquake. The empirical analysis employs a difference-in-differences method in which the first difference is a comparison of the individuals exposed to the earthquake in utero to those born before the earthquake, and the second difference is a comparison of individuals born in the affected regions to those born in non-affected regions.====Our study contributes to two strands of literature. The first examines the consequences of fetal exposure to natural disasters. Earthquakes have been shown to affect birth outcomes (Torche, 2011; Kim et al., 2017), cognitive ability (Torche, 2018), and educational attainment (Caruso & Miller, 2015; Paudel & Ryu, 2018).==== However, most of these studies focus on the effects of exposure to earthquake shaking with high intensities.==== To our best knowledge, we are the first to examine the effects of fetal exposure to low-intensity earthquake shaking on long-term outcomes. Recent literature shows that fetal exposure to mild shocks can have substantial negative effects (Almond et al., 2018). Therefore, it is imperative to explore the long-term impacts of fetal exposure to low-intensity shaking.====One potential problem with this literature is that the population of women may change in affected areas after disasters (Currie & Rossin-Slater, 2013). Then the estimation results may in part reflect the compositional changes in expectant mothers. In our context, the Chinese government imposed strict migration controls during the 1970s, which could prevent individuals from migrating across regions after the earthquake. Thus, our estimation is less likely to be affected by endogenous migration issues.====Second, our paper contributes to the literature examining the effects of maternal stress on children's outcomes. A majority of these studies focus on prenatal exposure to stressful events, such as earthquakes (Glynn et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2017), extreme weather (Simeonova, 2011; Currie & Rossin-Slater, 2013), the September 11, 2001 attacks (Berkowitz et al., 2003; Lauderdale, 2006; Brown, 2020), the death of a family member (Black et al., 2016; Persson & Rossin-Slater, 2018), a nationwide blackout (Burlando, 2014), and landmine exposure (Camacho, 2008).====One challenge in estimating the effects of maternal stress using large disasters such as earthquakes or terrorist attacks is that these events not only generate mental stress but also impose direct physical effects on pregnant women. We argue that we can provide evidence on the effects of maternal stress by exploring the effects of fetal exposure to low-intensity shaking. According to Zeng & Wang (2013), during the Tangshan earthquake, almost all the casualties and economic losses were concentrated in high-intensity regions including Tangshan, Tianjin, and Beijing. Thus, pregnant women in low-intensity regions are more likely to suffer from mental stress than other non-stress factors.====We find robust evidence that individuals exposed to the Tangshan earthquake during fetal development have lower educational attainment. The effects are significant not only for individuals exposed to high-intensity shaking but also for individuals exposed to low-intensity shaking. In specific, we estimate that individuals exposed to the earthquake in utero in high-intensity regions complete 0.18 fewer years of schooling. They are 1.5 percentage points less likely to complete middle school, 2.1 percentage points less likely to complete high school, and 1.2 percentage points less likely to attend college. On the other hand, individuals exposed to low-intensity shaking in utero complete 0.1 fewer years of schooling. They are also 1.1 percentage points less likely to finish middle school.====In comparison to studies that explore the effects of prenatal shocks on educational attainment in the long run, our estimates of fetal exposure to high-intensity shaking are comparable to the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the U.S. (Almond, 2006),==== whereas they are smaller than the effects of the Chinese Famine from 1959 to 1961 (Qian & Meng, 2009), and the 1970 Ancash earthquake in Peru (Caruso & Miller, 2015). Our estimated effects of exposure to low-intensity shaking are comparable to the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Taiwan (Lin & Liu, 2014), and larger than the effects of exposure to hurricanes in the U.S. (Karbownik & Wray, 2019), and family bereavements in Norway (Black et al., 2016).====Besides, our results show that fetal exposure to the earthquake has a larger impact on females than on males. In terms of labor market outcomes, we find that fetal exposure to the earthquake has no significant effects on 1) labor force participation, 2) having a part-time job, or 3) working in a low-skilled occupation, which are in general consistent with the findings in Black et al. (2016). One potential reason is that all the individuals in our baseline sample are in their 20s and most of them will work anyway. In addition, the reduction in educational attainment may be too small to translate into changes in occupational outcomes.====To the best of our knowledge, there are two other studies that examine the effects of the 1976 Tangshan earthquake on human capital accumulation. Xu (2011) finds that the earthquake leads to a larger fertility response and reduces the education of cohorts at schooling age during the earthquake. Wang et al. (2017) find that the earthquake has a negative effect on the education and labor market outcomes of affected children and the impacts are concentrated among those aged 6-11 years old during the earthquake. The differences between these two studies and ours are as follows. First, we focus on the effects of the earthquake on fetuses instead of young children as examined in the above studies. Second, these two studies mainly explore the impacts of high-intensity shaking while we also examine the impacts on those exposed to low-intensity shaking. One limitation in the above studies is that they assume that an individual's county of residence in 2000 or 2005 is the same as her birthplace. However, internal migration in China, especially rural-urban migration, increased dramatically since the mid-1990s. Rural migrant labor is estimated to be 104.7 million in 2002 and 125.8 million in 2005 (Chan, 2010).==== Thus, individuals’ current residence may not be the same as their birthplace, especially for those between 20 and 40 years old, who are the focus of their analysis.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the 1976 Tangshan earthquake and its impacts on maternal stress, while Section 3 discusses the data, the sample, and presents summary statistics. The econometrics models are discussed in detail in Sections 4 and 5 presents the main results.

Child labor affects child’s development negatively (Beegle et al., 2009, Gunnarsson et al., 2006, Holgado et al., 2014) and has long-lasting consequences with respect to health, education, productivity, and wages later in life (Emerson and Souza, 2011, O’Donnell et al., 2005). In Latin America and the Caribbean, more than 10 million children are involved in forms of employment that do not comply with minimum age requirements and are hazardous or exploitative. Therefore, increasing school enrollment has been the centerpiece of global anti-child labor policies (U.S. Department of Labor, 2019) and several countries in Latin America have made important progress towards advancing the goal of achieving universal primary coverage.==== Studies analyzing the impact of these initiatives targeted at increasing school enrollment and attendance find large increases in school attendance and much smaller decreases in child labor (see e.g., Attanasio et al., 2010, Ferro et al., 2010, Glewwe and Olinto, 2004, Maluccio and Flores, 2005, Skoufias et al., 2001) because school attendance and child labor are not mutually exclusive (de Hoop & Rosati, 2014), and the trade-off between work and schooling is not clear-cut (Kondylis & Manacorda, 2012).====In settings where primary coverage is almost universal, increasing school enrollment as an avenue for reducing child labor is exhausted. Therefore, current education policies are shifting from increasing schooling access to improving learning opportunities e.g., through the extension of the school day and Full-Time School programs (FTS)====(UNESCO, 2015).==== Yet, little is known about how increasing school instruction time has an impact on both school enrollment and child labor.==== Our paper aims at filling this gap. On the one hand, increasing school instruction time could lead to a direct impact on child labor by increasing the marginal returns to education, which could lead to higher wages for the child in the future, thereby compensating the household for the loss of child’s income today (Edmonds, 2007). On the other hand, FTS indirectly subsidize childcare, freeing the time of other household members to increase their labor supply and substitute child labor for adult labor (Basu & Van, 1998). This study is the first to investigate the causal effect of a FTS program on child labor. We focus on a range of child labor indicators that cover market work, excessive domestic work, weekly hours worked, as well as extensive and intensive margins.==== We further elaborate on different sources of heterogeneity to explain our results such as poverty level at the regional and household level, as well as child-specific characteristics and elaborate possible mechanisms that explain our findings.====A second contribution of this paper is to the studies analyzing the impact of FTS programs. FTS programs have been shown to have a positive impact on academic outcomes, leading to modest improvements in test scores (see e.g., Agüero, 2016, Bellei, 2009, Cabrera-Hernández, 2020, Figlio et al., 2018, Hincapie, 2016, Padilla-Romo, 2022, Thompson, 2021), and to a decrease in the probability of early dropout and grade repetition (García, Fernández, & Weiss, 2013). Only few studies focus on non-academic outcomes. These studies find that longer-school days decrease the involvement of children in risky activities such as crime and early pregnancy (Berthelon & Kruger, 2011). We contribute to the literature by focusing on academic and non-academic outcomes that have not been analyzed before i.e., school enrollment,==== time spent on schooling activities, and child labor indicators. We also explore the role of school meals as one of the channels through which FTS could impact school enrollment and child labor.====Finally, we contribute to the literature analyzing spill over effects of FTS to other family members. Previous studies find that FTS increase the labor force participation of mothers (Contreras and Sepúlveda, 2016, Padilla-Romo and Cabrera-Hernández, 2019) and grandmothers (Padilla-Romo & Cabrera-Hernández, 2020) because these programs entail subsidized childcare and a school day which is more compatible with the traditional working day. We extend this analysis by focusing not only on parents, but also older siblings. This is of particular relevance because within household substitution effects are likely to determine – to a large extent – the impact that FTS have on child labor. As young children spend more time in school, this may decrease the need for child supervision at home. Therefore, besides analyzing the decision to work and hours worked, we also evaluate if the time spent on domestic work changes as a response to the extension of the school day.====To identify the effect, we take advantage of the roll-out of the Full-Time Schools (FTS) program,==== implemented in Mexico from 2009 to 2018. The FTS program is a national initiative that extended daily school hours from part-time (four hours) to full-time (six or eight hours) in primary and secondary schools==== and covered more than 3 million children during the school year 2017/2018. The FTS program increases the weekly instruction time from 20 to either 30 or 40 h i.e., an increase in schooling hours by 50% or even 100%. This study combines administrative school data with data from the Mexican National Labor Force Survey (ENOE) and the ==== (MTI), a nationally representative survey designed to collect information on economic, domestic, and schooling activities carried out by children in Mexico.====Our empirical strategy exploits the staggered implementation of the FTS program at the municipality level to identify the causal effect of a longer school day. We examine the impact of changes in the share of FTS at the municipality level on a yearly basis on (i) the probability of attending school, (ii) weekly hours spent on schooling activities, and (iii) a range of child labor indicators for children aged 7 to 14 years. In addition, we investigate if the program has an impact on the labor force participation (LFP) and domestic work of other household members.====The program’s guidelines establish that priority should be given to schools located in disadvantaged areas. Therefore, we address the concern that the roll-out of the FTS program may be endogenous to municipality characteristics by following three main steps. First, our empirical specification controls for municipality and time fixed effects, as well as a vector of time-varying municipality characteristics which capture local changing economic conditions which may be correlated with the roll-out of the program. We provide as well several robustness tests based on our baseline specification.====Second, we present descriptive and empirical evidence to rule out pre-existing trends and differences of children living in municipalities with different coverage of the program. To do so, we present the results of dynamic models interacting the share of FTS with a yearly dummy at the individual and municipality level. Third, we present the results of alternative specifications such as (i) an IV approach that instruments the share of FTS with an interaction between the share of eligible schools at the municipality level and the yearly budget allocated to the program at the state level, (ii) simple DiD estimates focusing on low-intensity and high-intensity municipalities, and (iii) an event-study design which allows us to rule out pre-trends and evaluate if effects are persistent several periods after the municipality takes up the program.====Our findings can be summarized as follows: When focusing on schooling, we find no impact that an increase in the share of FTS in the municipality has an impact on the probability of being enrolled in school, but a larger coverage of the FTS program leads to an increase in the weekly hours allocated to schooling activities. This finding alleviates the concern that parents, who rely more strongly on child labor, will take their children out of school due to the increase in daily schooling hours. When focusing on child labor, we find that an increase in the share of FTS decreases the probability that children work. A standard deviation increase in the share of FTS at the municipality level leads to a 0.9 percentage point reduction in the probability to engage in child labor. Boys are less likely to engage in market work; and girls less likely to engage in excessive domestic work. We find that the reduction in child labor is smaller for children living in extreme poverty.====When analyzing the response of other household members to the FTS program, we find no impact for older siblings. This finding supports that the reduction in child labor for children aged 7–14 is not substituted by an increase in the probability to work by individuals aged 15–17. In line with Padilla-Romo and Cabrera-Hernández (2019), we find that mothers of children aged 7–14 increase their labor force participation. This increase in LFP is driven by mothers with low levels of education, in the lowest income quintiles, and is similar for mothers who face higher or lower childcare costs. Therefore, we argue that spillover effects within the household are not only driven by the indirect subsidy to childcare, but also due to a substitution effect between child and adult work. Finally, we find that fathers do not adjust their labor force participation, but they increase slightly the weekly hours allocated to domestic work.====The following section provides a general overview of the education system in Mexico, and describes the FTS program.

The existing literature and popular press report that Black students are more likely to be out-of-school suspended than white students, on average. Using administrative data on students from North Carolina public schools over eight academic years, we find that the direction of racial disparity depends importantly on the type of offenses when students are compared within the same school. While Black students are more likely to be suspended for fighting and ====, white students are more likely to be suspended for insubordination and disrespect toward faculty. We also find that economically disadvantaged students are more likely to be suspended across all types of offenses.","Exclusionary school discipline, which refers to school suspension or expulsion, is a disciplinary practice that punishes misbehaving students by isolating them from their learning environments. This form of punitive action is a common disciplinary alternative in U.S. public schools; for example, in the 2017–2018 school year alone, 2.5 million (or 5 percent) of the 51 million public school students were suspended out-of-school at least once. In addition to questions about its efficacy and harmful impacts, there is increasing concern about racial disparity in its implementation. Policy makers and the popular press site, as evidence of a disparity, that Black students represented 38.2 percent of student out-of-school suspensions in the 2017–2018 school year while comprising only 15.1 percent of the public school student population. Related, 4.8 percent of white boys and 1.6 percent of white girls were suspended out-of-school at least once, while the numbers for Black boys and Black girls were 15.3 percent and 8.6 percent (Civil Rights, Office for, 2021).====The high rate of out-of-school suspension may reflect the consequences of policies such as “zero tolerance”, which emphasize tough punishment, including social exclusion, as a primary response to crime or misconduct (Losen and Skiba, 2010, Skiba and Knesting, 2001). However, this disciplinary practice is widely criticized for its inability to improve students’ misbehavior and its adverse consequences for suspended students and the broader school community. Some research documents that school suspension lowers academic achievement and raises school dropout rates of suspended students (Anderson et al., 2019, Arcia, 2006, Lee et al., 2011, Raffaele Mendez, 2003, Skiba and Rauch, 2015, Wald and Losen, 2003). Additionally, adult criminal activity has been linked to school suspensions, expulsions, and early exposure to the criminal justice system (Aizer and Doyle, 2015, Bacher-Hicks et al., 2019). Furthermore, the Black–white academic achievement gap is of great importance for understanding Black–white gaps in economic outcomes. For example, Neal and Johnson (1996) document that (AFQT) test scores alone explain nearly three-quarters of the racial wage gap for young men and all of the wage gap for young women.====Concerns about these adverse effects are amplified by the disproportionate representation of students of color in school suspension rolls. Morris and Perry (2016) show that racial disparity in exclusionary school discipline may account for approximately 20 percent of Black–white differences in school performance. This concern and evidence motivated the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education to release a school discipline guidance package in 2014 to reform discipline policies and has since motivated several states to enact new legislation.==== There is more recent evidence, however, that the negative causal effects of school suspension on students’ academic achievement and school dropout rates are actually small or not statistically significant (Bacher-Hicks et al., 2019, Li and Gilleskie, 2022). In addition, Kinsler (2013) and Li and Gilleskie (2022) find that school suspension can deter students from committing subsequent offenses.====Although the ==== and ==== of exclusionary school discipline techniques remain controversial, the purpose of this paper is to carefully explore the data with regard to the ==== of out-of-school suspensions. Even if there are no negative effects of school suspension on suspended students, a deeper investigation into apparent racial disparity in school suspension is warranted. There is an abundance of articles in the education literature suggesting a racial disparity by examining average rates of punishment by race, even after controlling for individual, family, and school characteristics (Gopalan, 2019, Shores et al., 2020). Diving deeper, Owens and McLanahan (2020) explore three of the literature’s expected drivers of this disparity in one study using survey data: differences by race in school sorting, individual behaviors, and – what they term – treatment/support of students. Using administrative data on individual students followed over time, we extend the disparity investigations to explore the important question of whether Black students are more likely to be suspended than white students for the same type of offenses in the same circumstances. Such actions are generally regarded as discrimination toward Black students regardless of the consequences of the punishments.====A large amount of literature documents that the racial disparity in out-of-school suspension persists even after accounting for offense types and other observable characteristics of students and observable environmental measures of schools (e.g., Anyon et al., 2014, Mendez and Knoff, 2003, Skiba et al., 2014, Skiba et al., 2002, Wallace Jr et al., 2008). However, using administrative data on North Carolina public school students in one school year (2000–2001), Kinsler (2011) found that the racial disparity documented in the literature is primarily generated by cross-school disparity of principals’ punishments. It disappears entirely when Black and white student suspensions are compared within schools. Anderson and Ritter (2017) find similar results using data from Arkansas spanning 2008–09 through 2014–15.==== This finding suggests that the observed “on average” disparity might be explained by school differences, such as a higher proportion of Black students in schools with more severe discipline. Furthermore, Kinsler (2013) documents that the cross-school disparity of principals’ punishments is consistent with their punishment strategies that focus on maximizing students’ academic achievements. Therefore, they conclude that racial discrimination plays no role in out-of-school suspension decisions. Gopalan and Nelson (2019), who find a Black disparity in discipline even within schools, argue that a lack of within-school punishment disparities does not rule out discriminatory practices across schools or districts. They examine the extent to which differences in the districts (schools) attended by students of different races in Indiana contribute to variation in racial discipline gaps.====Using rich administrative data on North Carolina public school students from the 2008–2009 to 2014–2015 school years, our study provides additional evidence on the racial disparities of school suspension between Black and white students, as well as punishment disparities among students from families of different economic backgrounds. Compared to previous within-school examinations (i.e., Kinsler (2011) and Anderson and Ritter (2017)), we document disparities across many more types of students’ offenses. Studies that control for offense type at the student offense level characterize infractions aggregately as objective and subjective or major and minor.==== Our data classify students’ offenses into about 90 types, which allows for a more detailed study of punishment disparities for different types of offenses. The panel feature of the data in this study also provides important controls for students’ offense histories in estimation.====Similar to Anderson and Ritter (2017) and Kinsler (2011), we find that the average punishment disparity (for “out-of-school suspension or not”) between Black and white students for all types of offenses disappears (and even slightly favors Black students) when suspensions are compared within the same school in the same academic year (i.e., when offenses are more likely to be punished by the same principals).==== When estimation is conducted separately by type of offense, we find that racial disparities do exist but the size of the disparity and, importantly, the direction of the disparity depends importantly on the types of offenses when suspensions are compared within the same school in the same academic year.==== While Black students were more likely to be out-of-school suspended for fighting, sexual harassment, aggressive behavior, dress code violation, theft, and excessive display of affection, white students were more likely to be out-of-school suspended for communicating threats, verbal harassment, inappropriate language, insubordination, disrespect toward faculty, truancy, leaving class without permission and skipping class. We do not find evidence that these racial disparities are correlated with principals’ or assistant principals’ race. In addition, we find that economically disadvantaged students are consistently more likely to be suspended out-of-school for almost all types of offenses, whether we restrict the comparison to be within schools or not.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In the loss frame, participants begin with an “endowment” of points and lose a point for incorrect answers, receive no points for skipped items, and gain a point for correct answers. In the gain frame, participants do not lose points for incorrect answers, gain one point for skipped items, and gain two points for correct answers. Contrary to traditional choice theory, where students may choose to skip more questions if the framing induces loss averse preferences, we find that loss-framed exams lead to less skipping. We also find that the loss frame led to improved overall performance, which appears to be driven by increased effort on the exam among participants in the loss frame group. We find little evidence of a gender differential response to frames.","Standardized tests are widely used in high stakes settings for students, educators, and educational systems. For example, exam scores are used to compare academic skills across countries, in teacher pay and promotion decisions, as higher education gatekeepers, and in school accountability programs. Exam scores are used in these ways because they purportedly measure an exam-taker’s proficiency in important skills. A growing literature has investigated whether this is true (Finn, 2015, Wise and DeMars, 2005), and has identified numerous determinants impacting exam performance, such as the role of student effort (Gneezy et al., 2019).==== Thus, a relevant question educators and policymakers face is how to improve student effort, especially on low or medium stakes exams when students may have less motivation to perform well. Beyond raising the stakes of exams for students or incentivizing student effort with large monetary rewards (Levitt et al., 2016), less is known about what types of low-cost interventions are most effective in increasing student effort.====This study investigates how the framing of exam scoring affects effort and subsequent exam performance. Outside of the exam setting, frames have been shown to have meaningful effects on effort and performance. Looking at overall course performance, studies from Apostolova-Mihaylova, Cooper, Hoyt, and Marshall (2015) and McEvoy et al. (2016) find that student performance is improved when the point structure of the entire course utilizes a loss frame. Findings from other settings have also shown that the framing of monetary contracts can induce greater worker and teacher effort (Fryer Jr. et al., 2012, Imas et al., 2017). In our context, participants take a standardized test where incorrect answers are penalized more than skipped items.==== We describe the exam scoring to participants using a “loss frame” or a “gain frame”. In the “loss frame”, participants start off with an “endowment” of points that they can lose by answering questions incorrectly. In the “gain frame”, respondents do not lose points for incorrect answers but instead gain points for skipped items and correct items.====Since differential scoring of incorrect and skipped items implies that a test-taker bears a risk in answering test items, the framing of this scoring can interact with risk and loss preferences in a way that affects exam performance. In particular, the theory of loss aversion (Tversky & Kahneman, 1979) suggests that in lottery decisions, individuals are willing to bear more risk in order to reduce the likelihood of experiencing a “loss”.==== However, loss aversion theory has ambiguous predictions for how this type of exam score framing affects exam-taker behavior. On the one hand, the more the test-taker feels an incorrect answer triggers a “loss”, the less willing they will be to risk an attempt on a question. On the other hand, a loss framing might induce more effort to avoid losing the “endowment” with which they began the exam. This effort effect arises because the probabilities in the “lottery” of an exam question are partly determined by student effort. For instance, test-takers may (unconsciously) read questions with greater care or spend more time thinking about correct answers, causing an increase in the number of items they can confidently answer. This may be especially relevant in lower-stakes settings, where exam-taker effort plays a role in exam performance (Gneezy et al., 2019). In total, these two inputs, student effort and choice, pull in opposing directions: the fear of incurring a loss with a wrong answer tempts the student to skip the question, but this fear also drives effort to answer test items correctly, increasing the probability of answering correctly (if they attempt) and thus incentivizing the student to attempt the question.====To date, the literature on how point structure and frames could influence student choice on exams is limited; furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has investigated how exam frames could impact student effort. In an experimental setting, Baldiga (2014) finds that on exams that penalize wrong answers (relative to omitting an answer), women skip significantly more than men, leading to worse scores overall. Similar findings come from Pekkarinen (2015) in the context of Finnish university entrance examinations: women skip more than men, leading to worse test scores. Recent work by Iriberri and Rey-Biel (2019) uses a within-exam (across question) approach along with a different frame (+points for skipping and ++points for correct answer) to uncover a similar finding: women skip more than men, harming their scores.==== Importantly, these studies do not explicitly test the impact of different frames on student outcomes;==== instead, they identify gender differences within a specific frame. Perhaps most similar to our study, a working paper from Balart, Ezquerra, and Hernandez-Arenaz (2020) tests two score-equivalent loss frames against each other, one where skipping encodes a loss and another where it does not: confirming the classical Tversky and Kahneman (1979) loss aversion in choice findings, the authors find that students skip more questions when there is no “loss” in skipping.====We carry out our investigation by analyzing findings from an experiment using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform designed to investigate how choices and effort respond to differential frames of an exam. We recruited 1903 subjects to take an English vocabulary exam consisting of 15 multiple choice sentence completion questions, each with two potential answers. Participants had three minutes and thirty seconds to complete the exam. Participants were randomly assigned one of two possible scoring structures. In one treatment (“gain frame”), participants were awarded a point for skipping and two points for each correct answer. In the second treatment (“loss frame”), participants were endowed with 15 points, and would gain (lose) a point for each (in)correct response, while skipping resulted in no change in points.==== Crucially, under this scoring system, the total number of points awarded is the same with either framing. Monetary payments were strictly a function of the number of points scored on the test. Thus, participants who perceive the frames to be equivalent should have no effect of treatment assignment. If, instead, participants in the “loss frame” are more likely to perceive incorrect answers as losses, then the two countervailing forces emerge: “loss frame” participants exert more effort in order to reduce the probability of a wrong answer, but they also will be more likely to skip a question to avoid an incorrect answer.====We find that the loss framing increased exam scores. The test score gains arose from a reduction in skipping questions and an increase in answering questions correctly, with the number of incorrect answers left unchanged. We interpret this as evidence consistent with increased effort being exerted under the loss frame. The loss frame appears to have increased participants’ willingness to exert the effort needed to answer questions correctly that they were particularly uncertain about and would have skipped under the gain frame. If instead the loss framing simply induced less skipping but did not affect effort, then we would have expected to find more incorrect answers (as a fraction of all questions answered) since the marginal test items are presumably ones participants find more difficult and are more likely answer incorrectly for a fixed level of effort.====More direct measures of effort also point to the loss frame inducing more effort. Loss frame participants self-reported exerting significantly higher levels of effort on the exam. We also find that loss frame participants spent significantly more time completing the exam questions, which we argue is a useful proxy for how engaged students are with answering the exam questions.====Furthermore, much like prior studies, we find that women were significantly more likely to skip across both treatment arms, which generated a gender gap with women having lower average test scores (Baldiga, 2014, Coffman and Klinowski, 2020, Iriberri and Rey-Biel, 2019, Pekkarinen, 2015). This finding holds conditioning on education level, and is in spite of female participants spending significantly more time on the exam and self-reportedly exerting greater effort on the exam. Thus, it appears that female participants were significantly more risk averse than their male counterparts, and this risk aversion induced greater effort but lowered overall test scores due to “too much” skipping. We also explore whether there is a gender differential in effort and behavior across the two frames. We do not find any evidence of loss versus gain frame effects on the gender gap in test scores.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we describe our experiments, in Section 3 we present our results, and in Section 4 we conclude.",The effects of exam frames on student effort and performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000619,22 August 2022,2022,Research Article,56.0

However, many design features of the tests themselves may lead to psychological reactions influencing performance. In particular, the level of difficulty of the earlier questions in a test may affect performance in later questions. How should we order test questions according to their level of difficulty such that test performance offers an accurate assessment of the test taker's aptitudes and knowledge? We conduct a field experiment with about 19,000 participants in collaboration with an online teaching platform where we randomly assign participants to different orders of difficulty and we find that ordering the questions from easiest to most difficult yields the lowest probability to abandon the test, as well as the highest number of correct answers. We obtain similar results when exploiting the random variation of difficulty across test booklets in the ==== (PISA) for the years 2009, 2012, and 2015, which provides additional external validity to the experiment. We conclude that question difficulty order in tests has important policy implications for optimal test design and performance. It additionally may have important implications for ranking candidates, as well as for the evaluation and comparison of educational institutions and systems.","Standardized assessments are one of the most frequently used ways to measure individuals’ knowledge and aptitudes. On top of their regular academic use, performance on some of these tests plays a crucial role in shaping educational and labor market outcomes. For example, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) in the US, and the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) worldwide, are assessment tests that determine access to universities and graduate studies. Similarly, standardized assessments are used to license professionals, such as professionals in Medicine and Law. Some examples are the bar exams in Law, the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), or ==== (MIR) in Spain. Additionally, standardized tests are used to compare educational systems across countries. Among the most prominent examples is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in the United States, while the ==== (PISA) and ==== are used worldwide. These examples are important since, even if in principle the stakes are low for student participants, results still determine the educational policies of the countries whose students participate in them.====The assessment of knowledge and aptitudes in tests depends on multiple design features that may potentially influence performance. These potential effects must be considered in light of the objectives and goals of the tests. For example, a topic that has received quite a lot of attention, both in education and in economics, is whether incorrect answers should be scored differently than omitted questions in multiple-choice tests.==== In addition, in psychology, performance differences between essay-type tests vs. multiple-choice tests have been studied (see for example the works by Bridgeman et al. (1996) and Chamorro-Premuzic (2006)), as well as potential effects of time limits, which may put more or less pressure on test-takers (see, for example, the reviews by McDonald (2001), and Zeidner (2010)).====A topic that has received less attention in Education and Economics is to what extent question difficulty order within a test influences performance. A perfectly rational test taker, when allowed to choose the responding order to the questions in the test should be immune to the actual presentation of the order of questions of different levels of difficulty. However, there exists ample evidence from Behavioral Economics showing that humans are affected by presentation effects (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). For example, test fatigue increases, and performance decreases as the test progresses (Balart & Oosterveen, 2019; Borghans & Schils, 2012; Zamarro, Hitt & Mendez, 2019) and so, it may be better to place harder questions at the start of the test given that they require greater analytical ability and effort. However, students might be disheartened by seeing a hard question early in the test and interpret it as a signal of the general difficulty of the rest of the test.==== Exams such as the GRE adapt the level of difficulty of subsequent questions to performance in the previous ones to obtain an accurate assessment of the test-takers knowledge.====In addition, potential psychological effects stemming from the order of difficult questions are particularly important in tests in which participants cannot access later questions until having answered the previous ones. A common practice by many academics is to simply randomize the order of questions or to place questions in the order in which topics were explained during a course. However, these practices do not necessarily consider potential psychological effects. In summary, if test designers have the goal of accurately measuring knowledge and not performance as affected by psychological effects, how should questions be ordered according to their difficulty levels? From easiest to most difficult, from most difficult to easiest, something in between? Does the difficulty order matter at all?====This paper studies whether the order of difficult questions is an important feature to consider when designing tests. We present two studies that complement each other in internal and external validity by showing how the order of difficulty of questions affects performance and ultimately, may bias the assessment of knowledge and aptitudes. Our first study is a field experiment designed in collaboration with an online teaching platform, which publicly promoted a 10-question online math challenge among their potential clients. The 19,000 voluntary participants were randomized into four different treatments, all with the same ten questions but with varying order of presentation of questions. The two main treatments contained either the three most difficult questions at the beginning (or at the end), while the four questions in the middle were the same in all treatments. The two additional treatments combined difficult and easy questions throughout the assessment to check for robustness. We measured participants’ number of completed questions, their number of correct responses, as well as self-reported demographic and self-perceived performance.====Our second study employs data from three years of the PISA exam (2009, 2012, and 2015) with a total of more than 600,000 student participants from around the world. We exploit the fact that test booklets vary in the order of groups of questions and that the allocation of test booklets to students in PISA is done randomly to estimate the effect of the order of groups of questions, and their difficulty level, on the number of blank responses and performance throughout the assessment.====In the field experiment, we find that ordering the questions from easiest to most difficult yields the lowest probability to abandon the test as well as the highest number of correct answers. Among participants who take the test with difficult questions placed first, 44% of them do not complete the test, while only 30% of the participants who take the test with easy questions placed first drop out. Accordingly, participants answer on average more than one more correct question in the Easy-Difficult than in the Difficult-Easy treatment (3.53 vs 2.42 out of 10 questions). In addition, consistent with the findings of the field experiment, in PISA, we find that students whose first cluster of questions in the test is about 10 percentage points more difficult, leave between 0.6 and 1 percentage points more blank questions in the middle and at the end of the test, respectively, as well as obtain between 2 and 1.5 percentage points fewer correct answers in the middle and the end of the test.====Most of the available literature on the effect of question difficulty order comes from psychology with studies that involve mostly undergraduates and small convenience samples. Early studies found mixed effects. While some studies found no effect of question difficulty order on performance (Brenner, 1964; Gerow, 1980; Laffitte, 1984; Plake, Thompson & Lowry, 1981; Smouse & Mung, 1968), others, consistent with our results, found that students perform better in tests where they have the most difficult questions at the end of the assessment test, as opposed to the beginning (Hambleton & Traub, 1974; Skinner, 1999).====The more recent literature in psychology finds overall null results of question difficulty order on performance, but positive results on self-perceived performance when the easier questions are at the beginning of the assessment. Weinstein and Roediger (2012) create two versions of a general knowledge assessment using the same 100 questions but changing their order. The first version has the most difficult questions at the beginning and the easiest questions at the end of the test (difficult-easy). In contrast, the second version starts with the easiest questions and ends with the most difficult questions (easy-difficult). The authors randomly assign either version of the assessment among a sample of 50 college students. They find no statistically significant differences in performance between the two test versions as a function of question order. However, the participants who receive the easy-difficult test are more optimistic about their performance relative to their peers who receive the difficult-easy version.====Another study from Bard and Weinstein (2017) follows a similar test design and obtains similar results. The authors employ a sample of about 270 college students and implement three experiments in which the order of questions, the type of test, and whether students are allowed to review the questions before answering them varies from one experiment to another. They find that there are no differences in performance as a function of question difficulty order. However, the authors did find that students tend to be more optimistic about their performance when the easy questions are at the beginning of the test. In any case, the estimates in these studies are imprecise and their statistical tests lack power due to very small sample sizes. The lack of statistical significance in these studies cannot be taken as evidence that question difficulty order does not affect performance.====Our two studies contribute to the literature by studying the effect of question difficulty order using two large subject samples in field settings. A common feature of both studies is that performance is not explicitly incentivized. Hence, in principle, issues such as risk aversion, competitive pressure, or importance attributed to rewards should not influence answering strategies, and therefore, assessment performance. However, although both tests can thus be considered as having low stakes for participants, the PISA exam is used to evaluate and compare educational systems within and across countries, and thus it can have high stakes for the educational institutions students belong to, as it can influence future educational policies.====Study 1 allows for random treatment variation and control over the test design, which is crucial for identifying causality and therefore guarantees the internal validity of our results. In study 2, using PISA data, we have less control over the test structure. Even though the order of groups of questions varies by test booklets and booklets are randomly assigned to students in PISA, study 2 provides higher external validity as it uses a large representative sample of international students taking a relevant exam used for the comparison of educational systems in different countries. Additionally, given how short the test employed in study 1 is, we can use it as a clean test of the discouraging effect of placing difficult questions at the beginning, without considering the plausible fatigue effect that may kick in when difficult questions are placed at the end of the test. Study 2 employs a longer test, and thus its net results may combine both effects.====The paper has the following structure.

These findings sparked a large debate on public policies to support members of disadvantaged categories by actively sorting individuals into purposefully crafted groups.====A major challenge in implementing these policies is the endogenous response of individuals to these interventions. For instance, in a large controlled field experiment, Carrell et al. (2013) implemented policies designed to leverage peer effects in educational settings to increase the performance of the lowest ability students. These policies typically prescribe to sort students into classrooms with a bi-modal skill distribution. They show that the intervention backfired due to endogenous segregation. Within treated classrooms, students sorted into smaller peer groups of “similar” classmates. They conclude that understanding the endogenous pattern of social interaction is essential to be able to implement these affirmative public policies.====The evidence of segregation begs the question of ==== low ability individuals segregate in the face of the gains from blending with their classmates documented in the peer effects literature. One hypothesis is that homophily (that is taste for like minded people) swamps material incentives.==== Alternatively, segregation (in the form of assortative friendships) may be an incentive driven equilibrium outcome, with individuals rejecting to be friends with individuals with lower skills (Shimer & Smith, 2000).====This paper contributes to the debate by studying the ==== of group formation in contexts with heterogeneous agents using observational data on the social network of a cohort of undergraduate students majoring in Economics and Business at the University of Naples Federico II. We provide empirical support for the latter hypothesis documenting that social efforts from low types are not “reciprocated” by higher types in a sense made precise below.====Specifically, we use data from a popular social networking site gathered throughout a key juncture of students’ social life: right at the beginning of their undergraduate degrees. This stage is, arguably, particularly suitable to study and test hypothesis on network formation, as most students start their undergraduate life with a clean social slate. Our measures of online social interactions are ====. An individual can engage with some other individual’s posts (say by “liking”, “sharing” or “commenting” its content) and not be reciprocated. This gives us a time varying measure of social interactions within our network of students, hinging on the hypothesis that online interactions reflect offline ones. However, given how pervasive and diffused this platform is in the age group of interest, this is arguably a good measure of actual social behavior in peer groups. As detailed in Section 3, the data allows to observe both the intensive (“closeness”) and the extensive margins (“mere friendship”) over time. Crucially, to identify “ability” as a driver of friendship formation, we are able to match these data with administrative records from the University on student performance before and after these social interactions took place, among other things.====Consistent with previous findings, in the first part of the paper we show that students segregate in an assortative manner along the ability dimension. High skill students hang out more and more with high skill peers. Exploiting the panel nature of our data we then document that this segregation occurs ==== over the course of the year. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, as information about ability naturally reveals, individuals sort accordingly. To support the hypothesis that individuals respond to ability we exploit the fact that first term exams – being publicly held – generate a discontinuity in the revelation of information about students’ types. We show that the grade point average obtained at the end of the first term has a significant positive effect on popularity controlling for possible differential changes in the level of engagement in online activity.====To understand what drives the increase in popularity of high types relative to low types we exploit the directional nature of our data. We show that this increased popularity is driven exclusively by lower types increasing their social effort selectively towards higher types. Interestingly, for the high types we find no differential change in the social effort directed towards high versus low types. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low types react to information on ability by “reaching out” to high types, but they are not reciprocated.====Our measure of social interactions hinges on the assumption that online interactions on a particular social media reflect offline ones. Needless to say, online platform use is self-selected and endogenous. In Section 2.1 we document how our sample of “online” students compares to that of other students either not registered on the platform or registered with “private” profiles, highlighting differences. These differences may raise concerns about the external validity of the results, but the findings hold for students that use the platform, and, given how pervasive and diffused this platform is in the age group of interest, our study captures an important part of social interactions and provides valuable evidence on how such interactions evolve over time. Indeed, selection into the sample does not seem to change over time: as shown in Fig. 1 in the Appendix, there is no clear pattern in the number of new registrations to the platform over the relevant time period.====A related literature consists of empirical papers that try to understand social interactions or the dynamic learning of ability. Farber and Gibbons (1996) develop a dynamic model of learning about worker ability in a competitive labor market. The model produces two testable implications regarding wage dynamics close in spirit, although in a very different setting, to what we find in our results. First, the role of schooling in the labor market’s inference process declines as performance observations accumulate; second, time invariant variables correlated with ability but unobserved by employers (such as certain test scores) are increasingly correlated with wages as experience increases. Similarly to us, Marmaros and Sacerdote (2006) study the interaction between first-year students proxying friendships through the volume of emails exchanged. They focus on the role of geographic proximity, common interests, majors and family background. They pay no attention to the effect of students learning about each others’ hidden attributes on the dynamics of social interactions which is instead our focus. A more recent study by Conti et al. (2013) shows that high ability students, i.e., those with higher IQ, are more popular among their peers and documents a positive effect of popularity on future earnings.==== Our study differs from Conti et al. (2013) as we analyze whether high achievers become more popular around the time information about their ability is revealed and whether this increase in popularity is driven by interactions with other high achievers or by low ability students reaching out.====Our findings are also closely related to the literature on social peer pressure in educational settings (Austen-Smith and Fryer, 2005, Bursztyn et al., 2019, Bursztyn and Jensen, 2015 among many others). In particular, our findings support the “cool to be smart” hypothesis put forward in Bursztyn et al. (2019). In a large field experiment (Bursztyn et al., 2019) show that students behave in a way that is consistent with the hypothesis that signaling ability is “cool”. The existence of this reward is indirectly inferred through behavior which would be difficult to rationalize otherwise. In this paper we actually document how ability (or its perception as revealed through grades) is indeed rewarded by a greater social effort from low achievers.====Finally, segregation may have an effect on school outcomes of minorities (Ananat, 2011, Angrist and Lang, 2004, Cutler and Glaeser, 1997, Echenique and Fryer, 2007, Echenique et al., 2006) making appealing to re-engineer this process by exposing students of different racial backgrounds to each other. Therefore, studying the ==== of group formation in contexts with heterogeneous agents is key for desegregation plans to be properly designed.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the data and discusses the representativeness of the sample used in the empirical analysis; Section 3 presents patterns of segregation in a static setting; Section 4 analyzes the dynamics of the social interactions among students in the same class, around the first term exams; Section 5 presents robustness checks for the main findings; and Section 6 concludes.",What drives segregation?

Principal VA is typically estimated using a connected networks model that includes both principal and school ==== (FE) to isolate principal effectiveness from fixed school factors that principals cannot control. While conceptually appealing, high-dimensional FE regression models require sufficient variation to produce accurate VA estimates. Using simulation methods applied to administrative data from Tennessee and New York City, we show that limited mobility of principals among schools yields connected networks that are extremely sparse, where VA estimates are either highly localized or statistically unreliable. When comparing principals across schools, employing a random effects shrinkage estimator is shown to alleviate estimation error to increase the reliability of principal VA in our simulations. For within-school rankings of principals, VA estimates from models with both principal-by-school FE and school FE perform best.","A growing literature seeks to estimate ==== (VA): statistical models that isolate the contributions of individual principals to school performance, most often conceptualized as student test score gains, in an education production function. VA methods applied to principals can provide answers to two important questions: (1) Who is an effective principal? (2) How important are principals as inputs to student learning? Extant work consistently finds that principals matter, with the magnitude of principal effects typically ranging between 0.05 and 0.20 student-level standard deviations (SD) (Bartanen, 2020, Branch et al., 2012, Chiang et al., 2016, Dhuey and Smith, 2018, Grissom et al., 2015). In other words, a 1 SD increase in principal VA increases student achievement by 0.05 to 0.20 SD.====A key empirical challenge to estimating principal effects is to account for myriad school- or district-level factors that affect student learning but that principals cannot control. For example, principals cannot control the neighborhood in which the school is located and they similarly face constraints around teacher hiring and/or retention due to district policies or local labor market conditions. These school factors are often difficult to measure and may not be well-captured by available proxy measures, such as average student demographics. The approach taken in prior studies is to estimate a two-way regression model that includes principal and school fixed effects (FE), under the assumption that such unobserved school factors are largely fixed across time. In this model, identification of the principal fixed effects (i.e., the VA estimates) is restricted to within-school variation, but additional across-school comparisons of principals are possible if some principals work in multiple schools over time. Mobility groups formed by principals and schools due to principals transitioning across schools are termed “connected networks” in the principal VA literature (e.g., Bartanen, 2020, Burkhauser, 2017, Chiang et al., 2016).====The appeal of the connected networks model is that it can yield VA estimates where principals have a large comparison set, while also avoiding misattribution of school effects to principals. Despite its common use in estimating principal VA, however, our understanding of the properties of estimates from the connected networks approach remains limited. The inclusion of school FE creates additional challenges stemming from the limited mobility of principals among schools. Whereas other applications of two-way network models may benefit from observing many individuals working in multiple firms (or teachers in multiple schools), a school typically has only one principal at time and a majority of principals lead only one school in their career. This limited mobility potentially leads to weakly identified FE estimates that are unreliable measures of principal quality and overstate the magnitude of principals’ effects (Jochmans & Weidner, 2019).====Connected networks models further hinge on the fundamental assumption that a principal’s effectiveness is the same in any two schools. This assumption allows for the indirect comparison of principals who never worked in the same school, which is a key practical benefit of the connected networks model. Given prior work demonstrating that leadership is a relational process and that principals’ impacts on student achievement are largely mediated through other school-level factors (e.g., Hallinger and Heck, 1998, Sebastian and Allensworth, 2012), such an assumption may be unrealistic. In particular, there may exist principal–school complementarities whereby part of a principal’s effect reflects how well matched they are to a particular school context (Dhuey & Smith, 2018).====Using a simulation approach, this paper helps to fill a gap by investigating the accuracy of connected network models for estimating principal effects. Simulation studies have the advantage of creating controlled conditions where the performance of VA estimators can be tested according to different assumptions about the data-generation process. In particular, this approach allows us to focus on the aforementioned issues related to the connected networks approach. While we acknowledge that principal VA modeling faces additional challenges beyond those we examine here, such as the assumption that a principal’s impact is immediate and fixed over time, our insights here contribute to a broader effort to improve methods for measuring principal quality using student outcome data. In that sense, our simulation is conceptually similar to those used to examine the accuracy of teacher VA models under different assumptions about the nonrandom sorting of students to teachers (e.g., Guarino, Maxfield et al., 2015, Guarino, Reckase et al., 2015). To supplement the insights drawn from our simulation, we also provide a brief empirical application using actual test scores.====Our simulation is built both from administrative datasets from Tennessee and New York City (NYC). That is, using the connected networks formed by actual mobility patterns of principals and schools over long panels, we generate simulated test scores where the true principal effects are known. We then apply VA models to the simulated data and compare the estimated and true principal effects. To more deeply understand the labor market dynamics that lead to these networks, we also construct datasets from a simulated process of job separations that varies the degree of switching of principals among schools. We consider two questions regarding the performance of principal VAMs: (1) How accurately do VAMs rank principals according to their true effects? (2) To what extent does the magnitude of principal VA accurately reflect the true magnitude of principals’ effects? Answers to these questions can provide insight about whether principal VA models are likely to provide accurate results in real-world conditions.====Our results uncover a key tradeoff between the statistical precision of principal VA estimates and their practical utility. Even in large-scale datasets where we observe thousands of principal transitions, the underlying network structure of principals and schools is very weak because most turnover events are exits from the principalship rather than across-school transfers. This yields two distinct types of connected networks. First, many principals belong to small networks that contain one or two schools, meaning that their estimated VA reflects performance relative to only a handful of other principals. While principal VA from small connected networks is precisely estimated, such localized performance measures may lack practical usefulness (e.g., as an accountability metric). Principals in large networks, on the other hand, can be compared to hundreds of other principals. However, the underlying network is weakly connected, undermining the reliability of VA estimates and producing inaccurate rankings of principals. Further, because schools in large connected networks are typically linked through only one or two mobile principals, inaccuracy is amplified substantially in the presence of principal–school complementarities.====A similar tradeoff exists for using principal VA models to understand the magnitude of principals’ impacts on student outcomes. In small networks, school FE erroneously eliminate part of the real difference in principal quality, leading to an understatement of the importance of principals. While large networks circumvent this problem, they ==== the magnitude of principal effects because of the estimation error introduced by weak network structures.====Given the estimation error of principal VA estimates in large networks, we further examine whether shrinkage approaches can improve correlations between principals’ estimated and true effects. Employing a mixed model that treats principal effects as random greatly reduces estimation error in large networks. This method improves the precision of principal VA and yields a substantially more accurate estimate of the magnitude of principal effects. Based on our simulation results, we recommend the random effects shrinkage approach in situations where one’s goal is to produce a global ranking of principals—i.e., by comparing the performance of principals who worked in different schools. If one’s goal is a localized, within-school ranking of principals, we recommend replacing principal FE with principal-by-school FE. This approach also greatly reduces estimation error in our simulations and yields VA estimates that are similar in accuracy to those from shrinkage approaches, but avoids potential biases in situations that could violate the assumptions of random effects estimators, such as endogenous sorting of principals into schools.====This paper contributes to our understanding of principal VA models, where evidence on their validity and reliability remains limited. This dearth of evidence stands in stark contrast to the teacher VA literature, where a large number of studies have investigated these properties (see Koedel, Mihaly, & Rockoff, 2015 for a review). We also contribute to a larger literature utilizing two-way regression models in the context of matched employer–employee datasets. Most notably, we provide an application of recent theoretical work (e.g., Jochmans and Weidner, 2019, Kline et al., 2018, Verdier, 2018) concerning inference of fixed effects estimated from network data. We also build on related applications using school fixed effects to control for unobserved school heterogeneity in value-added modeling, including for teachers (Mansfield, 2015) and teacher preparation programs (e.g., Mihaly, McCaffrey, Sass, & Lockwood, 2013). These applications highlight some key challenges for analyzing connected networks that we consider in the context of the principal labor market, with the added benefit of a simulation analysis that can provide deeper insight around the accuracy of VA models with school FE.",Connected networks in principal value-added models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000668,3 August 2022,2022,Research Article,60.0

I show that underrepresented applicants tend to get weaker letters, but that readers pay less attention to letter strength for underrepresented students. Overall, the inclusion of letters modestly improved application outcomes for the average underrepresented student.","The college admissions decision is an important determinant of students’ life chances, and a highly visible source of inequality of opportunity. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are much less likely to apply to (Hoxby & Avery, 2013; Hoxby & Turner, 2013) or be accepted at (Krueger et al., 2006) selective colleges than are those from more advantaged backgrounds. Growing evidence indicates that this has important implications for graduation and other life outcomes (e.g., Black, Denning, & Rothstein, 2021; Bleemer, 2021; Cohodes & Goodman, 2014).====The specific criteria used in making admissions decisions may have implications for the equity of the process. In particular, critics of the SAT and ACT college admissions exams have often argued that they create unfair advantages for students from already advantaged backgrounds (e.g., Atkinson, 2001; Kurlaender et al., 2020; Rothstein, 2004). This has motivated many colleges to change the weight placed on different quantitative measures, for example by emphasizing class rank, and others to adopt “holistic” review processes that aim to reduce reliance on quantitative measures more generally. Evidence on so-called “percent plans” suggests that merely changing the weights can lead to fairer admissions rules (Black, Denning, & Rothstein, 2021; Bleemer, 2021), though it does not fully offset inequality in pre-college opportunity (Cortes & Klasik, 2020).====But for all of the concern about the SAT, the qualitative components of college applications may be at least as much of a problem (Alvero et al., 2020, 2021). Students from lower-income and otherwise disadvantaged backgrounds are unlikely to get the college counseling, essay writing help, and other application assistance that is routinely available to more privileged students. This may lead them to submit weaker applications, with less polished or less carefully chosen essays. They may also have limited access to recommenders who can write them strong letters that satisfy the particular demands of undergraduate admissions offices. More generally, the inclusion of qualitative measures typically requires using subjective application reviews rather than mechanical formulas. It is not clear that more subjective decisions will be any fairer than are purely quantitative measures. Human reviewers are subject to their own biases, conscious or otherwise, and holistic review may simply expand the scope for them to preference students from more advantaged backgrounds.====I shed light on this question by examining the role of letters of recommendation (LORs) in a selective campus's holistic admissions review process. I use natural language processing methods to measure the content of letters, and investigate whether letters submitted for students from different groups are distinctive (that is, whether the student's identity characteristics are reliably predicted by the letter content) and whether they improve or hurt those students’ relative chances of admission. In contrast to past work using artificial intelligence to assess qualitative components of college applications (e.g., Alvero et al., 2020, Alvero et al., 2021), I do not make assumptions about how application reviewers interpret information that may be correlated with student background, but use actual application scores to infer what the readers value.====My study draws on a pilot program implemented by University of California, Berkeley (UCB) in 2016–17. Importantly, UCB is officially committed to an equitable admissions process that does not provide unfair advantages for students from advantaged backgrounds. It has for many years used “holistic review,” whereby applicants are evaluated as a whole package without fixed weights for any particular admissions measures (Hout, 2005).==== Applications are read individually, and readers are instructed not to use mechanical rules and to look for evidence that students from less advantaged backgrounds can succeed. However, prior to the pilot I study, UCB had never solicited letters of recommendation as part of its admissions process. The explicit motivation for introducing LORs was to provide more information that could be used to identify students who had overcome disadvantages, and the letters may have been used differently than in other settings where that is less of a priority.====Even within the UCB context the move to use LORs was controversial. While some, including the university's leadership, believed that LORs could be used to identify more students from underrepresented groups who were prepared to succeed at Berkeley, others argued that they would have the opposite effect. They predicted that low-income and otherwise disadvantaged applicants would not have access to mentors who could write them strong letters, and that the effect of including this qualitative information would be to create barriers to the admission of underrepresented applicants.====The LOR pilot was designed to ask for letters only when they might be important to the decision because the applicant was otherwise marginal for admission. This created variation across students in the presence of letters. Ben-Michael, Feller, & Rothstein, 2021 study the effect of including LORs on admissions decisions at Berkeley, using matching strategies to identify comparable groups of students who did and did not submit letters. They find that the availability of letters improved application scores on average for both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, with the largest effects for students whose quantitative qualifications would have predicted modest probabilities of admission. The net effect was to slightly reduce the relative scores of students from underrepresented groups.====Here, I take advantage of a within-subjects experimental design that was built into the UCB pilot study to dig deeper into the roles that letters play. A subset of 10,000 applicants who had submitted letters was selected at random for inclusion in the experiment. These students’ applications were evaluated twice – once as intended under the LOR pilot, with the letters considered by application readers, and once by a separate set of readers who were not given access to the letters. By comparing the scores given by these separate sets of readers, I can measure the impact of the letters on the score at the individual applicant level.====For the students included in the within-subjects experiment, I obtained access to the letters themselves. Text was extracted from the letters, de-identified, and used to construct a number of “features” capturing the content of the letters. I measure the frequency of mentions of academic, athletic, community, and other topics, as well as the overall tone of the letter. I use these features to quantify differences in the types of letters written on behalf of different students and what the application review process in fact values in a student's letter.====My first question is whether letters written on behalf of underrepresented students are distinctive. My investigation is similar in spirit to that undertaken by Alvero et al. (2021), who show that essay content can be used to predict family income. I show that letters submitted on behalf of underrepresented applicants are indeed different from those submitted for their more advantaged peers. Controlling for the quantifiable elements of applications, I show that a one standard deviation increase in the “URM-ness” of an applicant's letters is associated with a 23 percentage point increase in the likelihood that the applicant is indeed from an URM group. For comparison, Alvero et al. (2020) find that the content of application essays can achieve 65% accuracy in classifying applicants as above or below median family income; Alvero et al. (2021) find that essay content explains about one-third more variation in family income than do SAT scores.====However, the distinctiveness of URM students’ letters is largely reflective of the fact that their applications are distinctive in many ways captured by traditional admissions criteria like GPAs and SAT scores. When I construct an index from these criteria to best predict URM status, a one standard deviation increase in this index is associated with a 31 percentage point increase in the probability of a URM student. Moreover, the index of traditional applications measures explains nearly ⅓ of the variation in the letter-based index. To isolate the information in the letters that is new, not merely duplicating what is already available, I construct an alternative index of letter features selected to add incremental predictive power to non-letter features of the application. This has much less predictive power – a one standard deviation increase in this index is associated with only a 5 percentage point increase in the URM share.====Second, I use the letter features, in combination with the reader scores from the experiment, to construct a measure of letter strength. Taking advantage of the fact that applications were read both with and without letters, I define a strong letter as one that yields a higher reader score when the application is read with the letters. I allow the data to speak to the relative importance of content, writing style, identity of the recommender, or other aspects of the letter for generating that score. I show that there is substantial variation in quantifiable aspects of letter strength – letters that I score one standard deviation above average are associated with a 5.7 percentage point increase in the likelihood that the reader who observes the letters will give the applicant a higher score than the reader who did not have the letters. However, the letter strength score values different aspects of the letter than those that are predictive of applicant characteristics; my index of letter strength is only weakly correlated (−0.16) with the letter's score for predicting the applicant's demographic group.====Third, I assess the distribution of letter strength among URM and non-URM applicants. Letters written for URM applicants are weaker, on average, than those written for non-URM applicants. About half of this reflects the fact that students who were rated as weaker by readers without access to letters tend to get weaker letters, and the URM applicant pool is weaker on non-letter dimensions than the non-URM pool. Even when I adjust flexibly for the strength of the application without letters, however, I find that URM students’ letters are slightly weaker, on average. The gap in letter strength predicts a 1.3 percentage point gap in the likelihood that the reader who sees the letters will assign a higher score than one who does not.====Finally, I investigate how the inclusion of letters affects application outcomes, and how this varies with URM status. Readers with access to the letters assign somewhat higher scores to URMs relative to non-URMs than would be predicted based on either non-letter application characteristics or the initial read scores. However, this URM benefit is lessened for applicants with the strongest letters, and increased for those with weaker letters. In other words, application readers seem to identify features in the letters that raise their evaluations for the average URM applicant, but within the URM pool they reward strong letters less than they do within the non-URM pool. One plausible interpretation is that the letters reveal information both about applicant strength and about applicant disadvantage; the readers reward both, but put less weight on the strength information for students who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds. I find evidence consistent with this, in that the URM-distinctiveness of the letters is associated with better application outcomes for URM applicants, but even controlling for this the strength of the letters has less effect on URM students’ outcomes.====My study relates to the long literature and policy debate regarding the use of quantitative measures in selective college admissions (see, e.g., Bastedo et al., 2018; Black, Denning, & Rothstein, 2021; Bleemer, 2021; Bowen & Bok, 1996; Hout, 2005; Karabel, 2005; Kurlaender et al., 2020; Lemann, 1995; Rothstein, 2004). It also relates to similar debates in other arenas, where policymakers must decide when and how to use subjective information in making consequential decisions. Employers decide who to hire, police decide who to arrest, judges and juries decide whether to convict, and real estate agents decide which houses to show, all based on human judgments, informed by a combination of measurable and unmeasurable factors. Concerns about the possibility that these judgments may introduce bias have been raised in discussions of hiring (Bendick & Nunes 2012; Bertrand & Mullainathan 2004; Biernat & Fuegen 2001; Madera et al., 2009; Schmader et al., 2007), police-citizen interactions (Correll et al., 2007; Gelman et al., 2007; Lai & Zhao 2010; Oliveira & Murphy 2015), and criminal sentencing (Glaser et al., 2015; Rachlinski et al., 2009; Weinberg & Nielsen 2012).====Understanding the role of bias in subjective decisions is difficult, as any given decision could reflect either bias or legitimate use of not easily quantifiable components of the information on which the decision maker relies. The police officer making an arrest decision may interpret the same information differently when it relates to a black or a white suspect, or may be seeing something real in his assessment of the suspect's body language, for example, that raises the (fairly assessed) likelihood of guilt.====The UC Berkeley LOR pilot study provides a unique opportunity to shed light on this issue because it allows me to quasi-experimentally vary the amount of information available to the subjective decisionmaker. Moreover, it takes place within a context where the explicit goal is to use the qualitative information in an unbiased way, to identify positive aspects of students’ applications that may not be apparent from other information. Thus, my results shed light on the potential to use qualitative information to increase fairness of review processes, but can be seen as an upper bound on what might be found in other processes where the goals and training are less clear.",Qualitative information in undergraduate admissions: A pilot study of letters of recommendation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000607,28 July 2022,2022,Research Article,61.0

This highlights the importance of studying the effects of school policies on students’ beliefs about their ability to learn and achieve. To this end, we examine the effects of accelerated math on students’ self-efficacy and growth mindset, using survey measures of these beliefs. We argue, based on economic theory, that effects on growth mindset should be considered as more important relative to those on self-efficacy. We examine the effects of accelerated math empirically using a difference-in-differences design and find negative effects on both belief measures. However, the effects on growth mindset are much smaller, and in some analyses indistinguishable from zero, although these effects are larger in magnitude for female students. In exploring potential mechanisms, we find accelerated math leads to a precipitous drop in math course grades, with no similar drop in math test performance. Our findings suggest that there may be negative effects of acceleration on important student beliefs, but these effects appear modest. Our work motivates further study of the information environment surrounding these students at the time of acceleration.","Many educators, researchers, and policymakers consider engaging more students in mathematics to be an important priority for American education (Rask, 2010; Shi, 2018; Grinis, 2019). America lags other comparable countries in math performance on major international assessments (DeSilver, 2017), and there is a long-standing concern that this hinders American international competitiveness (Balingit & Van Dam, 2019). Several educational policies have sought to respond to this concern, with three of the most important being changing the mathematics curriculum (e.g. Common Core State Standards), changing how the current curriculum is taught, and, perhaps the most straightforward, accelerating the current curriculum.====This paper is focused on this last policy, which has waxed and waned in popularity. In particular, we study this policy in a Californian school district. In the 2000s, California was a forerunner of the “algebra-for-all” movement, which sought to have more students learn algebra by eighth grade. Over this period, California experienced phenomenal growth in eighth grade algebra course-taking, which soared from 35% in 2003 to 65% in 2011 (Dougherty et al., 2015; Domina et al., 2016). But by 2013 this movement had subsided. Today, many Californian school districts offer high-performing students the option to take accelerated math sequences. These sequences often condense three or four years of math into two or three, providing participating students greater opportunities to access STEM fields which would be more difficult for them otherwise, due to the sequential nature of the math curriculum (Schneider et al., 1997).====While accelerated math courses provide students access to more difficult material, and are believed to increase math performance and long-run outcomes for the majority of treated students (Stevenson et al., 1994; Joensen & Nielsen, 2009; Long et al., 2012; Dougherty et al., 2015; Domina et al., 2016; Lafortune, 2018), much less is known about the effects this program has on student motivations and beliefs about learning. This is despite the importance of these effects for considering acceleration decisions. For instance, the California Mathematics Framework (California Department of Education, 2015) cautions that educators lean toward avoiding placing marginal students in accelerated courses. They write (page 6): “Decisions to accelerate students into the Common Core State Standards for higher mathematics before ninth grade should not be rushed. Premature placement of students into an accelerated pathway should be avoided at all costs. In order to ensure that students are developmentally ready for accelerated content, it is not recommended to compact the standards before grade seven.” The developmental effects of math acceleration on treated students could be large and important, since the transition into accelerated math occurs during early adolescence, when students are forming beliefs about themselves through social cues from their peers, teachers, and environment.====Particularly important to consider is the impact of acceleration on students’ beliefs about learning, such as their self-efficacy or growth mindset (Bandura, 1997; Dweck, 2007; Yeager et al., 2019), which tap into students’ beliefs about their abilities to perform and their belief that intelligence is malleable, respectively. As top performing students in the non-accelerated math class are moved to an environment where everyone in the class is also a top performing student, students may look to their peers, their grades, and the effort put into understanding the concepts, and begin to think they are not “innately good” at mathematics. This is despite these students learning more math in the accelerated program, as reflected in standardized test scores. On the other hand, exposure to resources, peers, and a curriculum more aligned with their abilities could lead to improvements in accelerated students’ beliefs about their ability to grow and advance academically. Moreover, the effects on beliefs could be different depending on student demographics, especially along the critical dimension of gender. In any case, these effects on beliefs could have consequences later for students’ academic choices as they continue their education in high school and college.====With this motivation, our study builds on the previous literature by examining math acceleration and the effects it has on students’ beliefs about their self-efficacy and growth mindset. Based on economic theory, we argue that growth mindset is in the long-run more relevant for student effort choices than self-efficacy. We examine empirically the effects of acceleration on measures of self-efficacy and growth mindset, using longitudinal repeated measure student data from a mid-sized urban Californian school district, and a difference-in-differences empirical design. Moreover, we explore whether the effects are different for male or female students, and whether the addition of GPA as a control attenuates the effects.====We find that beliefs about self-efficacy decline significantly upon entry into accelerated mathematics. We also find that growth mindset declines upon entry. However, the effects on growth mindset, while statistically significant, are much smaller than those on self-efficacy. In addition, in some specifications, the growth mindset effects are not significantly different from zero. Since we argue that the effects on growth mindset are more important than those on self-efficacy, our findings suggest that concerns about acute negative mindset effects of acceleration are unwarranted. Given the positive effects of acceleration on learning (when measured by test scores), we believe our results may be encouraging for advocates of expanded acceleration.====However, our relatively small overall effect estimates may mask important heterogeneity. Given the well-documented gender gap in STEM participation (Cimpian et al.t, 2020), and findings of gender heterogeneity in belief formation (Charness & Levin, 2005), heterogeneity of effects based on gender are particularly relevant. Consistent with this literature, we find that female students experience a bigger decline in self-efficacy than male students upon acceleration, and only female students experience a statistically significant decline in growth mindset.====Finally, despite what we argue are relatively small magnitudes, we indeed find statistically significant negative effects on growth mindset. This raises the question of what can be done to mitigate these effects. We find that math GPA declines substantially upon entry into the accelerated math track. Importantly, we find that math test scores relative to other students tend to rise upon entry (or at least stay constant, depending on specification), suggesting that this GPA decline does not reflect a reduction in average performance or learning. Moreover, controlling for GPA strongly attenuates the estimated effects of acceleration on student beliefs (although as we discuss, such an exercise suffers from important simultaneity concerns). These results suggest that policymakers might consider evaluating what signals the educational system sends to accelerated students, especially through math GPA. Better signals may help these students form more accurate beliefs about their learning.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2 by discussing contextual background and additional relevant literature. Section 3 introduces our data and measurement strategies. Section 4 presents graphical evidence in favor of our empirical strategy.

Utilizing data from the American Bar Association on class profiles, we use the value added with drift methodology to estimate the causal impact of attending a particular law school and then use a regression discontinuity methodology to estimate the difference in value added between T14 and non-T14 law schools that is attributable to T14 status. We find that T14 law schools confer no signaling effect on the Bar exam, which is graded blindly, but a substantial signaling effect on employment at “Big Law” firms with more than 250 attorneys, which pay some of the highest salaries in the law profession. The lowest-ranked T14 university increases the likelihood of Big Law employment by 30 percentage points (96%) more than the highest-ranked non-T14 university. This likely reflects asymmetric information in the labor market for lawyers, and thus graduating from a T14 law school serves as a signal of a lawyer’s ability.","The extent to which human capital accumulation and signaling play a role in the causal impact of education remains one of the most fundamental questions in the economics of education, as the answer to that question largely determines the optimal market structure and governmental policies for the educational system. Given that the per capita cost of postsecondary education exceeds that of primary and secondary education (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017, National Center for Education Statistics, 2018), determining the efficiency of our postsecondary education system is particularly important. Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2013) find that the earnings premium associated with a college degree has risen substantially in the past three decades, but whether investing in a postsecondary education system is efficient is determined by whether the education system imparts true, causal increases in human capital (Becker, 1962, Mincer, 1974) or whether educational attainment is a signal and the education system merely acts as a sorting mechanism for agents who have varying innate ability (Spence, 1973).====Many other studies have attempted to decompose the returns to education, as returns to both human capital accumulation and signaling value may simultaneously contribute to the causal effect of additional education. Despite the fact that identifying the exact contributions of human capital and signaling may be empirically unidentifiable when both have a causal effect (Huntington-Klein, 2021), prior studies have shown that there is some combination of a human capital and signaling effect in additional years of education (Kaymak, 2012, Lange, 2007) and college (Bingley et al., 2015, Fang, 2006). Research has also shown that there is substantial heterogeneity in the return to a bachelor’s degree, as different majors or institutions may provide a higher return than other majors or institutions due to differences of both human capital accumulation and signaling (Dale and Krueger, 2002, Hastings et al., 2013, Kirkeboen et al., 2016).====On the other hand, some studies rule out the presence of one of the two potential mechanisms. Lang and Kropp (1986) and Bedard (2001) show that differences in educational attainment in response to compulsory schooling or the supply of postsecondary education institutions are not consistent with the human capital model. Tyler, Murnane, and Willett (2000) provide evidence that the General Educational Development credential provides a signaling effect for some individuals, while Clark and Martorell (2014) show that a high school diploma confers no signaling value, and Eble and Hu (2016) show that an additional year of schooling, holding highest credential constant, provides very little labor market return. Given the scope and complexity of the United States education system, it is not surprising that different contexts, which involve differences in the prestige and rigor of the credential, the labor market awaiting those obtaining credentials, and the ability of firms to identify direct measures of human capital, will often result in different relative contributions of the human capital and signaling effects.====This paper studies the labor market returns to education in the context of attending an elite law school, and then estimates whether this return is driven by an increase in human capital accumulation or whether there is a signaling value to attending a selective group of universities that the law profession deems particularly prestigious. Specifically, we utilize the consistency of the top 14 places of U.S. News & World Report’s (USNWR) law school rankings to answer the following: do Top 14 ranked law schools add value (in terms of employment at a law firm larger than 250 attorneys and other labor-market outcomes) greater than implied by the increase in the human capital of their students (as measured by the percent who pass the Bar exam)?====In 1987, USNWR released its first ranking of accredited American law schools. Following a two-year hiatus, in 1990 USNWR started publishing law school rankings annually. Since the beginning of the annual rankings, the same fourteen schools==== have occupied the top positions in almost==== every year’s ranking, allowing them to be widely recognized as the most prestigious schools. Due to the consistency in the top 14 ranked positions, these schools have been informally named the Top 14 (or T14). This label, while not an official designation of USNWR, has become widely used, including in academic studies.==== These schools, being among the most coveted by prospective law students, are among the most selective in their admission criteria and essentially have their choice of students. The graduates of T14 universities go on to prestigious careers (large law firms and federal clerkships) at rates higher than most other schools==== and earn higher salaries on average====.====Figs. 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) plot the average percentage of students who pass the Bar exam, obtain employment at Big Law firms, and obtain federal clerkships against the USNWR rank of the school. For all outcomes, law schools with a USNWR rank closer to one have better outcomes. However, the percentage of students passing the Bar exam trends smoothly throughout the domain of USNWR rank, while the percentage of students employed at Big Law firms or obtaining federal clerkships change discontinuously at some ranks. While the discontinuity occurs at a very high (i.e. top three) rank for federal clerkships, the discontinuity for Big Law employment occurs noticeably at the cutoff between T14 and non-T14 universities.====It is unclear if the success of T14 alumni are due to the causal effect of attending a T14 university or whether the distribution of pre-law-school ability changes discontinuously between T14 and non-T14 graduates. In order to estimate the causal impact of attending a particular university, we estimate school value added on Bar passage and labor-market outcomes, such as Big Law placement, using the value added with drift methodology (Chetty, Friedman, & Rockoff, 2014). The value added with drift methodology uses a selection-on-observables, most notably undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score, approach to account for the fact that students do not randomly sort to law schools. The value-added methodology attributes any unexplained difference between the labor-market outcomes of graduating students and the predicted outcomes of those students based on observable pre-law-school characteristics to the causal impact of the school. We then utilize the fact that T14 status varies discontinuously across the threshold between the 14th- and 15th-ranked universities to estimate the causal difference in value added from the T14 designation using a regression discontinuity methodology.====Our results show that attending a law school with T14 status confers a substantial increase in the likelihood that a graduate will obtain a job at Big Law firm while providing little to no benefit in terms of likelihood of passing the Bar exam. We find that, on average, T14 law schools increase the likelihood that their graduates pass the Bar exam by 10 percentage points more than their non-T14 peers. However, this difference is driven almost entirely by differences in human capital accumulation between T14 schools and non-T14 schools both in theory, because the Bar exam is graded blindly, and in practice, because we find little to no discontinuous difference between the value added provided by the 14th-ranked school and the value added provided by the 15th-ranked school. For employment at Big Law firms, T14 law schools increase the likelihood of Big Law employment by 63 percentage points more than their non-T14 peers. We estimate that a large portion of this effect is due to the signaling==== effect of attending a T14 university, as the 14th-ranked law school increases the likelihood of Big Law employment by 30 percentage points more than the 15th-ranked law school. Given that only about 31% of students obtain employment at a Big Law firm, this represents a 96% increase in the likelihood of obtaining a Big Law offer if one attends a T14 university relative to a comparable non-T14 university.====These findings have various labor market implications. Law school applicants have a large incentive to attend T14 schools instead of similar non-T14 schools because of the substantial potential private benefit. This will likely increase the demand for T14 law schools. T14 law schools likely respond by increasing tuition, as the supply of law school admission slots is likely relatively inelastic in the short run. Big Law firms, on the other hand, appear to be operating inefficiently. Our results suggest that Big Law firms could hire lawyers of similar quality for lower wages if they recruited students at law schools ranked just outside of the T14. This in turn may decrease relative demand for T14 universities, which would put downward pressure on T14 tuition until the difference in tuition between T14 and non-T14 law schools roughly reflects the difference in human capital accumulation between those universities.====This paper contributes to various literatures on human capital, signaling, and the impacts of law school. Our findings provide additional evidence that signaling plays a large and important role in the return to education. Our study is unique in that we can measure the impact of a signal (T14 status) on an outcome (Bar passage) for which it is impossible for a signal to have an effect (due to anonymity) and then compare this to the effect of the signal on outcomes where signaling may play a role. Furthermore, because Bar passage is a ==== outcome (i.e. post-acquisition of the signal), Bar passage gives us some measure of the human capital of graduates after completing their law school education. While imperfect, in the fact that the skills required for Bar passage may be highly correlated with but not exactly identical to the skills necessary to succeed at a Big Law firm, our setting provides a placebo test that gives an indication as to what extent human capital may vary with the signal.====This paper also contributes to the literature estimating the returns to professional degrees (Hussey, 2012), the wage premium for law school quality (Ehrenberg, 1989, Oyer and Schaefer, 2019, Sander, 2004), and college quality more generally (Andrews et al., 2016, Anelli, 2020, Dale and Krueger, 2002, Ge et al., 2018, Hastings et al., 2013, Kurlaender et al., 2016, Zimmerman, 2019). We find that highly-ranked schools do in fact have a larger causal impact on labor-market outcomes than lower-ranked schools, but that the beliefs of employers account for much of the causal impact and only some of this impact can be attributed to the actual skills acquired while attending an elite university.",The signaling value of university rankings: Evidence from top 14 law schools,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000577,20 July 2022,2022,Research Article,63.0

However, attracting and retaining skilled people to the teaching profession is challenging. In this paper, we study how making college tuition-free affects the pool of students pursuing a teaching career. We exploit the conjunction of two tuition-financing policies implemented in Chile: a scholarship introduced in 2011 for teaching majors, and a massive 2016 reform that made college tuition-free for students from households in the bottom 50% of the income distribution. We use the programs’ differences in timing and eligibility criteria to study the effects free college had on the self-selection of students into teaching programs. We find that free college decreased the relative returns to pursuing a teaching career, making it substantially less popular among relatively poor high-performing students who now self-select into programs with higher returns. We find that the reform reduced the academic qualifications of the pool of students entering the teaching programs, which can negatively affect long-term teacher quality.","Teachers are a key input in the formation of early human capital. Effective teachers can create fruitful learning environments, inspire and motivate students, compensate for the lack of a favorable home environment, and help level the playing field for disadvantaged students. Research shows not only that teacher performance impacts student learning outcomes and academic achievement at all levels of education (Araujo et al., 2016, Bau and Das, 2019, Hanushek et al., 2018, Schacter and Thum, 2004), but that teachers’ effects on students are persistent (Konstantopoulos, 2011). Students who are assigned to high-quality teachers exhibit better long-term outcomes, such as a higher probability of attending college, and higher salaries (Chetty et al., 2014). Thus, attracting the best candidates to the teaching profession has become central to improving education systems. But, where and how to find the best teachers? There is convincing evidence that effective teachers were once among the best students in school (Alfonso et al., 2010, Glazerman et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2011).==== For this reason, in countries with highly successful education systems such as Finland, Singapore, and South Korea prospective teachers are selected from among top high school students (Auguste et al., 2010, Seng Tang, 2015). However, in most countries, universities still struggle to attract the best students to become teachers. Students who pursue teaching programs are disproportionately drawn from the lower end of the academic proficiency distribution (Balcázar and Ñopo, 2014, Eide et al., 2004, Hanushek and Pace, 1995, Santiago, 2002) and tend to perform lower on cognitive tests than students in other fields (Lang & Palacios, 2018).====To a large extent, the difficulty of attracting top students to the teaching profession can be explained by a combination of low expected labor market returns and low social recognition of the profession (Elacqua et al., 2018, OECD, 2018). For example, teachers are among the lowest-paid college graduates and are paid, on average, 20% less than similarly educated workers in OECD countries (OECD, 2017a).==== Moreover, recent international evidence shows that the net economic returns of teaching degrees are low on average (Espinoza and Urzua, 2016, Gonzalez-Velosa et al., 2015, Hastings et al., 2013), and that top students are significantly more likely to choose programs with higher economic returns, such as in STEM, business or law. As a result, several countries have implemented policies to make the teaching profession financially more appealing (Bruns and Luque, 2015, OECD, 2005). Such policies include raising teacher salaries, offering more attractive professional development opportunities, making dedicated financial aid available in the form of grants, scholarships or special allowances, among others (Ballou and Podgursky, 1995, Claro et al., 2013, Santiago, 2002).====At the same time, there have been increasing pressures to make higher education more affordable. In the US, for example, the idea of making universities tuition-free has been discussed and there are concrete plans for eliminating tuition fees in community colleges across the country. Both types of policies affect the relative return of university degrees and, ultimately, student choices (Bucarey, 2018). For this reason, to continue attracting top students to the teaching profession, it is important to understand the interplay between policies that incentivize qualified students to pursue teaching degrees and broader efforts to alleviate the financial burden of attending higher education.====In this paper, we study how tuition-free college affects the pool of students pursuing a teaching career. We exploit a major 2016 reform carried out in Chile that made college tuition-free for students from households in the lower 50% of the income distribution. We leverage the fact that the introduction of free college affected the application behavior of distinct groups of students depending on their eligibility to the ==== (BVP) tuition grant, a scholarship program introduced five years before, in 2011, that was successful in bringing high-quality students into teaching majors (Castro-Zarzur, 2018). The BVP granted full scholarships to students willing to enroll in teaching majors who scored in the top 30% of the college entrance exam. The subsequent introduction of the free-college policy equalized the relative prices of studying a wide range of different majors, potentially offsetting the incentives set out by the BVP.====Using difference-in-difference and triple-difference strategies on a rich administrative dataset containing test scores, student applications, and enrollment, we compare the application and enrollment behaviors of students in cohorts before and after the implementation of the tuition-free policy. Thus, we identify the causal effect of eliminating tuition fees on students’ preferences for teaching degrees and the extent to which it affected the academic qualifications of students pursuing a teaching career. Our results suggest that granting tuition-free access to college decreased top-performing students’ demand for teaching programs. The probability of applying to a teaching major among high-performing students who come from relatively poor backgrounds fell by about 15.8%, offsetting the gains obtained by the BVP scholarship during its first years of implementation. In consequence, students admitted to teaching degrees after the policy change have lower academic performance than those admitted before it, while the average performance of those admitted into other majors remained unchanged or even improved. The drop was concentrated on the relatively poor high school graduates whose scores fell by around 10% of a standard deviation.====Our paper provides important input to the ongoing international debate on free college by analyzing a potential unintended consequence of such policy. In particular, we find that even though free college may increase total welfare, the distortion of equilibrium prices can affect the sorting of students into different programs and reduce long-term teacher quality.====Our findings are likely to be informative even in contexts lacking previous ability-based scholarships, such as the BVP. Teaching majors tend to be the least costly in many countries—including the United States, where differential tuitions are being increasingly used. Hence, in the absence of tuition-free college, the relatively cheap teaching majors are a pathway to higher education for low-income students. As free college equalizes the tuition cost across all majors, high performers from poorer backgrounds can substitute programs that were relatively cheap with programs that were more expensive and provide better returns. In that sense, the BVP is just a vehicle for identification as it allows us to implement a difference-in-difference strategy while providing important insights on the potential impact of free college on self-selection into the teaching profession in more general settings like the US, where the college tuition-free policy is gaining momentum and several existing programs are already pushing in that direction (e.g., New Mexico state-wide free college policy and the Excelsior program in New York).====The paper is structured as follows.

We find that nearly 60% of parents hold inaccurate beliefs about their child's educational performance. Parental upward biased beliefs are positively associated with both financial and time investment in their children's education. The results for financial and time investment are mainly driven by paternal and maternal upward biased beliefs, respectively, reflecting differences in credit and time constraints on each parent. We find that parental educational expectations, confidence in their child's future and parenting style are underlying mechanisms through which parental misbeliefs affect household education investment. Our findings suggest that mistaken parental beliefs may have an important role to play in narrowing educational ====.","Household educational expenditure is one of the most important ways that parents can invest in their children's future. Most traditional models of human capital investment assume that parents have perfect information about their children when they make educational investment decisions. However, the existing literature suggests that parents have incomplete information when it comes to their child's school attendance, academic achievement and the amount of time that their children spend studying (Dizon-Ross, 2019). Findings from previous studies suggest that parents’ beliefs about their children's effort in school and school attendance are upward biased (Bergman, 2021; Robinson et al., 2018), while parents underestimate their children's educational performance and the productivity of investment (Barrera-Osorio et al., 2020; Jensen, 2010). Information friction between parents and their children is higher when parents come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and have low levels of human capital (Bergman, 2021; Robinson et al., 2018). Various factors have been shown to contribute to information friction, including poor parent-school communication, the simplicity of school report cards and misaligned incentives or strategic-information disclosure by children and schools (Barrera-Osorio et al., 2020). In addition, in China, the country in which our study is situated, parents’ mistaken beliefs about their child's performance may also stem from the prohibition on ranking students’ academic achievement at the nine-year compulsory education stage (Zhang & Bray, 2018).====The overarching research question that we seek to answer, which has not been addressed thus far in the literature, is the extent to which parental misbeliefs themselves affect household financial and time investment in their children's education. Subsidiary research questions that we consider are the channels through which this effect materialises and the extent to which parents can/do learn about their children and how this affects their relative financial and time investment in their children over time.====To answer our research question, we examine the association between parental misbeliefs about their child's educational performance and household human capital investment, consisting of both financial and time investment, in China, using the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS). We find that parents’ beliefs about their children's ability to succeed are upward biased and that this causes them to overinvest their financial and time resources in their children's education. We find that parents do update their investment strategies in their children's education over time and that as children approach critical screening exams that they may invest more time, relative to financial resources. We find considerable heterogeneity in the relationship, with the association being stronger for investment in girls, amongst better educated parents and for households in rural areas. We find that in-school expenditure is more sensitive to parental misbeliefs than out-of-school expenditure. The effects of upward biased beliefs on financial and time investment in their children's education are, respectively, driven by fathers and mothers, reflecting that fathers and mothers face different credit and time constraints on educational investment.====Our contribution helps fill several related elements of the literature on information friction in human capital investment. First, ours is the first study to examine how parents’ upward and downward biased beliefs affect household financial and time investment in their children's education and how this differs between mothers and fathers. Second, we focus on parents’ inaccurate beliefs about individual-level academic performance rather than misinformation about aggregate factors, such as average economic returns to education, school quality and knowledge of the health production function, which has been extensively examined in prior research (Andrabi et al., 2017; Fitzsimons et al., 2016). Third, we contribute to the literature on parental time investment decisions, which are known to be crucial for fostering a child's development. A variety of theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain individual differences in parental time spent with children (see Monna & Gauthier, 2008 for a review). We address the gap in understanding to what extent the decisions that parents make with respect to how they allocate time spent with their children are biased by parent-child information friction. Fourth, we offer evidence on how much parents learn and adjust their expenditure on their children's extra schooling over time and, in particular, in the lead up to major screening choices.====Fifth, we examine the potential channels through which parental misbeliefs could affect household-level educational investment in children. While a few studies have shown that information provision could enable parents to better compare the price and quality of education providers and to choose educational inputs that are more closely matched to their children's academic needs, there is limited research on the potential mechanisms through which parent-child asymmetric information affects educational investment by households. We find that parental expectations for educational achievement, confidence in their child's future and parenting style mediate the observed association between parents having inaccurate beliefs about their children and household investment in children's education.====Finally, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of household expenditure on children's education in a developing Asian country, in which educational attainment is highly valued. China has experienced a rapid increase in household education expenditure and especially in out-of-school education expenditure (Wang & Cheng, 2021). Our results offer an explanation for this phenomenon.",Parental misbeliefs and household investment in children's education,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000590,2 July 2022,2022,Research Article,65.0

We reproduce the results in a replication experiment and investigate mechanisms: The effects are not driven by above-average students reacting particularly well to feedback due to individual characteristics; rather, the information about being above average makes feedback effective. We present evidence that individuals focus on good news to adjust their beliefs, and that feedback can offset disadvantages faced by individuals who are held back by their own underestimation of relative abilities. Once beliefs between controls and the treated converge, repeated treatment does not add to the effects.","It has long been established that the behavior and performance of others can provide an important benchmark against which individuals can compare their performance and gauge their abilities (see, e.g., Bandura 1991, Corcoran et al. 2011, Festinger 1954, and Taylor et al. 1996). However, in many situations, the information necessary for comparison may be imprecise or incomplete, leaving individuals with no appropriate frame of reference. Under such conditions, providing feedback relative to a suitable peer group may facilitate social comparison, thereby enhancing decision-making, motivation, and ultimately performance.====An economically and socially important setting where feedback may improve outcomes is higher education. Students at the start of their university careers face new tasks which are complex and challenging, and they are surrounded by new peers, making it difficult to assess their relative abilities. Providing relative performance feedback early on could therefore present a low-cost and easily scalable tool for universities to help students improve their performance.====To test this, we implement a relative performance feedback intervention at one of the largest universities of applied sciences in Germany. After the first semester, control group students receive letters from the university, informing them about how many credit points they managed to obtain in the previous semester.==== Students in the treatment group receive the same information, but the letters also inform them about how well, in terms of credits, they performed relative to the average student and the student on the 80th percentile. To make individuals aware of what type of behavior is approved and to prevent potential boomerang effects, i.e., negative effects for high performers that are sometimes implied by social comparison theory, we draw from the social norms literature and add an approving normative message (==== or ==== plus an emoticon) for students who obtained at least the average amount of credits.====Our approach complements the few existing studies that consider the effects of relative feedback on the overall performance of students: While we send students postal letters that include relative feedback on their accumulated credits (i.e., quantity), Azmat et al. (2019) and Cabrera and Cid (2017) supply students with information regarding the quality of their study progress by giving access to their relative grade point average (GPA) via the universities’ online services and find null or negative effects on performance. Dobrescu et al. (2021) give feedback on inputs: they provide real-time ranks during a semester-long online assignment and show that this improves exam performance in the intervention course and generates positive spillovers to other courses.====The initial implementation of our feedback intervention has a positive, but statistically insignificant treatment effect on subsequent performance in the full sample. Based on the design of the feedback, we explore heterogeneous responses. Students whom the feedback informs that they have performed above average in the first semester increase their performance by a statistically significant 2 credits points (==== standard deviations) in the second semester, relative to controls. For students at or below the average we do not find effects on behavior.====These results thus give rise to the hypothesis that above-average feedback enhances performance. We test this hypothesis with a replication experiment one year later with a new cohort of students and reproduce the full pattern of results. Most importantly, we replicate the result that above-average feedback significantly increases performance (1.6 credit points or ==== standard deviations). Across both experiments the effects are roughly equivalent to one third of an additional passed exam and correspond to an effect size of ==== standard deviations.====While our interventions target credits, we also show that those who benefit from the feedback on credit points maintain the same GPA as the individuals in the control group. This shows that the increase in earned credits can be interpreted as a net performance gain, as students do not buy gains on the (treated) credit points dimension with losses on the grade dimension. In light of research showing that performance incentives on one domain can lead to negative effects on other domains (Altmann et al., 2021, Eriksson et al., 2009), this result is not self-evident. In addition, we also survey students on potential negative side effects of the intervention on their well-being, as for example Celik Katreniak (2018) shows that stronger incentives can come at the cost of increased stress and reduced happiness. We find no such evidence: treated students are no different from controls in any of the well-being domains we observe.====We investigate potential mechanisms behind this causal reaction to above-average feedback: Employing a regression discontinuity design (RDD) based on the sharp cutoff at the average allows us to assess the causal effect of being informed about an above-average performance versus being informed about an average or below-average performance. Receiving above-average feedback increases subsequent performance by about six credits in comparison to receiving another type of feedback. This indicates that it is the information about being above average itself and not any differences in underlying characteristics (ability, motivation, learning technology, etc.) that leads to the increase in performance.====In the replication experiment, we further explore mechanisms by analyzing the role of pre- and post-treatment expectations about relative performance. We find that students have inaccurate expectations about their relative performance pre-treatment and that students who receive above-average feedback subsequently update their beliefs. In the absence of treatment, those whose beliefs underestimate their actual relative performance obtain fewer credits. Feedback is able to offset this disadvantage associated with inaccurate beliefs. There is no evidence of updating for students at or below the average. We argue that the pattern of effects and the evidence that students selectively process feedback is consistent with theories on the management of self-confidence (see, e.g., Bénabou and Tirole 2002).====Finally, we show that repeated treatment in the third semester does not elicit additional performance gains. One reason may be that in the third semester, beliefs about relative performance held by the controls are almost as accurate as those of the treatment group.====Overall, our results show that providing relative performance feedback is beneficial for a large share of individuals entering university. When beliefs are inaccurate and the feedback is encouraging, performance can increase even in complex and challenging tasks such as passing exams in higher education. At the same time, the intervention is also inexpensive at a total cost of less than €2.5 per student and semester (see Table A.11). The results also highlight that feedback schemes can have distributional implications. While the effects may be considered pareto-improving (no negative effects), it is mostly students in the upper middle of the performance distribution who profit. The intervention may thus decrease performance equality in the education system. Inequality-averse policy-makers should take this into account and be aware that for the most precarious students, making their shortcomings salient via feedback may not generate any effects.",Relative performance feedback and the effects of being above average — field experiment and replication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000449,2 June 2022,2022,Research Article,66.0

We find that this initiative led to meaningful increases in primary-school enrollment (i.e., a 4.0 percent increase), and the improvements were sustained in the months after the program concluded.","The informed oversight of citizens can promote effective governance of their local public services by mitigating the moral hazard that can exist in the presence of information asymmetry and a divergence between the goals of individuals operating government agencies and the public interest (Azfar et al., 1999; Mansuri and Rao, 2012). That is, informed civic engagement can support accountability of public sector workers, tailor public services to the unique needs of particular communities, improve poverty targeting, and, in general, increase the demand for good governance. A growing body of empirical evidence, however, suggests that the manner in which citizens are given information and the opportunities to participate in the delivery of public services, influences the impact of civic engagement on the quality of local governance (Banerjee et al., 2010; Björkman and Svensson, 2009; Blimpo et al., 2015; Casey, 2018; Duflo et al., 2015; Mbiti, 2016; Olken, 2007; Pradhan et al., 2014).====Our paper contributes to the literature on strengthening local governance to improve public service delivery in developing countries by studying a novel and low-cost intervention. Specifically, we examine the School Council Mobilization Program (SCMP), a unique program piloted in five out of thirty-six districts in Pakistan's largest province, Punjab. The SCMP focused on providing sustained and targeted guidance to school council (SC) members (i.e., parents, community members, the head-teacher) on their civic responsibilities through regular, low-cost engagement over mobile phones. The provincial government hired a call center for 17 months and every month, calling agents provided information to SC members on their roles and responsibilities. These design features (i.e., a one-to-one, low-cost and sustained engagement mechanism between the provincial government and the SCs to encourage citizen participation in improving school governance) have not, to our knowledge, been evaluated in local governance settings. Moreover, Pakistan provides a unique cultural and political setting to evaluate this impact where public services are under-provided, and often misappropriated.====We use school-level administrative data for 26 districts in Punjab, five of which were exposed to the SCMP, collected regularly by the Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) of the School Education Department. The school-level data are available for each of 17 months. The earliest observations (i.e., 5 monthly observations) consist of school-level data from the months just prior to the implementation of the SCMP. The next period corresponds to a time-period when the SCMP was actively engaging SC members in the field (8 months) and the last period provides us data in the months shortly after SCMP activity had concluded (4 months). Schools are segregated by sex in Pakistan. Within the five program districts, only primary and middle schools were chosen for the SCMP. The eligibility criteria, whereby only schools with median or higher enrollment within each district-by-level-by-sex cell were intended to participate, informs our quasi-experimental research design. We leverage the existence of school-by-period panel data across districts with and without the intervention in a “difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) design.====Specifically, we identify schools as having an intent-to-treat based on a 3-way interaction (i.e., being in a treatment district in a post-treatment period and having above-median baseline enrollment). Our DDD specifications condition on unrestrictive fixed effects for each 2-way interaction between districts fixed effects, time fixed effects, and a fixed effect for being in the treatment-eligible group (i.e., above-median enrollment). We complement this analysis with the supporting evidence from event-study specifications. We also examine semi-dynamic specifications that allow the impact of the SCMP to vary over time and consider treatment heterogeneity by school (i.e., primary or middle, girls or boys).==== While our core findings focus on the impact of program eligibility on the outcome measures (i.e., reduced-form or intent-to-treat estimates), we also discuss the impact of program eligibility on program participation both to demonstrate that the intent-to-treat created a treatment-control contrast, and to facilitate scaling the reduced-form estimates into “treatment-on-treated” estimates of the impact of program participation.====We find that SCMP eligibility increased student enrollment by 2.3 percent. With a take-up rate of 58 percent, we find that SCMP participation increased student enrollment by 4.0 percent (i.e., .023/0.58). The estimates suggest that the gains in school enrollment are meaningfully sized relative to the comparatively low-cost of the intervention (i.e., USD 50 per school for a yearlong engagement). Additionally, we find that the SCMP eligibility reduced student attendance modestly (i.e., 0.58 percentage points) and there was no statistically significant effect on teacher attendance.====We also find that the effects of SCMP eligibility on student enrollment grew in magnitude over time (i.e., in the months after the program ended), while student attendance fell sharply in the months after the program ended. These results suggest the challenge of sustaining attendance among the marginal enrollees or that there could be fade-out once the program ended (i.e., students may remain officially enrolled, but stop attending). Interestingly, the impacts of SCMP were statistically significant for primary schools only, where the increase in enrollment was the highest for female primary schools (i.e., girls aged 5-12) and the decrease in attendance was driven by boys’ primary schools (i.e., boys aged 5-12). Specifically, we find that SCMP eligibility increased the enrollment of young girls by 6.5 percent. The treatment-on-treated estimates imply that SCMP participation increased the enrollment among girls by more than 12 percent (i.e., roughly 14 additional enrollees per school). On the other hand, attendance in boys’ schools fell, albeit modestly, by 1.5 percentage points. Together the dynamic and heterogenous effects of the SCMP by school level and sex, and relatively low-cost of the intervention indicate that a more permanent change may need a longer and sustained effort with school councils.====Overall, our results suggest that the engagement mechanism informed council members and encouraged them to participate in school governance that improved school enrollment, especially for young girls. We speculate that continuous engagement with calling agents, who were of the same sex as the members, and the fact that it was spearheaded by the provincial government, assisted their engagement and added credibility to the calls. Moreover, we think that members, either through passive oversight, or proactive engagement and monitoring of the school were able to impact outcomes directly targeted through the SCMP calls in their community's schools. Our results also provide broader evidence on improving public services through proactive citizen participation in low-cost and highly scalable ways (e.g., compared to in-person training) via continuous engagement mechanisms between the state and its citizens.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section two provides a discussion on the theoretical framework and prior literature, section three describes the School Council Mobilization Program, section four and five include a description of the data and identification strategies respectively.

While tuition regulations lower sticker prices, colleges recoup losses by lowering financial aid or rapidly increasing tuition after regulations end. At four-year colleges, regulations lower sticker price by 6.3 percentage points while simultaneously reducing aid by nearly twice as much (11.3 percentage points). At two-year colleges, while regulations lower tuition by 9.3 percentage points, the effect disappears within three years of the end of the regulation. Changes in net tuition vary widely; focusing on four-year colleges, while some students receive discounts up to 5.9 percentage points, others pay 3.8 percentage points more than they would have without these regulations. Students who receive financial aid, enter college right after the regulation is lifted, or attend colleges that are more dependent on tuition benefit less.","In the face of concerns about college affordability, tuition freezes and caps are gaining popularity as a policy tool for state governments to regulate public colleges. They are a rare set of policies that often receive bipartisan support. Both parties frame freezes and caps as beneficial for state residents, who will be enabled to affordably obtain a college education.====A tuition freeze or cap occurs when a state government sets limits on the amount that public colleges are allowed to raise listed tuition (i.e. “sticker price”) from year to year. Typically, a “freeze” occurs when colleges are banned from raising nominal tuition at all. However, states will frequently impose limits on the percent that colleges are allowed to increase tuition (e.g. 3 percent/year), rather than fully freezing tuition. From 1990 to 2013, seventeen states implemented a tuition freeze or cap at least once, affecting 2–3 percent of institutions and 7–8 percent of students each year (Deming & Walters, 2017). These tuition regulations typically only affect the in-state undergraduate tuition level.====Under an effectively enforced tuition regulation, colleges should not be able to increase listed tuition by a large amount. However, at the same time, they may search for other ways to compensate for their tuition losses. Such responses, in turn, can yield different results from what the state government intended by imposing a tuition regulation. Previous studies have found that colleges adjust various margins in response to different financial shocks  (Bound et al., 2020, Clelan and Kofoed, 2017, Delaney and Kearney, 2015, Delaney and Kearney, 2016, Deming and Walters, 2017, Dinerstein et al., 2014, Webber, 2017), and which margin(s) colleges use under a tuition regulation is ==== ambiguous; they could decrease financial aid, hike up tuition once the regulation is lifted, or adjust other margins such as the composition of students by residency. Notably, depending on which margin universities adjust, tuition regulations could have different distributional implications.====Despite the prevalence of these policies and the ==== ambiguity in their effects, there has been little empirical evidence about the consequences of these tuition regulations. These effects are of direct interest to policy-makers considering these regulations, as well as to students and their families who may be subject to them.====Using a modified event study framework, we begin by estimating the effect of tuition freezes and caps on listed tuition to assess whether the regulations have any “bite”. We find large heterogeneity in their effectiveness over time; tuition regulations had large and statistically significant effects that kept listed tuition from increasing in 2013 and earlier, but they have had no detectable effects from 2014 to 2019. We show that this is driven by a slowdown of tuition increases in recent years; in 2013 and earlier, institutions that were not under tuition regulations raised tuition by 6.3 percent from one year to another, while the annual increase for these non-regulated institutions was 3.1 percent post 2014. This implies that colleges under tuition regulations are facing meaningful losses in tuition revenue in 2013 and earlier, but not in 2014 and later. Therefore, we expect to see colleges adjusting other margins such as institutional aid only in the earlier period, so we focus our analysis of outcomes other than listed tuition to the years before 2013.====Focusing on the earlier period, our primary finding is that although tuition caps and freezes reduce increases in “sticker price” tuition, they simultaneously induce universities to reduce increases in institutional financial aid, sometimes by a greater degree. This leads to an unintended consequence that when institutional aid is need-based, net benefit from a tuition regulation can be concentrated among richer students who do not receive institutional aid rather than needy students who do receive institutional aid. Dynamic changes in listed tuition and institutional aid over time have additional distributional impacts across cohorts, with some cohorts paying relatively higher tuition. Putting our results from the two periods together, our findings show that either these tuition regulations do not obtain their first-order goal of lowering listed tuition, or when they do, they simultaneously result in unintended distributional effects.====Specifically, we estimate that for four-year institutions, across all years a regulation is in place, the average yearly effect of a tuition regulation on listed tuition is −6.3 percentage points. To be precise, this means that listed tuition is 6.3 percentage points lower than it would have been in the absence of a regulation, and does not necessarily mean that tuition falls from year to year. All following effects should be interpreted in the same way. The corresponding impact on institutional aid is −11.3 percentage points. Two years after the end of the cap/freeze, listed tuition is 7.3 percentage points lower than it would have been if the regulation had never been in place while institutional financial aid is 19.5 percentage points lower. At two-year institutions, where the role of institutional aid is limited, colleges instead respond by rapidly increasing tuition once the cap/freeze has been lifted. During the regulation the impact on listed tuition is −9.3 percentage points; three years later it is only −4.8 percentage points and not statistically different from zero.====We probe for further heterogeneity in the four-year sector by estimating differential impacts by institution type. We find that institutions that are more dependent on tuition revenue lower financial aid more, and more quickly increase listed tuition after the regulation has been lifted. Similarly, we find that non-research universities adjust institutional aid by more than research universities.==== These results imply that colleges with less monetary resources apart from tuition make larger adjustments to other margins in response to tuition regulations.====These responses from colleges imply that tuition caps and freezes have differential impacts on various groups of students. To give a sense of how this heterogeneity affects students moving through their education during and after a tuition regulation, we use our estimates to simulate the difference in net tuition paid from students’ points of view. We consider students who vary in terms of (1) whether they receive institutional aid, (2) which type of institution they enroll in, and (3) when they first enroll with respect to the timing of the regulation. Our results imply that states that implement a uniform regulation on all colleges within the state may be creating inequalities in the way the regulation is felt by various students. Depending on the type of student we consider, our estimates range from a student receiving a 5.9 percent discount to having to pay 3.8 percent more over four years of college due to the regulation.====While we focus on the effects on tuition and net tuition, we also extensively investigate effects on other outcomes such as room and board charges, instructional expenditure and the composition of students by residency and academic preparedness. We do not find any of them to be as important as adjustments in institutional aid, although we do find suggestive evidence that instruction-related expenditures per student are 3.3 percentage points lower under tuition regulations. These null results on other margins could be attributed to the fact that colleges are restricted in the changes they can make. For example, universities cannot pool revenue from different sources when some part of the revenue is earmarked to pay for certain expenses by their budgeting practice or outside entities (Blagg et al., 2017, Kelchen, 2016). In 2010, 21% and 38% of total revenue of four-year and two-year institutions was restricted to be used for certain expenses.==== Such restrictions can reduce incentives for increasing room and board prices, for instance, when universities cannot shift the revenue to expenses sourced by tuition revenue.====Our paper fits into a literature investigating how colleges respond to financial shocks. Previous papers have studied implications of changes in state funding (Bound et al., 2020, Fethke, 2005, Webber, 2017) or federal funding (Dinerstein et al., 2014, Singell Jr and Stone, 2007). Among various outcomes, changes in listed tuition are often found to be the main channel through which universities adjust to financial shocks. For example, Webber (2017) finds that decreases in state funding are partially passed on to students through increases in tuition. He finds that on average between 1987 and 2014, students bear 25.7 percent of the financial burden from state funding changes. Similarly, Dinerstein et al. (2014) find that in response to the expansion of federal Pell grants during the Great Recession, public colleges raised tuition to fully capture the increase.====We study a different type of shock on colleges’ revenue: tuition regulations. Tuition has been becoming a increasing share of universities’ revenue due to steady decreases in state funding in recent decades. Standing in contrast to other shocks, universities cannot adjust listed tuition to recoup the loss from the shock, by design of the regulation. We find institutional aid to be the most important margin that institutions adjust. While changes in tuition mostly yield distributional consequences from one cohort to another, changes in institutional aid can further result in an unequal distribution of benefits within each cohort.====Several papers have documented that universities often adjust institutional aid to capture additional revenue. Clelan and Kofoed (2017) find that institutional aid decreases during recessions. Turner (2017) shows that institutional aid is crowded out by federal Pell grants, with universities giving less institutional aid to students with higher Pell grants. In contrast to these papers that study a targeted policy (Pell grants) and a non-policy shock, we study a policy that is seemingly universal, at least among in-state undergraduate students. However, we show that even though tuition regulations are applied equally to all students paying in-state tuition, they can have different impacts across students because of institutions’ responses of decreasing institutional aid.====Our paper also aligns with the small set of papers that focus on the tuition regulations specifically. Delaney and Kearney, 2015, Delaney and Kearney, 2016 study impacts of the Illinois 2004 “Truth in Tuition” law, which requires flat tuition rates for 4 years for each cohort of students. They find that colleges increase tuition before cohorts enter in anticipation of not being able to increase it later. We use policy variation from all states in the US over the longer period (1990–2019) and find no anticipatory behavior but a statistically significant and economically meaningful response of changes in institutional aid in the first two decades. Relatedly, Deming and Walters (2017) exploit tuition freezes and caps in their analysis of whether increasing expenditures or lowering tuition is more effective in increasing enrollment and graduation at public colleges. They find a strong “first stage” effect of tuition caps/freezes on listed tuition; our results support this while adding the finding that the decrease in listed tuition is accompanied by decreases in institutional aid. This may be key to explaining the Deming and Walters (2017) finding that lower tuition (instrumented with tuition freezes) does not have a strong effect on total enrollment or graduation rates. We also add to this literature by examining heterogeneity in the type of regulation (i.e., cap or freeze and length of regulation) and university characteristics. Finally, we illustrate how this heterogeneity affects different types of students based on their timing of entry into college, the type of institution they attend, and whether they receive institutional financial aid.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional background and the data sets for our analyses, Section 3 lays out a conceptual framework to frame empirical results, Section 4 describes our empirical strategy and identification, Section 5 presents results, Section 6 illustrates the impact of a tuition regulation on a representative student by putting estimates together, and Section 7 concludes.",Making college affordable?

Determining which factors are affecting them is crucial to avoid negative consequences. This paper identifies the causal relationship between education and traditional gender role attitudes. I use data from the European Social Survey for 14 European countries, along with a quasi-experimental approach that exploits exogenous variation in compulsory schooling across countries and year of birth. I find that for women from a poor family background, education reduces the probability of agreeing with traditional gender norms in more than 11 percentage points.","Traditional gender role attitudes, which are still prevalent today, may have negative implications for the economy as a whole. If a majority of the population thinks that women should stay at home, this may result in a low participation of women in the labor market.==== The loss of this talent could have a negative effect on growth. There is evidence showing that countries in which women participate little in the labor market grow less.==== According to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), gender inequality has a strong negative impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in Europe. In particular, higher levels of gender equality could increase GDP per capita up to 9.6% (3.15 trillion of euros) in 2050.====The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 indicates that, although gender equality has improved in the last few years, gender inequality in both economic participation and political empowerment remains very high (World Economic Forum, 2017). The traditional stereotype of women is still prevalent in Europe. According to the Gender Equality Eurobarometer 2017, about 44% of Europeans think that the most important role of a woman is to take care of her home and family. Moreover, data from the European Social Survey 2002-2010 show that about 47% of Europeans think that women have to be prepared to leave the job market to take care of the family and about 23% think that men should have more right to a job than a woman. There are also big differences across countries. While in some countries of Eastern Europe these percentages reach 70% and 50%, respectively, they are much smaller in the Nordic countries (below 30%).====This paper examines the causal effect of education on traditional gender role attitudes. I study to what extent education explains people's opinions about the role women should play in society. If indeed education plays a role, educational policies could be implemented to reduce social prejudice. Several explanations have been put forward to explain traditional gender role attitudes. Alesina et al. (2013) find evidence that gender roles have their origins in the traditional agricultural practices. In addition, religion (Algan & Cahuc, 2006; Guiso et al., 2003), parental education (Vella, 1994) and intergenerational transmission (Dhar et al., 2018; Farré & Vella, 2013) have been found to be explaining gender norms. Moreover, there is an association between education and gender-role attitudes (Fan et al., 2000; Thornton & Freedman, 1979). However, as far as I know, it still has not been studied which is the causal effect of education on gender norms.====To identify whether the correlation between education and other variables can be interpreted as a causal effect is not trivial because of the potential endogeneity of education. Numerous studies have dealt with this issue using schooling reforms. Most of them find that changes in compulsory schooling laws (CSL) are a valid instrument for education, using different reforms for both US and European countries (see Lochner, 2011 for a literature review).====I use data from the European Social Survey (rounds 2, 4 and 5) for 14 European countries. I exploit changes in CSL, that vary across countries and year of birth, to deal with the potential endogeneity of education. Specifically, I use exposure to CSL as an instrument for the number of completed years of full-time education. To measure traditional gender-role attitudes, I use the degree of conformity with the following two statements: ==== and ====. I find that these traditional gender norms are correlated with several socio-economic indicators at the country level. In particular, countries with a greater percentage of people agreeing with these two statements present lower women's employment rates, lower women's labor force participation rate, lower percentage of women responsible for supervising other employees and greater inequality between women and men. Thus, this kind of questions seem to capture specific cultural traits and, because of the strong correlation with gender inequality indices, they can be considered as proxies for women's empowerment. Then, this study also contributes to the education literature that studies the relationship between education and women's empowerment, including, among others, research on the effect of education on domestic violence (Erten & Keskin, 2018), fertility (Ali & Gurmu, 2018; Cygan-Rehm & Maeder, 2013; Fort et al., 2016), girl child marriage (Paul, 2019), and women labor force participation (see Heath & Jayachandran, 2016 for a summary).====Determining which factors are shaping gender social norms is crucial to avoid unwanted consequences. There is a large body of evidence supporting that gender social norms affect several relevant socioeconomic factors as well as the gender gaps in some outcomes. Fortin (2005) finds that traditional views are associated with a reduction in women's employment rates. In this regard, Jayachandran (2019) discusses how specific gender social norms affect women's employment. Bertrand et al. (2015) find that the social norm ==== has negative consequences on marriage formation, women's labor supply and division of home production, among others. According to Fernandez & Fogli (2006, 2009), when the cultural background is based on the traditional role of the women, it decreases women labor force participation and increases fertility. Blau et al. (2013) comes to similar conclusions. Additionally, he finds that intergenerational transmission of gender norms has an effect on education. Regarding gender gaps, traditional gender role attitudes are contributing to gender gaps in test scores (Pope & Sydnor, 2010) and gender wage gaps (Fortin, 2005). In addition, cultural factors like gender social norms have been found to be predictors of cross-country gender wage gaps (Antecol, 2000), the gender gap in labor force participation rates (Antecol, 2001), and the gender gap in smoking behavior (Rodríguez-Planas & Sanz-de-Galdeano, 2019).====Analyzing gender norms, attitudes or beliefs could be a way to capture identity. Identity, understood as the feeling of belonging to a group, plays an important role in explaining economic outcomes (Akerlof & Kranton, 2000) as well as social preferences (Chen & Xin Li, 2009). In addition, there is evidence for its intergenerational transmission (Phyllis et al., 1997; Olivetti et al., 2016). Then, given the effect of gender role attitudes and certain economic outcomes, along with its transmission through different generations, it becomes essential to understand which factors are shaping such gender norms.====This work finds that education reforms increase years of education, but only for individuals from a low educated family, in particular women. This is not surprising, since this group is precisely the objective of most of the reforms. For men and women from a highly educated family, the instrument has no power enough to identify the effect of education, in case it exists. Results indicate that, for women from low educated families, education has a strong causal effect on gender-role attitudes. In particular, one additional year of full-time education decreases the probability of agreeing with the statement “men should have more right to a job than a woman” by more than 11 percentage points. In addition, when using alternative specifications, I find that education also reduces the probability of agreeing with the statement “a woman should be prepared to cut down on her paid work for sake of her family” in 13 percentage points and 9 percentage points for both women and men, respectively.====There are several potential explanations behind the mechanism through which education affects gender-role attitudes. First, education could change the way individuals think by promoting more tolerant views toward women and minorities. To check this hypothesis, I remove from the sample those individuals who attended school under a conservative regime (Spain and Portugal). The reason is that the objective of education in these countries was to train women to take care of the family and home. When I estimate the model without these countries, the effect on the probability of agreeing with the statement that men should have more right to a job than a woman is bigger (13 percentage points). There is also a significant reduction of a similar size on the probability of agreeing with the statement that women should leave the labor market to take care of the family. Thus, it seems that not only the quantity of education is important, but also quality matters. A possible second mechanism is that education increases economic opportunities for women since more educated people have a higher probability of finding a better job with better wages and labor conditions. Therefore, women would have the possibility to access better jobs and then, change their opinions toward the role women should play in society. This is consistent with my findings that older women, who have less education and work less than younger women, are more likely to agree with the traditional role of women. It also seems that their job opportunities are also different from those of the younger ones, since a greater proportion of them have jobs that require only low skills.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data used in this analysis. Section 3 shows the empirical model. Section 4 contains the results. Section 5 includes some robustness checks. Section 6 considers alternative gender norms outcomes. Section 7 discusses the mechanisms through which education could affect gender-role attitudes.

For instance, females typically mature earlier (Lim et al., 2013). They tend to have stronger verbal skills (Baron-Cohen, 2007; Kimura, 2000) and these skills are particularly valuable for later educational attainment (Aucejo & James, 2019). Findings also highlight a female advantage in non-cognitive skills that contributes to the gender test score gap that advantages females (Christopher et al., 2013; Duckworth & Seligman, 2006; Golsteyn & Schils, 2014; Jacob, 2002). Differentials in parental investments in favour of daughters in early childhood provide another potential explanation for girls’ better educational outcomes (Baker & Milligan, 2016; Kaushal & Muchomba, 2018; Lundberg et al., 2007).====Delaney and Devereux (2021) note several other potential factors contributing to educational gender gaps that include: assessment methods (Baldiga, 2014; Iriberri & Rey-Biel, 2021); teacher's gender bias in grading (Carlana, 2019; Lavy & Sand, 2018); peers or school environment effects (Booth et al., 2018; Dustmann et al., 2018); differences in risk preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009; Marianne, 2011; Saygin & Atwater, 2021); gendered differences in sleep cycles (Lusher & Yasenov, 2018), and gender disparity in performance under competitive pressure (De Paola & Gioia, 2016).====The extant literature demonstrates that time investments by parents and their children are prime factors that foster child development (Del Boca et al., 2017; Fiorini & Keane, 2014; Lee & Seshadri, 2019). Largely absent in this literature though, is a focus on how children themselves invest their own time in activities that prompt, facilitate or constrain subsequent academic performance differentially in males and females. This paper contributes by investigating the likely role of children's time investment (Heckman & Mosso 2014).==== We build on this literature to explore two primary research questions (i) How do males and females allocate their time during childhood and adolescence? and (ii) To what extent do gender differences in their time investments explain the gender gaps in their cognitive and non-cognitive skills?====We bring to these questions rich panel time-use diaries representing two cohorts of Australian children in their first 16 years of life to provide the most comprehensive picture to date on the relative time allocations of males and females in a contemporary Western setting. Our study yields three main findings. First, as compared to males, females allocate more time to personal care, chores and educational activities and less of their time to physical and media related activities. Moreover, these gender differences in time allocation appear first at very young ages and then widen as children age.====Second, and more importantly, we provide new evidence that gender differentials in time investment are quantitatively important in explaining the gender gaps observed in cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Specifically, gender differentials in time investment, especially in educational activities outside of school, favour females and explain up to 15% of the overall gender test score gap. Our results further reveal that the contribution of gender differences in time allocation is more pronounced for higher performing students. We also uncover that gender disparity in time allocation, particularly to time spent on media activities, favours non-cognitive skills in females, contributing up to 3% towards the gender gap. Third, the results additionally suggest that as children grow older, gender differences in time allocation play an increasing role in explaining the gender gap in cognitive and non-cognitive skills.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes our data and Section 3 presents gender differences in time allocation from birth to mid adolescence. Section 4 attempts to quantify the contribution of gender differences in time allocation to the gender gaps in cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

The UNESCO Institute for Statistics reports in its Women in Science project that women worldwide represent only 29% of researchers.==== In the private sector, the Grant Thornton International Business Report 2016 notes that women hold only a quarter of senior roles and that a third of businesses do not have any women in senior management. The Interparliamentary Union notes that women account for 24% of parliamentary seats worldwide.==== This underrepresentation is a cause for concern because recent research has found that diversity matters. First, diversity in these different areas leads to better performance of societies and firms, and among peers.==== Second, women favor different policies than men when they have access to political power.==== Finally, the presence of women in more diverse settings provides role models for women to enter a wider range of occupations or perform better in workplaces.==== Allowing women to enter both academia and positions of power in the public and private sector is thus crucial to moving gender equality forward.====A common argument for narrowing the gap in representation (or fixing the leaky pipeline) is that women at the top will promote women at the bottom and increase their salaries. However, research on that hypothesis is inconclusive. Some literature has found that women in positions of power, such as on corporate boards or evaluation committees, promote other women (see, for example, De Paola and Scoppa 2015; Ehrenberg et al., 2012; Kunze and Miller, 2017; Kurtulus and Tomaskovic-Devey, 2012; Sheltzer and Smith, 2014). However, other research has found no effect, or even negative effects (Bagues and Esteve-Volart, 2010; Bagues, Sylos-Labini, and Zinovyeva, 2017). Finally, some research finds that the effect of female representation at the top depends on the hierarchy of their lower-ranking colleagues (Abendroth et al. 2016; Shin, 2012; and Stainback and Kwon, 2012).====In this paper, we contribute to this literature with a study of the role of female evaluators in the assessment of applications for graduate school fellowships from the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Mexican equivalent of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). We would like to know if there is gender bias in the review process. We define gender bias as any differential treatment of male versus female applicants, and we are particularly interested in the role of the gender of the evaluator in this differential treatment. Since the granting of these fellowships for graduate study abroad has an impact on the career prospects of those who receive them, equal opportunity in the process is key to advancing women's careers.====In 2016, Mexico invested 0.5% of its GDP in research and development, substantially less than the OECD average of 2.35%.==== During the 2017–18 academic year, women represented 50% of undergraduate students, 55% of master's degree students, and 48% of doctoral students (ANUIES 2013-18), yet only 33% of researchers are female.==== These female researchers are unevenly distributed across academia and the public and private sectors, where women represent 33%, 35%, and 28% of the total, respectively.==== Even though there is near-parity among graduate students, those numbers represent all graduate studies, not just doctoral programs. Our own estimations from the Mexican labor survey show that in 2015, women held 47% of master's degrees, but just 38% of doctoral degrees. According to our data, 55.2% of female applicants received funding from CONACYT, as compared with 57.8% of male applicants. A first step in the effort to close the gender gap among researchers is to provide equal opportunities in funding for graduate school. It is important to study whether gender differences are due to the quality of applications or to inherent biases against women in the evaluation process.====The literature on the effect of women's representation on evaluation committees in real life settings is not conclusive.==== Van der Lee and Ellemers (2015) analyze the results of applications for research funding in the Netherlands. They find that women are less successful when there are more female reviewers, though the selection of reviewers is not random in this setting. Breda and Ly (2015) exploit a two-stage admission process in French universities, which include a gender-blind written examination that allows them to control for abilities and use a triple-difference specification to assess whether professors show bias in their scoring of oral examinations. They find that women are favored in male-dominated fields, and men in female-dominated fields. Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) conduct a field experiment to analyze hiring decisions for a laboratory manager. Researchers received applications from male and female students with identical profiles, but showed preference for the male applicants, indicating that pre-existing gender biases have a moderating effect.====The studies closest to our own are those of Bagues and Esteve-Volart (2010) and Bagues et al. (2017). The first analyzes the evaluation of candidates to the Spanish judiciary. They find that male-dominated committees do not favor men, and female-dominated committees do not favor women. However, their available information does not allow them to observe individual evaluations; they observe just the proportion of women in the randomly-assigned committees and their hiring decisions. They therefore cannot distinguish whether women are tougher on women, or if men change their behavior when there are women on the committee. Bagues et al. (2017), however, examine tenure decisions in Spain and in Italy, which also uses randomly-assigned evaluation committees. For Spain, they find no effects of female representation on evaluation committees. For Italy, they find that women applicants do worse with greater female representation on the committee. In this country they have data on individual evaluations and observe that men show a licensing effect: they are less favorable toward women when there are more women on the committee, a committee composition effect. This problem presents itself because the committee members all know the identities of their colleagues.====Our research design exploits pairing of evaluators and applicants (there are generally three assigned evaluators per applicant). Unlike previous studies, ours uses each evaluator's scoring of the application, and these scores can be disaggregated into scores assigned to different aspects of the application, such as the quality of the graduate program to which applicants have been accepted, the relevance of their proposals, their ability to work with others, and their potential as researchers. Also unlike previous studies, our results are free from evaluator biases from committee composition effects, since individual evaluators do not know the identities of the other reviewers, and each makes an independent assessment of the application.====Even though supposedly there is random pairing of applicants and evaluators, we find that female reviewers have a greater chance of being assigned to evaluate applications from women. We thus control for various characteristics of the applicants and the evaluators, as well as different structures of fixed effects. We also checked for balance within fields of study and found that engineering is the most troublesome field, and medicine and health sciences is the most “balanced” field in a statistical sense. Thus, as additional robustness checks, we excluded engineering from our estimating sample and we also did our estimations using only the medicine and health sciences sample. Our results are robust to the different specifications and estimating samples. First, we find that female evaluators assign male applicants a score close to 0.10 standard deviations higher than male evaluators. Second, male reviewers show no such gender bias in scoring applications. Third, female reviewers grade female applicants more harshly than male applicants (by 0.04-0.05 standard deviations), although the estimate is imprecise.====We try to shed some light on the mechanisms behind these results. We find no robust effect of female representation in broad fields of study. The scores of female evaluators follow a U-shaped pattern with age, and the gap between scores given to female and male applicants is greatest for evaluators less than 45 years old. Male evaluators exhibit no pattern and no differential treatment of male and female applicants. Finally, female evaluators are somewhat biased by stereotypes: they consistently assign higher scores to female applicants on “soft” skills traditionally associated with women (such as social adaptability and the ability to work in groups) and lower scores on “harder” skills that signal their potential as researchers and the quality of the program to which they have been accepted. Male evaluators also give female applicants higher scores on “soft” skills, but not on any other part of their application.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

However, broadening the applicant pool while also maintaining diversity may require encouraging applications from individuals who have little to no chance of admission. We shed new light on this behavior using detailed data on Harvard University that was made public as part of the ==== lawsuit. We show that Harvard encourages applications from many students who effectively have no chance of being admitted, and that this is particularly true for African Americans. After a 28-year period where the African American share of applicants to Harvard was roughly stable, the African American share of applicants grew by almost 57% over four years. Yet, there was little change in the share of admits who were African American, consistent with our finding that the increase in applications was driven by those with lower SAT scores. We show that this change in applicant behavior resulted in substantial convergence in the overall admissions rates across races yet no change in the large cross-race differences in admissions rates for high-SAT applicants.","Applications to elite colleges and universities have skyrocketed over the past twenty years with little change in the number of admits (DeSilver, 2019). At top schools, admission rates are now in the single digits (U.S. News & World Report, 2019). With such low admit rates, many applicants simply have no chance of being admitted, suggesting clear information problems in this market. Even though the Common App has lowered the costs of applying to multiple institutions (Knight & Schiff, 2022), the high rejection rates imply significant wasted resources in terms of the applicant’s time filling out additional essays, the monetary costs associated with applying to the school (both directly and through sending standardized test score reports), and the time of the admissions officers reading files.====High application rates result in part from colleges actively recruiting applicants. Students who take exams such as the PSAT are often flooded with brochures from various colleges (Rivard, 2013b, Strauss, 2017). For example, Smith, Howell, and Hurwitz (2020) find that in a sample of 2015–2016 SAT test takers, the average number of institutions purchasing a student’s contact information is 28.5.====There are many reasons why colleges, including the most elite, actively recruit students. First, colleges are interested in finding the====most productive matches while maximizing the number of full-paying students (Rivard, 2013b).==== Second, recruiting provides a mechanism for schools to attract a diverse applicant pool, which may lead to both better matches and an enhanced learning environment. For example, the College Board allows schools to recruit applicants according to factors such as students’ test scores, high school GPA, intended college major, gender, race, and geography.==== Finally, successful recruiting implies an increased number of applications and lower admissions rates, which can enhance a school’s prestige (Blair & Smetters, 2018).==== This last motivation can lead to perverse incentives for a college: recruiting applicants with little to no chance of admission. This phenomenon, dubbed ‘recruit to deny’ by the popular press (Colarusso, 2015, Strauss, 2015), may be especially costly for those with limited access to information about their admissions prospects.====Because universities closely guard their recruiting strategies and admissions decisions, much of what we know about ‘recruit to deny’ and its effect on admissions is based on anecdotal evidence. We shed new light on this practice by examining recruiting strategies and how these strategies affect the applicant pool and eventual admissions outcomes using data from Harvard made public in the recent ==== lawsuit. We show that these recruiting practices especially impact African Americans. As we illustrate in the following sections, the data indicate four facts: ==== Harvard recruits African American students significantly more aggressively than their white and Asian American counterparts; ==== many African American applicants have essentially no chance of admission; ==== aggressive recruiting of African American students accelerated dramatically after 2003; and ==== as a byproduct, admissions rates across racial groups have converged over the past twenty years.====For the Class of 2018, Harvard sent out over 114,000 recruitment letters to admit 2,047 students.==== In determining which students to recruit, Harvard implemented substantially different test-score cutoffs based on the race or ethnicity of the applicant. For example, to be eligible for a recruitment letter based on the SAT, African American and Hispanic students needed to score an 1170 on a 1600-point scale, a score at roughly the 78th percentile.==== By way of comparison, the 25th percentile SAT score among Harvard matriculants in Fall 2017 was 1460.==== All told, almost 50% of those qualifying for a recruiting letter were underrepresented minorities.====Casting a wide net for underrepresented groups is important for maintaining a diverse applicant pool. However, this recruiting strategy will only result in a diverse admitted class if the applicants have some hope of being admitted. Using individual-level applicant data for the Classes of 2014–2019, we show that a substantial fraction of African American applicants are effectively ruled out by their test scores and grades. To do this, we examine the link between race, admissions chances, and Harvard’s academic index—a weighted combination of the student’s SAT scores, SAT II subject test scores, and high school grades. Among typical applicants to Harvard, we find that African Americans account for only 11% of the applicant pool, but 41% of the applicants in the bottom decile of the academic index.==== The admit rate for African Americans in the bottom decile was 0.03%, meaning that essentially none of the 5,921 applicants in this decile were admitted over the six-year period.====Although there are a number of potential reasons why we see this striking pattern for African Americans, historical data tell us when these patterns emerge. While applications of all races have increased substantially, the increases are especially large for African Americans between the Classes of 2008 and 2012. Namely, the African American share of applicants grew from 6.4% for the Class of 2008 to 10.1% for the Class of 2012. To put this jump in context, consider that the African American share of applicants for the Class of 1980 was 5.9%. For the 28-year period between the Classes of 1980 and 2008, the minimum and maximum African American applicant share were 4.5% and 6.4%, respectively. Despite the run up in applicants beginning in 2008, the share of admits who were African American remained unchanged, implying that the sharp increase in applications from African Americans did not diversify the admitted pool. At the same time, the average SAT score of African American applicants fell by 33 points (on an 800-point scale) or roughly one-third of a standard deviation over this four-year period. Additional data indicate that the rise in applications came from those with scores on the SAT subsections below 550; scores for which virtually no Harvard applicant is admitted. For the Class of 2009, the number of African American applicants with scores above 640 was more than double the number of applicants with scores below 550. But for the Class of 2012, there were fewer African American applicants with math scores above 640 than below 550.====The sharp rise in the number of low-scoring African American applicants led to a significant decline in the African American admit rate. Between the Classes of 2009 and 2016, the African American admit rate fell from 12.9% to 6.2%.==== This drop also precipitated a convergence in unconditional admit rates across racial groups. For the Class of 2009, African American applicants were admitted at a 67% higher rate than Asian Americans, but by 2016 the African American admit rate was just 3% higher than the Asian American admit rate.==== Yet, the convergence in unconditional admit rates across racial groups masks consistently large admit rate differences conditional on academic preparation. An African American applicant who scored above a 740 on the SAT math was 4.46 times as likely to be admitted as a similar-scoring Asian American applicant for the Class of 2009 and was 4.65 times as likely to be admitted for the Class of 2016.====While recruiting non-competitive applicants may result in a more diverse applicant pool or lower admission rates for Harvard, the broader market likely suffers. In recent work, Mulhern (2021) shows that personalized admissions information alters application behavior, and that students prefer to apply to schools where they have a reasonable probability of admission. Additionally, when students do not receive information about their best options, they are unlikely to pursue them. These findings are consistent with both incomplete information about admissions prospects and costly applications.==== In this environment, if institutions inundate the market with misinformation, parents and students will have a difficult time deciphering sources that are reliable and accurate, ultimately leading to suboptimal application behavior and possibly mismatch. Importantly, Harvard’s recruitment behavior is not unique. Other elite colleges and universities have seen enormous growth in applications and declining admissions rates. Additionally, a 2020 Department of Justice investigation of Yale University reveals patterns in admissions that are remarkably similar to Harvard’s. Namely, African Americans are substantially over-represented in the bottom 10% of the academic index where admission rates are minuscule.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe Harvard’s recruitment methods, paying particular attention to the role of race. In Section 3, we discuss admission patterns in the individual-level data for the Classes of 2014 to 2019. In Section 4, we use the historical data to show how application and admit rates for different races have evolved over time. Section 5 shows our findings are corroborated using data from other schools and Section 6 concludes.",Recruit to reject?

Using data from the 2010 Chinese Census, we find that increased women’s education permanently reduces fertility, which is different from the evidence in many countries where women compensate at later ages for the initial loss in births. We also find that increased education has a greater negative effect on the total live births of rural ","Since the middle and late 20th century, the total fertility rates in most developed and developing countries have dropped sharply, and China is no exception. After the implementation of the one-child policy in the late 1970s, China’s total fertility rate has been declining. Although the government has gradually relaxed the birth control policy in recent years, the expected increase in the total fertility rate has not yet appeared.==== The total fertility rate dropped to 1.7 in 2018 (see the World Bank), below the global average and the replacement rate needed to maintain the current population. The declining fertility rates and increasing proportion of childlessness have accelerated population aging and the shrinking of the working-age population, which have become the major demographic problems in China.==== As various factors such as fertility policy, education, marital status, house prices, and labor market performance are likely to affect fertility, the reasons for the negative fertility trend are not fully understood (Cygan-Rehm & Maeder, 2013).====Educating girls and young women has always been considered to be an effective means to reduce fertility. Early studies have shown that there is a significant negative correlation between women’s education and fertility (e.g., Cochrane et al., 1990; Lam & Duryea, 1999; Handa, 2000). However, whether these correlations represent causal relationships has been the subject of debate (McCrary & Royer, 2011; Lavy & Zablotsky, 2015). They may instead be due to potential reverse causality (early pregnancy may impede further education) or unobservable factors such as individual ability and family resources that affect both female education and fertility (Osili & Long, 2008). Recent studies use exogenous sources of variation in schooling unrelated to fertility to examine the causal impact of women’s education on fertility.====Some studies have found that increased women’s education reduces fertility after taking into account the possible endogeneity (Cygan-Rehm & Maeder, 2013; Dinçer et al., 2014; Ali & Gurmu, 2018). Several causal studies have shown that the negative relationship between female education and fertility disappears or even becomes positive (McCrary & Royer, 2011; Monstad et al., 2008; Fort et al., 2016). In addition, some studies have examined the impact of female education on early fertility, and found that increased education reduces the incidence of teenage births (Black et al., 2008; Silles, 2011; DeCicca & Krashinsky, 2020; Grönqvist & Hall, 2013). However, more education does not necessarily affect completed fertility, as women can catch up with the initial reduction in fertility later in life (Monstad et al., 2008; Breierova & Duflo, 2004; Geruso & Royer, 2018). Since education may affect fertility outcomes through several channels such as positive assortative mating, child mortality, and contraception use, and the importance of these channels may vary by country or subpopulations, the estimated effects vary across studies.====China promulgated compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) in 1986, and decided to gradually establish a nine-year basic education requirement throughout the country. This reform was gradually implemented in different provinces at different times from 1986 to 1994. By the end of 2000, China basically popularized nine-year compulsory education, covering 85% of its population. Exploiting the cross-regional and cross-time variations in the enforcement of compulsory schooling reform in China, this paper examines the causal effect of women’s education on fertility as well as the potential mechanisms underlying the relationship such as child mortality, labor market performance, assortative mating, and the incarceration effect.====Specifically, this paper uses data from the 2010 Chinese Census, and restricts the sample to married women aged 35 and above (aged 11–25 when the CSLs were implemented). The instrumental variable (IV) results show that an additional year of female education significantly reduces the number of births by 0.24. We also find that increased women’s education increases the probability of childlessness, but the results are statistically insignificant. Furthermore, we examine the potential channels through which women’s education affects fertility, and find that increased women’s education reduces child mortality, improves the education of husbands, delays women entering the marriage market, and increases the opportunity costs of childrearing, which means that increased women’s education can affect fertility through several channels. Finally, we find no significant differences in the effects of women’s education on fertility by child’s gender and nationality. Increased education has a greater negative effect on the total live births of rural ==== women.====This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, using the variation induced by the compulsory school reform in 1986 in China, some recent studies have found that more education increases personal income (Fang et al., 2012), delays the age of marriage (Li & Cheng, 2019), is beneficial to various child outcomes during adolescence (Cui et al., 2019), and has mixed effects on health-related outcomes (Huang, 2015; Xie & Mo, 2014). As far as we know, this is the first paper to examine whether the increase in women’s education caused by the compulsory schooling reform decreases fertility in China, which is a supplement to the research on the causal relationship between women’s education and fertility.====Second, the debate over empirical evidence on the impact of female education on fertility has raised concerns about the importance of institutional conditions, such as labor market characteristics, the availability of child care, and a wide range of policies (Cygan-Rehm & Maeder, 2013). This paper focuses on China, characterized by high female labor force participation,==== limited public child care services, and a strict fertility policy.==== Our research will provide meaningful insights for similar developing countries.====Third, China’s total fertility rate dropped sharply from 6.4 children per woman in 1965 to 1.7 in 2018 (see the World Bank). Some studies have examined the reasons for the decline from multiple perspectives such as the one-child policy (McElroy & Yang, 2000; Li et al., 2005), the quantity-quality trade-off (Rosenzweig & Zhang, 2009; Li & Zhang, 2017), and the rise in house prices (Pan & Xu, 2012; Liu et al., 2020). This paper will provide an additional explanation for the rapid decline in the total fertility rate.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework and relevant literature. Section 3 briefly introduces the institutional background in China. Section 4 presents the empirical methods. Section 5 describes the data and variables. Section 6 provides the empirical results. Section 7 discusses various potential mechanisms.

We define the occupational specificity of each college field as the likelihood that a student majoring in that field subsequently works in an occupation requiring specific skills acquired in the field. We find that occupationally-specific, non-disciplinary courses are strongly associated with earnings; e.g., a five percentage-point shift among English majors from their least occupationally-specific courses outside the humanities to computer science is associated with a 0.055 increase in log-earnings.","Over the last 25 years, rising tuition costs coupled with a flattening of the college wage premium contributed to an increased demand among four-year college students for degrees with strong occupational pipelines. Between 1995 and 2015, for example, the total number of bachelor's degrees conferred by U.S. postsecondary institutions increased by 65%, degrees in health professions and computer/information sciences increased by 166% and 162%, respectively, and degrees in English ==== by 14%.==== Despite these stark examples of the trend toward “vocational” college majors, students have not entirely abandoned the humanities, arts, and social sciences: together, these fields accounted for more than one in four bachelor's degrees granted in 2015. Existing research offers rationales for why students continue to choose college majors that lack a vocational focus, including (a) the fields suit their idiosyncratic abilities and preferences (Altonji et al., 2012; Arcidiacono, 2004; Wiswall & Zafar, 2015); and/or (b) they expect the labor market to reward the general skills (communication, critical thinking, global awareness, ====.) acquired in those fields (Adamuti-Trache et al., 2006; Hill & Davidson Pisacreta, 2019, Humphries, Joensen, &#38; Veramendi, 2017). In this study, we consider a third reason: students rely on college coursework ==== their majors to enhance their labor market outcomes.====This conjecture motivates the question posed in the title: Among college graduates with degrees in English and other “nonvocational” fields, are labor market outcomes positively associated with credits completed in vocationally-oriented, nonmajor courses such as computer science? To address this issue, we begin by defining the vocational orientation, or occupational specificity, of each college field of study as the (out-of-sample) likelihood that a student majoring in that field will work in an occupation requiring the specific skills acquired in that field. Among the 60 fields represented in our sample, nursing has the highest occupational specificity (91%) because it imparts skills that closely match the requirements of several occupations (registered nurses, nurse midwives, ====) ==== because jobs are relatively plentiful in those fields. Design has a mid-level specificity score (46%) because it links closely to a set of occupations where jobs are relatively scarce, such as designers and artists. History is among a group of fields with occupational specificity equal to zero, indicating that no occupation has skill requirements that closely match the specific skills acquired in undergraduate history courses. History majors might be productively employed in journalism, sales, teaching, and any number of other occupations on the basis of their ==== skills (or subsequent training), but because no occupation forms a direct pipeline for this undergraduate field of study it is judged to lack occupational specificity.====We combine our field-specific occupational specificity measure with college transcript data for over 95,000 recent bachelor's degree recipients drawn from Ohio administrative records to construct a credit-weighted index of the occupational specificity of each student's curriculum, decomposed into three components: within-major credits, credits outside the major but within the major's discipline, and credits outside the discipline.==== We model two early-career outcomes (probability of employment and log-earnings) as flexible functions of all three credit-weighted occupational specificity indexes, allowing the effect of each index to (a) be nonlinear; (b) vary with each of the other components; and (c) vary with the occupational specificity of the major. We lack exogenous variation in credit requirements that might be used to contend with students’ self-selection of college majors, elective college courses and, in turn, occupational specificity indexes. Instead, we control for a range of college- and student-specific factors that invariably affect these choices, including graduation year fixed effects, university fixed effects, first-semester grade point average, first-semester percent of attempted credits that are completed, college transfer patterns, and enrollment duration. In a series of robustness checks, we take further steps to net out individual ability and institutional quality by, ====., reducing the sample to a single institution and eliminating students who transfer between colleges, change majors, or earn double majors.====We use our regression estimates to compute marginal effects of various credit-related interventions that alter the distribution of total credits between major and nonmajor courses. These estimated marginal effects enable us to address such questions as: Can individuals with vocational majors potentially enhance their labor market outcomes by amassing a high percentage of credits in their majors? How do their “returns” to within-major credit concentration compare to analogous estimates associated with nonvocational majors? Can students who choose nonvocational majors potentially benefit from choosing occupationally specific courses outside their major? Do those potential benefits depend on whether the additional, nonmajor credits are within-discipline (and, therefore, related to the major) or farther afield?====Our study fits squarely into the literature that assesses “field of study” effects on the labor market earnings of college graduates (e.g., Altonji et al., 2012; Berger, 1988; Grogger & Eide, 1995; Hamermesh & Donald, 2008; Kirkeboen et al., 2016; Webber, 2016), but is most closely aligned with the strand of this literature that asks whether earnings differences among majors are attributable to differences in skill specificity (Blom et al., 2021; Bridet & Leighton, 2015; Leighton & Speer, 2020; Malamud, 2011; Silos & Smith, 2015). Our point of departure is that we do not consider a student's college major to represent the totality of his or her skill acquisition. Instead, we account for each student's entire distribution of college credits across 60 fields, and we assess the occupational specificity of credits within the major as well as in all other fields. Our data reveal that the average percent of total credits allocated to courses within the major is only 29%, with a maximum of 56% among arts majors. Given that the typical college student completes ==== more credits outside the major than within the major, it stands to reason that labor market outcomes are driven by far more than the identity of the major or its skill specificity.====Our findings reveal that credit-weighted, occupational specificity indexes associated with nonmajor courses are weakly related to employment probabilities, but strongly related to earnings. A shift of five percentage points worth of credits (equivalent to one-third of a standard deviation, or 8.2 credits) ==== the discipline (but outside the major) from the least occupationally specific course to the most occupationally specific course is associated with a boost in log-earnings of 0.03 to 0.05, depending on assumed levels of both the major's occupational specificity and the starting level of the within-discipline specificity index. An analogous shift of credits among courses ==== the discipline is associated with a log-earnings boost of 0.05 to 0.08. When we fine-tune the intervention to correspond to a five-point credit shift among English majors from their least occupationally specific courses outside the humanities to computer science courses, we predict a log-earnings increase of 0.055.====Despite efforts to address the endogeneity of our credit-related variables via observables and reliance on within-institution variation, we acknowledge that our estimated marginal effects are unlikely to represent the payoffs that a randomly chosen student can expect to receive. Identification of causality is far from trivial in our application because students choose from scores of fields in selecting not only their major but a large percentage of their college credits. This self-selection of majors and elective courses is invariably affected not only by students’ cognitive ability—for which we adequately control—but by their noncognitive skills, preferences, and expectations. Moreover, their subsequent choice of occupation is likely to affect the earnings payoff to the occupational specificity of their coursework.==== As a result, our log-earnings estimates represent the (causal) effect of credit-related productivity enhancement ==== any direct, earnings-enhancing effects associated with the preferences, noncognitive skills, expectations, and/or occupational aspirations that lead to the selection of vocational credits outside the major. In short, our estimates are likely to be upper bounds on productivity-enhancing, causal effects.====While we believe alternative identification strategies are worth pursuing in the future, our current estimates are useful for (at least) two reasons. First, given that we are the first to establish relationships between the occupational specificity of nonmajor coursework and labor market outcomes, we prefer to use a large, representative sample of students, institutions, and fields of study along with a suitably flexible regression function. In contrast, efforts to improve identification via instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or structural approaches will invariably require reduced choice sets, less flexible functional forms, and/or restricted samples. The current study provides a foundation on which such extensions can build. Second, our findings support policies designed to shape students’ noncognitive skills, preferences, expectations, and occupational goals to help them make optimal college curriculum choices. These are the confounding factors for which we are unable to control; as such, our estimates represent (causal and noncausal) benefits among students who, for example, possess the “tastes” and occupational aspirations that lead them to ==== to augment an English degree with computer science courses. As long as “uncontrolled for” self-selection is driven by ==== factors, which appears to be the case, there is scope for increasing the number of students who receive such benefits.",Should English majors take computer science courses?

However, the combination program shows greater promise, particularly for girls. ==== indicate that the effects are concentrated in the lower half of the outcome distribution. We discuss and provide evidence for various hypotheses that could explain these differences.","Math education is almost always on the forefront of education policy discussions. Interest in math from politicians, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners stems, in part, from the understanding that the economy depends on jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which all require math skills. The United States’ relatively poor performance on international tests has fueled fears that the nation will lose its competitive advantage (Committee on STEM Education, 2018; Clements, 2004). This emphasis on math has more recently reached the early childhood education sector where more and more children are exposed to early math concepts in prekindergarten (Clements, 2004).====Research provides some evidence that starting math instruction early is beneficial to children's development of math skills. Math is cumulative; more advanced concepts such as addition and subtraction depend on knowledge of earlier concepts such as number recognition and counting. Math achievement in prekindergarten and kindergarten predicts future math achievement as late as eighth grade (Claessens & Engel, 2013; Jordan et al., 2009). More generally, investments in quality early childhood learning experiences provide some of the highest returns on investment in education (Heckman, 2006).====While math is increasingly taught in formal early childhood education settings, young children's exposure to early math is less prevalent at home. Parents tend to endorse the notion of supporting early math concepts in the home, but they focus more on literacy development than math development, with some evidence that this preference for literacy is greater among low-income, black, and Hispanic families (Sonnenschein et al., 2016; Sonnenschein et al., 2012; Cannon & Ginsburg, 2008). Furthermore, studies have shown that low-income families are less likely than higher-income families to foster the academic development of their children at home more broadly (Sonnenschein et al., 2016; Bradley et al., 2001). Home learning environments are consequential for children. Differences in home experiences early on in life affect early child development and persist through school and beyond (Duncan et al., 2010; Pungello et al., 2010).====Text messaging interventions for parents have proven to promote behaviors that improve educational outcomes in a variety of settings. In particular, text messaging curricula including information, activities, and encouragement have helped parents support the literacy development of their prekindergarteners in the home. These programs were most effective for students who started the year with lower literacy skills (Doss et al., 2019; York et al., 2019; Cortes et al., 2021; Cortes et al., 2019).====To date, no study that we know of has assessed the effects of text messaging programs – or similar low-touch programs – for parents on children's development of math skills. The acquisition of math skills may differ from the acquisition of literacy skills for a number of reasons. In particular, parents are primed to focus on early literacy. Programs such as “Talk Read Sing” and “Reach Out and Read” encourage parents to build their children's early literacy skills (Nobles, 2018; Mendelsohn et al., 2001). Very few similar signals instruct parents to focus on math. Moreover, parents may be more comfortable thinking of themselves as teachers of literacy than teachers of math. While early math is likely no more difficult for parents – only requiring very basic understanding of counting, numbers, and comparisons such as more and less – parents may be worried about math because their own experience with math in schools may not have been positive, and they may experience math anxiety (Ashcraft & Moore, 2009; Luttenberger et al., 2018). Finally, math may elicit gender-specific behaviors in different ways than literacy. Math is traditionally considered a male subject area (Gunderson et al., 2012; Cvencek & Greenwalk, 2011). As such parents’ inclination to build math skills may differ depending on their child's gender.====In this study, we investigate whether 32-week, text messaging-based programs can help parents improve the early math outcomes of their prekindergarteners. We field an experiment to compare a program that focuses solely on math (“pure math program”) with one that combines math, literacy, and social-emotional learning (SEL) (“combination program”) in three California school districts. The former may be more effective at improving math because it spends more time on math (Berkowitz et al., 2015). The latter may be more effective because it combines literacy, for which parents are primed to work and generally feel comfortable, and because literacy and social-emotional skills may enable children to more readily acquire math skills (Purpura et al. 2011; Graziano, 2007). Both programs send three text messages per week to promote behavior change of parents and to foster positive parent-child interactions similar to those developed by York et al. (2019).====We find that the pure math program had no detectable effects on assessments of early math skills for either girls or boys. The combination program had meaningful positive effects on girls of 0.16 standard deviations, and quantile regression analysis indicates that girls between approximately the 15==== and 55==== percentile of the outcome distribution have large and significant benefits of approximately 0.30 to 0.40 standard deviations. The magnitude of the effect implies that while girls start off the year behind boys in math, they catch up to and even surpass boys when their parents have access to the program that combines literacy, math, and SEL. We hypothesize three potential explanations of these differences. First, parents of boys may be overconfident in boys’ ability to do math and see less need to practice math with boys. Second, parents and teachers may respond to greater (perceived) girls’ interest in and mastery math related activities. Third, while parents may not engage differently based on their child's gender, girls may be more receptive to the math activities because they can regulate emotions and impulses better than boys (Matthews et al., 2009; Ponitz et al., 2008; Else-Quest et al., 2006).",Engaging girls in math: The unequal effects of text messaging to help parents support early math development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000395,20 April 2022,2022,Research Article,76.0

Both approaches find that Black students face higher suspension probabilities and longer suspensions than White students and are suspended for longer than Hispanic students. There is no evidence of Hispanic-White disparities. The similarity of findings across approaches and the ability of individual fixed effect models to account for unobserved characteristics common across disciplinary incidents provide support that remaining racial disparities are unlikely to be driven by differences in behavior.,"The use of exclusionary discipline practices is prevalent in K-12 education in the United States (Heitzeg, 2009, Steinberg, 2016). These practices are controversial, as recent research document long-lasting negative effects of severe disciplinary punishments on students’ educational achievement (Bacher-Hicks et al., 2019, Skiba et al., 2014, Sorensen et al., 2021). A related concern is that these policies facilitate the school-to-prison pipeline, a phenomenon in which harsh school policies expose students to the criminal justice system at a young age (Bacher-Hicks et al., 2019, Heitzeg, 2009, Owens, 2017, Weisburst, 2019). This situation is especially troubling for students of color, who are disproportionately represented in K-12 disciplinary infractions and face pervasive racial disparities upon entering the criminal justice system (Anderson and Ritter, 2017, Skiba et al., 2002).====These potentially stark consequences of harsh discipline on later life outcomes motivate efforts to curb racially disparate use of exclusionary discipline. Doing so requires a more comprehensive understanding of the origins of such gaps. One possibility is that disparities result from differences in unobservable student characteristics and behavior. Another possibility is that some of this disproportionality arises from bias, in which students exhibiting the same behaviors are treated differently by race. While an increasing number of studies provide evidence for racial bias in criminal justice settings, such as federal sentences (Rehavi & Starr, 2014), bail decisions (Arnold et al., 2018), and criminal trials (Anwar, Bayer, & Hjalmarsson, 2012), less is known about the prevalence of disciplinary-related racial bias during primary and secondary school, before most individuals formally encounter the criminal justice system. This paper uses administrative K-12 data from North Carolina and two complementary identification strategies to document findings that are consistent with racial bias driving some of the gaps in exclusionary discipline.====Our empirical approaches examine racial gaps in exclusionary discipline for students of different races who are jointly involved in the same disciplinary incident. The first identification strategy leverages within-incident variation in suspension outcomes across students of different races. We show that in disciplinary incidents consisting of one Black student and one White student, Black students are 0.4 percentage points more likely to be suspended, which corresponds to 6% of the overall gap in the propensity for White and Black students to receive a suspension, conditional on being reported for a disciplinary infraction. Furthermore, Black students receive suspensions that are 0.05 days longer on average than White peers involved in the same incident, and this magnitude is 12% of the overall gap between Black and White students in number of days suspended for an incident. Black students are also suspended 0.03 days longer than Hispanic students in the same incident, which is 8% of the gap between Black and Hispanic students in suspension length. In contrast, we find no Hispanic-White gaps in suspension probability or length.====The key identifying assumption underlying this approach is that within an incident, student race is not correlated with unobservable differences in student behavior. We subject our findings to multiple robustness checks, including limiting the analysis to students with no history of office referrals, and find our point estimates are robust to these additional controls. Racial differences in the severity of exclusionary discipline cannot be explained by previous disciplinary history or student characteristics, such as relative age. To further address the concern that even within a disciplinary incident, variation in individual behavior may be driving differential outcomes in exclusionary discipline, we employ a second empirical strategy. This approach uses student-level fixed effects instead of incident-level fixed effects to assess how disciplinary consequences vary for a given student across incidents based on the race of other students involved in the same incident. Results show similar patterns to the results using the first strategy: Black students who are engaged in the same incident with a White student are 0.5 percentage points more likely to be suspended and have suspensions averaging 0.07 additional days, relative to when they are in a same-race incident. The analogous difference for Black-Hispanic incidents is 0.03 additional days. The proximity of these magnitudes to estimates using the first approach, coupled with the ability of individual fixed effects models to account for unobserved student behavior common across disciplinary infractions, provide further evidence that measured racial differences in exclusionary are not driven primarily by behavioral differences.====To understand contexts that mitigate or exacerbate racial gaps in exclusionary discipline, we examine heterogeneity by infraction type. School administrators have more discretion over punishment severity for some types of incidents based on locally administered student codes of conduct. We abide by these district guidelines to classify incidents into objective versus subjective infractions, with the former capturing misbehavior such as skipping school and dress code violations, and the latter encompassing categories such as insubordination and disruptive behavior. Findings indicate that racial differences are almost entirely driven by subjective infractions. These findings indicate that contexts involving more school administrator discretion may invite more bias.====This paper relates to a growing body of studies examining racial gaps in exclusionary discipline in the education system (Barrett et al., 2019, Kinsler, 2011, Skiba et al., 2014). Using North Carolina data as well, Kinsler (2011) finds significant statewide gaps in suspensions between Black and White students, conditional on receiving an office referral and infraction type. A limitation of this study is that the earlier North Carolina data used in this study do not contain incident identifiers, making it difficult to disentangle whether gaps arise from underlying situational and behavioral variation across incidents as opposed to disparate racial standards in treatment. Barrett et al. (2019) use administrative data from Louisiana to look at suspension gaps between Black and White students involved in fights together, finding significant gaps in total days suspended. The authors only observe students who were suspended in the data, and they use date and school information to infer students involved together in the same fight.====We contribute to and advance the literature in several ways. First, we observe data on all student ==== instead of a censored dataset containing only suspensions as in Barrett et al. (2019). Selection into the sample of suspended students may depend on factors correlated with both race and severity of disciplinary outcomes. Failing to account for this selection may bias estimates of racial differences. Our referral sample overcomes this concern by including all students involved in an incident regardless of whether they receive a suspension. However, one limitation of both papers is the inability to address selection into referrals by race. We are aware of one other paper that uses referral data to examine racial differences in exclusionary discipline. Liu, Hayes, and Gershenson (2021) identify intentional discrimination using rich administrative data from a diverse large urban school district in California. The paper uses an approach akin to our first identification strategy to document greater suspension rates and length for under-represented students relative to White students. Our paper is unique in implementing a second identification strategy that exploits variation in racial compositions across peers using a student fixed effects approach. This approach further alleviates concerns that there are unobservable behavioral differences across students within incidents that influence suspension outcomes.====Another advantage of this study is that our data contains incident identifiers, which create a more precise linkage of students to incidents relative to Barrett et al. (2019). This enables us to expand our analysis to other types of infractions beyond fights, so that we can assess whether racial differences are more pronounced in infraction types involving more or less discretion on the part of school administrators. The scope of North Carolina data furthermore allows us to examine the experiences of Hispanic students in addition to Black and White students. In particular, we are able to investigate interracial incidents involving only students of color from different groups. We find substantive gaps in exclusionary discipline outcomes for Black and Hispanic students, even with the inclusion of incident-level fixed effects. Our finding of similar magnitudes of Black-Hispanic gaps in suspension length relative to Black–White gaps is especially interesting. It suggests that the more severe punishment of Black students is unlikely driven solely by differences in perceived disadvantage or test performance given that academically and socioeconomically, Hispanic students look much more like Black students than they do White students. Our findings of gaps in disciplinary outcomes between Black and Hispanic students shed light on the complexity of relationships among under-represented racial and ethnic groups.====Finally, the focus on school discipline-based bias recalls the growing body of literature studying the role discrimination among police officers and judges plays in contributing to racial disparities in the criminal justice system (Antonovics and Knight, 2009, Anwar and Fang, 2006, Fryer, 2019, Goncalves and Mello, 2021, Grogger and Ridgeway, 2006, Horrace and Rohlin, 2016, Knowles et al., 2001, West, 2018). Challenges to identifying bias in the K-12 context involving the selection of students into schools and unobserved behavior echo the difficulty of pinpointing bias under endogenous police or judge encounters and imperfect data on individual behavior. While some strategies addressing these challenges are not applicable in the K-12 setting, our use of incident fixed effects and juxtaposition across individuals of different races parallels approaches in the literature on criminal justice and bias (see, for example, West (2018) and the use of automobile crash fixed effects).",Equal time for equal crime?

We test for the presence of race/place-of-origin and gender biases among students and instructors in asynchronous online post-secondary classes by measuring responses to discussion comments posted in the discussion forums of 124 different ==== (MOOCs). Each comment was randomly assigned a student name connoting a specific race/place of origin and gender. We find evidence that assumed identities influenced the likelihood of both instructor and peer responses. The comparative effects by identity indicate that instructor responses consistently privileged White males who were, on average, 94% more likely to receive a response than other students. We also find that White female students were particularly likely to receive a peer response. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding social-identity dynamics in classrooms and the design of online learning environments.","An increasingly large number of basic economic interactions (e.g., workplace communication, consumer purchases) occur in digitally mediated, asynchronous environments. This is uniquely true in education and especially at the postsecondary level where online learning environments were becoming increasingly common even prior to the dramatic changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, earlier evidence indicates that a third of postsecondary students took an online course and that an online format had negative academic consequences, especially for students with lower levels of prior achievement (Bettinger, Fox, Loeb & Taylor, 2017; McPherson & Bacow, 2015). The character of instructor and peer engagement in online classrooms is likely to contribute to their comparative effectiveness and may raise fundamental issues of fairness. Given that social identity theory suggests that membership in social groups such as a specific gender and race affects self-concept and the perceptions of others, examining how engagement is related to race and gender in educational settings is critically important (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). In particular, a longstanding descriptive literature (e.g., American Association of University Women, 1992; Tenenbaum & Ruck, 2007) indicates that teachers in conventional classrooms appear to exhibit biases against females and racial minorities (e.g., directing engagement and encouragement disproportionately to White and male students). Similarly, evidence (Bettinger, Liu & Loeb, 2016) suggests students participating in asynchronous discussion forums in online classes at a degree-granting institution exhibit preferences for engaging with similar peers and that such engagement improves learner outcomes.====Ex ante, it is not clear whether online classrooms would mitigate or increase the prevalence of such biases. The comparative anonymity of these entirely digitally mediated interactions, which provide fewer visual clues of race/place of origin or gender, could attenuate biases by reducing the tendency towards racial and gender-based categorizations. Alternatively, the stylized character of online classrooms may increase the psychological salience of the limited identity cues that are available as well as reduce the social incentives for self-control. Using a field experiment, this study provides novel evidence of the possible presence of racial and gender biases among instructors and students in online courses. This experimental study is situated in the discussion forums of 124 postsecondary Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In such large-scale, online learning environments, these forums provide the primary, and often the only, opportunity for instructors and students to interact. These interactive message boards also perform vital educational functions as students rely on the discussion forums to ask questions about the course content and structure and to receive answers and encouragement from fellow students and course instructors. We tested for the presence of biases in these settings by creating fictional student identities with race/place-of-origin- and gender-connotative names, placing randomly assigned comments in the discussion forums using these fictional student identities, and observing the engagement of other students and instructors with these comments.====We believe this study makes at least two broad and distinct contributions. First, it provides important new evidence on the character of digitally mediated interactions. The nature of such interactions has particular relevance in the context of online classrooms. These learning environments have become increasingly common but face serious challenges in terms of supporting student engagement and human-capital accumulation. While evidence exists on bias in several other settings, we are unaware of any existing studies specifically assessing instructor bias in online educational environments. Second, the empirical evidence from this field experiment also informs an important theoretical ambiguity. An active and growing body of evidence indicates that a race or gender-congruent instructor (i.e., “a teacher like me”) results in improved student outcomes (e.g., Dee, 2004, 2005; Fairlie, Hoffman & Oreopoulos, 2014; Gershenson, Holt & Papageorge, 2016; Lindsay & Hart, 2017; Van den Bergh, Denessen, Hornstra, Voeten & Holland, 2010). However, the existing reduced-form evidence cannot distinguish between effects due to active instructor biases and those due to how student performance responds to an instructor's identity (e.g., stereotype threat and role-model effects). Because this study relies on experimentally constructed student identities, it unambiguously isolates the effects that are instructor-centered (e.g., implicit and explicit biases).",Bias in online classes: Evidence from a field experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572200036X,14 April 2022,2022,Research Article,78.0

Six Memphis suburbs subsequently voted to create separate municipal districts. Many complex school zoning changes resulted from the ==== and subsequent splintering of districts. This provides a rare opportunity to identify how the value of academic quality and local district control are capitalized in housing prices, independent of school-level ==== and district administration.","The 2013 consolidation of Memphis City Schools and neighboring Shelby County Schools was the largest of its kind in the history of the United States, combining two districts that were markedly different along dimensions of race, income, and school achievement.==== Schools within the original city district enroll high numbers of minority and low-income students and produce significantly lower standardized exam scores and graduation rates, relative to schools originally served by the county district. Following one year of a unified county-wide district, six Memphis suburbs created separate municipal school districts for residents within their boundaries. The fragmentation of the municipal school districts resulted in numerous school zoning changes. The political circumstances motivating these complex zoning changes create a natural experiment that enables us to separately identify the capitalization of both school-level academic performance and local district administration in the housing market.====The capitalization of school characteristics in the housing market has garnered substantial attention, yielding a long academic literature (for a review see Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger, 2011). Since Black (1999) emphasized bias resulting from spatially entwined school and neighborhood characteristics, researchers have developed several approaches to disentangle the value of school and neighborhood quality. The most widely utilized approach is to compare homes in similar neighborhoods on either side of the boundary, using boundary fixed effects (Black, 1999; Kane et al. 2006; Gibbons et al., 2013; Dhar and Ross, 2012; and La, 2015). A one standard deviation improvement in test scores is generally associated with a 1-4% increase in home values in studies using a boundary fixed effects approach (Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger, 2011). Results from these studies have clearly demonstrated the need to address the confounding of school and neighborhood quality; however, the question of whether boundary fixed effects are sufficient to address this concern remains open.====A related literature has evaluated how the introduction of new information about school quality impacts home values (Figlio and Lucas, 2004; Imberman and Lovenheim, 2016). The benefit of this approach is that it allows researchers to use a repeat sales model, holding constant all time-invariant home and neighborhood characteristics. However, the relevance and novelty of the information about school quality will also affect measurement of the effect. Figlio and Lucas (2004) find a substantial impact on housing prices following the announcement of school grades in Florida. However, the size of the effect declined over time as the grades proved to be a volatile measure of school quality. Meanwhile, Imberman and Lovenheim (2016) find no impact on housing prices following the release of teacher and school value-added data in Los Angeles.====Changes in school boundaries offer an opportunity to disentangle school and neighborhood characteristics using a repeat sales specification to measure changes in home values over time as houses are rezoned to schools of varying quality. However, in order for this identification strategy to yield unbiased estimates, the school boundary changes must be uncorrelated with trends in housing prices. Ries and Somerville (2010) use changes in school boundaries in Vancouver, BC to identify the causal impact of school characteristics on home value. The boundary changes in Vancouver were motivated by overcrowding in certain schools. Upon testing the identifying assumption, the authors find that their estimates reflect pre-existing differences in the trend in home prices. Any zoning changes motivated by changes in neighborhood demographics are likely to be subject to similar endogeneity issues. Collins and Kaplan (2017) present a basic analysis of the 2013 school district merger and de-merger in Memphis, TN and demonstrate that the resulting boundary changes do not violate this critical assumption. Instead, we establish that the changes in school and district boundaries created variation in home values that is unrelated to pre-existing neighborhood trends. This is a necessary first step towards the analysis in the current paper, which utilizes these changes as a natural experiment to separately identify the impact of school characteristics and local district control on housing prices.====In addition to the capitalization of school quality in the housing market, changes generated by the Memphis school district merger—and subsequent secession—raise questions about the value of local district administration. National interest in district boundaries and secession has increased in recent years. Since 2000, 73 school districts have successfully seceded, typically leaving behind large urban districts with substantial minority populations and high poverty rates (EdBuild, 2019). In addition, several municipalities have attempted but failed to secede, and others are currently at various stages in the process of trying to form their own independently run districts.==== The tradeoff between large and small school districts was traditionally framed in terms a financial benefit resulting from administrative economies of scale verses greater autonomy and flexibility allowed by decentralized control. There is mixed evidence about the relationship between district size and student academic performance, with some studies showing a positive relationship (Devaraj et al., 2018) and others showing a negative relationship (Driscoll et al., 2003).====We indirectly address the question of optimal district size by estimating demand for local district administration as it is capitalized in housing markets. Although there is a small literature on the impact school district consolidation and secession on home values, most studies focus on consolidation among small rural districts. Hu & Yinger (2008) find a boost to home values concentrated in smaller districts. Duncombe et al. (2016) find a short-term decline in home values with some evidence of long-term appreciation. However, they also find heterogeneous effects across districts of different sizes and incomes. The previously studied consolidations differ from the district changes in Shelby County in several ways. First, previous research focuses, for the most part, on small rural districts, whereas, during the year that Shelby County Schools was unified, it was the 17==== largest district in the nation.==== Second, after one year of unification, the six municipal districts were allowed to secede. Rather than district consolidation, our analysis more accurately reflects the impact of school district secession on housing prices.====Some researchers have argued that the recent trend in district secession is primarily racially motivated. In an article titled “Segregation by District Line,” Frankenberg et al. (2017) note that district fragmentation in Memphis “reduced possibilities for further integration and equity.” This argument stems from a Supreme Court decision (Milliken v. Bradley, 1974), which reversed a Circuit Court decision requiring the Detroit metropolitan area to adopt a desegregation plan encompassing 53 different school districts. Thus, under the ruling the creation of a separate school district has the potential to entrench existing racial segregation between schools. Although we are unable to directly address the importance of race in the value of local district administration, the boundary changes allow us to estimate the value of school-level demographic characteristics independent from academic performance and localized district control.====Most previous studies have only included school-level demographics as an attempt to control for neighborhood characteristics with the exception of Bogart and Cromwell (2000) and Clapp et al. (2008). Bogart and Cromwell (2000) use school assignment changes generated by declining enrollment in Shaker Heights, OH to estimate a repeat sales model measuring the impact of preference over racial composition of schools on home prices. They estimate the effect of the percent of non-white students on home values, finding a weakly significant positive effect in just one specification. Because the coefficient is not statistically different from zero in the majority of their specifications, including all of the repeat sales analyses, they conclude that the positive coefficient was picking up unobserved neighborhood characteristics unrelated to the racial composition of schools.====Clapp et al. (2008) use over time variation in school district characteristics, including both test scores and student demographics to estimate the impact of changes in those characteristics on home values while controlling for neighborhood fixed effects. Their fixed effects analysis using three-year average test scores indicates that school performance does not have a significant impact on housing prices when including controls for student demographic characteristics. Instead, local property taxes and the percent of the student body that identifies as Hispanic are correlated with significantly lower home values. One limitation of this analysis is that the authors are unable to control for pre-existing trends in both school and neighborhood quality over time. Our study contributes to the existing literature on valuation of school demographics by utilizing the natural experiment produced by redistricting in Shelby County, TN to estimate the impact of student demographic characteristics on home values, independent from academic performance.====While previous literature has estimated the school quality effect using existing school boundaries, the school district modifications in Shelby County provide an opportunity to estimate the effect using ==== in school boundaries. Collins and Kaplan (2017) exploit these changes using a difference-in-differences specification with fixed effects associated with a home's original school zone. Using this methodology and parcel-level data, we compare two homes that were originally assigned to the same school but were reassigned to schools of different quality following the county redistricting. Applying the identification strategy established in Collins and Kaplan (2017), this paper builds on that preliminary work in several important ways. First, we identify the impact of school zoning changes on home prices using a broad range of academic performance measures, including standardized test scores and graduation rates. Our results are qualitatively similar across academic performance measures, giving us confidence in the robustness of our school-level academic quality estimates. Second, we examine differences across elementary, middle, and high school boundaries. A priori, it is unclear whether the value of school quality varies by level of schooling. Our findings indicate that academic performance is valued similarly across grade levels. Third, we incorporate student demographic characteristics to evaluate the role that preference for school racial composition has on home values independent of school quality and local district administration. This consideration is particularly important given both the history of racial segregation in the school system and current trends in suburban district secession.====The comprehensive set of analyses presented here allow us to draw several important conclusions. First, the literature has reached a consensus on the capitalization of school quality in housing markets, with various identification strategies consistently yielding estimates between 2-3% for a one standard deviation change in test scores. Second, there is considerable demand for local district administration in the presence of large urban school districts. Finally, although we find no difference in demand across schools with varying percentages of non-white students, racial diversity has a significant negative impact on housing prices.",Demand for School Quality and Local District Administration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000292,5 April 2022,2022,Research Article,79.0

Therefore, conditional on their level of effort, incomplete information partially explains why students’ grade expectations are often different from their actual academic performance (Hacker et al., 2000, Reynolds and Pemberton, 2001)====The goal-setting behavior, personal expectation, and effort investment of students are based on the information they possess (Wright, 2020).====
 Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2012) found that students often start with misinformed expectations about their success and they update these beliefs in a Bayesian manner when exposed to correct and complete information about their true likelihood of success. However, students often receive this information when it is too late for their actions to affect the outcome. For instance, students may only learn about course difficulty after performing poorly on an exam later in the semester. In this paper, we utilize a field experiment to randomly expose students to accurate course- and instructor-specific information about the past distribution of grades at the start of the semester. We then study how this intervention affects students’ grade expectation, subsequent effort, persistence, and academic performance in the course.====Several studies have found that students’ expectations about their potential grades typically differ from their actual grades and are often biased upwards (Hacker et al., 2008, Hacker et al., 2000, Miller and Geraci, 2011, Serra and DeMarree, 2016). In addition to the incomplete information received ex-ante, students are often unable to differentiate between the aspired and realistic future states (Kruger and Dunning, 1999, Serra and DeMarree, 2016, Svanum and Bigatti, 2006). This blurs the line between their aspirations (what they wish to achieve) and their predictions (what they expect to achieve) and this leads them to overestimate their future grades (Reynolds & Pemberton, 2001). Overconfidence, particularly in low performers, also plays a key role in the mismatch between students’ expected and actual performance. The level of overconfidence, which may vary systematically by various student-level attributes and academic discipline, could be detrimental for students’ persistence,====academic performance, and long-term goal attainment (Armor and Sackett, 2006, Boud and Falchikov, 1989, Falchikov and Boud, 1989, Grimes et al., 2004, Klein and Helweg-Larsen, 2002, Nowell and Alston, 2007, Robins and Beer, 2001, Wrosch et al., 2003).====Irrespective of the exact source of the mismatch between expected and actual grades, our study tests whether it can be corrected through the timely provision of complete information about the past course- and instructor-specific grade distribution. While some studies have designed and tested strategies to correct student expectations, they are usually very involved, costly, and require an expert intervention (Försterling and Morgenstern, 2002, Hall and Sverdlik, 2016, Haynes et al., 2009, Perry et al., 2010, Wrosch et al., 2003). For instance, Hall and Sverdlik (2016) informed students of the risks of unrealistic expectations and the benefits of downgrading their expectations in response to an academic setback. They found correlational evidence that the intervention did not have the intended effect on students’ academic expectations, though it negatively impacted their academic performance. In contrast, Försterling and Morgenstern (2002) found that encouraging students to adopt personally controllable explanations for academic setbacks (attributional retraining) improved their subsequent outcomes. Our study builds on the literature in several important ways: (1) this is the first study to examine the causal impact of providing students with accurate instructor-specific information about the past distribution of grades to help students develop informed expectations about their future performance. As such, our intervention aims to correct any misinformation students received before starting the course and nudges students to develop informed beliefs about the expected grade distribution and their position in it. In addition, our intervention is conducted at the start of the semester when it is still early for students to use this information to adjust their behavior and influence their academic performance in the course. (2) Unlike most of the prior interventions, we explore a very simple, zero monetary cost intervention, requiring minimal time and effort, which an instructor can easily carry out without any external expert assistance. As such, our intervention is easily adaptable and scalable.====Theoretically, a student can belong to one of the following three groups: (1) True-estimator if their expected grade distribution matches the true grade distribution; (2) Over-estimator if their expected grade distribution is to the right of the true grade distribution, or is skewed towards the right tail; and (3) Under-estimator if their expected grade distribution is to the left of the true grade distribution, or is skewed towards the left tail. Our intervention does not bring any new information to the true-estimators. However, an over-estimator will respond to the intervention in one of the following four ways: (i) instead of lowering their expected grade, they may choose to exert a higher level of effort in order to attain the original expected grade, (ii) instead of increasing their effort, they may choose to lower their expected grade, (iii) they may lower their expected grade and increase their effort simultaneously, or (iv) the intervention may discourage them altogether, causing both a lower expected grade and a lower effort level. A similar line of reasoning can be used to examine the response of an under-estimator to the intervention.==== Consequently, determining the effect of the intervention on students’ expected performance and effort is theoretically ambiguous, and therefore requires an empirical investigation.====We find that while students grossly overestimate their expected performance in the course, the intervention caused treated students to lower their grade expectation in a manner that is consistent with the true/actual grade distribution. In addition, the treatment had a small positive impact on students’ test scores and improved the likelihood of passing the course by 10 percentage points. Lastly, we find that the treatment had a stronger effect on: (a) higher-achieving, female, and higher-income students; (b) those who entered the course expecting a high grade; and (c) students who obtained information about the course and instructor prior to their enrollment in the course. This suggests that instructors can significantly improve students’ outcomes in difficult courses by simply providing them with complete information about the past distribution of grades.====We proceed as follows: Section 2 outlines the experimental design, data and the randomization procedure, followed by the empirical design in Section 3, the empirical analysis in Section 4, and the conclusion in Section 5.",A for effort: Incomplete information and college students’ academic performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000152,4 April 2022,2022,Research Article,80.0

We exploit the Canadian lumber export crisis beginning in 2007 in a quasi-experimental design. The crisis was sudden and more pronounced in the forestry ","When an economy faces a shock, some industries may be hit harder than others. In this context, one may expect that some industries will bounce back fairly quickly, while others may suffer permanent losses. Lessons from previous major economic downturns may help us design policy interventions to help smooth the impact of shocks. The great recession of the last decade, as well as the economic downturn due to the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021, share some commonalities. In both cases, the impact of the shock did not reach the same level of severity across all industries, and not only did the intensity of the shock vary, but so did the expected duration of the shock. In industries where the shock will have permanent impacts, the labour force will have to adjust, and workers will have to go back to school to acquire new skills. Investing in one’s human capital may entail substantial opportunity costs, including foregone labour income. When this opportunity cost decreases, standard economic models predict that individuals will increase the scope of their investment in education. In periods of crisis, when unemployment increases and wages tend to stagnate, the opportunity cost of going back to school decreases. This should be particularly true in sectors of the economy in which the negative shock is expected to last for several years.====In this paper, we estimate the impact of a negative trade shock on labour market outcomes and educational choices of workers. More specifically, we exploit the Canadian lumber export crisis beginning in 2007 in a quasi-experimental design. Between 2007 and 2009, the subprime mortgage crisis caused a substantial slowdown in the U.S. housing market, including in the construction sector. This downturn contributed to amplifying the Great Recession, a global financial crisis that lasted from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009 in the United States. That shock translated into a substantial drop in American imports of Canadian lumber. The permanence of the shock in the forestry industry was particularly striking relative to what happened in other sectors of the economy, and therefore focusing on this sector could provide valuable lessons for industries that are likely to be hit more permanently by recessions in the future.==== We use this shock as a natural experiment to estimate the propensity of forestry workers to work part-time versus full-time, become unemployed or inactive, and return to school.====We offer several contributions to the literature. First, we provide empirical evidence on the impacts of a negative labour demand shock on workers’ labour market status following the shock. We look at both labour market outcomes and educational choices. To our knowledge, the literature investigating the impact of labour demand shocks on educational choices has mainly focused on positive labour demand shocks. Second, we show that outcome adjustments may vary over time. More specifically, we find that labour market outcome adjustments materialize rapidly, while educational choices take more time. This directly contributes to our understanding of individuals’ situations with respect to labour market status following a negative labour demand shock. It also suggests that policies could be designed to help workers who wish to return to school adjust more rapidly. From an administrative standpoint, it is easier to drop out of school than to enrol. Enrolment processes could be streamlined to encourage individuals to invest in their education, and this should be a priority in all countries severely hit by the pandemic.====Our main results suggest that the probability of being employed in the forestry industry decreased by 3.8 percentage points (p.p.) (==== = 0.030), above and beyond an overall decrease of 3.8 p.p. (==== = 0.000) for workers in the primary and secondary sectors. The shock on forestry workers was therefore twice that of the overall shock on comparable workers. This more severe shock translated into a higher probability of being unemployed (2.4 p.p., ==== = 0.035) or inactive (1.4 p.p., ==== = 0.301). While one would expect younger forestry workers to return to school in such circumstances, we find that in the first two years following the crisis, these additional unemployed or inactive workers did not go back to school. However, going back to school takes time, and after 3 to 4 years, we find that education enrolment increases by 2.9 p.p. (==== = 0.045). This is consistent with the idea that increases in education enrolment are gradual, as it is easier to drop out than to enrol.====The paper is structured as follows.

Perceptions of the math abilities of underrepresented minority students, whether by themselves or their schools, may contribute to such gaps. A ==== with data on all Massachusetts public school students shows how receiving a positive ability signal affects subsequent enrollment in advanced high school math coursework. For Black or Hispanic students, particularly those with low reading scores, being labeled as “Advanced” on a 10th grade math test substantially increases the likelihood of later Advanced Placement Calculus course- and exam-taking. White or Asian students and those from higher income high schools show no such effects. Understanding how ability signals affect students’ and schools’ decisions about assignment to coursework may suggest further ways to address gaps in such enrollment.","Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in college STEM majors and in subsequent jobs in STEM fields (Fry et al., 2021), including in medical school (Morris et al., 2021). Patterns of enrollment in rigorous STEM coursework in high school may explain some of these gaps. Descriptive evidence suggests high school students who take Advanced Placement (AP) STEM courses are substantially more likely to complete a STEM college degree than observationally similar peers who do not take such courses (Smith et al., 2018). Recent causal evidence suggests that taking AP coursework can boost students’ interest in pursuing a STEM major in college (Conger et al., 2021) and that earning AP credits can increase the number of college STEM courses completed (Gurantz, 2021).====There exist, however, clear disparities by race and income in enrollment in such advanced coursework. The most recent data available suggests that Black students comprise 15% of each year’s graduating high school class but only 9% of AP exam takers and less than 5% of those who earn a passing score on at least one AP exam.==== Such gaps are not as stark for Hispanic and Latino students, who are 19% of the graduating class but only 17% of those who earn at least one passing score. Gaps by income are arguably even larger. Whereas 48% of K-12 students in the United States are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, but those students represent only 27% of AP exam takers and only 22% of those with at least one passing score. Such gaps are not limited to Advanced Placement coursework. A 2014 report from the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Education shows that Black and Hispanic students are similarly underrepresented in elementary school gifted and talented programs, as well as in core and advanced quantitative courses in middle and high school.====In this paper, we study one potential determinant of enrollment in advanced STEM coursework in high school, namely the signal sent by the label used to describe a student’s performance on an important standardized exam. Students scoring in the top category of Massachusetts’ standardized 10th grade math test are described as “Advanced”, a positive signal that roughly half of students receive in any given year. We use a regression discontinuity design to compare future course-taking and performance for students just above and below the threshold that distinguishes that category from the “Proficient” one below it. Students just above and below this threshold are similar in terms of demographics and other characteristics, differing only in whether they receive this positive signal. This allows us to identify the causal impact of that signal on subsequent course-taking outcomes.====We first document large gaps in AP Calculus course-taking by race/ethnicity and by income. Black or Hispanic students are 8 percentage points less likely to take AP Calculus than their White peers, a gap largely unchanged when comparing students in the same high school. Low income students are 9 percentage points less likely to take AP Calculus than their non-low income peers, or 5 percentage points less than those in their same high school. We then show that, for Black or Hispanic students, being labeled as “Advanced” on the 10th grade math test substantially increases the likelihood of later Advanced Placement Calculus course- and exam-taking. The effect is larger among students with low reading scores, suggesting that the signal carries greater weight for students without other markers of high achievement. The “Advanced” threshold is near the median of the math ability distribution, so that the marginal student induced to enroll tends to earn low grades in the AP Calculus course and low scores on the AP Calculus exam. The enrollment of White or Asian students is unaffected by this ability signal. The effect of these signals on low income students generally is about half the magnitude as the effect on Black and Hispanic students and only marginally statistically significant. We see little evidence of heterogeneity by gender, perhaps related to the lack of a gender gap in AP Calculus participation rates.====These findings contribute to two existing strands of research. First, and most narrowly, a growing body of literature documents that preliminary signals of performance can have substantial effects in directing the focus of future course choices by students. Papay et al. (2016) find that low-income urban students who score just above a scaled score performance threshold on a standardized state high school test are significantly more likely to enroll in college than students who score just below the threshold. Avery et al. (2018) find that students with raw scores just over the threshold for AP college credit are significantly more likely to choose a college major corresponding to the subject of that test than are students with raw scores just below that same threshold. Goldin (2015) finds that women respond more negatively than men to less than perfect grades in an introductory economics course. Rogers and Feller (2016) find that students randomly selected to review the work of academically stronger classmates are less likely to complete their large scale on-line course, perhaps discouraged by their lowered perception of their own skills. Our paper adds to the evidence that positive signals can change students’ coursework decisions, including as early as high school.====Second, and more broadly, recent studies find clear evidence of bias in the selection of students for advanced coursework. Card and Giuliano (2016) observe that the introduction of a universal screening test for admission to a gifted education program significantly increased the proportion of minority and low-income students in the program. Similarly, Dougherty et al. (2015) find that the representation of minority and low-income students in Algebra I in 8th grade increased when the Wake County School District introduced a formal rule to select students for the course on the basis of prior achievement. From test scores and grades to less formal feedback, students receive a stream of noisy signals about their academic performance and perceived ability levels throughout their years in K-12 classrooms. The results of these prior studies suggest that traditionally disadvantaged students receive, on balance, more negative signals than others conditional on past test scores and grades. Our results suggest that positive signals can thus affect the decisions of such students, or perhaps their teachers.====We conclude by discussing potential mechanisms and implications of our findings. We note that our observed effects may be driven by changing the course choices of students and their families, or of teachers and school counselors who assign students to courses (Francis et al., 2019, Mulhern, 2020). We argue that, though this particular ability signal was not well-targeted toward students likely to succeed in AP Calculus courses, states and school districts could generate more informative signals designed to identify students appropriate for a given advanced course. Such signals could improve participation in appropriately rigorous coursework.",Ability signals and rigorous coursework: Evidence from AP Calculus participation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000140,22 March 2022,2022,Research Article,82.0

We exploit a reform that compelled all schools in England to replace pay scales with school-designed performance related pay schemes. Using teacher-level data, we find that in response to the reform, schools in labor markets with better outside options for teachers have relatively higher teacher pay progression, spending on teachers, teacher retention and ","Public sector labor markets around the world are typified by their bureaucratic nature where an individual's pay is typically based on observable characteristics (experience) and divorced from performance (productivity). There may be good reasons not to have strong performance pay in the public sector: lack of competition, non-verifiable outputs, multiple tasks, and motivated agents (Dixit, 2002; Burgess and Ratto, 2003).==== There are also costs: inflexibility precludes organizations from reacting to local labor market conditions and reduced incentives for effort (Woessman, 2011). Pay that is unresponsive to both individual productivity and to local conditions is likely to lead to misallocation of resources between labor and other inputs. The impact of centralized pay in the public sector on productivity is therefore an empirical question, that will depend on the country and industry context. In this paper we study the impact of the public sector pay structure on productivity using a pay reform that required public sector providers to stop using pay scales based on experience and switch to a more flexible, performance based, pay structure.====The productivity of many public sector occupations is difficult to measure. We estimate the impact of increased pay flexibility in the education sector, where student performance on externally graded national exams can be used as a measure of productivity. The pay reform ended the use of ‘annual progression’ pay scales in all schools in England and from September 2013 required (not just ‘permitted’) all 20,000 plus state-funded schools to introduce their own Performance Related Pay (PRP) scheme. In doing so, the reform completely changed the basis for setting pay, affecting the whole labor market of close to half a million teachers in the public sector (DfE, 2018d) and half of school budgets (DfE, 2018b). Despite the scale of the changes to pay regulations, there were no changes to the way schools were financed, which allows us to isolate the impact of reducing pay rigidities.====This de-coupling of pay from experience means that, in principle, schools could vary pay as they wished, within their existing budget. Schools could respond by changing the school-level ==== teacher pay, and the ==== in pay across teachers within the school. Our paper focuses on the first of these and so relates to the large literature on the level of teacher pay relative to other occupations, which has been argued to affect teacher quality and therefore pupil outcomes (Nickell & Quintini, 2002). In this case, deregulation allows schools to set their pay relative to the local labor market (see Britton & Propper, 2016). We use the natural experiment of the national implementation of the reform to test how schools respond to outside labor market conditions, and the resulting implications of this for productivity.====This reform, in combination with newly available administrative data on individual teacher pay, allows us to contribute to the literature by being the first to estimate the impact of a national pay reform using individual-level data. Specifically, we use this reform to address three key questions. First, do public sector organizations change pay when given the freedom to do so? Second, how do these changes affect the labor supplied? Third, does the decentralization of pay impact student outcomes? We directly test the implication of Britton and Propper (2016) that school would react to local conditions to improve pupil performance.====We exploit the pre-reform variation in wages across local labor markets in England to test how schools react to increased pay flexibility. This is estimated in a difference-in-differences framework, with school and year fixed effects. We use the pre-reform mean hourly wage of the labor market in which the school resides as a dosage treatment post-reform. We are therefore estimating the relative reactions made by schools according to local wages. Schools in areas where the pay scales happen to coincide with the local market clearing level of wages will be unaffected by the reform in terms of average wages or quantity of teachers employed. Taken to an extreme, if pay scales were perfectly aligned with all local labor markets, there would be no reaction to the reform (in average wages or quantity of teachers employed) with relation to local labor markets. Therefore, we interpret the sign and magnitude of our dosage parameter as the relative extent to which the pay scales had taken schools away from market clearing equilibria.====To focus on pay changes due to pay deregulation we need to abstract from any potential compositional changes in the teacher workforce which could affect pay levels.==== To account for this, we create an individual teacher-level counter-factual expected annual pay growth which would have occurred under the old scale point system (see Section 4 for details). This allows us to calculate the deviation from expected pay progression for each teacher, which accounts for relevant teacher demographics. We aggregate this to create a school-level measure of average deviation from expected growth.====The detailed data on teachers come from the School Workforce Census, an annual census of every public sector teacher in England from 2010. The reform, and our study, encompasses both primary schools (serving children aged 4 through to 11) and secondary schools (serving children aged 11 through to 16). We combine this teacher-level data with administrative data on student performance at ages 11 and 16 from the School Performance Tables and pre-reform local labor market earnings from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. Together, these allow us to estimate how the removal of pay scales affects public sector pay, employment and productivity. We make four contributions to the literature via four distinct findings.====First, after the reform, schools’ choice of how to implement performance related pay leads teachers’ salaries to grow relatively faster in tighter labor markets. This happens from within existing budgets, showing a preference for increased teacher compared to non-teacher spending in response to the local labor market. Post-reform, there is an immediate decrease in teacher pay growth across all districts, but this decrease is smallest in labor markets with higher outside wages, where the competition for labor is highest. Primary (secondary) schools in areas with a one-pound higher hourly median wage awarded 0.134 (0.127) percentage points higher increases in teacher salaries annually. To put this in context, after the reform teachers in schools one standard deviation higher up in the local median wage distribution would experience 0.6 percent higher salaries. In contrast, despite the increased competitive labor market pressures, schools are no more likely to introduce variation in pay growth in high wage areas.====The second finding is that schools in higher wage markets relatively increase the number of teachers they employ. There were no restrictions on the maximum number of teachers prior to the reform, which implies that this is a supply response to higher wages. Furthermore, there is no increase in the number of newly hired teachers, meaning that the schools are using their funds to retain their existing teachers.====Our third finding is that schools in these labor markets achieve relatively higher growth in student test scores. For each one-pound increase in local median hourly wages, primary (secondary) schools post-reform experience a 0.014 (0.023) standard deviation increase in student test scores. In addition, we show that the relative gains in student test scores are larger in schools with more disadvantaged student populations, implying that these schools were the most negatively affected by the national pay scales, by preventing them from hiring or retaining teachers. For secondary schools, most of the test score gains occurred during the first year of the reform before pay or the quantity of teachers employed were able to change, implying that much of these initial gains are due to increased teacher effort as a result of a salient performance regime. Note, these relative gains in student achievement occurred without increases in school budgets, or increasing the dispersion of teacher wages within schools. Moreover, the nature of the external grading of national exams in England prevents us from testing if there were any aggerate changes in student performance.====Finally, not all types of teachers gained the same from the decentralization of pay. One of the features of having a bureaucratic pay scale in a labor market with hard to observe individual productivity is a reduced scope for biases and nepotism. Using a simple difference in differences specification (before and after the reform interacted with various teacher characteristics) we estimate the impact of pay deregulation on relative pay growth. We find that the removal of the pay scales leads to males experiencing 0.38 percentage point higher pay growth than females. Moreover, teachers with longer tenures at the school also experience higher pay growth.==== While we cannot say if these relative differences in pay are due to productivity/demand rather than bias/nepotism, we can say that they would not have occurred under the pay scale system.====There are several papers on the importance of pay flexibility for productivity (Kessler 1990; Grimshaw, 2000; Buchan and Black, 2011). Most closely related to this work are those that examine the teacher labor market, which provides an excellent laboratory in which to study the effects of reduced bureaucracy in pay structure on productivity. Our findings are consistent with Britton and Propper (2016) who find that students in labor markets in England where teacher wages are below market wages perform worse on standardized tests.====Our paper provides an advance on theirs by exploiting the changes over time due to an exogenous policy reform (rather than their five-year changes in local wages which may be endogenous) in addition to the geographical variation in outside wages. Our setting also allows us to explicitly test an implicit assumption of Britton and Propper (2016) that school leaders are aware of, and would respond to, local labor market conditions if they could. We find that school leaders react to market forces when given the flexibility to do so.====The two papers closest to ours are Biasi (2020) and Willén (2019), with results similar to ours with respect to student performance and teacher salary, respectively. Biasi (2020) examines 146 school districts in Wisconsin who were given the freedom to use ‘flexible pay’ for teachers rather than ‘seniority pay’ determined by collective-bargaining agreements with unions. Biasi finds that the districts which opted out of seniority pay had increased dispersion of salaries, and teachers’ pay became more correlated with teacher value-added. High value-added teachers disproportionately moved into these districts. Sorting of teachers and increased teacher effort led to improved pupil performance in reading and math by 4-6 percent of a standard deviation. Our paper studies the case of a universal, national reform to pay-setting for teachers, which allows us to build on Biasi's findings in two ways. First, the universal nature of the reform removes the issue of endogenous selection into treatment status (which Biasi deals with via variation in contract ending dates). Second, the national, compulsory implementation means that we do not have to worry about the role of potential teacher migration between untreated and treated schools. This allows us to provide a more complete answer to the question of what would happen if flexible pay were adopted by all schools.====Willén (2019) studies the phased removal of national teacher pay scales in Sweden, replaced by individual wage bargaining.==== The paper examines how pay at the municipality-gender-year level changes after a five-year transition period. Willén finds that the local labor market influences teacher pay: higher non-teacher salaries are associated with higher teacher salaries, but no improvement in relative student attainment (productivity). While Willén (2019) uses municipality-gender-year level data, we take this line of inquiry one step further by providing the first evidence on teacher-level counterfactual salary growth. Our access to individual-level data allows us to calculate individual deviations from expected pay under the old pay regime, and so separate the effect of the reform on teacher pay from possible changes in teacher demographics. In addition, this allows us to test any increase in the variation of pay growth within individual schools, which would be evidence of schools actively using PRP. The English setting required schools to design and publish their own pay policies rather than set pay according to individual wage bargaining. We therefore provide new evidence on the impact of wage decentralization when the salience of published criteria is high. In contrast to Willén (2019), we do find a significant impact on student achievement.====The other related literature is that of PRP. The impact of PRP schemes in developed countries has mixed results.==== Those that have relied on pre-specified targets of student performance, have typically not found significant effects (Goodman and Turner, 2010; Springer et al., 2010; Fryer 2013). In contrast, those that have relied on relative performance of teachers within a school (Lavy, 2009) or principal assessment (Atkinson et al., 2009) have found positive effects on student performance.====Our findings are similar in nature to Atkinson et al. (2009) who study another English teacher pay reform in 1999, where principals could determine if their teachers qualified to be on a newly established upper-pay scale. Any additional pay came from central government, rather than the school budget, and so in the first year 88% of staff eligible applied, and 97% were awarded the bonus (Wragg et al., 2004). Despite the ex-post apparent lack of competition for this award, before the reform eligible teachers were told that performance would determine future salary, and in the first year of the reform student test score growth increased. We also find that student test scores increased in the first-year post-reform, before teacher pay could be affected, or before teachers knew how the implementation of PRP would be realized. We take this as additional evidence that the stated implementation of PRP under uncertainty improves student test scores. A key difference for policymakers between these two reforms, is that the second (the focus of this paper) is budget neutral.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the English teacher labor market and the nature of the reform. Section 3 briefly sets out the theoretical predictions and empirical design. Section 4 describes the data and how we calculate the expected pay increases.

One understudied example of this differentiation is the increasing trend of “colleges” becoming “universities” by changing their names. Between 2001 and 2016, 122 four-year colleges—nearly 25% of those called colleges in 2001—made such conversions. Leveraging variation in the timing of these conversions in an ==== framework, I show that converting to a university signals an increased focus on ====, which leads to an increase in undergraduate enrollment, bachelor’s degree production, and total revenues. I further find that these effects are largest when institutions are the first in their market to convert to a university and can lead to negative ==== on non-converting colleges.","Higher education institutions in the United States make a myriad of strategic decisions each year to attract students to their campuses. In recent years, such decisions have become increasingly important as institutions, particularly those outside of the elite echelon, have faced a declining traditional college-age population (Grawe, 2019), reductions in state support (Mitchell, Leachman, & Saenz, 2019), and increased skepticism about the value of a college education (Parker, 2019). In the face of these trends, colleges have sought new ways to differentiate themselves in hopes of enrolling more students and claiming more tuition dollars. Many have done so by investing in non-instructional amenities (Jacob, McCall, & Stange, 2018), adding new programs of study (Cook, 2021), or increasing their advertising presence (Cellini & Chaudhary, 2020).====Other colleges have taken an alternative approach: they have re-branded themselves as “universities”, rather than “colleges”. Indeed, between 2001 and 2016, 122 four-year institutions —nearly 24% of those that began the century as “colleges” —changed their names to forgo the word college and include the word university instead. College leaders are not shy in providing their motivations for such changes. When Lynchburg College in Virginia announced that it would become the University of Lynchburg in the fall of 2018, their vice president and dean for academic affairs stated that “claiming our status as a university will. enable us to attract and recruit more students” (Gentry, 2017). Similarly, when Lasell College in Massachusetts announced its plans to convert to Lasell University, their president told ==== that he hoped it would make the institution “seem more appealing” (Wong, 2019).====While there is some research on factors that influence colleges’ decisions to convert to universities (Jaquette, 2013, Morphew, 2002), there is not yet evidence on whether such conversions succeed in attracting students to institutions and improving their financial viability. In this paper, I leverage variation in the timing of institutions’ conversions in an event study framework to analyze how college-to-university conversions affect a variety of institutional outcomes. Using rich, institution-level data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and College Scorecard, I find that converting to a university signals an increased focus on graduate education, which has positive effects on both undergraduate enrollment and an institution’s finances, but negative effects on competing institutions’ outcomes. Specifically, the number of first-time students increases by 5.2% in the first five years following a conversion and 7.2% six or more years after. The total number of undergraduate full-time equivalent (FTE) students increases by 3.1% and 5.4% in these respective time frames. In addition, the number of bachelor’s degrees conferred by an institution increases by 5.5% six or more years following a conversion, while total non-investment revenues increase by 8.5%. These effects are larger for institutions that are the first in their markets to do so and reduce enrollment, awards, and revenues at non-converting institutions in the same markets, suggesting that a portion of the gains to a college-to-university conversion come at the expense of other institutions’ ability to attract, retain, and graduate students.====While I cannot rule out that these results may be partially driven by other unobservable changes that may occur at the same time as a conversion —such as changes in administrators or marketing campaigns —I provide suggestive evidence that the name of an institution influences student demand and institutional finances above and beyond other associated factors. First, I control for a variety of time-varying institutional characteristics, including changes in institutions’ degree offerings and physical capacity that occur leading up to, and after, a conversion. For the key outcomes of interest described above, the results are statistically indistinguishable with and without controls, indicating that changes to these areas are not driving the effects I document. Second, I show that my results are robust to limiting the sample only to institutions that offered graduate programs before converting, indicating that the addition of graduate education itself does not explain the results. Finally, I show that conversions tend to decrease per-student expenditures, making it unlikely that students are responding to changes in the educational quality of an institution.====These findings contribute to several related strands of literature regarding the market for higher education in the U.S. On the demand side, I add to a large body of empirical work on students’ college enrollment decisions. Prior work shows that students often lack reliable information about the quality of institutions and, as a result, often rely on rankings (Alter and Reback, 2014, Griffith and Rask, 2007, Hurwitz and Smith, 2018, Meyer et al., 2017) and media coverage (Lindo et al., 2019, Rooney and Smith, 2019) to make their decisions. In addition, relatively small changes in application costs can dramatically affect students’ behavior (Knight and Schiff, 2022, Pallais, 2015, Smith et al., 2014). In this paper, I document that students’ choices are also sensitive to the name of an institution, which students may interpret as a signal of its quality and educational offerings in the absence of other reliable information. This finding is consistent with work by Clinton (2020), who finds that students enrolled in a college that converts to a university experience higher earnings in the labor market, suggesting that employers also interpret a “university” as providing a higher quality education than a “college”.====On the supply side, I build on prior work showing colleges behave strategically to optimize outcomes of interest, such as their rankings and their finances. For example, [16] find that colleges strategically use test-optional admission policies to improve their rankings, while (Luca & Smith, 2015) provide evidence that business schools selectively choose which ranking information to provide students to appear higher-quality. In terms of institutional finances, several recent papers show that institutions —particularly public universities —have turned towards out-of-state (Bound, Braga, Khanna, & Turner, 2019), international (Bound, Braga, Khanna, & Turner, 2020), and master’s students (Jaquette, 2019) as revenue sources in response to declines in state appropriations. Here, I document that other institutions have converted to universities in the face of similar trends and that such conversions are likely strategic decisions as they lead to increased student demand and higher revenues.====This paper also relates to a broader literature on the determinants and effects of organizations’ names. Both theoretical and empirical work indicates that names are an important signal of reputation and quality (Belenzon et al., 2017, McDevitt, 2011, McDevitt, 2014, Tadelis, 1999), particularly in the presence of information asymmetries. My results confirm this finding in the higher education market and suggest that name changes may have similar effects in other markets where there are significant information frictions and where one-time decisions can have important long-run consequences, such as primary and secondary schooling and healthcare.",Is a name change a game change?

The effect is identified by exploiting variation in hours of school-year employment between employed twins and estimation of a value-added model using administrative registers. Increasing hours of school-year employment increases grades in the school exit exams, reduces ==== in the following year, and increases the years of schooling attained by age 20. If anything, increasing hours of school-year employment reduces school dropout and school absence. Our results are consistent with a non-linear effect of employment intensity on educational achievement and employment being preventive of risky behavior.","Research on skill development has mainly focused on the school setting, e.g., class size, teacher quality, and school resources, though students spend most of their daily life outside the classroom. Employment is commonly a part of the daily life of teenagers in developed countries. In 2019, 31 percent of teenagers (ages 16-19) in the U.S. were employed, either in school weeks or vacations. In the U.K. and Germany, the shares are 52 percent and 28 percent (ages 15-19), respectively. In this study we leverage data from Denmark, where the teenage school-year employment rate was 42 percent in 2019 (ages 15-19).====Employment is found to affect beliefs, values, work ethics, and self-esteem (Jahoda, 1981; Gottschalk, 2005) and we know that skills such as problem-solving, organizational, time-management, communication, and presentation skills, as well as the ability to work under pressure, are important for educational achievement and risky behavior (e.g., Farrington, 1988; Diamond, 2012; Moffitt, 2012; Heckman and Kautz, 2012). Similar to regular employment, student employment may have non-pecuniary and cumulative benefits in terms of formation of skills that can be transferred for use in other domains of life, including schooling and education. Skill formation is expected to increase with more hours worked, but time available for non-work activities, such as studying, will decrease concurrently. This implies a non-linear relationship between employment intensity and educational gains (Marsh & Kleitman, 2005). On the other hand, both the reduction in leisure time and the potential skill development are expected to reduce the propensity toward risky behavior. However, criminological theory suggests that the salary from work can increase the number of events in which the student may be tempted to engage in risky behavior, e.g., partying and drinking (Felson, 1986; Osgood, 1999). These opposing effects suggested by theory call for empirical research.====The aim of this study is to provide evidence on how school-year employment of lower secondary school students (ages 15-16) causally affects cognitive skills, risky behavior, and educational achievement.====The first contribution of this paper is that we provide a comprehensive study of the effect of school-year employment on cognitive skills (exam GPA across compulsory school exit exams and subject-specific exam grades), risky behavior (juvenile delinquency, school dropout, and school absence), and educational achievement (years of schooling attained by age 20). The effect on each of these outcomes has been studied previously, but never jointly in a single study, and while the effect on educational achievement is often studied in the literature the effect on criminal activity has received less attention (Neyt, Omey, Verhaest, & Baert, 2019). In their review of the literature on student employment effects on educational outcomes, Neyt et al. report that previous studies have studied student engagement, educational choices, test results, and academic attainment. We cover all four of these outcomes and add criminal activity.====Our second contribution is that the study relies on measures of actual hours worked, as reported by employers to the Danish tax authorities. We regard this as a major improvement as previous literature has relied on retrospective self-reported measures of hours worked Oettinger (1999). argues that these imputed hours worked constitute a significant source of bias for this literature.====Results differ vastly across contexts, e.g., high school versus tertiary education. Thus, our third and final contribution is to study student employment for students in lower secondary school, a largely understudied context (Sabia, 2009).====In Denmark, individuals aged 15-16 are allowed to work up to two hours on school days and a maximum of 12 hours per school week. On average, students in our sample work four hours per week. We exploit the details of the comprehensive Danish administrative registers to provide reliable estimates of the effects of student employment. Our identification strategy is to use within twin-pair variation in school-year work experience in a value-added model. Our identifying assumption is that the variation in school-year work experience within pairs of employed twins during the final year of compulsory school is independent of the individual outcomes, once we account for the skill level, behavioral outcomes, and work experience prior to grade 9.====We find that a one standard deviation increase (corresponding to three additional hours) around the sample mean of work experience obtained during the first eight months of the final year of compulsory school increases the percentile rank in the grade 9 exam GPA score distribution by 2.3 percent, decreases the probability of being registered for a non-traffic-related crime in the following year by 0.9 percentage points (with a sample mean of 1.0 percent), and increases acquired years of schooling by age 20 by one month. If anything, work experience reduces school absence and school dropout in the last three months of the school year. In addition, our results are consistent with a non-linear relationship between employment intensity and educational gains. Viewed together, our results suggest that school-year work experience within the legal limit improves skills, which in turn reduce risky behavior and increase human capital acquisition.====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly describes the related literature. Section 3 gives an overview of the regulations in the teenage labor market in Denmark Section 4. explains our empirical approach. Section 5 describes the data sources and sample selection criteria, and provides descriptive statistics on the teenage labor market. In Section 6, we present the results on the returns to grade 9 work experience on the average grade point in grade 9, criminal behavior, school absence, school dropout, and attained years of schooling, including subgroup analysis and robustness analysis. Finally, in Section 7 we discuss our findings and draw conclusions.","The Effect of School-Year Employment on Cognitive Skills, Risky Behavior, and Educational Achievement",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000188,13 March 2022,2022,Research Article,85.0

But assessment of the impacts on low- and moderate-income families requires consideration of whether net tuition—tuition less grant aid—has increased commensurately. This paper describes recent shifts in net tuition by family income and institution type and assesses the role of changes in state funding in generating these shifts. Using data reported by universities on net tuition paid by students from different family income levels, we find that public research universities have increasingly shifted to high-tuition, high-aid ====. From 2012 to 2018, net tuition fell by far more than would have been predicted by the growth in state appropriations, while tuition levels continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the prior years. The increased progressivity in ====, particularly among research universities, cannot be explained by changes in state appropriations.","Rising tuition at public universities has brought renewed attention to the questions of “who pays” and “who benefits” from US public higher education. Enrollment-weighted average tuition at four-year public universities increased by nearly 200% between academic years 1987–88 and 2018-19, with increases particularly marked in the years around the Great Recession and then slowing in recent years.==== Because approximately 70% of students at four-year universities in the US attend a public university, the ==== burden of increased prices is consequential.====But headline comparisons of tuition charges at public universities do not capture the distribution of prices paid by students from different circumstances. Indeed, the net tuition paid by students from the lowest-income families (less than $30,000 in family income) at four-year universities increased by only 4.5% between 2008-09 and 2018-19, while tuition increased by 32.6%. The affordability and progressivity of higher education depend upon the distribution of grant aid by income and institution type. For the 2018-19 academic year, tuition net of grant aid for students with family incomes under $30,000 was ==== at flagship universities (generally regarded as the most selective in the state) than at non-research universities in 36 states, even as tuition is typically higher at flagship universities.==== As Hansen and Weisbrod (1969) identified 50 years ago, high tuition combined with high aid may be more progressive than low (or zero) tuition.====While the long-standing question of the incidence of public subsidies for higher education is one motivation for this analysis, the observed rise in tuition levels at public colleges and universities raises policy questions about the “affordability” of college education, particularly for families of modest means (Boyington, Kerr, and Wood, 2021; Clark, 2016; Dickler, 2016; Douglas-Gabriel, 2016).  Even as policy analysts and the media often draw a direct connection between tuition levels and “affordability”, it is “net tuition” that determines the financial burden for students from different family income levels at public colleges and universities.  To this end, misperception of net tuition presents a different policy challenge than rising college costs (Hershbein and Hollenbeck, 2014; Davis et al., 2019; Perna, Wright-Kim, and Jiang, 2021).====While the long-standing question of the incidence of public subsidies for higher education is one motivation for this analysis, the observed rise in tuition levels at public colleges and universities raises policy questions about the “affordability” of college education, particularly for families of modest means (Boyington, Kerr, and Wood, 2021; Clark, 2016; Dickler, 2016; Douglas-Gabriel, 2016).  Even as policy analysts and the media often draw a direct connection between tuition levels With data on net tuition paid by family income for in-state students, we measure the “pass-through” rate of tuition changes by family income within each institution. In essence, for each dollar increase in posted tuition, how does net tuition change for students from low- and moderate-income families? After controlling for secular trends and state-level economic conditions, we find that the net tuition paid by students with family incomes under $30,000 increases with tuition at a rate of 30 cents per dollar at Carnegie R1 (“very high research activity”) institutions, 77 cents per dollar at non-research institutions, and 95 cents per dollar at two-year institutions. ==== In effect, research universities appear to engage in more price discrimination by family circumstances than do two-year and non-research four-year institutions.====Descriptive evidence aligning net tuition and tuition changes likely confounds multiple factors affecting tuition, including budget shocks and demand shocks. Changes in state appropriations are an especially policy-relevant budget shock that may impact tuition and, in turn, net tuition paid by students from different circumstances. While it has been well-established that tuition increases less than dollar-for-dollar with declines in appropriations per student (Bound, Braga, Khanna & Turner, 2019; Deming and Walters, 2017; Chakrabarti, Gorton & Lovenheim, 2020), this analysis is the first to examine the response of net tuition at different income levels to changes in appropriations. In general, appropriations changes do not explain the increased progressivity of pricing by family income. To organize evidence, we decompose the changes in tuition levels and net tuition into those attributable to state appropriations and other residual factors, including changes in demand among students from out-of-state and other shifts impacting enrollment demand at public universities Residual factors beyond changes in state appropriations appear as the most significant force in shaping the progressivity of pricing. We hypothesize that, for research universities, changes in market demand combined with increasingly diversified revenue streams facilitated the shift to high tuition, high-aid pricing, resulting in reductions in net tuition for students with financial need in recent years.====Recent pricing trends are unambiguously more generous for low-income students only if aid increases are coupled with steady or increasing low-income enrollment. A related long-standing concern is that enrollment responses to changes in grant aid are muted relative to changes in tuition if students have incomplete information about the financial aid system (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos and Sanbonmatsu, 2012; Kane, 1994).==== We find that changes in low-income enrollment shares in connection with tuition increases are statistically indistinguishable from zero at non-research universities. R1 universities see gains in the representation of low-income students when tuition increases, even as it remains the case that low-income students are relatively underrepresented at these institutions.====Our analysis proceeds with a brief overview of the key institutional details related to tuition setting and grant-based aid at US public universities.

We establish the importance of housing disease by (i) assembling a novel microdata set containing the universe of housing transactions for a large sample of school districts; and (ii) using the timelines of school district housing booms to disentangle the effects of housing disease from reverse causality and changes in household composition. We find housing price elasticities of per-pupil expenditures of 0.16–0.20, which in turn account for 20 percent of the growth in public school spending for districts with at least one housing boom. School districts primarily spent the extra resources on instruction and capital projects, not on administrative expenditures, suggesting that the cost increase was accompanied by improvements in the quality of school inputs.","Median expenditure per student in U.S. public schools grew from $9131 in 1990 to $12,407 in fiscal year 2008/9, a real change of 36%. Around the same time period, house prices in U.S. school districts skyrocketed, with the median district having prices increasing from $169 K in 1993 to $284 K by the end of 2007 – see both times series in Fig. 1. Could the housing boom have caused those major changes in school expenditures per pupil? The answer is “no” according to the leading local public finance models (Oates, 1969) because house prices are just a function of local taxes and amenities,==== and therefore are thought to have a muted effect on local finances. This intuition comes from Tiebout (1956), who posited that local expenditures solely reflect household sorting and preferences for public goods.==== Moreover, local government finances can be determined by other factors, such as fiscal federalism,==== local governmental decisions and transfer schemes,==== local autonomy and competition,==== and more recent “mandates” such as pension benefits and special education.====In this paper we re-examine this standard answer. We propose a new mechanism – housing disease – to explain some of the changes in local school expenditures during the 1990s and 2000s. Housing disease is a spillover from housing markets. First, housing booms generate unusually high growth rates of housing prices. That triggers a growth in school district revenues given that local governments raise a share of their funds via property or land.==== In turn, school district administrators may have incentives to spend the extra revenues without consulting voters due to complicated budget rules, frictions in re-optimizing tax rates, or pure rent-seeking. The end result is an increase in education expenditures without a corresponding shift in local preferences.====This type of mechanism is not unprecedented in the economics literature. In fact we use the word “disease” to emphasize its similarity to Baumol and Bowen (1966)’s cost disease, a canonical example of a spillover to the cost of public education stemming from conditions in a separate market. The primary difference is that, whereas Baumol and Bowen's cost disease originates in the labor market, the housing disease's genesis is the housing market.====The first challenge in estimating the importance of housing disease is that house prices are endogenous to school quality and household composition. We deal with this issue by using the timeline of housing booms in each school district in our sample. The variation from local housing booms has two features that are key to our research design: a) different school districts began to boom across a decade-long period from mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, some of them multiple times, allowing us to remove the impact of national macroeconomic factors; b) housing booms in the last cycle were associated neither with changes in school quality nor with widespread changes in household composition. In Section 4 we show how to estimate the timeline of local booms using time series methods developed by Ferreira and Gyourko (2021) and empirically validate the research design by directly testing the two key features above.====The second challenge is that housing data is generally not available for a large sample of school districts. We solve this problem by amassing the most recent version of the CoreLogic universe of housing transactions from 1993 to 2013 and mapping each home to school district boundaries. Our sample covers more than 2000 school districts with almost 60% of all total enrollment in public schools. The micro data provide us with the additional advantage of allowing us to use a split-sample approach, such as in Card, Mas and Rothstein (2008), to deal with specification search bias that arises when the same time series is used to estimate both the timeline and magnitude of a housing boom (Leamer, 1983).====We find that school district house prices are nearly 20 percent larger by the end of the fifth year of a housing boom, when compared to the pre-boom year (net of other housing booms in the same district, and net of time and district effects). Expenditures per pupil creep up with a one to two-year lag, turning statistically significant at year 3 and becoming 3 percent larger by the fifth year of a boom. With those magnitudes in hand we can back out the house price elasticity of public school finances. We find an elasticity between 0.16 and 0.20, with our favorite specification resulting in 0.18. This relatively small elasticity is justified by the fact that a large fraction of school district revenues now come from state and federal transfers, especially for low income districts.==== We also find slightly larger elasticities for local housing busts, but our research design is only internally valid for housing booms – housing busts are usually accompanied by drops in income and employment that are difficult to disentangle, and homeowners may be more likely to appeal their house value assessments (McMillen, 2013).====The estimates are robust to a number of tests based on samples that include subsets of school districts, by type (unified, elementary, and secondary) or by the level of independence. The estimates are also robust to using different definitions of housing breakpoints, and to the inclusion of a number of demographic characteristics as controls. We further estimate econometric models in levels (as opposed to using logs) in order to recover the portion of an additional dollar in the housing tax base that flows to general school expenditures. We find that a $100 increase in the local housing tax base leads to a $1 increase in school expenditures, which is a reasonable approximation of effective property tax rates in the United States. This also implies that local school districts are not engaging in major changes in statutory tax rates after the begin of a housing boom. In the final robustness test we estimate the same econometric models for U.S. municipalities. Those local jurisdictions also raise part of their revenues via property taxes, and we find a similar housing disease effect.====Our main estimates imply that housing disease, for districts with at least one housing boom, can account for 20 percent of the median growth in public education spending during the 1990s and 2000s. These results imply a breakdown of the theoretically efficient choices made by Tiebout-type households. Since the optimal level of expenditures equates marginal costs (local taxation) with marginal benefits (school services), additional spending induces costs that exceed its benefits. This inefficiency is the cost of housing disease.==== Empirically though, it is natural to ask whether these additional resources are really being wasted.====We address this question by using detailed school district finance data to measure how the additional expenditures generated via housing disease are spent. Total expenditure per pupil increases by $350 five years after a housing boom begins, with $163 assigned to current expenses and $178 allocated to capital expenditures, an almost equal split. Instruction corresponds to almost the totality of the increased current expenses; and we do not find new resources being used to increase administrative expenses, ruling out the worst type of rent seeking.====Among the instructional expenses we also find that pupil-teacher ratios, a proxy for educational quality, improve but at a fairly small rate (less than 1% reduction in pupil-teacher ratio). We also find a large increase in average salaries and benefits: 4.6% and 5.1% respectively by the end of the fifth year of a housing boom. Those changes in school wages occur in contrast to average MSA level changes in personal income that remain flat during the housing booms we study. These wage results could reflect either increases in school personnel quality/productivity or rent-seeking, a possibility raised by Brueckner and Neumark (2014) and Diamond (2017).====Despite this potential ambiguity in the interpretation of the wage effects, the fact that pupil-teacher ratios decreased, capital budgets grew, and administrative expenses remained flat suggests that housing disease is accompanied by improvements in the quality of school inputs, and that bureaucrats are not capturing the increased resources. To check for effects on educational output, we also provide test score estimates based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), though this analysis suffers from additional shortcomings, noisy measurements, and limited statistical power. Not surprisingly, almost none of the test score estimates are statistically different from zero.====Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of the increase in public education spending of 1990s and 2000s. While the large amount of resources devoted to public education still sparks a debate over whether money matters for improving school quality,==== we focus on understanding why the recent growth happened in the first place. We propose and test a new mechanism that is generally not taken into account by standard theory and is difficult to study given data and design limitations. Housing disease may in fact become more relevant in the near future because extreme price fluctuations are becoming a feature of the system as opposed to a one-time bug. Housing markets are now characterized by many local housing booms and busts (Ferreira & Gyourko, 2021; Sinai, 2013), fueled by both behavioral and financial factors (Favara & Imbs, 2015; Mian & Sufi, 2009; Shiller, 2005), and exacerbated by regulations that limit the supply of new housing (Glaeser & Gyourko, 2018).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews how school district finances work and the potential for housing disease; Section 3 then describes the data sources and sample construction; Section 4 then describes our empirical framework and tests the validity of our research design; Section 5 presents our estimates; and Section 6 concludes.",Housing disease and public school finances,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775722000139,25 February 2022,2022,Research Article,87.0

In this paper, I present the first evidence that matching high school students with same-race teachers improves the students’ college enrollment. To address selection and the sorting of students and teachers, I use detailed Texas administrative data on classroom assignment, exploiting variation in student and teacher race within the same course, year, and school, eliminating 99% of observed same-race sorting. Race-matching raises minority students’ course performance as well as improves longer-term outcomes like high school "," show that Black and White students enter school with similar test scores in reading and math, but each year in school widens the gap by 0.1 standard deviations. A number of potential explanations and mechanisms could be behind these differences including differing resources, differing qualities of schools, and others.====One potential mechanism I will examine in this paper is the racial distribution of teachers and how teachers improve outcomes for same-race students. Past literature shows that same-race teachers can also increase students’ short-term, course-level outcomes like test scores, grades, and behavior.==== Teachers may be more effective at communicating and teaching same-race students or may work effectively as role models, updating students’ beliefs about the returns to education or increasing their motivation.==== In support of the role model hypothesis, having a same-race teacher increases teachers’ and students’ expectations of student educational attainment.====The potential of students and teachers to non-randomly sort to each other creates serious selection issues when analyzing how the match affects students’ outcomes. For example, many students may be drawn to a teacher that is the same race as them if they feel that they are lacking a same-race role model. The lack of a role model for the student may make a student more likely to want to choose a teacher with the same race while increasing the benefits of matching with a same-race teacher. This non-random sorting could create positive selection into having a same-race teacher leading a researcher to overestimate the benefit of a same-race teacher. I describe in greater detail in the Methodology section how I try to mitigate this potential positive selection effect on matching and student outcomes.====To address this self-selection concern, I use newly collected Texas administrative data on classroom assignment and exploit institutional details of the assignment of students to teachers in Texas high schools. Texas is an extremely diverse state with large minority populations, making it an excellent setting to analyze racial matching of students and teachers, especially Hispanic and Asian students who have been largely absent from the literature due to a lack of power in the analysis. High school students in Texas have choices over courses, but they lack the choice of teacher conditional on courses. In order to minimize the self-selection of students and teachers, I compare the outcomes of similar students in the same high school that selected the same courses but were assigned teachers of different races. This strategy reduces observable same-race sorting by about 99% for each race. To address concerns of remaining observable and unobservable selection from non-random sorting, I implement the bounding methodology proposed by ==== and show that the results for minority students are largely robust to the potential issue of selection on unobservable characteristics and omitted variable bias.====First, I examine the effect of matching with a same-race teacher in a course on students’ course outcomes. Conditional on student and teacher fixed effects, I show that Black and Asian students perform significantly better on standardized test scores and have higher pass rates in the class that they match with a same-race teacher. These students score better along both objective and subjective measurements of course performance with a same-race teacher, suggesting an increase in learning. I find no significant effect for short-term race matching effects for White or Hispanic students.====.====I also show that race matching in a subject in high school has strong effects for college major choice, especially for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. One additional same-race STEM teacher in high school for Black and Hispanic students increases a student’s likelihood of majoring in STEM as a college freshman by 0.7 p.p. (8.6%) and 0.6 p.p. (6.6%), respectively. An additional Hispanic teacher in social sciences for a Hispanic student increases their likelihood of majoring in social sciences by 0.3 p.p. When examining major choice one concerning pattern is that Black and Hispanic students in college are less likely to major in STEM fields, which have larger wage premiums (====). These differences in major choice could contribute to racial income gaps. My findings paired with the dearth of Black and Hispanic students in STEM fields suggest a need to train and hire more STEM minority teachers.====White teachers make up over 70% of high school teachers in Texas while White students only make up about 35% of the student population. My research suggests that policies to make the teaching population more representative would likely benefit minority students with minimal negative ==== impacting the White student population from having fewer same-race teachers. These benefits of additional minority teachers would decrease the college enrollment gap between White and minority students and likely the wage and unemployment gap given the results on college major choice.====I contribute to the previous literature in three main ways. First, I present the first research examining the effect of race matches in high school on college outcomes such as enrollment and major choice. Second, I include Hispanic and Asians students in my analysis, presenting the first evidence of race-matching for these students on longer-term outcomes like high school graduation and college enrollment. Third, I present evidence on race-matching in Texas, an ideal new setting for this research given its racial diversity. Finally, I add to the literature by providing additional estimates of the short-term effect of matching with a same-race teacher on test scores and pass rates using a large, detailed administrative dataset.====The following is the Supplementary material related to this article.

Consider for example a scholarship or school grants program. These programs might have long-term gains for the initial cohort of students, but are unlikely to benefit future cohorts. Contrast this with teacher professional development (TPD) programs that invest in teachers’ human capital. Such programs could be orders of magnitude more cost-effective if future cohorts taught by the same teacher also learned more as a result of the program. This insight is well-understood when considering investments in physical capital, but less so with human capital. Most, if not all, comparisons of cost-effectiveness (e.g. Dhaliwal et al, 2013) only consider the benefits for the first cohort of students.====There is surprisingly little evidence on the sustained effects of TPD programs on the ==== themselves, which would require assessing students taught by these same teachers in subsequent years. Some evaluations of education interventions have looked at the long-term impact on the original cohort of students (examples include Baird et al (2016) and Millán et al (2020)), but few have looked at the impact on future beneficiaries. For example, none of the studies cited in the recent literature review of TPD programs by Arancibia, Popova, and Evans (2016) examine the impact on learning for future cohorts of students after the program ended. In short, we do not know if successful TPD programs improve human capital, or merely produce a once-off bump in learning.====This paper reports on the sustainability of improved teaching practices through a longitudinal analysis of the teachers and students who participated in a randomized evaluation of two programs aimed at improving the teaching of home language (Setswana) early-grade literacy in 180 public primary schools in South Africa. Of these 180 schools, 50 were randomly assigned to receive residential teacher training workshops (two days at a time, twice a year), 50 were assigned to receive on-site specialist coaching to teachers, and 80 schools were assigned to the control. In both programs, teachers received the same lesson plans and learning materials. The interventions were implemented in a staggered approach, with teachers in a different grade participating every year (grade one teachers in the first year, grade two and three teachers in the second and third years respectively), so most teachers were only directly exposed to the program for one year. In contrast, the same students were exposed to newly trained/coached teachers in all three years (provided they did not repeat any grades). We sampled these students at the beginning of grade 1 (January 2015) and tracked them for two years. After two years of implementation (at the end of 2016), both programs had a significant positive impact on student learning (Cilliers et al, 2020), although the impact was larger in the Coaching arm. Moreover, lesson observations and document inspection revealed significant improvements in teaching practice, especially for teachers that received coaching. We were unable to assess these students at the end of the third and final year of the program (end of 2017).====Towards the end of 2018, roughly a year after the completion of the program, a follow-up round of data collection was conducted to investigate the sustainability of the observed impacts. We assessed a fresh sample of grade three children —the post-treated cohort— who were likely to have been taught by teachers in grades one, two and three who participated in the program in the previous year. We also conducted interviews with grade one and three teachers, to see if teacher knowledge and reported practices were significantly different compared to the control group one and three years after program support had ended. Roughly 77 percent of grade 3 teachers in the treatment arms also taught grade 3 the previous year, and thus participated in the program in 2017.====There are two main results to highlight in this paper. First, we find persistence for both programs in teacher knowledge and use of resources provided by the program, but only teachers that received coaching continued demonstrating improved teaching practices. One year after the program ended, teachers in the Coaching and Training schools were still using the lesson plans and reading materials provided by the program, and displayed better knowledge of the pedagogical principles embedded in the program than the control teachers. However, only in the Coaching arm do we find sustained improvements in teaching practices, the print-richness of the classroom environment, and the number of exercises completed by students. These results suggest that ongoing in-classroom support offered by coaches leads to sustained and meaningful change in teacher practices.====Second, both programs had positive impacts on learning for the post-treated cohort of students (who were taught by teachers one year after exposure to the program), although the effect sizes were substantially smaller— 0.11==== (SE=0.08) and 0.19==== (SE=0.08) for the Training and Coaching arms respectively. In contrast, the impacts for the directly treated cohorts (who were taught by teachers the same year as exposure to the program) were 0.2==== (SE=0.08) and 0.34==== (SE=0.07), respectively, after two years of exposure to the program. Given conservative assumptions we estimate that Training and Coaching are 31 and 35 percent more cost-effective when considering this additional benefit on the subsequent cohort. And, if we consider the potential future benefits over a teacher's lifetime of teaching, Training and Coaching are 44 and 55 percent more cost effective relative to the estimates that only consider the learning gains of the first cohort.==== Coaching remains more cost-effective than Training.====These results build on the existing literature on the sustainability of the impacts of educational interventions and our understanding of how these are affected by the mechanics of changing teacher practice. Structured pedagogy programs —which offer a combination of training, learning aids, and ongoing, on-site coaching— have been found to be highly effective in multiple different contexts (Cilliers et al, 2020; Piper et al, 2018; Snilstviet et al 2016; Kerwin and Thornton, 2018; Kotze et al 2019). Similarly, Castro, Glewee and Montero (2019) found that even in an environment of high teacher turnover and non-compliance, coaching interventions can be moderately effective when implemented at scale. And an evaluation of a national coaching program in Peru found that the impact of coaching on learning persisted even when teachers moved schools, but that the benefits followed the teacher and were lost to the school that the teacher left (Majerowicz and Montero, 2018). Our study extends these findings by measuring the impacts not only on student learning, but also on teacher knowledge, practice, and the classroom environment— both during and after exposure to the program. We also experimentally compare one common modality of professional development (centralized training workshops) with another increasingly favored modality (on-site coaching).====Our results also contribute to the literature around cost-effectiveness of development programs. Previous work highlighted the challenges and possible approaches to comparing cost-effectiveness across different contexts and accounting for uncertainty in estimates (Dhaliwal et al, 2013; Evans and Popova, 2016). Our contribution is meant to highlight an important but previously under-appreciated distinction between investments in human capital (e.g. teacher professional development) that could benefit multiple cohorts of students, and programs that only benefit one cohort.","The Challenge of Sustaining Effective Teaching: Spillovers, Fade-out, and the Cost-effectiveness of Teacher Development Programs",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572100128X,2 February 2022,2022,Research Article,89.0

Closing college campuses and moving learning online has burdened students, added technological difficulties to their learning, and raised significant concerns about those students who depend on college housing, meal plans, jobs, and other support to stay safe and secure (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Moreover, the pandemic has suddenly changed the economic environment many students depend on in maintaining the financial support for their studies. Jobs and internships ensuring financial well-being during their studies have vanished overnight. In addition, the grim labor-market prospects have halted graduates’ career prospects and professional dreams (====; ====; ====).====As working-class neighborhoods in New York City's outer boroughs became the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in mid-March 2020, many in those dense, lower-income areas have been struggling due to lack of resources or because of the emotional impacts of isolation. While the unsettling and difficult health and economic implications of this crisis appear to be disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable people in these communities, the evidence up to date remains scarce. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, the paper documents and quantifies the causal short-term impact of the pandemic on the educational and economic expected and actual outcomes of New York City's public university students. Second, the paper evaluates whether these burdens are greater for the most vulnerable students: low-income students, defined as those who ever received the federal Pell grant; first-generation students; and transfer students. Third, the paper explores the mediator factors behind its main results.====For this purpose, I collected rich student online survey data from Queens College (QC) between July 24th and September 18th 2020, and merged it with academic administrative records to identify Pell grant recipients and observe students’ fall 2019 cumulative GPA. Close to 3200 students responded to the survey. The survey asked them about how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shutdown had changed their academic experience and expectations, as well as their future economic expectations. In addition to collecting subjective information, the survey also collected objective information including employment or earnings loss due to the pandemic, receipt of any emergency relief fund related to COVID-19, and socio-demographic characteristics. To the extent that the survey inquired students on how these outcomes/expectations had changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they reflect individuals’ change from the counterfactual state, without COVID-19. For the subjective ==== to reflect a causal effect of COVID-19 I assume that: (1) students have accurate beliefs about the counterfactual, and (2) there is no systematic bias in students reporting their subjective beliefs. In the methodology section, I discuss why both assumptions are reasonable in this context.====The analysis of the differential impact of COVID-19 on low-income students estimates the causal impact of the pandemic on Pell recipients relative to that on never Pell recipients. To address concerns that these estimates may be confounded by pre-pandemic differences between the two groups of students, I control for a battery of baseline characteristics, including fall 2019 cumulative GPA, known to be associated with ====, as well as employment status and economic wellbeing.====I find that, due to the pandemic, between 14 and 34% of QC students considered dropping a class mostly because they were concerned that their grade would jeopardize their financial assistance. Furthermore, the pandemic reduced freshman students’ retention rate by 26% and modified the ==== plans of 30% of QC students with two fifths of them postponing graduation. The pandemic also deprived 39% of the students of their jobs and reduced the earnings of 35% and the expected household income of 64%.====The analysis in this paper also reveals that the early stages of the pandemic were grimmer for urban college students who ever received the federal Pell grant than students in the same college who had never received the Pell grant (hereafter Pell recipients and never Pell recipients). Pell recipients experienced greater labor-market shocks than never Pell recipients as they were 20% more likely to lose a job due to the pandemic and 17% more likely to experience earning losses than never Pell recipients. Despite being 36% more likely to receive financial support from emergency relief grants and stimulus payments and unemployment benefits from the CARES Act than never Pell recipients, Pell recipients were 65% more likely to have faced food and shelter insecurity, and 15% more likely to expect lower annual household income due to the pandemic than their wealthier peers.====Despite these economic differences across the two groups of students, the only educational differential effect is Pell recipients’ 41% greater likelihood to consider dropping a course during spring 2020 semester. This greater withdrawing consideration is mostly driven by Pell recipients more likely to be concerned that their grade would jeopardize financial assistance than the counterfactual. Consistent with this, Pell recipients were 60% more likely to report to have had difficulties maintaining financial aid than their counterparts.====Other vulnerable students, such as first-generation students and transfer students, were even harder hit. To the extent that first-generation students and transfer students seem to rely less on financial aid than Pell recipients and more on income from wage and ==== jobs, both their educational and employment outcomes were more negatively impacted by the pandemic relative to students whose parents also attended college or those who began college as freshmen.====The current work connects to a well-developed literature that documents the effect of crises on student well-being, such as violent conflicts (====), natural disasters (====) or financial crises (====; ====; ====;====) and college education (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).====The current paper is closest to ==== as these authors examine the impact of COVID-19 on Arizona State University (ASU) students’ experiences and expectations, and study how these effects differ along existing socioeconomic divides. The current paper adds to this earlier work by analyzing the students’ experiences at QC, an urban college with a socially vulnerable and ethnically diverse student population, located within three miles of the epicenter of New York City's COVID-19 outbreak in early spring 2020. Both ASU and QC are in an urban setting, and both are Hispanic minority-serving institutions, but ASU doubles QC in enrollment and acceptance rate as well as in tuition costs. Aucejo and co-authors fielded their survey at the end of April 2020 as spring semester was coming to an end and the COVID-19 positivity rate in Phoenix was 7% (====), COVID-19 hospitalizations were less than 200 per day, and deaths were less than 20 per day. In contrast, the survey at QC was fielded at the end of the summer after NYC had been harshly hit by COVID-19 during April and May 2020 with a positivity rate of 27% to 65% (====, ====), hospitalizations of close to 2000 per day and close to 800 deaths per day. The findings in the current paper corroborate those in the earlier study that the pandemic disrupted both academic and labor-market expectations of college students in the US, and that the most disadvantaged students were harder hit. It is important to underscore that, while the economic, financial and health outcomes of the pandemic are relevant mediating factors as in ASU (====), the estimates in the current paper reveal that the educational impacts of the pandemic at QC remain relevant even after I control for the negative impact of COVID-19 on economic and health outcomes. This stresses that in the case of QC, with a more vulnerable student population than in ASU, the pandemic impacted educational outcomes beyond its effect on students’ economic, financial, and health wellbeing.====The current paper also relates to Rodríguez-Planas (====) reveals students’ differential use of the flexible grading policy based on their financial and academic needs. It also suggests that the flexible grading policy was able to counteract negative shocks, especially among the most disadvantaged students. The current paper complements the administrative records analysis by focusing on students’ self-perceived COVID-19 challenges.====The rest of the paper is structured in the following way. ==== and ==== describe the data and the statistical methods, respectively. ==== presents the results before concluding in ====.====Appendix Table A.1.

Our analysis reveals an increase in the likelihood that high schools in non-suburban areas sent students to the flagship campuses, but ultimately little to no equity-producing changes over this 18-year period in terms of regular attendance at flagships by students who attended high schools without a previous sending history. Thus, the purported high school representation benefits of the policy may not go as far as advocates might have hoped in terms of generating equity of access to the flagship campuses in the state.","The Top 10% Plan admissions policy has now been in place in Texas for over 20 years. This admissions policy was crafted as a potential “race-neutral” alternative to affirmative action admissions in postsecondary education after race-based policies were struck down by the 5th Circuit Court's decision in ==== (1996). The initial Top 10% Plan guaranteed all Texas students’ admission to any four-year public institution of their choice provided they graduate in the top 10% of their senior high school class. This admissions policy sought to exploit the existing racial and ethnic segregation between high schools in the state to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of students admitted to four-year public institutions without explicitly incorporating a student's race and ethnicity into admissions decisions (e.g., Black, Cortes & Lincove, 2015, 2016; Cortes, 2010; Cortes & Lincove, 2016; Niu, Tienda & Cortes, 2006). However, the best estimates of the short-term effects of the Top 10% Plan suggest that, after accounting for demographic changes in the state, it was not able to recover the racial and ethnic diversity that was lost when affirmative action was banned in college admissions (Alfonso & Calcagno, 2007; Harris & Tienda, 2010; Long, 2007; Long & Tienda, 2008). In the long run, race-based affirmative action bans led to persistent declines in the share of traditionally-underrepresented students of color admitted to and enrolling at the public flagship universities in the state relative to their representation in the population, regardless of the alternative policies or strategies that states and universities employed to try to recover the racial diversity lost to the bans (Long & Bateman, 2020).====Although it had limited success in generating racial and ethnic diversity, the Top 10% Plan may have had other benefits, including diversifying the ==== of high schools (i.e., affluent versus poor schools, urban versus rural schools, etc.) that send students to the selective flagship institutions in the state—the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Texas A&M University (TAMU) in College Station (e.g., Montejano, 2001; Niu & Tienda, 2010). In fact, parallel to the goal of increasing racial and ethnic diversity, policymakers hoped the Top 10% Plan would broaden access to Texas's four-year public campuses to all high school students not just those from the few privileged high schools that accounted for a substantial portion of student enrollment, particularly at the flagship institutions (Holley & Spencer, 1999; Tienda, Leicht, Sullivan, Maltese & Lloyd, 2003).====We focus on access to public flagship institutions because of the well-documented monetary returns of attending four-year public colleges (Chetty, Friedman, Saez, Turner & Yagan, 2017; Hoekstra, 2009; Smith, Goodman & Hurwitz, 2020). Indeed, Chetty et al. (2017) note that public colleges and universities are the vehicle of social mobility in the United States. The monetary returns to attendance at a selective state university could be as high as 20 percent (Hoekstra, 2009). Additionally, access to both Texas flagship universities increased both students’ likelihood of graduating with a bachelor's degree and their later earnings (Black, Denning & Rothstein, 2020).====To date, there has been little research conducted on whether the Top 10% Plan increased the pool of high schools across the state, and access of those high schools to the selective flagship campuses. Thus, we look for evidence of changes in the sending patterns of Texas high schools to the flagship campuses by analyzing whether the Top 10% Plan was associated with changes in: (1) the likelihood that high schools sent students to the flagship campuses based on how frequently those high schools had sent students to the flagships prior to the policy; (2) the likelihood that high schools sent students to the flagship campuses according to school characteristics (e.g., student demographics), regardless of prior sending patterns; and lastly, (3) whether new high schools began to send students to the flagship campuses at rates similar to high schools with a regular sending pattern. Previous research found evidence of increased access to UT based on prior sending patterns, though none have looked at the relationship of these policies and changes in sending patterns after 2003 (Long, Saenz & Tienda, 2010; Montejano, 2001).==== As a result, these studies cannot speak to either the long-term benefits of the Top 10% Plan nor how robust the initial changes in high school sending patterns were in the first place. Additionally, Long and his colleagues (2010) did not account for whether high schools with observed increases in access were part of either the Longhorn or Century programs, which may mis-attribute changes in access to the Top 10% Plan instead of these supplemental policies.====A recent study by Black, Denning et al. (2020) demonstrated how the Top 10% Plan altered the population of students who had access to the flagship campuses and that students who gained access had higher graduation rates and earnings. In doing so, they estimate that, through the end of their data in 2002, roughly 200 additional students attended UT each year, relative to a predicted counter-factual group whose class rank is not observed. Here, the authors focused on the important question of how the Top 10% Plan opened access and benefitted individual students rather than answering questions about how the policy may have opened access to students from a wide range of high schools in Texas.====We contribute to the study of how the Top 10% Plan opened access to the flagship campuses in several important ways. We examine 18 years of post-Top 10% Plan data to look for both short- and long-term evidence of ==== to the selective flagship campuses by ==== in Texas. Specifically, we describe the changes in the ==== of high schools to the selective flagship campuses after the enactment of the Top 10% Plan based on the pre-policy sending patterns of high schools to these flagship campuses, as well as the characteristics of high schools that were more likely to send students to the flagship campuses after the implementation of the Top 10% Plan, regardless of prior sending pattern. We also focus on the sending patterns of high schools rather than on the enrollment choices of individual students. This approach helps to reveal whether the Top 10% Plan was associated with enduring changes in access that may reflect a cultural change in attitudes at a high school about enrollment at the flagship campuses rather than one-off choices by individual students that may simply reflect a student's particular circumstances. In other words, we describe the extent to which the share of seats at the flagship campuses shifted in favor of high schools that did not send many (or any) students prior to the implementation of the Top 10% Plan.====We find descriptive evidence that the Top 10% Plan appeared to increase the likelihood that high schools from non-suburban areas of Texas sent students to the flagship campuses. Moreover, high schools with no prior pattern of sending students to the flagship campuses were also more likely to send students once the Top 10% Plan started, but these occurrences were relatively sporadic and did not amount to new regular sending patterns – put differently, these high schools did not become the new feeders’ high schools in the state. In addition, we confirm prior results that demonstrated that the Top 10% Plan did not recover racial diversity lost by Texas's ban on affirmative action by showing that changes in the likelihood that high schools sent students to the flagship campuses were only trivially related to the racial composition of a high school. Lastly, our results also suggest the value of the Longhorn and Century programs in recruiting students to the flagship campuses by showing large increases in the likelihood that high schools that were part of these programs sent students to the flagship campuses.","Uniform admissions, unequal access: Did the top 10% plan increase access to selective flagship institutions?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277572100114X,23 January 2022,2022,Research Article,91.0

BATB requires eligible schools to provide breakfast in the classroom each morning to all children, regardless of income. We show that there is an 11.6 percent increase in the prevalence of children who are overweight after such programs are implemented. Weights at the very low or very high end of the BMI distribution appear unaffected, however, and we find no evidence of an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Moreover, the effect is concentrated mostly on girls, low income, and black children. As for test scores, the effects tend to be positive, but not statistically significant among the early adopters of BATB programs.","In the United States, school breakfasts are usually served in school cafeterias for free or at a reduced price to eligible students whose household income is below certain thresholds of the Federal poverty line (FPL). There is a cost to participation, however, as students must arrive before school and eat in cafeterias away from other students (Bernstein, McLaughlin, Crepinsek & Daft, 2004). Concerns about lower participation have led to experimentation with Breakfast After the Bell (BATB, Food Research & Action Center, 2015). Under this model, meals are served and eaten in the classroom after the school day started, thus increasing the potential for students to take advantage of the opportunity to eat breakfast (Anzman-Frasca, Djang, Halmo, Dolan & Economos, 2015; Bartfeld & Kim, 2010). In addition, these programs are universal and not means tested, so there is no stigma attached to being offered breakfast (Food Research & Action Center, 2015).====It is an open question, however, whether expanding access to school breakfasts in this fashion is beneficial to children's wellbeing and academic achievement. Students may have already been optimally selecting into the existing breakfast programs. If so, offering universal, convenient breakfast may come with an unintended consequence if it leads children to overeat in the morning. While experimenting with such BATB programs, a New York City Health Department internal study suggested that some students served breakfast in the classroom were indeed overloading on calories (Grynbaum, 2012). In a recent randomized trial, a program using the BATB model at some schools in Philadelphia showed that BATB increased incident and prevalent obesity (Polonsky et al., 2019). This is similar to the initial analyses of data collected by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the experiences of moving breakfast from the cafeteria to the classroom (Bernstein et al., 2004). Subsequent, more experimental analyses of schools changing the setting of breakfasts on child weight, however, have not found strong weight effects (Corcoran, Elbel & Schwartz, 2016; Schanzenbach & Zaki, 2014).====As of July 2020, thirteen states have adopted the BATB program, with Massachusetts being the latest going into effect in 2022, requiring all public schools with at least 60 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price (FRP) school meals to offer breakfasts.==== Despite some districts and several states having BATB mandates in effect for quite some time, the health and educational effects of BATB mandates remain uncertain. In this study, we test for the effects of expanding school breakfasts access among early adopters by using the plausibly exogenous implementation of district and state-wide BATB programs. Four states and one very large school district (Dallas) adopted these programs between 2010 and 2016. We use a difference-in-differences methodology and the restricted-use Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–11 (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of elementary school-aged children, to provide an assessment of the effect of these BATB programs on child weight alongside academic outcomes.====We find that the programs are followed by an increase in the probability that a child is overweight (but not obese). These classifications use body mass index (BMI) and follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines that define overweight and obese by age and sex using BMI z-scores. The weight gains we find appears to be concentrated among children in the third quartile of the BMI distribution, right around the age-sex based cutoffs for overweight status for the sample we study.==== At the high and low end of the BMI distribution, there are no discernable effects. We engaged in a number of tests to determine which socioeconomic subgroups of children appear to have their BMI most affected by the BATB initiation. The increased incidence of overweight status is more prevalent in girls. Non-white girls are more affected than white girls, as are girls from low-income families. We also consider the effects of expanding breakfasts on student achievement. The ECLS-K data show positive effects on reading, math, and science assessments. The estimates are imprecisely estimated, however, and cannot rule out zero or even negative effects. These results are consistent with Leos-Urbel, Schwartz, Weinstein and Corcoran (2013).====We stress that our paper is one that identifies the intention-to-treat effect of mandated BATB by states and large districts. Our data do not explicitly measure whether breakfast is eaten. It is the case, however, that schools that implement BATB programs experience substantial increases in the number of students utilizing breakfast programs.==== The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

We define as high stakes grade the final grade of primary or secondary school, because good performance in that grade can affect future opportunities. Our difference-in-differences estimates show that math scores increase on average by 0.17 to 0.22 ==== during high stakes grades, a sizeable effect. Reading scores, however, are not affected.","It is well recognized that student outcomes depend on the effort of students, parents, peers, and teachers, and that these agents respond to incentives – including school vouchers (Behrman et al., 2016, Rouse, 1998), performance-based teacher compensation (Dee and Wyckoff, 2015, Duflo et al., 2012, Glewwe et al., 2010), school accountability systems (Figlio & Loeb, 2011), central examinations (Jürges et al., 2005), cash rewards (Angrist and Victor, 2009, Dearden et al., 2009, Fryer, 2011), and social norms in the class (Bursztyn & Robert, 2015).====There is also a growing awareness that school test scores reflect not only ability, knowledge and intelligence but also personality traits, motivation and incentives. Test takers may not exert maximal effort. When tests are low stakes, as in the OECD PISA project, some individuals try harder than others (see Duckworth et al., 2011). Scores can also be improved by rewarding students (see Borghans et al., 2008, Segal, 2012).====We add to this literature by studying the effect of high stakes conditions on math test scores in the specific context of German primary and secondary schools. In Germany, students at the end of primary education are tracked into different types of secondary education (or tracks), some leading to college education and some others ending up in vocational training. Since selection into tracks often depends on school performance in the final grade of primary school, tests taken during that grade are likely to deliver better results than tests taken in earlier grades. In a similar fashion, students in the final grade of secondary education have much more at stake than students in earlier grades, because their school results in that grade can affect the transition to the labor market and access to vocational training and higher education. Because of the higher incentives to perform well, we classify final grades as high stakes grades.====We exploit two institutional features of the German system: first, the final grade of primary education varies across states (Lander) for students of the same age. In most German states, primary school ends after the fourth grade. In Brandenburg, however, primary education lasts six years. Stakes in the fourth grade are therefore much lower in Brandenburg than elsewhere. Second, the ninth grade is the final grade in lower-tier secondary schools (Hauptschule) but not in middle-tier secondary schools (Realschule), which end instead in the tenth grade. Conditional on age and grade, students enrolled in the former type of schools who take the test in the ninth grade have higher stakes than students enrolled in the latter type.====We use data on repeated assessments of students across different German states and a difference-in-differences technique to evaluate whether high stakes grades in primary and secondary schools affect test scores. We find that math scores in primary and secondary education are 0.22 and 0.17 standard deviations higher when tests are taken during a high stakes grade than when they are not, suggesting that the stake of a grade affects student learning and knowledge. These are substantial effects, given that, as a rule of thumb, student scores typically increase by 0.25 to 0.33 standard deviations during a school year (Wößmann, 2016).====While there are a few studies that find a positive association between student outcomes and final exam periods (Bishop, 1998, Frederiksen, 1994, Neill and Keith, 2001, Winfield, 1990), we are aware of only two papers (Federivcova and Munich, 2017, Jacob, 2005) that estimate the average treatment effects of high stakes situations on test scores by using a difference-in-differences framework similar to ours. Both papers find positive effects of high stakes periods on math achievement.====On the one hand, Jacob (2005) compares the mean math achievement levels of students living in US districts where high stakes testing was on (Chicago) to mid-west districts where stakes were lower, and finds positive effects of high stakes testing (around 0.3 s.d.). His estimates are larger than ours, probably because they capture the combined impact of high stakes on students, teachers and schools, that could be sanctioned in the case of poor performance. On the other hand, Federivcova and Munich (2017) use TIMMS data for Slovak primary students and report that admission exams near the end of primary education, when there is much at stake, increase student math scores by 0.2 standard deviations, similar to our findings. Compared to this study, our investigation explicitly tests for the presence of parallel trends and uses longitudinal rather than repeated cross section data. We are not aware of similar studies based on German data. While Jacob (2005) investigates student performance under high stakes testing, both Federivcova and Munich (2017) and this study look at student performance on a low-stakes test taken in a high stakes grade. We will use the term ==== if student performance on a low-stakes test is affected by the fact that the test was taken during the final grade of primary or secondary school. A positive high stakes grade effect indicates that students have an incentive to increase their knowledge in a high stakes grade, and therefore perform better even in low-stakes tests.====Our paper further complements experiments conducted in schools that investigate the effect of (changes in) stakes on student effort exerted in tests (Gneezy et al., 2019, Levitt et al., 2016). Whereas the internal validity of these experiments is high, one may be concerned about their external validity mainly because participants are aware that they are part of an experiment, which may affect their behavior.====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section introduces the data. Section 3 develops the empirical strategy by discussing the relationship between stakes and timing of assessments, defining the treatment and control groups, and introducing the DiD (difference-in-differences) framework.

Our results are robust to several specification checks that aim to mitigate potential selection bias concerns.,"Over the last three decades, a major change in education worldwide is the rapid expansion of post-primary schooling (Banerjee, Glewwe, Powers, & Wasserman, 2013). In most countries, a majority of youth attends secondary education. A second major change, thanks to more countries participating in international testing, is the increased awareness that the amount of learning taking place in how post-primary schooling varies greatly across national educational systems. Moreover, countries are increasingly aware of the difficulty in improving post-primary performance (OECD, 2016). These changes have led many countries to focus on reforms aimed at improving student achievement in secondary schools.====One popular reform, especially in Latin America, increases the amount of time students spend learning core subject matter, such as mathematics, reading, and sciences. This emphasis on increased instruction is logical since in most Latin American countries students attend school – even secondary school – only a few hours daily. Brazil is an important example of both the challenge in improving post-primary education and increasing time in school to improve educational quality.====In 2003, the average high school in Brazil delivered only 4.5 h of education per day, well below the average of about seven in most OECD countries (Bruns, Evans, & Luque, 2011). The cost of increasing the number of school hours creates challenges in Latin America. Moreover, there is no consensus that extending the school day is beneficial for student achievement (Alfaro, Evans, & Holland, 2015). In Brazil, specifically, the available evidence shows that increasing school day hours without increasing time dedicated to math or language has null effects on student test scores (Almeida, Bresolin, Borges, Mendes, & Menezes-Filho, 2016).====This paper aims to provide new evidence by analyzing a full-day school program in Pernambuco, Brazil. The high school program combines longer school day hours with increased resources. The state government converted regular public schools (4.5 school-day hours) into full-day high schools (8 school-day hours).==== The extended hours were prominent in core curriculum components (language, mathematics, and sciences). Hours of instruction increased by 40–80 percent, depending on the school and subject. While regular schools in Pernambuco have the fewest number of hours of mathematics per week across all 58 PISA countries listed, Pernambuco’s full-day schools are among the top 25 countries in the number of hours of mathematics per week.==== The state government promoted the expansion of the program as one of their central educational policies. During and after this expansion, national test rankings improved for Pernambuco. These results drew the attention of other state and federal authorities, eventually culminating in the federal government’s launching of a national full-day school program.====In this paper, we address three unanswered questions about the full-day school program. First, what are the key components of its full-day school program implemented in Pernambuco? In answering this question, we argue that full-day school programs need to be interpreted as a bundle of changes in school resources rather than as a single feature of school environments. Second, does the full-day school program affect student learning gains? Although this question seems fundamental from a policy standpoint, there is a lack of evidence that establishes a causal link between the full-day program and students’ test scores.==== Third, are different components of the program associated with the effects on student test scores? To answer this question, we explore variation in the program components, including an exploratory analysis measuring heterogeneous impact based on the number of extended days each school implemented.====This paper begins by presenting a comprehensive description of the full-day reform. In Section 2, we use official documents and different data sources to systematize the critical components of the program. While the program changes school resources broadly (e.g., science labs), the increases in amount of time devoted to core curriculum subjects seems to be the reform’s crucial component. We also describe the implementation process of the program which is fundamental for our empirical strategy to identify the effects on student test scores.====A threat to identifying the program’s effects is the selection of students: students attending the full-day program might be different from students attending regular schools. We address this threat by combining new administrative data with causal inference methods that are based on how the program was rolled out. With respect to the data, described in Section 3, we use administrative records to construct a dataset that tracks individual students’ test scores before and after high school. Therefore, all our results can be seen in terms of student gains over their high school years. By doing this, we provide new evidence using panel data and contribute to previous literature, which has analyzed the effects of full-day programs in developing countries on student test scores using only cross-sectional data (Almeida et al., 2016, Bellei, 2009).====Controlling for pre-program test scores does not solve the selection problem: students in areas where full-day high schools were implemented might have larger test score gains than students attending regular schools independently of the program. As a step toward mitigating the selection problem, Section 4 discusses our research design which explores variation in the implementation of the full-day program. In short, the implementation of the full-day program creates two types of variation in treatment status: within and between schools. Within schools, only students starting high school in the year of the program’s implementation get the full-day program; the cohorts attending the same school before the conversion are not eligible for the program. Thus, we can define the treatment group as those exposed to the program and the control group as those that are not exposed to the program within schools. Because the program was not implemented in all high schools, we can also explore variation in program exposure between schools. Altogether, we can implement a two-way fixed effects model to estimate full-day high school program effects, where we compare students in contemporaneous cohorts, controlling for the previous test scores (in a value-added fashion). Our strategy is based on the idea that cohorts before the program in a particular year form a useful counterfactual for cohorts enrolling in the full-day program, after accounting for fixed differences between previous test scores, school fixed effects, and year effects.====In Section 5 we present estimates for the two-way fixed effects model, and we show that attending a school converted into a full-day high school leads to significant gains in student test scores. Our results suggest that finishing high school in the program leads to an average of 0.22 standard deviations increase in standardized math scores and a 0.19 in language (Portuguese) test scores.====These results, however, might be biased because of model specification or because our model does not fully address students’ selection problem. The first reason has been discussed extensively in the literature. The two-way fixed effects model might suffer from incorrect weights for different groups and periods, dynamic treatment effects, etc.==== To mitigate concerns related to these issues, we follow the approach described by Callaway and Sant’Anna (2021) and estimate a non-parametric differences-in-differences that take into account problems of the two-way fixed effects model. We show that our results are robust and we do not find evidence of time effects or dynamic effects that could potentially bias our main results.====Another reason our empirical approach might lead to bias is whether we did not address students’ selection properly. If selection of students happened at the same time the program is implemented, the two-way fixed effects model method does not eliminate the bias, since achievement growth of full-day and regular high school students would be different.====As a robustness check, we estimate the effects of the program using an instrumental variable approach. Using data from before the program started, we constructed an instrument based on a student’s probability of attending a regular or full-day high school, conditional on the distance from the student’s middle school to their potential high schools. Because these probabilities were constructed with pre-program data, they are unlikely to be influenced by selection of students. We then use this instrument to estimate the impact of the extended school day in our two-way fixed effects model.====Our identification using the IV strategy exploits two key influences on students’ attending full-day school: (i) the change in the availability of the full-day program from cohort to cohort and (ii) the distance between each middle school and the available high schools. Altogether, our exclusion restriction requires that any other mechanism through which student’s distance from middle to high school affects test scores is constant across cohorts and any other mechanisms causing test scores to differ between cohorts with and without a full-day school exposure will affect students homogeneously after accounting for the likelihood of attending a particular high school. Our results using the IV are similar to our main results.====In Section 5, we investigate heterogeneous effects and present an exploratory analysis aiming to disentangle the potential sources of student performance gains from the full-day school reform. We show that the effects are larger for students with higher previous test scores, for males and for younger students. There are no heterogeneous effects across student socioeconomic characteristics. We also find that the effects of the program do not vary by teacher characteristics. In terms of school factors, we find no association between principal continuity and test scores. Finally, we also compare the impacts of attending a 5-day or 3-day of full-day school. We find that students in 5-day full-day high schools increase their test scores by 0.26 sd in math and by 0.09 sd in language more than students in 3-day full-day high schools. We argue that these differences might be connected to the use of time for academic activities, given that the infrastructure and human resources in these two types of full-day schools are similar.====Our research contributes to three strands of literature. First, it provides new evidence on the effects on student test scores of extra time on academic activities. Prior research has used different approaches to study these effects. For example, some macro-level evidence suggests that time on a given task matters when explaining differences between countries test scores (e.g. Lavy, 2015, Rivkin and Schiman, 2015). Studies more similar to ours, however, are those that analyze the effects of particular interventions focused on the relationship between the time on academic activities and student test scores (e.g. Agüero and Beleche, 2013, Battistin and Meroni, 2016, Bellei, 2009, Cortes and Goodman, 2014, Huebener et al., 2017, Meyer and Van Klaveren, 2013, Taylor, 2014). Most studies have focused on interventions in developed countries, with a few exceptions, notably Bellei (2009), Agüero and Beleche (2013), and Cabrera-Hernández (2020). We therefore also aim to contribute to understanding the importance of school day hours as a potential input for improving education in developing countries.====Second, this paper adds to the literature on the complementary effects of expanding school resources and task activities on student test scores. Lavy (2016), for instance, has similar conclusions to our study. Lavy (2016) finds positive results of an educational intervention in Israel that combines resources with additional time on academic activities. Our study also indicates, in a very different (and financially constrained) context, that interventions like the full-day school program are successful in increasing students test scores. Third, our research contributes to the emerging literature of how to organize schools to provide opportunities teaching in the right level (Banerjee et al., 2007, Banerjee et al., 2013). Because the program lengthens the school day without radically changing the curriculum, we believe our analysis provides a reference for policies in developing countries that are expanding secondary education.","The effects of public high school subsidies on student test scores: The case of a full-day high school in Pernambuco, Brazil",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775721001151,14 January 2022,2022,Research Article,94.0

Improved nutrition may lead to better academic achievement, but BAB may also cut into instruction time. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation with variation in treatment timing, we find modest negative effects of BAB on math and no effects on English, Language, and Arts (ELA) test scores. The negative effects, while small, were driven by more affluent children. The null findings cannot be explained by the lack of an effect on breakfast participation or school attendance increases. Average ==== by grade indicate positive effects on math scores for vulnerable children when BAB is adopted in earlier grades and negative but modest effects in later grades for more affluent children. Overall, we conclude that BAB can be incorporated into the school day without adversely impacting academic achievement in a meaningful way.","Many schoolchildren are not taking full advantage of school-provided meals. Participation in school breakfast, in particular, is much lower than school lunch. In 2019, only 15 million children participated in the School Breakfast Program (SBP) compared to the nearly 30 million who participated in the National School Lunch Program (USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), 2020). Low participation in the SBP is problematic because there is evidence that breakfast consumption is associated with improved diet (Ask et al., 2006; Bhattacharya et al., 2006; Utter et al., 2007; Fletcher & Frisvold, 2017), which has been shown to enhance cognition among school-aged children (Benton & Parker, 1998; Glewwe et al., 2001; Figlio & Winicki, 2005; Belot & James, 2011). Breakfast consumption may also be protective against excess weight gain (Gleason & Dodd, 2009; Szajewska & Ruszczyński, 2010).====Increasing participation in the SBP has also been identified as one way to reduce food insecurity among children (Gundersen & Ziliak, 2014). Food insecurity among households below 185 percent of the poverty threshold was over 29 percent in 2018 (USDA Economic Research Service (ERS), 2019)====. Food insecurity is associated with adverse health and educational outcomes (Gundersen et al., 2011) and may be one factor driving the growing achievement gap between more- and less-affluent schoolchildren documented by Michelmore and Dynarski (2017).====A growing number of studies have evaluated the link between SBP participation and improved academic achievement (Basch, 2011; Leos-Urbel et al., 2013; Frisvold, 2015; Nanney et al., 2016; Bartfeld et al., 2019). Frisvold (2015) exploits differences in state mandates requiring that SBP be provided to low-income children to present what is arguably the strongest evidence of a causal link between SBP participation and higher performance on math and reading scores among children in lower-income schools.====Our study differs from this earlier literature in that we focus on “breakfast after the bell” (hereafter BAB), a new way of delivering school breakfast. We do not focus on adoption of the SBP itself. In fact, all schools we analyze already provide breakfasts through the SBP. However, BAB is designed to make it easier for more children to take advantage of school breakfasts because a traditional school breakfast schedule requires children to arrive at school before the beginning of classes, which is one factor that contributes to lower participation (Imberman & Kugler, 2014). BAB encompasses a number of delivery models that serve breakfast after the school day commences. These include breakfast served in the classroom, prepackaged grab-and-go breakfasts that children bring to their classrooms at the beginning of the school day, and second-chance breakfasts served mid-morning during a class break. BAB has been shown to meaningfully increase participation in school breakfast (Bartfeld & Kim, 2010; Anzman-Frasca et al., 2015; Soldavini & Ammerman, 2019) and reduce the number of schoolchildren who skip breakfast entirely (Ritchie et al., 2016).====Because schools across the country have discretion on whether to implement BAB delivery, there is a need to better understand its impact on academic outcomes. Given the aforementioned benefits of regular breakfast consumption, BAB could lead to higher achievement, especially among children at risk for poor diets or food insecurity. Moreover, by increasing the number of meals served, BAB can lead to additional federal reimbursement dollars to support child nutrition budgets, which may translate into higher-quality nutrition programs (Story et al., 2006; Monsivais et al., 2011). On the other hand, some educators have expressed concerns that BAB is costly relative to other breakfast delivery models in terms of class time and cleanup (Folta et al., 2016; Krueger et al., 2018). To the extent BAB is disruptive or occupies time that would otherwise be used for instruction, academic performance could suffer after BAB adoption despite more children having access to school breakfasts.====The aim of this study is to examine the effect of BAB on academic achievement among schoolchildren using administrative data from the Arkansas Department of Education. Some schools began adopting BAB delivery as early as 2013 (2012/13 academic year) and others still had not adopted BAB by 2019, the last period in the dataset. We leverage this staggered adoption of BAB among schools to estimate the effect of BAB delivery on math and English Language Arts (ELA) scores. We follow Callaway and Sant'Anna's (2020) difference-in-differences (DID) methodology with multiple time periods and variation in treatment timing to answer three questions. The first has been addressed in in earlier studies, albeit for different regions of the country (Imberman & Kugler, 2014; Anzman-Frasca et al., 2015; Corcoran et al., 2016). This is what is the cumulative average treatment effect of BAB across all grades? The second is do students who were exposed to BAB in different grades have, on average, higher or lower average treatment effects? The third question is how does the effect of attending BAB schools vary with the length of exposure?====Overall, we find limited evidence that BAB delivery impacts academic achievement in our sample of Arkansas students. Specifically, we find that being exposed to BAB reduces math scores by 0.02 standard deviations and no evidence that BAB impacts ELA scores. However, there is evidence of heterogeneity in the effects on math scores by the grade when children were exposed to BAB. We observe positive but insignificant effects for children exposed to BAB in earlier grades (fourth and fifth) and negative effects after sixth grade, with a significant and modest -0.4 standard deviation impact for children exposed to BAB during seventh and eighth grades.====We also present dynamic average treatment effects. These estimates allow us to explore how the effect of being exposed to BAB changes by the amount of time that the student has been exposed. Overall, these effects are insignificant and lead to conclusions consistent with the average treatment effects. However, we observe that the magnitude of the effect increases with the length of exposure. These findings are robust to restricting the sample to children who had BAB for a longer period of time (at least three academic years).====We next explore heterogeneous effects by economic disadvantage. Specifically, we consider students who were never economically disadvantaged, always disadvantaged, and who switched economic status across years. This latter group is of particular importance because these students are from lower-income households but not consistently eligible for free meals over time (Gordanier et al., 2020). Overall, we find a modest statistically significant and negative effect on math only among the more affluent children, those who were never classified as economically disadvantaged. Food insecurity would tend to be less severe among these children and so better access to nutrition through BAB may have been less important relative to disruptions that may have accompanied the adjustment to BAB delivery.====Average treatment effects by grade also help us better understand the heterogeneity in BAB exposure. We observe meaningful positive effects on math scores during fourth grade for children always classified as economically disadvantaged (0.10 standard deviations) and during fifth grade (0.10 standard deviations) for those who switch economic status over time. On the other hand, we observe negative effects for children exposed to BAB after sixth grade. Again, the magnitude for the more affluent children is the largest with a significant effect for those exposed to BAB in seventh grade (-0.06 standard deviations). We also observe a significant negative effect, but smaller in magnitude (-0.05 standard deviations), for those classified as economically disadvantaged and exposed to BAB during eighth grade.====To better understand these findings, we explore two mechanisms by which BAB adoption could impact academic achievement. First, we examine whether BAB meaningfully increases SBP participation in Arkansas. Using district-level data, we are able to show a meaningful association between BAB and SBP participation and conclude that lack of an effect on participation is an unlikely explanation for the limited impact of BAB on test scores. Next, we assess the impact of BAB on attendance as this may be a pathway to better performance (Carrell & Hoekstra, 2010; Frisvold, 2015). Again, we find very small effects of BAB on the percentage of days that students attend school.====This paper builds on the literature analyzing the effect of offering breakfast directly to students in the classroom on academic achievement (Imberman & Kugler, 2014; Anzman-Frasca et al., 2015; Corcoran et al., 2016). Our paper is close to Imberman and Kugler (2014) and Corcoran et al. (2016) who exploit the timing of adoption of BAB in a DID to identify the impact of in-class breakfast on ELA and math scores. However, given recent concerns regarding the use of DID with staggered adoption, which in the presence of dynamic treatment effects could lead to biased estimates (Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Callaway & Sant'Anna, 2020; Chaisemartin & D'Haultfœuille, 2020; Sun & Abraham, 2020; Athey & Imbens, 2021), we implement the estimator developed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020). Their method not only allows estimation of treatment effects by academic grade but also provides valid estimates of the overall average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Moreover, each of the earlier studies examined children in urbanized school districts. Hence, their findings may not generalize broadly to children in non-urban areas because there are important disparities in school resources and school food environments between urban and less-urban areas (Nanney et al., 2016). More broadly, our work also contributes to the recent research analyzing the adoption of universal meals through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) and its impact on academic achievement (Ruffini, 2021; Gordanier et al., 2020). Like BAB, CEP makes breakfast more available to schoolchildren albeit through removal of a monetary constraint as opposed to a temporal constraint.====We organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 describes BAB and the recent findings regarding BAB implementation and academic achievement. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and describes the data and construction of the variables. Section 4 covers the main econometrics results and presents robustness checks.

This information is especially important since re-enrollment programs are being sold as a ‘win-win’ for both schools and students. This paper contributes to the literature by using the National ==== of Youth 1997 cohort with a fixed-effects difference-in-differences regression to estimate recent labor market benefits for stopouts. Re-enrolling and completing a bachelor’s degree leads to a significant increase in employment of 9.8 percentage points and a significant increase in real (2014) annual income of $5,392.","There is a large literature that estimates returns to education; however, most focuses on traditional students who remain continuously enrolled. This ignores the fact that many students have interrupted enrollment, or stopout, while in college. For example, Pretlow, Jackson, and Bryan (2020) report that of the first-time students in the Beginning Postsecondary Study of 2011–2012 entering cohort (BPS:12/17), 38.8 percent stopped out at some point. This paper contributes to the literature by estimating recent returns to bachelor’s degree completion for stopouts.====I show there are economically meaningful benefits to bachelor’s degree completion for stopouts using a fixed-effects difference-in- differences regression and data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 cohort (NLSY97). Students who re-enroll and complete a bachelor’s degree are 9.8 percentage points more likely to be employed, work 2.20 more weeks per quarter, and earn $5392 more in real (2014 dollars) annual income, on average. Allowing the degree to impact both the level and growth of income leads to a significant initial increase of $4294 and a significant annual income growth of $1121.====This is not the first paper to examine labor market returns for those with interrupted enrollment. Literature using less recent data has found that older adults who return for an associate degree or non-degree program at a community college experience similar labor market benefits as those without interrupted enrollment (Leigh & Gill, 1997). Light (1995a) uses the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79) and a model that allows wage paths to behave differently before and after re-enrolling to find that there are meaningful gains for those who re-enroll in school. However, the gains are smaller than for those who are continuously enrolled. While Light (1995a) focuses on white men, Monks (1997) expands the sample to include women and minoritized populations in the NLSY79 and focuses on those with at least 12 years of education but no more than 16 years of education. He finds that the interaction between age and college completion is significant and negative, but the main effect is positive and large enough such that those who complete before age 32 have positive benefits, while those who complete later do not.====Without knowing the recent economic benefits to bachelor’s degree completion for students who stopout during college, it is not possible to compare the costs and benefits of programs and policies aimed at inducing students to re-enroll and complete a bachelor’s degree. Colleges and universities are facing enrollment challenges, as the supply of potential students coming straight from high school is expected to shrink due to lower birth rates (Zahneis, 2021). This could greatly impact the financial situation of many institutions as decreasing state funding has led to an increased reliance on tuition (Webber, 2017). Companies that offer re-enrollment services are telling colleges and universities that it is cheaper to increase enrollment through getting students to return rather than recruiting new ones (for example, see InsideTrack (2021)). Thus, it is important for colleges and universities to think about how to best allocate their recruitment and retention budgets.====Numerous private sector firms exist to help create and implement re-engagement campaigns. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is providing grant support for the City University of New York system to receive free services from ReUp Education, a company that focuses on re-enrollment (Schwartz, 2019). InsideTrack advertises that the average cost per re-enrollment is only $216 (InsideTrack, 2021). Education==== will help colleges and universities “develop a stopout contact strategy” and “scale your stopout campaign” (Gilmore, 2021).====Education companies are not the only ones interested in re- enrollment programs. The National Governors Association has compiled a brief summarizing best practices to help students re-enroll and complete a credential or degree (Alfuth, 2021). For example, Wayne State University has implemented the ‘Warrior Way Back’ program that forgives up to $1500 in debt over three semesters if students return to school (Medley & Rosales, 2020).==== Work is underway to expand the program both regionally and nationally (Medley & Rosales, 2020). In addition to debt forgiveness, some states have targeted those very close to completion such as with Mississippi’s Complete 2 Compete Initiative, some states have focused on streamlining the process to re-enroll such as Indiana’s Next Level Jobs Initiative, and some states focus on personalized assistance to re-enroll such as Tennessee Reconnect (Alfuth, 2021). The Lumina Foundation has also awarded nearly $4 million to Indiana, Maine, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Washington for adult promise programs, which provides tuition free college for adult students (Lumina Foundation, 2017). Aside from concerns over workforce readiness, government may be interested in supporting re-enrollment campaigns to address concerns surrounding student loan default, which is more common among those who left without completing a degree (Dynarksi, 2016). It is important to know if students are benefiting enough to warrant these types of interventions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

To estimate the effect, we created a novel dataset by linking administrative and survey data on students at a medium size Spanish university and used a ==== in which the cutoff is 5, i.e., the pass score in the national grading system. Although obtaining a score just equal to or barely greater than 5 in midterm tests has no immediate consequence for students, it may have a psychological effect by acting as a (de)motivating signal to study and pass the course, with the sign of the effect being unclear ex-ante. We find that obtaining a pass score in at least one midterm has a positive effect on the final exam score. The result seems to be explained by higher students’ motivation when jointly accounting for their effort. Overall, our results suggest that partly unexplored psychological mechanisms may help us deepen our understanding of the determinants of achievement in higher education.","Innate ability is perhaps one of the most important factors influencing educational choices and success in the labor market. However, recent research has shown that even among students with very similar predetermined characteristics and, hence, similar ability, those obtaining a score just above the pass cutoff in at least one high school final test have a higher probability of attending college than those just below in the UK (Machin et al., 2020) and in the US (Papay et al., 2010). Less is known, instead, about the mechanisms driving students’ behavior and how they react to a positive achievement signal. Although it has been hypothesized that psychological factors may play a relevant role in these settings (see for a review Koch et al., 2015, Lavecchia et al., 2016), quantifying them and estimating the clean effect of passing a test on subsequent achievement requires a context in which, first, one or more tests are taken over time and, second, at least one of them is low stake.====In this paper, we take advantage of the assessment structure of the first Math course in Business Economics and in Economics degrees at the University of Alicante in Spain, with two low stakes midterm tests followed by a final exam, to quantify the empirical relevance of a psychological effect in achievement. Midterm tests and exams are graded on a continuous scale from 0 to 10, and 5 is the pass score, as well as in all courses in Spanish universities and traditionally in compulsory education. However, scoring 5.1 rather than 4.9 in the midterm tests has a quantitative irrelevant effect on the probability of passing the Math course since one can take the final exam, regardless of having passed the midterm tests. To test whether barely obtaining a pass score in at least one of two midterm tests leads to an increase in the final exam score, we created a novel dataset by linking administrative and survey data on three cohorts of first-year students in the academic years 2016 to 2019. We estimate the effect by way of a regression discontinuity design (RDD) in which the running variable is the greatest score in the midterm tests and the pass score, i.e., 5, is the cutoff. Importantly, thanks to the surveys we conducted throughout the course, we obtained detailed information on students’ socio-demographics and found that they are similar on both sides of the cutoff, i.e., balanced, thus offering support to the validity of our design.====The most important reason for studying Math achievement in a higher education setting is the widely documented positive relationship between Math achievement, success in a university degree, and in the labor market (Joensen and Nielsen, 2009, Levine and Zimmerman, 1995, Rose and Betts, 2004). Since a Math gender gap has been documented in several studies (see for a review Niederle & Vesterlund, 2010), we have also tested whether gender differences in behavioral responses to signals in the tests could shed light on the reasons underlying such gap.====The behavioral mechanism behind the effect of barely obtaining a pass score in one or more midterm tests is interpreted as being of a mainly psychological nature for two reasons. Firstly, there is no direct consequence for obtaining a score barely greater than or equal to 5 rather than barely smaller than 5, since all students take the same final exam independently of the midterm score. Secondly, although a slightly greater score in the midterm has a negligible effect on the probability of passing the course, those students obtaining a score barely greater than or equal to 5 in the midterm are more likely, in theory and based on anecdotal evidence on students’ reactions, to give a positive interpretation to their score and think that they will do better than others in subsequent assessment in the course. A complementary interpretation is a left-digit effect, that has been documented in related studies in the education literature. For example, based on respondents in a Danish online panel, Olsen (2013) finds a more positive respondents’ evaluation of school performance for those schools whose scoring (i.e., the average grade obtained by pupils) is just to right of an integer relative to just to the left. Similarly, studies based on data on millions of high school students show that students whose SAT scores are just to the left of multiples of 100 are more likely to retake the SAT (Goodman et al., 2020, Pope and Simonsohn, 2011). Kahneman et al. (2021) puts forward the hypothesis that a broad class of behavioral responses to a little change, such as scoring to the left or right of a cutoff, partially due to a mistake, can influence decision-making and reviews evidence supporting the hypothesis.====In our setting, we find that the effect of barely scoring at or above 5 in at least one of the midterms on students’ score in the final exam is positive and significant, with the magnitude being approximately 0.25-0.30 standard deviations of the final exam grade. Although slightly greater, the size of this effect is in line with the magnitude found in the literature for other educational interventions, in particular those related to the effect of positive feedback in college education (Azmat et al., 2019, Bandiera et al., 2015, Brade et al., 2018, Chevalier et al., 2018). Conversely, we find no gender difference: boys and girls react to the signal in the same way. When we assess the validity of our research design, we find that the distribution of the greatest midterm score and of predetermined characteristics, such as gender and socio-demographics, are balanced at the 5 cutoff after dropping observations of students scoring in a small neighborhood of the cutoff, i.e., a “donut” RDD (see Barreca et al., 2011, Barreca et al., 2016). Our results are robust to adding controls, varying the RDD bandwidth or using quadratic specifications.====We also exploit richer survey data, available for a shorter period (2017/18 and 2018/19), to carry out additional empirical exercises. On the one hand, these estimates reinforce the validity of our research design by showing evidence of balancing for an extended set of students’ characteristics, such as high school majors and expectations of achievement in the first Math test. On the other hand, when we use students’ self-reported measures of motivation and effort we find that motivation tends to be more empirically relevant than effort to rationalize our main results.====Our paper contributes to the literature in education with a case study in which a positive signal in midterm tests plays a predominantly psychological role by broadening our knowledge of the behavioral underpinnings of students’ choices. By exploiting a cutoff embedded in assessment systems in Spanish education, it complements related studies on the effect of modifying the information disclosed on achievement or the assessment rules in higher education by way of field experiments. It also contributes to the literature on left-digit effect in the context of education with evidence on college education, while most studies focus on high school exit tests. In addition, our paper speaks to studies on the Math gender gap by suggesting that gender differences in processing information on Math achievement are not relevant mechanisms to explain part of this gap.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the institutions and data. Section 4 describes the research design and assesses its validity.

We compare several measures of transient technical inefficiency and show that around 58% of New York City middle schools are efficient in Math gains, while 16% are efficient in ELA gains. Multivariate inference techniques are used to determine subsets of efficient schools, providing actionable decision rules to help policymakers target resources and incentives.","While improving public school education has been an empirical concern of parents, teachers, researchers, and policymakers for decades, a challenge has been the debate over the balance between increasing financial resources or pressing schools to improve efficiency. This has led to a multi-pronged policy approach in the United States (US), including both increased public-school spending – real per-pupil expenditures in public education increased from $7,000 in 1980 to $14,000 in 2015 (Baron, 2019) – and increased public school accountability – for example, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB; Public Law 107–110). Nonetheless, student academic performance in the US continues to lag other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries despite spending more per pupil (Grosskopf, Hayes & Taylor, 2014). This suggests inefficiency in US public schools, where a lack of competitive market forces may allow it to persist. Consequently, econometrics production models that account for the existence of inefficiency are required, and this paper leverages the stochastic frontier literature (due to Aigner at al. 1977 and Meeusen & van den Broeck, 1977) to estimate and perform inference on inefficiency measures for public middle schools (serving grades 6–8) in New York City (NYC) from 2014 to 2016. The nearest neighbors to our research are three recent stochastic frontier analyses of US public schools: Chakraborty, Biswas and Lewis (2001), Kang and Greene (2002) and Grosskopf et al. (2014). Our research adds to this literature by applying a more flexible production specification (Greene, 2005a, 2005b) and modern inference techniques (Flores-Lagunes et al., 2007, Horrace and Parmeter, 2018; Horrace, 2005), applied to data from the largest and one of the most diverse public-school systems in the country.====Public schools in NYC enroll over 1.1 million students in more than 1,700 schools, of which over 200,000 are in middle school grades (grades 6 through 8) in more than 500 schools. The city's size and diversity provide a unique backdrop for a school efficiency study, because it has many schools (the primary unit of observation) that operate under a common set of regulations, funding mechanisms, and procedures, reducing the potential for heterogeneity bias due to differences in the economic and policy environment. Moreover, understanding school inefficiency in this environment is of great importance as 72.8% of students in NYC public schools are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, a characteristic often negatively associated with educational attainment (Hanushek & Luque, 2003; Kirjavainen, 2012). To this end, we construct a balanced panel of 425 public middle schools that operate from 2012 to 2016 to estimate each school's technical inefficiency for the cohorts of students in grade 8 between the 2014 and 2016 academic years (AY). We begin with a school-level educational production function that measures output during middle school as the gains in mean students’ test scores in Math and English Language Arts (ELA) between grade 5 (in the spring semester before students enter middle school grades) and grade 8 (in the last spring semester of middle school). We use gains in testing outcomes to address concerns that produced outputs (e.g., proficiency rates or mean test scores) are a result of student quality (selection into middle schools) rather than school efficiency. Our production function, then, also includes inputs that broadly fit into three groups – student characteristics, teacher characteristics, and school characteristics – in order to provide estimates of and to control for the marginal effects of other features of the middle school environment.====Aside from being the first stochastic frontier analysis of NYC public schools, to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to apply the “true fixed effect stochastic frontier model” of Greene, 2005a, Greene, 2005b to US school production.==== This model is highly flexible, because it accounts for both persistent (time-invariant) and transient (time-varying) inefficiency shocks. For example, Chakraborty et al. (2001) estimate only persistent inefficiency in a cross-section of Utah public schools. Kang and Greene (2002) estimate only transient inefficiency in an upstate NY public school district. Grosskopf et al. (2014) estimate only persistent inefficiency in public districts in Texas. We find that both persistent and transient inefficiency are present in NYC middle school production and ignoring either component is an empirical mistake.====In addition to improved flexibility of our specification relative to others, our paper considers different measures of transient inefficiency and uses inferential techniques that offer policymakers a methodology to determine groups of schools that are on the efficient frontier. In particular, parametric stochastic frontier models only yield a truncated (below zero) normal distribution of inefficiency conditional on the production function residual for each school. The most common approach to attain point estimates of school-level inefficiency is then to calculate the means of these conditional distributions (Jondrow, Lovell, Materov & Schmidt, 1982) and rank them. However, the mean of a positive and continuous random variable can never be zero, so these point estimates can never identify efficient (inefficiency equal to zero) schools.==== Therefore, in addition to calculating the means of these truncated normal distributions for each school, we calculate their modes as a point estimate of school-level efficiency (Jondrow et al., 1982). Since the truncated normal distribution for each school has a mode at zero inefficiency with positive probability, the mode measure allows for efficiency ties, producing a group of schools that are on the efficient frontier. We also “salvage” the conditional mean point estimate using the inferential techniques in Horrace (2005) and Flores-Lagunes et al. (2007), which may be used to select a subset of schools that are efficient at the 95% level. We compare the cardinality of the set of mode-zero schools to the cardinality of the selected subset based on Horrace (2005).====In the absence of frontier-based analyses, many studies estimate school (and teacher) effectiveness using value-added models (Ladd & Walsh, 2002; Meyer, 1997). We note these techniques are different in both purpose and form from the models we use here. Beginning with purpose, value-added models typically aim to identify the benefits of educational inputs (for example, if value-added increases when a policy is implemented) or the underlying quality of an education-producing unit (i.e., school or teacher), thus largely ignoring transient technical inefficiency. In fact, one of the major controversies of using value-added models for high-stakes public policy decisions stems from the assumption that deviations from each school's (or teacher's) fixed effect==== may provide evidence that estimates are unstable (Koedel, Mihaly & Rockoff, 2015; Schochet & Chiang, 2013).==== The true fixed effect stochastic frontier model allows for a portion of annual deviations to reflect transient inefficiencies in education production (perhaps, for example, related to effort or changes in curriculum) and to estimate the size of transient inefficiency for each unit. Then, in terms of difference in form, traditional value-added models estimate the value-added of a unit as deviations from the conditional mean, while in our model we use the regression equation to develop an efficiency frontier. Using our probability statement technique, then, we can estimate the likelihood that individual units or groups of units operate on this efficiency frontier in a given observation year (or not). Conversely, value-added methods require decisionmakers to designate ==== cut-offs to assign policy levers, perhaps flagging high-value-added units for rewards or low-value-added units for penalty. Taken together, we believe the true fixed effect stochastic frontier model can address some of the major controversies that surround the use of value-added models or previous stochastic frontier techniques used for education policymaking, in part because the model is intended to identify inefficiency rather than quality, and in part because it separates persistent from transient inefficiencies, which allows for better targeting of policy levers towards each form of inefficiency.====In short, we find that student composition of a school is more predictive of production in ELA, while the teacher composition of a school is more predictive of Math production, which is consistent with conventional wisdom that ELA achievement is more reflective of home and individual characteristics, and Math achievement is more reflective of classroom characteristics (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1988). Second, by separating persistent technical inefficiency from transient technical inefficiency, we are able to show that both sources of inefficiency harm the productivity of middle schools in NYC (the conditional means of both sources range from about one-half to a whole standard deviation, depending on subject considered and estimator used). Third, we offer evidence that both efficient and inefficient schools operate in all five boroughs of NYC, suggesting school inefficiency is geographically dispersed and dispersed across schools serving high and low performing students. Fourth, by separating inefficiency from the error term (under our set of distributional assumptions), decisionmakers are better able to assess the extent to which declining exam performance during middle school is due to inefficiency as opposed to statistical noise. Finally, we offer policymakers a pair of actionable decision rules that are methodologically rigorous and reflect true performance of schools, both derived from the true fixed effects model, including application of the conditional mode estimator to identify when schools operate efficiently or the more rigorous Horrace (2005) probabilities to identify a subset of the best.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

This study investigates the effect of age on women’s ","A collection of milestones in a woman’s life – for example, stepping into the workforce, investing in post-college human capital, getting married, and giving birth – occurs in her twenties and thirties. Given the time constraints, age plays a significant role in making such decisions during this period. One natural question is whether women forgo investing in their post-college human capital because they are at a relatively old age. If so, does anticipating the school entry age increase the likelihood of women enrolling in graduate school? This study aims to answer these questions by revealing the effect of age on women’s graduate education choices, a typical post-college human capital investment.====Attending graduate school leads to a series of consequences for women, such as postponed career and marriage. Postponement of such behavior puts women in an unfavorable position in the labor and marriage markets, which is considered the opportunity cost of post-college human capital investment. The opportunity costs of attending graduate school increase with a woman’s age. Moreover, the increase in these opportunity costs is not constant across different ages. The opportunity costs rise sharply when women are sufficiently close to their thirties. In this sense, graduate education choices are substantially different for women of different ages. Therefore, holding the standard schooling years equal, the primary school entry age would also have an essential impact on women’s graduate education decisions.====A major challenge in identifying the effect of school entry age on human capital investments concerns its endogeneity. The endogeneity of school enrollment age would notably bias the estimation. The initial years of the implementation of the Compulsory Education Law (henceforth CEL) in China provide a unique setting to isolate this effect. Specifically, I exploit two exogenous sources of variation in school entry age – namely, the birth month cut-off rule for primary school enrollment (henceforth birth month cut-off) and different legal age thresholds for primary school entry (henceforth legal school entry age) set by the CEL – to examine the impacts on women’s graduate education enrollment in China.==== The low percentage of women’s enrollment in graduate education in China, shown in Fig. 1, motivates this study. Fig. 1 also shows the number of females entering college and graduate school, respectively, from 1998 to 2010 in China. Despite the great increase in the number of female college entrants, the percentage of women enrolling in graduate school remains at a notably low level. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 2, the share of female graduate school entrants is not at par with their male counterparts in 2010 despite the constant increase over the previous decade. These features of graduate education imply that there could be gender-specific factors explaining women’s post-college education choices.====In this study, I employ a double-difference strategy. For brevity, I consider a pool of four types (types A–D) of women who choose to obtain graduate education (see Fig. A.1 in the Appendix). They are heterogeneous in the birth month and legal school entry age, representing four typical patterns of age at primary school enrollment, which are created by the stipulation of the law. Without loss of generality, I assume that these women were all born in 1980. The type-A woman====was born ==== September and entered primary school at the age of ==== in 1986.==== After 16 years of schooling,==== this woman graduates from college in 2002.==== For simplicity, I assume that people enter graduate school in the same year that they graduate from college. That is, this type-A woman enters graduate school in 2002, at which time she turns 22. The type-B woman was born ==== September in 1980, and her legal school entry age was ====. Due to the birth month cut-off set by the CEL, she enters primary school in 1987, one year later than the type-A woman. Hence, this type-B woman enters graduate school in 2003, at which time she turns 23. For the women of type-C and type-D, the legal school entry age was ====. The type-C woman, who was born ==== September, enters graduate school in 2003, at which time she turns 23. The type-D woman, who was born ==== September, enters graduate school in 2004, at which time she turns 24.====As discussed above, the opportunity costs of attending graduate school are different and nonlinear for the four types of women, who are aged 22, 23 (type-B and type-C), and 24, respectively, at the graduate school enrollment. I hypothesize that the opportunity costs increase with age and the function of opportunity costs is convex (positive second derivative). Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that the difference in opportunity costs between the type-D and type-C women would be larger than the difference between the type-B and type-A women. A double-difference approach captures this effect.====Moreover, the double-difference estimation employed in this study could reduce the confounding effects caused by unobservable variables, thus isolating the effect of age. Specifically, the first difference makes comparisons between women born before and after September, that is, type-A versus type-B, and type-C versus type-D. The exogeneity of the birth month ensures that any potential confounder related to educational attainment could be differenced out.====School entry age ==== has an impact on educational outcomes, as shown by a vast body of literature (e.g., Bedard and Dhuey, 2006, Black et al., 2011, Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014, McEwan and Shapiro, 2008, Mühlenweg and Puhani, 2010). These effects are also found in the Chinese population (Chen and Park, 2021, Zhang and Xie, 2018, Zhang et al., 2017). The second difference of this strategy rules out these impacts by comparing the difference between type-D and type-C with the difference between type-B and type-A. In other words, the effect isolated by the double-difference strategy is driven by the disproportionate increase in the opportunity costs at different ages.====The findings of this study are striking. For the female sample, the coefficient estimated by the double-difference approach is negative, a statistically and economically significant result. In particular, the result implies that a one-year increase in the school enrollment age for women entering primary school at age seven relative to those entering at age six is roughly associated with an 18.6% decline in the possibility of graduate school enrollment owing to age. In other words, women who enter school at a relatively old age forgo their graduate education. Similar findings are obtained when the sample is restricted to women who completed college. In contrast, no such effects are present for the male sample.====Two mechanisms are explored to explain the findings: the marriage market and the labor market. Using mediation analysis, it is found that a one-year delay in school enrollment is associated with lower marriage age for women. Further, for both marriage and labor markets, it is found that in counties where women face unfavorable conditions, the adverse effect of school enrollment age on women’s graduate education investment is present.====This study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, this paper is related to the literature that examines the long-term consequences of school entry age. A number of previous studies on school entry age address the short-term influences of the age at which one starts school, such as scholastic performance and educational attainment before higher education (Angrist and Krueger, 1992, Black et al., 2011, Cornelissen and Dustmann, 2019, Datar, 2006, Elder and Lubotsky, 2009). Meanwhile, literature on long-term influences, such as college attendance and labor market outcomes, is limited (Bedard and Dhuey, 2006, Dobkin and Ferreira, 2010, Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014). This study is among the first to investigate the effect of school entry age on graduate education outcomes. Moreover, the underlying mechanism driving the effect is different. Previous studies have mainly focused on a school scenario in which children enter school at different ages and exhibit different levels of academic achievement. In this study, the influences of school entry age on women’s graduate education choices are examined through the channel of marriage and labor markets.====Second, since marriage is one of the mechanisms that explains the findings of this study, this paper adds to a growing body of literature on the impact of women’s relatively short reproductive period on their career choices by providing empirical evidence revealing the role of age (Dessy and Djebbari, 2010, Gershoni and Low, 2021, Low, 2019, Siow, 1998, Zhang, 2021). Theoretical research demonstrates that as a result of the relatively small fertility window, a woman’s human capital investment is costlier during her reproductive years, which in turn leads to a marriage-career trade-off (Dessy and Djebbari, 2010, Low, 2019, Siow, 1998, Zhang, 2021). The time constraints of the fertility window make women highly sensitive to an increase in their age. For example, Low (2021) experimentally identifies the age penalty for women in the marriage market. Gershoni and Low (2021) show that when the time constraint of fertility is loosened by reproductive technology such as IVF, women tend to invest more in their higher education. Consistent with the existing literature, this study shows that women at relatively old age are less likely to pursue graduate education, which could be accounted for by the marriage market prospects. In this sense, this study advances the understanding of the role that a woman’s age and the associated fertility window play in her human capital choices.====Further, this study broadens the literature on the association between marriage and career choices. A series of studies provide direct evidence of the negative effects of family responsibilities on women’s occupational outcomes (e.g., Adda et al., 2017, Buckles, 2008, Herr, 2016, Kleven et al., 2019, Loughran and Zissimopoulos, 2009, Miller, 2011). The current study shows that graduate education, as a typical human capital investment in career development, also has a trade-off relationship with family formation: for women at a relatively old age, the higher opportunity costs in the marriage market keep them away from obtaining post-collegiate education. Note that such negative impacts are rarely observed among men. In this context, this study also contributes to the research on the gender wage gap.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the background of the study, including typical features of Chinese education system, the implementation of the CEL, and marriage patterns in recent decades in China. Section 3 introduces the identification strategy and the data sources. Section 4 presents the baseline estimation results and discusses the potential threats to the empirical strategy.

This effect is constant across different types of holidays (fall, Christmas, winter, Easter, Pentecost, and summer). Moreover, we find evidence of a spike in suicide propensity in the first two days following the end of school holidays. The results are robust to the inclusion of a series of control variables and to different definitions of youth. Overall, this paper suggests that school holidays have a beneficial impact on the well-being of students and that suicide prevention efforts are particularly important in the days following the end of holidays.","School attendance is generally associated with positive outcomes, because it improves the human capital of students. For example, children who have gone to school for more days (Carlsson et al., 2015), those who have not missed classes due to snowfall (Goodman, 2014), and those who have attended schools for more hours per week (Angrist et al., 2013; Dobbie and Fryer Jr, 2013) perform better on standardized tests. This increase in human capital then translates into higher wages (Oreopoulos, 2006).====The benefits of schooling, however, might come at a psychic cost to students (Heckman et al., 2006). This important drawback has received relatively little attention in economics so far, but descriptive data portrays a sad reality. First, a large number of students report being victims of bullying at high school: 8.6% in Germany (Melzer et al., 2012) and 25.9% in the US (Schneider et al., 2012). Second, high expectations from parents and teachers can lead to performance anxiety and take an important toll on students (Wang, 2016). Both bullying and performance anxiety might create a stressful school environment for students.====While stress is difficult to observe, some of its behavioral consequences can be measured. The most salient of them is suicide. It is the third leading cause of death for students. 3,041 suicide-attempts by students from grade 9 to 12 occur daily in the US (Kann et al., 2018) and 7.9% of German adolescents report having attempted a suicide (Brunner et al., 2007). Although significant progress has been made in understanding socio-cultural, developmental, psychiatric, psychological, and family-environmental risk factors of suicide (Bridge et al., 2006), the role of schools on youth suicide propensity is still unsettled. Evidence shows that the number of suicides committed by teenagers is relatively low during the summer and then increases in the fall when the school year starts (Finland: Lahti et al. (2006), United States: Hansen and Lang (2011), Japan: Matsubayashi et al. (2016)) and that the number of youths’ visits to emergency rooms for self-harm is greater during the school year than during vacations (Lueck et al., 2015; Plemmons et al., 2018). Even though these findings suggest a relationship between school attendance and suicides, they are unable to clearly identify causality.====Indeed, the lack of variation in the timing of summer holidays makes it impossible to distinguish between seasonal and school patterns. Hence, the mood of school-aged individuals could simply depend on seasons as is the case for adults (Christodoulou et al., 2012).====This paper is the first to address this empirical challenge by taking advantage of two particularities of the German school system. First, the timing of summer holidays varies across time and states. In 2019, for example, the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate had summer holidays from July 1st to August 9th, while Brandenburg had its holidays from June 20th to August 3rd. In 2015, however, Rhineland-Palatinate had summer holidays from July 27th to September 4th, while Brandenburg had its holidays from July 16th to August 28th. Second, the German school period comprises several holidays throughout the year, which further removes the link between seasons and school holidays. For example, German students typically enjoy a two-week fall holiday, a two-week Christmas holiday, a one-week winter holiday, and a one-week Easter holiday. These two characteristics make it is possible to avoid the usual collinearity between seasonal and school patterns and therefore enable us to disentangle the effects of both of these variables on youth suicide propensity.====Overall, we find a significant decrease in the suicide propensity during holidays. The probability of at least one student committing suicide on a given day in a given state decreases by 0.065 percentage points during school holidays controlling for state, year, month, and day of week fixed effects, which corresponds to a 16% decrease in the daily probability of a suicide. In other words, transforming one school day into a holiday would prevent 0.10 suicides per year across Germany. Moreover, we test whether this effect varies between the different holiday types. We find no evidence to support this hypothesis. In other words, the position of holidays throughout the year does not seem to influence their impact on the probability of youth suicides. Finally, we find that the probability of suicides increases significantly by 30% during the first two days following the end of a holiday. This result suggests that schools should pay particular attention to the mental health of students following a school holiday to prevent suicides.",The perils of returning to school—New insights into the impact of school holidays on youth suicides,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775721001187,12 December 2021,2021,Research Article,100.0

This paper examines the effects of the four-day school week on achievement across 12 states to contextualize these four-day school week impacts nationally. We estimate these effects using a difference-in-differences design with data from the Stanford Educational Data Archive and a proprietary longitudinal national database of four-day school week use from 2009 to 2018. We find reductions in both math and English/language arts achievement when examining four-day school weeks nationally, but these aggregate effects appear to be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across districts. When stratifying four-day week districts into districts with low, middle, and high levels of time in school, we find statistically significant negative effects on math achievement for four-day school week districts with low time in school, but no statistically significant effects for four-day school week districts with middle or high time in school. Our findings suggest that maintaining sufficient overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts contemplating four-day school week adoption.","Brick-and-mortar school environments foster human capital accumulation, social emotional development, and healthy behaviors through daily access to productive academic instruction, school meal programs, physical activity opportunities, and structured face-to-face social interactions with peers, teachers, and administrators. The positive effects of educational input quality (e.g., high-quality teachers, small class sizes, high-quality school infrastructure; see, for example, Angrist & Lavy, 1999; Jackson, 2020; Krueger, 1999; Rockoff, 2004) and the quantity of exposure to these educational inputs (e.g., instructional time; see, for example, Cattaneo, Oggenfuss & Wolter, 2017; Lavy, 2015) on student outcomes from early elementary through adolescence and adulthood are well-documented.====Given these benefits, it is important to consider the academic implications of various alternative school schedules that change the composition or quantity of in-person school exposure. One such schedule, the four-day school week, eliminates one required school day per week — a Friday or Monday – with longer school hours on the remaining four school days to adhere to state-mandated minimum yearly instructional hours requirements. Despite the typical lengthening of the school day, however, districts operating on a four-day schedule typically end up with lower levels of time in school on a weekly basis. The average school day lasts seven hours and 45 min under a four-day school week model and six hours and 54 min under a five-day school week model, resulting in an average weekly reduction of 3.5 h (Thompson, Gunter, Schuna Jr., & Tomayko, 2021). An increasing trend in use of the four-day school week has been observed over the past two decades, with over 1600 schools in 650 school districts, primarily in rural settings, as of the 2018–2019 school year. These shortened school schedules are primarily motivated by financial considerations,==== but teacher retention and student attendance considerations also play a role in four-day school week adoption. Regardless of the rationale for these four-day school week schedules, understanding the ramifications for student achievement is of great importance amongst stakeholders. A sparse, but growing, literature has found mixed evidence on the effects of four-day school week adoption==== on student achievement across several state-specific studies – finding achievement increases in Colorado and decreases in Oklahoma and Oregon.==== Mechanisms such as weekend learning loss and early school start times could play a role in achievement impacts. However, given the documented relationship between instructional time and academic achievement (Cattaneo et et al., 2017; Lavy, 2015), these disparate four-day school week achievement impacts may also be driven by choices over how much time students spend in school under these four-day school week models (Thompson, 2021a).====This study also estimates the causal impact of four-day school week adoption on student achievement, but makes several key contributions to this emerging literature. First, this study provides multi-state estimates of four-day school week achievement effects. We use a difference-in-differences research design to examine the achievement impacts of the four-day school week in 12 states using data on district-level student achievement from the Stanford Educational Data Archive and a proprietary, longitudinal, national database of four-day school week use from 2009 to 2018. This aggregate analysis finds small reductions for both math and English/language arts (ELA) achievement – evidence consistent with the recent state-specific findings.====Second, we provide evidence that these aggregate effects may be masking important heterogeneity due to differences in overall time in school across states and districts. Both overall time in school requirements and instructional time vary significantly across the U.S. (Brixey, 2020; Phelps, Corey, DeMonte, Harrison & Loewenberg Ball, 2012). Additionally, districts adopting the four-day week vary in the extent to which they extend the four in-person days (Thompson et al., 2021). This leads to variation in weekly time in school, which is measured in this study using the difference between the daily start and end time multiplied by the number of school days per week. When stratifying four-day week districts into terciles of low, middle, and high time in school groups and comparing achievement among these subsamples to the sample of five-day school week districts, we find statistically significant reductions in math and ELA achievement for the low time in school four-day school week adopters, but no statistically significant impacts for the middle or high time in school four-day school week districts. Due to the cross-sectional nature of our time in school database, however, we are unable to observe directly whether these low time in school effects are driven by reductions in time in school explicitly associated with the switch to the four-day week, or whether lower time in school preceded the change. Despite this limitation, the evidence suggests that the four-day school week is not detrimental for achievement per se, but that four-day school weeks implemented in districts with low overall time in school are likely to have meaningful negative consequences for student academic progress. Thus, maintaining adequate overall time in school should be a key consideration for school districts thinking about adopting this type of alternative school schedule.",Only a matter of time?

Although grade inflation is unfair and may imply inefficient allocation of human resources, current knowledge of grade inflation effects on individual outcomes is scarce. One explanation is probably the challenge of measuring and estimating causal grade inflation effects. We find that grade inflation at the school level affects earnings mainly through choice of university and the chosen field of education, rather than through enrolment per se, because attending universities of higher quality and pursuing high-paying fields of education have a substantial impact on earnings. On the other hand, high-skilled students attending upper secondary schools without grade inflation and, unexpectedly, low-skilled women attending “lenient” schools are harmed by this. This causes extensive unfairness and, plausibly, detrimental welfare effects.","Grade inflation in the education system exists in many countries. For example, Hurwitz and Lee (2017) show for the US that the proportion of high school students with top grades rose from 39% to 47% in 1998–2016, during a period when SAT scores declined. In Sweden, two changes in the school system caused substantial grade inflation at both the compulsory schooling and upper secondary (Björklund, Fredriksson, Gustafsson & Öckert, 2010; Cliffordson, 2004; Gustafsson & Yang Hansen, 2009; Wikström & Wikström, 2005). First, the grading system changed from a relative to a goal- and criterion-referenced grading system in 1997, and second, school competition increased due to a reform giving students the right to choose a school outside their local catchment area. At the upper secondary school level, grades increased by almost 10 percentage points between 1997 and 2003, without a corresponding increase in standardized tests such as PISA.====This study investigates the impact of upper secondary grade inflation on enrolment in higher education and earnings for the period of massive grade inflation in Sweden. Grade inflation is a consequence of misaligned incentives: grades are inflated for the benefit of students, teachers, and schools, but at the expense of the common good. Also, because grades are bounded from above, grade inflation means more concentrated grades at the upper tail. In a signaling model, it has been shown that inflated grades help mediocre students at the expense of good students (Chan, Hao & Suen, 2007). Our findings support this conclusion: highly skilled students at schools without grade inflation are harmed by grading leniency.====Grade inflation is a policy concern because it can cause mismatches in the labor market and can be unfair. If grade inflation reduces the informative signal of grades, the distribution of skills in the population may be allocated inefficiently. Additionally, grade inflation is likely to cause a change in ranking of individuals (compared to previous school achievements), without changing the skill distribution per se, affecting the probability of being accepted for high-paying fields of education or higher-quality universities. Such re-ranking may have significant welfare costs because of its detrimental impact on higher education as a “sorting mechanism”. However, a positive effect can also be expected: grades may affect perceived self-efficacy, thereby having a real effect on educational attainment. Feedback has been shown to have a positive impact on subsequent test scores (Bandiera, Larcinese & Rasul, 2015).==== Nevertheless, grade inflation generates inequities between and within cohorts and, since school grades are a strong predictor of university achievements in Sweden (Björklund et al., 2010), university selection based on incorrect grading is likely to impose welfare costs. However, to our knowledge, the welfare costs of grade inflation have not been assessed empirically. It is beyond the scope of this study to assess the welfare costs, but suggestive evidence shows that they may be substantial.====To measure grade inflation, we compare students’ grades with results from the Swedish Scholastic Assessment Test (SweSAT), which is taken and administered outside schools. Importantly, the SweSAT does not suffer from the same misaligned incentives as school grades and therefore represents a measure of skills not impacted by grade inflation. Around 55 percent of each student cohort takes SweSAT. By aggregating the difference between upper secondary school grades and the SweSAT results at school level, we use the change in schools’ grade inflation over time to identify a grade inflation effect.==== A caveat is that school grades capture a broader set of skills than SweSAT, which mainly captures cognitive skills. Thus the difference between school grades and SweSAT at the ==== level is not a measure of grading leniency; it is mainly a residual skill measure when removing the cognitive component in grades. When aggregating up the divergence between grades and SweSAT at the school level we capture systematic changes in grades that may be caused by grade inflation.====However, the divergence may also be caused by a systematic sorting of pupils into upper secondary schools based on unobserved non-cognitive skills. The approach is, therefore, complemented by school fixed effect and a control strategy that removes the remaining sorting on non-cognitive skills. Sorting is likely to be related to parental/migration background, but after the control for compulsory grades (plausibly, picking up the sorting on non-cognitive skills) sorting on important background factors have no impact on the results. The remaining biasing factor is changes in schools’ production of non-cognitive abilities over time. However, our results show no evidence of systematic changes in schools’ production of skills. Concisely, our approach isolates systematic changes in grades at the school level, unrelated to a cohort's pre school-achievements and post cognitive skills.====Rigorous diagnostic testing supports that this quantity, indeed, measures grade inflation. Our approach is a development of Wikström and Wikström (2005), who investigate the relationship between school competition and grade inflation.====We show that grade inflation at an intermediate (upper secondary) education level mainly affects admission to higher education. To some extent inflated grades enhance university achievements, suggesting a self-efficacy effect, but the main impact is on the choice of university and field of education. Then, indirectly, a better university and a higher paying field of education implies higher earnings. The signaling value of school grades therefore appears to be limited to university selection, as the direct impact on earnings is small.==== An increase of one standard deviation in grade inflation, exhibited by 16% of the schools, increases earnings by about 5%. The likely consequence is that highly skilled students at schools without grade inflation are harmed by a lower ranking in the competition of study places and that low-skilled women attending “leniently grading” schools are also affected negatively. The latter finding may be due to a negative self-efficacy effect (Bandura, 1997), as a consequence of the relative downgrading of these women's school grades.",The impact of grade inflation on higher education enrolment and earnings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571930024X,14 November 2019,2019,Research Article,108.0

Taking advantage of the fact that assignment to remediation is mainly based on teacher evaluation scores, I use a fuzzy ==== and find that teachers barely assigned to remediation improve their pedagogical practices as measured by their next evaluation scores. While there is suggestive evidence that these teachers’ students obtain higher standardized test scores after the training is complete, this result is not robust, and the suggestive positive impact disappears after one year. I also find that during the year of their teacher’s reevaluation, the students of teachers assigned to remedial training obtain significantly lower test scores. Teachers assigned to remediation report lower prestige and job satisfaction, suggesting that the stigma of being labeled as a low performer leads teachers to put more effort into preparing their teaching evaluations, causing a temporary drop in student learning.","A sizable share of teachers in low- and middle-income countries lack the knowledge and pedagogical skills for effective teaching (Bold, Filmer, Martin, Molina, Stacy, Rockmore, 2017, Bruns, Luque, 2015). Raising the calibre of teachers is critical, as teacher quality is a key determinant of student learning (Araujo, Carneiro, Cruz-Aguayo, Schady, 2016, Hanushek, Rivkin, 2010, Rockoff, 2004). While governments should strive to recruit better teachers, improving the selection of new entrants will not lead to a meaningful increase in the average quality of teachers in the short run, as a large share of public school teachers are civil servants with permanent contracts. Potential policies to upgrade the skills of current teachers include evaluating them (Taylor & Tyler, 2012), giving them feedback (De Hoyos, Ganimian, Holland, 2017, Muralidharan, Sundararaman, 2010), and providing them with training. Even though in-service training for teachers is a major component of non-salary expenditures in most educational systems (Bruns & Luque, 2015),==== many of these programs go unevaluated, and the evidence from those that are assessed is often discouraging (Fryer, 2017, Popova, Evans, Breeding, Arancibia, 2018). A potential pathway to improve the efficiency of in-service training is to use the results of teacher evaluations to target the teachers most in need of training. Training programs can then be tailored to address the weaknesses of each teacher. However, there is no evidence on whether remedial training can improve the skills of low-performing teachers.====This paper investigates the impact of remedial training for low-performing teachers in Chile on their subsequent performance in teaching evaluations and their students’ achievement in standardized tests. In 2003, the Chilean Ministry of Education introduced evaluations for public school teachers. Teachers are periodically evaluated using several instruments such as classroom observations, an extensive lesson plan prepared by the teacher, and peer and supervisor assessments.==== Teachers with a weak performance in this evaluation (roughly the bottom tercile) are required to attend remedial training until their next evaluation in four years’ time. Taking advantage of the fact that assignment to remediation is primarily based on a cutoff rule, I use a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design to obtain causal estimates of the impact of remedial training for teachers first evaluated in 2004–2010. Since not all teachers who were assigned to remedial training take part in it, my estimates capture the impact of being assigned to remediation.====Providing teachers with remedial training could encourage them to improve their skill set, but teachers’ pedagogical skills will not improve if these training programs are ineffective. In contrast to the standard in-service training that teachers in most educational systems receive, remediation requires identifying a group of teachers whose performance is considered inadequate. Singling teachers out in this way has the potential of creating social stigma (Koedel, Li, Springer, & Tan, 2017), which could incentivize teachers to exert more effort, or discourage them and worsen their performance. Using individual-level data on the 38,000 teachers first evaluated between 2004 and 2010, I find that those who are barely assigned to remedial training after their first appraisal have higher reevaluation scores than those who barely avoided training. Importantly, I show that there is no differential attrition or sorting that could bias my estimates, and provide evidence that the density of teachers’ scores in the first evaluation (i.e., the running variable) is smooth across the cutoff, as are the observable characteristics of teachers and the schools they work for. These results are robust to the inclusion of these baseline covariates, and to the choice of bandwidth and functional form. I also find that teachers assigned to remedial training are significantly less likely to report increased prestige and job satisfaction as a consequence of their first evaluation results, indicating the existence of stigma associated with remediation. It is important to mention that low-performing teachers are not only assigned to remediation, they are also excluded from applying for temporary wage increases. Although I cannot disentangle the impact of these two treatments, I present evidence that suggests that the improvement in evaluation scores is, at best, only partially driven by differential salary increases.====While remedial training improves the performance of teachers in their evaluations, it is unclear whether this translates into better teaching. To assess the causal impact of teacher remediation on student learning, I use individual data on student performance in Chile’s yearly nationwide standardized tests in 2005–2016, and compare the test scores of students whose teacher was barely assigned to remediation with those whose teacher barely avoided it.==== Although I find suggestive evidence that the students whose teachers were barely eligible for remedial training obtain higher test scores the year after their teacher completes remediation, these results are not robust. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant difference in test scores the following year. I also find that on the year of their teachers’ reevaluation (also the fourth and final year of training), the students of teachers assigned to remediation score around 0.12 standard deviations lower on their standardized tests. Participating in remedial training and preparing for the teaching evaluations take time, and teachers’ workload is not reduced to compensate for this (Taut, Santelices, Araya, Manzi, 2011, Taut, Sun, 2014). Such a sizable decrease in student learning is thus consistent with a story in which teachers assigned to remediation face the stigma of being labeled as low performers, making them more likely to allocate time away from their duties to prepare for their reevaluation. Taken together, these results indicate that even though remedial training can have a modest impact on the quality of teaching, it can also have unintended consequences that counteract the program’s success.====Although there is an extensive literature on the topic of in-service-training for teachers,==== there are no studies examining the impact of remedial training for low-performing teachers. The closest paper is Jacob and Lefgren (2004), who examine the impact of a reform that placed a subset of elementary schools in Chicago with low reading scores on academic probation. Probation schools received special funding for staff development, as well as technical assistance and enhanced monitoring. Since assignment to probation was based on a cutoff rule, the authors also employ a fuzzy RD design, and find that teacher training had no impact on students’ reading or math scores. However, the remedial training in Jacob and Lefgren (2004) was granted to ==== with low standardized test scores, whereas training in Chile is provided to ==== with low scores in an evaluation of their pedagogical skills. The metric used to assign teachers to remediation (school-level standardized test scores vs. individual evaluations of teachers’ pedagogical skills) and the level at which remediation is provided (every teacher in the school vs. a subset of low-performing teachers) could matter for how teachers respond to remedial training, and how this impacts their students. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the impact of training specifically targeting low-performing teachers.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Chilean teacher evaluation system and its consequences, and Section 3 outlines the regression discontinuity design used for estimating the causal impact of remedial training. Section 4 describes the data and provides details on the sample and its characteristics, and Section 5 presents the main results.

Using data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find that students in all majors differ considerably in the percentage of credits taken within-major, as well as in their overall credit distributions. When credit distributions are taken into account in modeling log-wages, estimated coefficients for college majors often fall by 50% or more. Moreover, estimated log-wage gaps between select pairs of majors often change by orders of magnitude depending on whether we compare individuals whose overall credit distributions correspond to obtaining a low, medium, or high level of credit concentration within the major.","Research on the wage payoffs associated with college majors has constituted an important strand of the “returns to schooling” literature from its genesis in the 1980s (Angle & Wissmann, 1981; Berger, 1988; Daymont & Andrisani, 1984) through recent, innovative efforts to identify causality (Arcidiacono, 2004; Hastings, Neilson, & Zimmerman, 2014; Kirkeboen, Lueven, & Mostad, 2016). Across four decades, the rationale for a focus on college major has invariably been that we observe substantial variation in wages—even after eliminating heterogeneity in school quantity (by focusing on college graduates) and, in some cases, school quality (by using data for a single institution)—because a college education imparts different skills depending on the field of study. Among workers with a bachelor's degree, college major has long been regarded as a suitable proxy for skill.====In this study, we contribute to ongoing efforts to account for skill heterogeneity among college graduates by supplementing college major dummies in log-wage models with detailed measures of college coursework—====, the percentage of total college credits completed in each subject area.==== Even among college graduates with the same major, college credit distributions and, in turn, skills can differ dramatically as a result of heterogeneity in abilities and preferences, the desire to diversify portfolios against future labor market risks, the timing of major selection, institutional requirements, and major-specific requirements. Not all data sources that support the identification of wage payoffs to college majors provide transcript records or similarly detailed information on college credits by field. When the requisite data ==== available, however, we demonstrate that a great deal can be learned by including coursework measures in the analysis. Course credit distributions not only measure skills in more detail than do binary indicators of college major, but they enable us to separate credentialing effects of majors from the skill effects captured by each worker's distribution of completed courses.====To pursue this extension, we use a sample of bachelor's degree recipients who participated in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) and for whom college transcripts were collected and coded. We use transcript data to identify each sample member's college major (using a 13-field taxonomy) and percentage of total college credits earned in each of 13 fields. We first summarize the extent to which major-specific credit concentrations as well as overall credit distributions differ within and across major. We then estimate log-wage models in which the key regressors are, alternatively, college major dummies, “percentage of total college credit” variables, and ==== sets of major and credit variables. By identifying college major coefficients with and without controls for credit distributions, we are able to separate “gross” college major effects from their credentialing effects net of skills. By assigning workers alternative credit distributions corresponding to low, medium, or high levels of concentration in their majors, we can compare conventionally-estimated, “average” payoffs to each major with a ==== of estimates that account for skill differences within and across major.====Our key findings are three-fold: First, college students with the same major often have markedly different credit distributions, although some majors contain more heterogeneity than others. For example, the interquartile range in the percentage of credits completed in the major is as low as 13.2 percentage points for agriculture majors and as high as 34.7 percentage points among students majoring in health professions. Second, the addition of college credit variables to a log-wage model leads to a 42–68% decrease in estimated major coefficients for the most remunerative fields (engineering, health professions, and mathematics/computer science), but an ==== point estimate for the least remunerative major (arts). This implies that the highest-paying majors impart substantial rewards to skill ==== credentialing, while skill effects are negative among arts majors. Third, the estimated log-wage gap between majors is often (but not always) orders-of-magnitude different depending on the assumed credit distributions. For example, we estimate a log-wage gap of 0.073 between social sciences and humanities majors when controlling for major only (along with baseline controls). When we also control for credit distributions, the estimated gap falls to an imprecisely estimated 0.033 if we compare a low-concentration social sciences major to a low-concentration humanities major, and it almost doubles to 0.130 when we instead compare high-concentration majors. At the same time, the estimated log-wage gap between health and business majors remains between 0.15 and 0.18 regardless of how or whether we account for credit distributions. Based on these (and other) findings, we argue that the incorporation of credit measures leads to a more nuanced understanding of wage payoffs to a college education than can be obtained from college major controls alone.","College major, college coursework, and post-college wages",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719303784,22 October 2019,2019,Research Article,111.0

In this paper, we take advantage of plausibly exogenous geographical heterogeneity in the ACA to examine the healthcare education sector's response to increased demand for healthcare services. We look across educational fields, types of degrees, and types of institutions, paying particular attention to settings where our conceptual model predicts heightened responses. We find no statistically significant evidence of increases in graduates and can rule out fairly modest effects. This implies that healthcare production may have adjusted to increased demand from insurance expansion in other ways rather than primarily through new graduates of local healthcare educational markets.","Concern regarding the adequacy of the U.S. healthcare workforce has guided public policy for several decades (Bärnighausen & Bloom 2011; Donelan, Buerhaus, DesRoches, & Burke, 2010; McHugh, Aiken, Cooper, & Miller, 2008). Policy interventions (e.g., visa waivers, federal loan programs) have attempted to influence demand and supply for healthcare workers along both geographic and specialty lines (Richards, Chou, & Lo Sasso, 2009). Additionally, the recent rise in opioid overdose mortality has heightened concerns about the adequacy of the existing workforce to treat addiction disorders, leading to large infusions of government funds to increase workforce education and training (Beck, Manderscheid, & Buerhaus, 2018). Sustained recruitment policy efforts suggest a lack of adequate response in the educational market to demand for workers in the healthcare sector.====Evidence from studies of local economic conditions suggests that the educational sector on the whole appears very responsive to local economic conditions for workers in general (Blom, Cadena, & Keys, 2015; Hershbein, 2012; Johnson, 2013; Kahn, 2010) as well as to expectations about future returns to specific degrees (Baker, Bettinger, Jacob, & Marinescu, 2018; Long, Goldhaber, & Huntington-Klein, 2015; Wiswall & Zafar, 2015). However, these studies also provide evidence suggesting that students are often not fully aware of labor market conditions when choosing general educational avenues. Furthermore, the political sustainability of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been in question from its inception, with over 50 congressional attempts at repeal by early 2014 (O'Keefe, 2014); this may have affected long-term decision-making regarding career choices. Thus, it is not clear that healthcare education would respond to the increased demand for healthcare arising from insurance enrollment gains following policies such as the ACA. Understanding the education sector response is important for economists insofar as it provides evidence on structural economic adjustment behavior to downstream demand shocks, particularly when such shocks occur through upstream public policy actions.====In this study, we examine whether increases in demand for healthcare resulting from the ACA led to subsequent responses in the education market (i.e. training additional workers to meet that demand) in the short run. The 2014 provisions of the ACA insured about 20 million low-to-middle-income non-elderly adults (Garrett & Gangopadhyaya, 2016). Going at least as far back as the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Manning et al., 1987), there is a considerable body of evidence demonstrating that expanded health insurance coverage and increased health insurance generosity increase utilization of healthcare by lowering the amount that the consumer pays for care. Indeed, the 2014 components of the ACA expanded both insurance enrollment and utilization of care considerably (Courtemanche, Friedson, Koller, & Rees, 2019; Courtemanche, Marton, Ukert, Yelowitz, & Zapata, 2017; Frean, Gruber, & Sommers, 2017; Kaestner, Garrett, Chen, Gangopadhyaya, & Fleming, 2017; Miller & Wherry, 2017; Shartzer, Long, & Anderson, 2015; Simon, Soni, & Cawley, 2017; Sommers, Blendon, & Orav, 2016; Sommers, Gunja, Finegold, & Musco, 2015; Wherry & Miller, 2016). However, it is unclear how, if at all, the supply side of the healthcare market adjusted to the influx of newly insured under the ACA.====Shortages of healthcare workers were a major concern even before the ACA was fully implemented (Bodenheimer & Pham, 2010; Dall, Chakrabarti, Lacobucci, Hansari, & West, 2017; Frogner, Spetz, Parente, & Oberlin, 2015; Juraschek, Xiaoming, Ranganathan, & Lin, 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2009; Ku, Jones, Finnegan, Shin, & Rosenbaum, 2009; Parente, Feldman, Spetz, Dowd, & Baggett, 2017; Sargen, Hooker, & Cooper, 2011; Staiger, Auerbach, & Buerhaus, 2012). If the healthcare sector did not have excess capacity prior to the ACA, then to avoid congestion problems, other adjustments within the healthcare market would be necessary to meet the new demand for care upon full implementation of the ACA. For example, the market could increase utilization of labor inputs (increasing hours, hiring more workers, or adjusting the mix of workers to take greater advantage of gains from specialization) or could employ new technologies that allow for greater worker productivity (for example, Telehealth; Chen, Mehrotra, & Auerbach, 2014). However, to some extent the market did not fully adjust, or did not adjust as quickly as necessary: congestion problems have already been observed in wait times for Medicaid appointments (Miller & Wherry, 2017) and in the ambulance sector (Courtemanche et al., 2019).====Dillender (2018) documents that the healthcare sector did increase the demand for healthcare labor as measured by additional job postings. However, it is unknown if this demand for new workers was met, and if so, if it was met by existing reserve workers, by workers from other countries or sectors, or by newly trained workers. Similarly, it is not clear if students or schools have reacted to the increased demand, or if they even perceived the increased demand to likely last in the long term given the ACA's political uncertainty.==== Our study complements this work by exploring the extent to which the educational pipeline for health professionals responded to additional demand in the healthcare labor market. Specifically, we examine whether the number of healthcare degrees completed, which is the joint product of demand and supply in the education market, increased in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA relative to states that did not expand Medicaid. Our investigation rests on the assumption that the difference in new healthcare demand between states that expanded Medicaid and states that did not expand Medicaid is adequate for detecting statistically meaningful estimates of the local healthcare educational sector response. To detect this response, we utilize graduation counts in health professional training programs that were mandatorily reported via the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). We find no evidence of educational pipeline increases and are able to rule out fairly small magnitudes, even in the case of subsectors that might be particularly responsive (such as one-year degrees). Supplementary analyses examining the number of candidates passing standardized licensure exams for nursing also do not display convincing signs of increasing as a result of Medicaid expansion. Consistent with our results, we also find that state and local government higher educational budgets do not show evidence of increases post state Medicaid expansion decisions. Taken together, our results thus imply that pipeline increases for healthcare degrees do not represent one of the major ways in which the supply side is adjusting to the increase in health care demand that followed the expansions.",Does the healthcare educational market respond to short-run local demand?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719301839,21 October 2019,2019,Research Article,112.0

These differences persist after controlling for ,"The aim of this study is to provide new important descriptive statistics on LGBT students. By leveraging novel information contained in the restricted-use version of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), this paper investigates whether LGBT students are more or less likely to complete high school or attend college, and whether they have higher or lower performance while in school.====In order to understand whether or not sexual minorities are a vulnerable sub-population that needs to be supported, policymakers need to know whether LGBT individuals are under-represented in secondary or tertiary education, whether they face specific challenges, and the key factors associated with their educational success. Without such data, policies may be driven by anecdotal evidence and the current political mood, or policymakers may believe that the invisibility of the LGBT population implies that these students do not require any specific intervention.====Within economics, the only published paper on LGB students is by Carpenter (2009). He shows that gays have higher GPA in college; while bisexual females spend less time studying. Even in other social sciences, the evidence is scarce and mainly derived from health surveys (Pearson & Wilkinson, 2017). This paper makes three main contributions to this literature. First and foremost, even if researchers have recently started to analyze labor market outcomes for trans individuals (Geijtenbeek & Plug, 2018), this is the first study to include any nationally representative statistics on trans students’ educational outcomes.====Second, this analysis is based on recent data: the HSLS:09 surveys have been conducted between 2009 and 2016. Most of the previous analyses rely instead on data such as the Add Health containing information on individuals who attended high school in the 1990s. Especially after the decriminalization of homosexuality in 2003 (====), and the progressive legalization of same-sex marriage between 2004 and 2015, the experiences of the LGBT individuals interviewed in the HSLS:09 might have been different due to improvements in social norms and attitudes towards the LGBT community (Flores & Barclay, 2016; Kenny & Patel, 2017; Kreitzer, Hamilton, & Tolbert, 2014; Sansone, 2018; Tankard & Paluck, 2017).====Third, while other surveys focus on adolescent health and health behavior, the HSLS:09 provides an extremely rich set of educational variables relevant for this analysis. For instance, this dataset includes test scores such as the SAT, PSAT and ACT, information on students’ and parents’ educational expectation and aspirations, measures of school identity and discrimination, details on respondents’ college performance, and the main reason behind their decision not to attend college.====This paper shows that LGBT students have poorer educational outcomes: even if they do not perform worse than their peers in several tests such as the SAT, they are less likely to graduate from high school, have lower GPA, and accumulate fewer credits while in school. Furthermore, these students are less likely to apply and attend college. These gaps persist – especially for non-heterosexual students – after controlling for demographic characteristics, family background, state and school fixed effects.====In line with these results, this study shows that LGBT students have lower educational expectations, lower motivation, school engagement and sense of belonging. In addition, these students believe that discrimination has impacted them both while in school and in the workplace. Therefore, future policies should ensure that students with similar ability have the same opportunities and can achieve the same educational outcomes irrespectively of their sexual orientation or gender identity.====The findings in this paper are in contrast with previous studies highlighting higher educational achievements among LGBT adults (Black, Sanders, & Taylor, 2007). This could be due to the fact that some (highly educated) individuals start to identify as LGBT only in adulthood. It could also be that, despite the initial low academic performance in high school, LGBT students quickly catch-up once they live in a more welcoming environment such as a college campus. Another alternative explanation is that low-educated people were less likely to disclose their sexual behavior or relationship status in the past decades. Indeed, Millennials are much more willing to identify as LGBT than older generations (Newport, 2018). In line with this hypothesis, Sansone (2018) found a lower prevalence of individuals without tertiary education among self-reported same-sex couples before the introduction of marriage equality in the U.S.",LGBT students: New evidence on demographics and educational outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719302791,21 October 2019,2019,Research Article,113.0

Our study shows that the adoption of affirmative action increased the enrollment of students from groups explicitly targeted by each policy, particularly public high-school students and Blacks.==== We also demonstrate that these effects were concentrated within more competitive and more prestigious academic programs. Lastly, we find that universities that adopted affirmative action policies with explicit racial criteria experienced an increase in the enrollment of Black students whereas universities that adopted race-neutral policies had no significant changes in the racial profile of their students. These results indicate that affirmative action policies were successful in improving access to higher education for targeted groups. However, we also identify important limitations of these policies.","Affirmative action policy (AAP)==== for college admission is a common practice worldwide; its purpose is to mitigate discrimination by providing access to educational opportunities that otherwise would not be available to individuals from disadvantaged groups. This study examines the effectiveness of these policies in one of the most unequal countries in the world, Brazil.==== Intergenerational inequality persists in Brazil in large part because of educational opportunity gaps among individuals of different socioeconomic strata (Barros, Foguel & Ulyssea, 2006; Ferreira & Veloso, 2006).====Brazilian universities started experimenting with AAPs in the early 2000s, and within less than a decade, most public universities==== had adopted some type of AAP for selecting their students. However, determining the effectiveness of AAPs in changing the profiles of enrolled students is confounded by economic conditions and structural changes that also impacted the application and selection of university students.==== To identify the policy effects, we explore the heterogeneity of AAP adoption by different institutions between 2004 and 2012, a period when Brazilian public universities could determine their own admission policies. We analyze a rich dataset with socioeconomic information from a large sample of freshmen students from all Brazilian federal universities during the period. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we compare changes in the average demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of students enrolled in programs==== from universities that introduced AAP with changes observed in programs from universities that did not adopt those policies. By having a control group, our estimates account for unobserved shocks that were concurrent to the adoption of AAP and that may have affected the selection of all students in Brazilian higher education. We show that, before policy adoption, the trends in the shares of students from disadvantaged groups were parallel across treated and control university programs, thus validating our identification strategy. We also show that the adoption of AAP by treated universities was not associated with other university-specific policies that could also affect the access of disadvantaged students such as a concomitant increase in the number of undergraduate positions.====Our results indicate that in the programs where AAP was adopted, there was a significant increase in the enrollment of students from targeted disadvantaged groups, i.e., public high school students (PHSS) and Blacks. We also observe a significant increase in the enrollment of students with disadvantaged characteristics not explicitly targeted by the policies. Specifically, we see an increase in the share of students with low levels of educational attainment (LLEA) by their parents. Finally, we do not observe any significant changes in the gender composition of treated cohorts.====We also explore heterogeneous policy effects, first, examining impact differences by program competitiveness, and second, evaluating the outcomes of different types of policies, contrasting race-neutral with race-targeted AAPs. We find that policy impacts were concentrated within and only significant for the most prestigious and competitive academic programs. Finally, we observe that the enrollment of Black students was not significantly affected by AAPs with race-neutral eligibility criteria. In contrast, in programs where race-targeted policies were adopted, there was a significant increase in the enrollment of Blacks. Meanwhile, both types of AAPs led to similar increases in the enrollment of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.====The Brazilian setting contrasts with the American and Indian experiences of AAP for college admission, which are the most commonly studied cases in the literature. In the USA, universities are not required to disclose how they weigh racial preferences in their admission decisions. Therefore, policy effects cannot be measured directly. In India, all public universities are required to comply with the same specific policies defined by the government, precluding the comparison of different types of policies. Other studies have evaluated the impact of AAP in Brazil; however, they were either restricted to one university or analyzed a period with little variation in policy across universities.==== Our analysis, however, includes all Brazilian federal universities, identifying a control group consisting of universities that had not adopted any type of AAP in the period of our evaluation.====Therefore, our paper contributes to the literature by examining the effects of AAPs on the enrollment of students from targeted and non-targeted deprived groups for a large number of universities and several types of academic programs. It also accounts for concurrent structural changes and compares the effects of different types of AAPs in a setting (Brazil) with transparent student admission criteria and variation in the policies adopted by institutions.====The remainder of the paper is divided as follows. Section 2 describes the use of AAPs for student admission and revisits the existing empirical literature about its impacts and the institutional background of its adoption in Brazil. Section 3 details our data and Section 4 presents our empirical strategy and discusses its results.

However, neither student-teacher ratios nor school attendance rates improved in the wake of oil discoveries.","The discovery and exploitation of resource wealth is typically associated with substantial increases in local governments’ revenue. Municipalities, counties and states benefit from resource extraction in the form of royalty payments or increased taxes. However, previous studies on a variety of countries have typically found mixed evidence for improvements in public goods provision due to resource windfalls. While some studies find positive effects (Brueckner, Gradstein, 2016, Maldonado, 2017, Olsson, Valsecchi, 2015, Smith, 2015), several others find that resource windfalls do not help or even harm public goods provision (Caselli, Michaels, 2013, Farzanegan, Thum, 2017, Gylfason, 2001, Martinez, 2016, Vicente, 2010). Moreover, there is little evidence on how resource windfalls affect the provision of public services to underprivileged groups.====In this paper, I study how the discovery of major oil fields in the Southwestern United States affected education provision. Starting in Texas in the late 19th century, many regions in the Southern and Southwestern United States discovered large oil fields and experienced oil booms that led to structural transformation and urbanization (Maurer, Potlogea, 2017, Michaels, 2011, Pratt, 1980). This new wealth also greatly increased local governments’ tax revenue and thus the means available to invest in education. The question of this paper is whether this additional tax revenue increased the provision of education, and how it affected the educational differences between whites and blacks.====Using exogenous variation in resource wealth provided by a series of staggered oil discoveries in the early 20th century and a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that oil wealth led to increases in education spending per capita of around 20%. The evidence for improved education quality in the wake of oil discoveries is more ambiguous: Wages for both black and white teachers increased significantly, and oil-rich counties managed to attract more teachers and better-educated white teachers. On the other hand, population increased, and as consequence student-teacher ratios remained unchanged or slightly increased. Similarly, oil booms also increased average local wages more than teacher wages, worsening teachers’ relative wages.====When turning to the question whether the additional spending also benefited blacks, the evidence is also mixed. Oil-rich counties participated more intensively in the Rosenwald school building program that was targeted at rural black children: They spent more public money on Rosenwald contributions and hired more teachers for Rosenwald schools, increasing the share of black children theoretically covered. However, overall student-teacher ratios for black children if anything increased slightly. A possible explanation for this is that Rosenwald spending crowded out other public money that would have gone towards black education anyways, a mechanism already documented by Carruthers and Wanamaker (2013). Overall, my results indicate that oil discoveries improved the quality of education along some dimensions, but oil wealth does not seem to have furthered the educational catch-up of blacks.====Resource wealth has been documented to bring about a variety of negative effects====: it fuels inter-state wars (Caselli, Morelli, & Rohner, 2015) as well as internal armed conflict (Berman, Couttenier, Rohner, Thoenig, 2017, Lei, Michaels, 2013), it might impede democratic development (e.g. Caselli, Tesei, 2016, Ross, 2012), and worsen employment and political prospects for women (Kotsadam, Tolonen, 2016, Ross, 2008, Ross, 2012). My findings stand in contrast to these negative results. They are in line, however, with several papers that have documented positive or less negative effects of oil wealth in the case of the United States (Allcott, Keniston, 2018, Basso, 2017, James, 2017, Maurer, Potlogea, 2017, Michaels, 2011). In addition, my results further support Martinez’s (2016) finding that internally raised taxes do lead to increased public spending.====The case of the US South is also interesting in its own right, as this region’s educational policies have received considerable attention. The first half of the 20th century saw a remarkable catch-up of black children in basic schooling (Collins, Margo, 2006, Margo, 1990). Economic historians have identified several important drivers of this catch-up that include the work of Northern philanthropists (Aaronson, Mazumder, 2011, Carruthers, Wanamaker, 2013, Donohue III, Heckman, Todd, 2002, Kreisman, 2017), litigation by the NAACP (Donohue et al., 2002) and moving out of child labor intensive cotton production (Baker, 2015). My paper analyzes whether increases in county revenue due to oil wealth contributed to this catch-up, though with the caveat that oil wealth affected only the Western part of South, and not the whole region.====Previous studies on the US South have shown that increases in untargeted education funds often went exclusively to whites (Baker 2016), while even funds targeted at blacks often were partly diverted to whites (Carruthers & Wanamaker, 2013). My setting lies at the intersection of these two papers: Oil booms provided increases in untargeted funds, but at a time when counties could “ invest” funds to benefit from matching Rosenwald grants for black schools. I document that oil increased the propensity to spend public money on the Rosenwald program, but this did not lower student-teacher ratios and thus might have crowded out other spending.====A closely related paper to mine in a modern setting is Marchand and Weber (2017) who analyze the effect of the recent shale gas boom in Texas on education spending and outcomes. They find that in spite of increased local revenue and school spending, average student test scores in counties that benefited from the shale gas boom declined. The likely reason for this is that the additional revenue went largely to capital and debt expenses, and to a reduction in property tax rates. Teacher wages were not raised and thus did not keep up with local wage growth. As a result, teacher turnover increased, and more experienced teachers left. In my historical setting, on the other hand, it seems that the additional revenue was more likely to be used to hire better teachers and increase their pay, even though this still was not enough to reduce student-teacher ratios. Michaels (2011) also finds positive effects of oil wealth on the fraction of the population with at least a high school degree, indicating improved education. My results add to his by also studying the effect of oil wealth on the quality of education provided, and by analyzing the implications for the racial education gap. Using a panel set-up with a difference-in-differences strategy, I am also able to relax the identifying assumptions of his paper, which relies on cross-sectional variation in oil endowments. Another closely related paper is Baker (2016) who uses discontinuities in school fund apportionment rules in Georgia in the 1910s to estimate how spending on black and white students reacted to budget cuts or expansions. He finds that expenditures on white students followed the budget shocks closely, while black students were virtually not affected at all. Spending on black students was kept at the minimum level that would still comply with federal and state laws and thus avoid litigation. There are two important differences between his set-up and mine. Firstly, Baker studies increases in unconditional funds, while oil discoveries happened at a time when the Rosenwald pogram provided grants conditional on fostering black education. Secondly, the bulk of oil discoveries happened in the 1920s and later, when the ratio of black-to-white student expenditures was increasing already (Margo, 1990).",Oil discoveries and education provision in the Postbellum South,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718307817,16 September 2019,2019,Research Article,115.0

This paper seeks to address this gap by evaluating the impact of the Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) policy -a policy that allowed for a more efficient mode of inter-island transfer within the country -on school attendance in the Philippines. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we compare the school attendance of children in municipalities near the Ro-Ro and the non-Ro-Ro ports over the span of ten years. Our results show consistent improvements in school attendance of males and females in the primary, secondary and tertiary level of education in areas near the Ro-Ro ports. We also observe a reduction in child employment, especially in males. Additional tests reveal that the Ro-Ro policy was able to affect children's education through increased household income in areas near the Ro-Ro ports.","There exists a considerable literature on the importance of transport connectivity in an economy. The common thesis among existing studies is that it stimulates local growth. As explained by Minten and Kyle (1999), transport connectivity improves the efficiency of local economies because increased mobility and lower costs associated with resource transfer, allow local economies to strategically allocate their resources into more productive uses. On the reverse, having limited connectivity constraints local growth because it limits trade opportunities as well as the transfer f beneficial knowledge and production technologies (Basilio, Faustino, Acena & Hernandez, 2010). A common strategy to increase connectivity is to invest in transport infrastructure, which most of the governments as well as international organizations such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have been doing for the past several years.====Although past studies have largely focus on the impact of building road and railway infrastructure, the literature nevertheless provides a general picture of how improved transport connectivity affects local economies. The most highly noted effect relates to reduced transport cost and increased mobility, resulting to higher market activities. For instance, the study of Limao and Venables (2001) observe higher trade volumes with lower transport costs. The highlight of their study centers on a country's level of infrastructure as an important determinant of transport costs. Ahlfeldt and Feddersen (2010) similarly observe higher economic activities after a high-speed railway system was built between Cologne and Frankfurt, Germany. As explained in the study of Fan and Chan-Kang (2004), there is a tendency for small enterprises to locate in areas near public infrastructure such as roads, electricity and telecommunication facilities. Fan, Jitsuchon and Mergakunnavut (2004) relatedly confirms that transport infrastructure does encourage small non-farm businesses such as food processing and marketing enterprises, electronic repair shops, transportation and trade, and restaurant services, and these provide employment opportunities to the local population. Hence, the presence of new local enterprises benefits the local economies through increased employment that effectively leads to higher income (Aschauer, 1989, Easterly and Rebelo, 1993, Fernald, 1999) and higher economic growth (Banerjee, Duflo & Qian, 2012).====However, the literature on the linkage between general public infrastructure and children's education is rather scarce. In a theoretical context, Agénor (2011) develops a model of endogenous growth, in which the production of human capital requires not only public expenditures on education services but also access to infrastructure capital. Saghir (2005) reports that 72% of children living in a household with electricity attended school in the late 1990s in Nicaragua, compared to 50% of those living in a household without electricity. Pal (2010) finds that in India, private schools are more likely to exist in more developed villages with better access to public infrastructure such as road, piped water, electricity, phone and post-office. A recent paper (Aggarwal, 2018) explores this topic by analyzing the impact of improved roads in India. The study reveals that younger kids in households near the roads were more likely to be enrolled in school. Older students (teenagers) on the other hand, were found to drop out of school as a response to expanded market labor opportunities brought by the provision of paved roads.====In developing countries, income remains to be a primary consideration for school attendance. It is reasonable to expect that when income is high, the household's ability to send children to school is also high. Several studies (Chernichovsky, 1985, Galenson, 1999, Jamison and Lockheed, 1987, Wydick, 1999) have verified a positive association between income and school attendance. Other studies (Binder and Scrogin, 1999, King and Lillard, 1987) also confirm the high possibility of young family members dropping out of school in cases where household income falls below a certain threshold. A less explored aspect is how the gains in income from improved transport connectivity are translated to other secondary effects such as investments in human capital. Such information is important in understanding the full effects using limited resources to fund public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, trains, and the like.====Similar with the work of Aggarwal (2018), this paper aims to supplement the gap in the literature by studying the link between improved inter-island connectivity and human capital investment in the Philippines. Our paper centers on the Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) policy that was implemented in 2003. This policy was conceptualized to allow the use of a more efficient and cost-effective mode of inter-island transfer that effectively connects the sea and road networks to enhance mobility within the country. We provide an interesting angle on the Ro-Ro policy since it was not intended to impact children's education. We particularly look at the change in school attendance in areas near the Ro-Ro ports, before and after the policy implementation, to uncover other possible effects of infrastructure investment and improved transport connectivity that is commonly overlooked in previous studies. The ultimate goal of our paper is to reveal age-specific and gender-specific impacts of an improvement in inter-island transport system. Our findings will be useful for policymakers in terms of understanding how transport connectivity and investments in transport infrastructure translate into welfare-improving results for local economies.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we provide a brief background on the Ro-Ro policy in Section 2. Then, we discuss our estimation strategy in Section 3. In Section 4, we cite our sources and present a first look at our data. We examine our results in Section 5, perform some robustness checks in Section 6, and finally, present our conclusion in Section 7.",Does public infrastructure affect human capital?

We conducted a random assignment experiment in 66 fourth- and fifth-grade mathematics classrooms to evaluate the predictive validity of three measures of teacher performance: value-added, classroom observations, and student surveys. Combining our results with those from two previous random assignment experiments, we provide additional experimental evidence that value-added measures are unbiased predictors of teacher performance. Though results for the other two measures are less precise, we find that classroom observation scores are predictive of teachers’ performance after random assignment while student surveys are not. These results thus lend support to teacher evaluation systems that use value-added and classroom observations, but suggest practitioners should proceed with caution when considering student survey measures for teacher evaluation.","For decades, researchers have documented heterogeneity in student achievement gains across teachers’ classrooms (e.g., Gordon et al., 2006, Jacob and Lefgren, 2005, Kane et al., 2008, McCaffrey et al., 2004, Rivkin et al., 2005, Rockoff, 2004). Such findings have inspired widespread efforts by states and districts to measure and reward teacher performance based primarily on three types of measures: student test achievement gains, classroom observations, and student surveys. In fact, between 2008 and 2014, nearly every state reformed their teacher evaluation policies to include one or more of such measures (Minnici, 2014). Yet, legitimate questions have been raised about whether these measures reflect the causal impacts of teachers, or are instead driven by unmeasured characteristics of the students they teach. Test-based measures (i.e., value-added estimates) have been most controversial in this regard, but the same questions could be raised regarding classroom observations and student surveys. If any of these measures do not accurately reflect teachers’ true performance, district and school policies relying on them will be misguided.====In this study, we use a sample of fourth- and fifth-grade mathematics teachers to test the predictive validity of three commonly-used measures in teacher evaluation. Across three school years, we generated teacher quality measures based on student test scores (i.e., value-added), classroom observation ratings, and student perception surveys. In the first two years of the study, we collected scores on all three measures under normal conditions. In the third year of the study, we randomly assigned participating teachers to classrooms within their schools and then again collected all three measures of teacher quality. Using those data, we ask two questions regarding the predictive validity of these measures:====If unmeasured characteristics of students drive distinctions between teachers during the first two years, we would not expect performance from the prior period to predict performance following random assignment. Moreover, the magnitude of the relationship will illustrate the degree of forecast bias (henceforth referred to simply as “bias”) in estimates of teaching performance measured under naturally occurring settings (i.e., when classrooms are not randomly assigned).==== By addressing these questions, we make three primary contributions in this study.====First, we contribute to the accumulating evidence of the predictive validity of value-added. Consistent with previous random assignment studies, we find that test-based value-added measures are unbiased predictors of teachers’ impacts on student achievement following random assignment. However, while these experimental results rely on fewer assumptions than other quasi-experimental tests of bias, they are less precise. Thus, to generate a more precise experimental estimate, we use meta-analytic methods to combine the results from the current study with those from the two existing within-school random assignment experiments. The pooled experimental estimate shows that value-added is a valid predictor of students’ average test scores following random assignment and is more precise than existing experimental evidence.====Second, we present new evidence on the predictive validity of classroom observations and student surveys. Because students are typically not randomly assigned to teachers, performance on such measures may be driven by the same selection biases as the more-often criticized test-based measures. We find that teachers’ scores on classroom observations conducted under natural assignment of students are predictive of teachers’ observation scores after random assignment. More specifically, we fail to reject the hypothesis of a coefficient of one (i.e., teachers’ observation scores under natural assignment perfectly predict observation scores after random assignment) and reject the hypothesis of zero (i.e., no predictive power). However, because these estimates are less precise than those for value-added, we also cannot reject reasonable amounts of forecast bias (the 95% confidence interval ranges from 0.51 to 1.65). For student survey responses, we reject the hypothesis of one and fail to reject the hypothesis of zero, suggesting that non-experimental student survey responses contain little information about teachers’ underlying performance; these estimates, again, are substantially less precise than those for value-added.====Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of these three measures to control variables. In practice, value-added models typically control for (at least) students’ baseline test scores, while classroom observations typically include no such controls. Consistent with the prior research on value-added, we find that it is essential to control for student baseline test scores to generate an unbiased predictor of teacher effects. However, unlike value-added, we find that the predictive power of observation measures is unaffected by the exclusion of student- or classroom-level control variables. While our study is limited to fourth and fifth-grade mathematics classrooms, this finding provides support for observation measures as they are typically operationalized in current state evaluation systems (i.e., without adjusting for classroom composition).","An experimental evaluation of three teacher quality measures: Value-added, classroom observations, and student surveys",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719302717,14 August 2019,2019,Research Article,118.0

To address the endogeneity of labor market conditions, we construct gender-specific predicted employment growth rates at the state level by interacting an industry’s share in a state’s employment with the industry’s national growth rate. We find that an increase in employment opportunities for men leads to an improvement in children’s cognitive achievement as measured by reading and math test scores. Additionally, our estimates show a positive and significant effect of male-specific employment growth on children’s Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores and in home environment in the year of birth. We find an insignificant positive effect of buoyancy in females’ employment opportunities on said test scores.","The early months of a newborn’s life are considered to have a profound and persistent role in formulating children’s cognitive skills.==== For example, early months largely determine the formation of synapses that permit communication between neurons, and the human brain reaches 50% of its mature weight by six months of age (see Woodhead, 2006 for an extensive review). Having been born in periods of labor market buoyancy may help children’s chances of having sufficient nutrient intake and a better living environment. Parents that can afford to purchase toys, musical instruments, and other educational materials may help stimulate children’s cognitive ability. However, when the labor market is in a downturn, parents may have decreasing income levels, increasing mental stress, a deteriorating health condition, and a worsening home environment. This might deprive children from getting not only adequate nutrition, but also parental attention and emotional support, thus creating negative consequences for the child’s development. At the same time, higher unemployment, which is associated with a decrease in labor supply, might yield more available time for parents, traditionally mothers, to engage in home production and take better care of the child. Given the importance of early life in laying the foundation for children’s human capital accumulation and long-term prospects,==== this paper investigates the link between labor market conditions at birth and cognitive achievement during childhood.====The crucial empirical problem of analyzing the effect of parents’ labor market conditions at birth on outcomes later in life is that unobserved heterogeneity could jointly affect parental labor-market activity and children’s educational attainment. Those parents who are more likely to be unemployed or lose jobs might have socioeconomic and home environments that are detrimental to children’s progress. One potential approach to address this concern is to use a measure of labor market outcomes constructed at the macro level, such as the unemployment rate (van den Berg, Lindeboom, & Portrait, 2006). However, the main concern with the unemployment rate is that it is affected by both labor demand and supply, and differences in parents’ labor supply behavior is related to differences in unemployment rates and in children’s educational outcomes. Welfare programs in the U.S. that are normally expanded during periods of high unemployment are criticized for distorting work incentives and labor supply, resulting in a rise in the unemployment rate. For instance, Barro (2010) and Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2015)) argue that the unemployment rate after the great recession of 2008–09 was artificially high because individuals were not returning to work due to a generous expansion of unemployment benefits. Likewise, the unemployment rate differs across race, ethnicity, and educational levels. The concentration of a particular racial or an (un)educated group in a particular state affects the state’s unemployment rate. Differences in children’s cognitive achievement associated with the unemployment rate could be the result of the composition of the unemployed.====To address potential confounders, this paper constructs predicted labor demand growth, which is arguably exogenous at the individual level. To do so, we calculate the share of each industry in a state’s employment in the base year and interact it with the growth rate of the corresponding industry at the national level. We construct separate predicted growth rates for men and women to examine if improved employment opportunities for men and women have differential effects. Our empirical strategy is based on Bartik (1991)) “shift-share” approach,==== which has been applied by Katz and Murphy (1992), Page, Schaller, and Simon (2019), Aizer (2010), and Allcott and Keniston (2018), among others, in different contexts. Our analysis uses children from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) Child and Young Adult that follows biological mothers in the NLSY79. The survey is conducted every other year (from 1986 to 2014) and has a rich set of information including widely used measures of cognitive ability such as math and reading scores and family background. We use children born between 1978 and 2009, who were 5 to 14 years of age, a group whose math and reading scores are available in our data.====We begin by assessing the way predicted gender-specific employment growths interact with parents’ labor market outcomes in the year of birth. We find that predicted male-employment growth has a positive and significant effect on fathers’ labor supply and earnings in the year of child birth. Furthermore, our estimates show that a one-percentage point rise in male-specific labor demand growth reduces the likelihood of the family being in poverty by around 1.4 percentage points. Our results show that predicted female-specific employment growth positively and significantly affects the number of weeks mothers worked in the year of child birth. However, the effect for mothers’ wages is not statistically different from zero. It is worth noting that about a third of the women reported having zero weeks of employment in the year of child birth in our sample, suggesting that those mothers may be more focused on birth and other child related issues. In another set of results, we find that predicted employment growths are highly correlated with unemployment rates.====We next estimate the effects of gender-specific employment growths on children’s test scores. We find that a one-percentage point rise in male-specific labor demand growth leads to a 0.018–0.033 standard deviation rise in math scores and a 0.025–0.032 standard deviation increase in reading scores. Our estimates show the positive effect of female-specific predicted labor demand growth, with the estimates showing increases of around 0.015 and 0.019 standard deviations in math and reading scores, respectively. That being said, we cannot statistically distinguish these estimates from zero. The differential effects across gender highlight the roles of both income and substitutability of parental care, as predicted by Becker and Tomes (1986). This is also in line with the existing theoretical ambiguity about whether a mother’s employment should create positive or negative effects on children’s cognitive ability. To the extent that mother’s employment reduces the quality of care, children’s cognitive development might be adversely affected. On the other hand, mother’s employment and subsequent increase in family income lead to a positive effect on children’s cognitive ability (e.g, Dahl & Lochner, 2012). Rege, Telle, and Votruba (2011), who investigate the micro effect of parental job loss that occurred when a child was in seventh grade on short-term educational performance, provides support to this ambiguity. The authors find an insignificant effect for mothers’ job loss on a child’s educational performance, but a significant and negative effect for fathers’ job loss.====We assess the robustness of our findings to several specifications. We separately estimate the effect of male-specific predicted employment growth on the child’s cognitive achievement by the marital status of their mothers in the year of birth. We find stronger effects on children of married mothers and insignificant effects on children of unmarried mothers. If mothers were unmarried at the child’s birth, any improvement in men’s employment opportunities may not affect them. These findings could be viewed as a falsification test. Even when we estimate the effect for male-specific employment growth, controlling for female-specific employment growth to account for any other effect on child achievement arising from interdependencies in spousal labor supply, the results are consistent. We also separately estimate the effect by race. This subgroup analysis shows that effects are more pronounced among white children. Moreover, as suggested by Jaeger, Ruist, and Stuhler (2018), we control for the lagged value of predicted male-specific growth to account for the possibility of its serial correlation over time.====We extend our analysis to estimate the effect on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), which measures receptive vocabulary.==== Our findings are similar to that of the reading and math scores. We find a significantly positive effective of male-specific predicted employment growth, but an insignificant effect of female-specific growth. In an attempt to further understand the mechanism behind the positive effect of labor market growth at birth in childhood, we investigate how labor market outcomes affect home environment in the year of birth. The NLSY has information about the quality of home environment. We find a significant and positive effect of male-specific predicted employment growth.====Finally, we explore a potential concern of whether couples self-select with regards to choosing a time for childbearing. If the self-selection–as shown by Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004)–occurs, our baseline model underestimates the effect of predicted employment growths. Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) argue that low-income parents’ skills deteriorate relatively faster, and thus the opportunity cost of having a child for a low-income family in labor market buoyancy is higher than that of a period of labor market slack. Likewise, low-earning couples might find periods of labor market booms more preferable as they may have enough financial resources to take care of the child. High-earning couples choose times of labor market slack to raise a child as their opportunity cost of childbearing becomes lower. We examine if predicted male-specific employment growth affects the behaviour of highly educated and less educated married mothers differently when it comes to having a baby. We do not find significant effects. Furthermore, we re-estimate our main findings using mother fixed effects. Our objective is to compare differences in outcomes of siblings due to differences in employment growth. Doing this allows us to net out time-invariant differences in family background. Our main results are consistent.====In examining the link between labor market conditions at birth and outcomes later in childhood, we contribute to three strands of the literature. First, this paper contributes to a small body of literature that examines the effect of the business cycle during childhood on later outcomes.==== For example, van den Berg et al. (2006) study the effect of the business cycle early in life on the individual mortality rate in adulthood. Using birth cohorts from 1908 to 1937 in the Netherlands, van den Berg, Deeg, Lindeboom, and Portrait (2010) examine how cognitive functioning in old age is affected by the business cycle in early life. Doblhammer, van den Berg, and Fritze (2013) employ a cross-national survey consisting of respondents from 10 European countries to study the link between economic conditions at birth and cognitive functioning among the elderly. Ruhm (2004) shows that mother’s employment in the first three years of a child’s life leads to lower test scores at ages 5 to 6. Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) examine the association between the unemployment rate during pregnancy and newborns’ health. However, there is little evidence on the effect of labor market shocks in the year of a child’s birth on educational outcomes. Rao (2016)’s analysis is centered around examining how average unemployment rates experienced in the years between conception and age 15 are associated with outcomes in adulthood.====Second, our paper complements the existing literature that studies the role of job displacement on children’s education (e.g, Hilger, 2016, Pan, Ost, 2014, Stevens, 1997). Much of the literature attempting to investigate the impact of labor market conditions focuses on individual layoffs, in an attempt to circumvent an endogeneity problem. These findings represent the micro effect. We contribute to this literature by leveraging (an arguably exogenous) employment growth to capture the general equilibrium or full effect of unemployment.====Third, by examining the impact of female labor market conditions at birth, we contribute to the literature that examines the link between mother’s employment and her child’s educational outcomes. The literature does not reach a consensus with regards to the effect of maternal participation in the workforce on children’s educational performance. James-Burdumy (2005) finds that maternal employment in the year after birth has a limited effect on a child’s test scores. Blau and Grossberg (1992) show that children whose mothers work all weeks in the child’s first year of life have lower test scores. Baum (2003) finds negative effects of maternal employment in the first year of a child’s life on cognitive development. Likewise, others find no significant effect of maternal employment (e.g., Kalil & Ziol-Guest, 2008). These differential findings in the literature could be the result of selection bias (see Bernal, 2008, Waldfogel, 2002), which we attempt to address.====The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 builds a conceputal framework to show potential channels between labor market conditions at birth and educational outcomes during childhood. Section 3 describes our data and Section 4 our empirical specification. We present results in Section 5 and apply a mother fixed effects model in Section 6.

We use administrative data for England to estimate the effect of attending a selective boarding school that admits an unusually high share of pupils with low socio-economic status on attainment at the end of compulsory education. By using ==== we obtain comparable control groups in selective non-boarding schools. Our main finding is that the probability of being in the top decile of achievement in the exams increases by about 18 percentage points compared to 59% for controls.,"Gaps in achievement by socio-economic status (SES) are a global policy challenge (see for a review Reardon, 2011, Sirin, 2005). In England these gaps are observed as early as the primary education phase and usually do not change over time or tend to increase as students progress through the education system (Dearden, Sibieta, & Sylva, 2011). While gaps by SES tend to be concentrated among pupils who are initially low achievers, they have also been found among high achievers (Crawford, Macmillan, Vignoles, 2014, Jerrim). This may have high opportunity costs if pupils who have the potential to perform well at school are held back or slowed down by the environment in which they have grown up.====Most policies designed to counteract the influence of deprivation on pupil achievement are based on the assumption that increasing school inputs boosts academic outcomes. However, the effect of these policies may be confounded by parental responses to the change in school inputs (Todd, Wolpin, 2003, Todd, Wolpin, 2007): family inputs may reinforce the role of school policies if parents respond by investing more into their children’s development or dilute it if they invest less.====Boarding schools offer the opportunity to observe a context where family inputs are substituted for school inputs, i.e. they reduce the role of family inputs for all pupils, since they offer education during the day and lodging at night. However, obtaining clean estimates of the effect of attending a boarding school on pupil achievement is an empirical challenge as it may be confounded by a selection effect if boarding school pupils and pupils in other schools differ substantially in ability or family resources. This problem has been circumvented in recent studies which exploit lotteries to oversubscribed boarding schools to estimate the clean effect of these types of educational institutions on achievement. Randomly admitted pupils obtain substantially higher test scores than non-admitted ones in boarding schools in poor neighbourhoods in the US (Curto & Fryer, 2014). Related research exploiting random admission in an elite school in France obtains similar results (Behaghel, de Chaisemartin, & Gurgand, 2017).====This paper is the first to study the effect of boarding education in England. The aim of our empirical analysis is to investigate the effect of boarding education by studying a selective boarding school called Christ’s Hospital (CH hereafter). This school admits talented pupils from different backgrounds and funds the cost of their education with a variety of means-tested bursaries. For our analysis we use rich administrative data of pupils in England and measures of achievement at the ages of 7, 11 (Key Stage 1 and 2) and the results of compulsory school final exams at age 16 (General Certificate of Secondary Education, GCSE hereafter) for five consecutive cohorts of pupils. We use propensity score matching to find, for each pupil at CH, a pupil in a selective day school who is as similar as possible in observable characteristics.====CH is financially supported by a wealthy foundation which funds means-tested bursaries for the majority of its pupils and is devoted to helping high achievers with low SES. We assess the effect of boarding by comparing CH pupils to those in other selective schools that do not provide boarding (i.e. selective day schools). Our first control group includes pupils who attended grammar secondary schools and whose primary school was in the same local authority as those attended by pupils who then went to CH. This ensures that both school and non-school environment are comparable for CH and control group pupils. While grammar schools are academically selective like CH, they differ in that they do not offer boarding and have substantially fewer resources. For the second control group we select pupils from independent schools, which are often as well-resourced as CH but tend to be less academically selective. CH pupils have lower SES and somewhat higher achievement in primary school tests than pupils in the two control groups. The characteristics of its pupils make CH an outlier in English private education. This confirms the importance of using rich measures of primary school achievement and SES in our empirical design to estimate a clean effect of attending CH.====We find that the achievement of pupils attending CH is significantly higher at GCSE. The probability of obtaining at least five GCSEs at A-A* (i.e. of being in the top two deciles in the distribution of the number of GCSEs at A-A*) is about 18 percentage points higher or 30% compared to the control groups attending selective non-boarding grammar or independent day schools. We assess whether there is heterogeneity in our main results and we find that the effect for girls is slightly higher relative to boys although the difference is not significant. Similarly, we detect no significant difference between pupils with high and low SES, which suggests that the effect is not concentrated on high-SES students, but is equally large among low-SES students. Crucially, predetermined characteristics for pupils at CH and for controls groups in grammar and independent schools are balanced. Our main results are robust to a placebo test, more so when grammar school pupils are the control group, assessing whether an extensive set of predetermined outcomes is systematically different for pupils at CH and pupils in grammar or independent schools. They are also robust to a sensitivity analysis assessing the bias of the main results in the presence of selection on unobservables.====Our paper offers a proof of concept that a boarding secondary school admitting high ability pupils with a low SES can improve their achievement relative to comparable pupils in other selective day schools. Our results contribute to the school choice literature by suggesting that currently available alternatives to standard schooling options may play a role in reversing the achievement gap at the end of compulsory schooling for disadvantaged pupils. Our results also contribute to the recent policy debate over the use of boarding schools for disadvantaged children in England (Department for Education, 2014, Department for Education, 2016), a debate which so far has not been informed by a thorough quantitative analysis.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

I conclude with some possible explanations for the lack of strong empirical support for the Bennett Hypothesis.","A great deal of attention has been paid to the rapidly rising price of an undergraduate education in the United States. Between the 1996–97 and 2016–17 academic years, the inflation-adjusted listed price of tuition and fees increased by 112% at public four-year colleges and by 68% at private nonprofit colleges (Ma, Baum, Pender & Welch, 2016). Yet post-baccalaureate prices have received relatively little attention although tuition prices for professional programs such as law, medicine, and business have risen at similar rates (Baum & Steele, 2017) and graduate enrollments have risen faster than undergraduate enrollments since 2000 (McFarland et al., 2017). For example, law students now face sticker tuition and fee prices of nearly $80,000 at public schools and $135,000 at private schools during the three-year course of full-time study (author's calculations using American Bar Association data).====Unlike many students in research doctoral programs (PhD), students pursuing professional doctorates in fields such as law (JD) and medicine (MD) pay most of the price tag of their education. Both law and medical students have only about 20% of total charges covered by scholarships—or one-third of what PhD students receive (Baum & Steele, 2017). This has resulted in student debt rapidly increasing among professional students, with law students seeing the largest increase. In 2012, 87% of law students with debt graduated with a median debt of $140,616, up from $88,634 in inflation-adjusted dollars in 2004 (Delisle, 2014). Students in medical fields borrowed more (an average of $161,772), but median wages for lawyers are half of that for primary care physicians ($118,160 versus $251,578) (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017). With starting salaries of new lawyers now below $70,000 (Kowarski, 2017), law students face debt-to-earnings ratios well above students in other graduate and professional fields. In this paper, I focus on law schools because of the potential implications of high debt burdens on their graduates.====One factor that some people believe contributes to increases in both tuition prices and student debt burdens is the availability of federal financial aid that students can access to finance their education. The idea that colleges take advantage of increased loan eligibility is widely attributed to William Bennett, who was President Reagan's Secretary of Education. In a 1987 opinion piece in ==== entitled “Our Greedy Colleges,” he wrote: “Increases in financial aid in recent years have enabled colleges and universities blithely to raise their tuitions, confident that Federal loan subsidies would help cushion the increase” (Bennett, 1987).====This theory, which became known as the Bennett Hypothesis, has been hotly debated for decades and has been the subject of a number of empirical studies. However, all of this research was for the undergraduate student population and mainly focused on the relationship between federal grant aid and tuition prices (e.g., Archibald and Feldman, 2016, Heller, 2013, Stoll et al., 2014). Yet although post-baccalaureate students hold nearly about 40% of all outstanding student debt (Delisle, 2014), only one prior study (Kelchen, 2019) has examined graduate education programs (in business and medicine). There has been no empirical research examining whether the Bennett Hypothesis holds for law schools.====I conduct the first empirical examination of the Bennett Hypothesis in legal education in this paper by leveraging two policy changes that increased the availability and attractiveness of federal student loans in professional education and focusing on law school students. Prior to 2006, law students (along with most other professional students) could borrow $18,500 per year in federal loans. This amount is well below typical tuition and fees at private law schools and slightly more than tuition and fees at public law schools, meaning that private loans or self-financing were needed to cover the rest of the cost of attendance. The Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 created the Grad PLUS loan program as of July 1, 2006, which allowed students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance in federal loans. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 created a Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that significantly reduced repayment amounts for students working at qualified nonprofits for a period of ten years as of October 1, 2007 along with other income-driven repayment (IDR) options that took effect in 2009.====Together, these two policies have the effect of increasing access to credit for legal education by allowing more students to borrow the full cost of attendance via the Grad PLUS program and allowing at least some students to repay less than their initial student debt amount under IDR. This creates an ideal test of the Bennett Hypothesis because if a college is inclined to maximize total revenues from its law school, the two aforementioned policy changes may provide an opportunity for institutions to gain additional revenue by increasing sticker prices. However, this also would increase graduates’ debt burdens, potentially leaving taxpayers with a portion of the total balance for any forgiven loans under income-driven repayment plans amid concerns that the federal government is underestimating the amount of loans that will be forgiven (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2016). There is some evidence that some colleges may be leveraging IDR and PSLF to shift the repayment burden to taxpayers through programs such as Georgetown Law's Loan Repayment Assistance Program (Mathews, 2013), but the implications of these programs on tuition prices has not been examined in spite of the potential importance to taxpayers who would pay for forgiven loans.====Using a sixteen-year panel of dataset on public and private nonprofit law schools and two different types of comparison groups, I explored the following research questions:",An empirical examination of the Bennett hypothesis in law school prices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718306630,22 July 2019,2019,Research Article,121.0

I estimate the effect of enrollment growth following the removal of primary school fees in Tanzania and find evidence of a sizeable increase in pupil-teacher ratios and a reduction in observable teacher quality, but rule out a substantial effect on test scores overall. These results are robust to instrumenting enrollment growth using predetermined fertility and migration decisions, and to a number of checks including the use of baseline enrollment rates as an alternative source of variation in enrollment growth. However, when investigating the possibility of heterogeneous effects for urban and rural areas, I find evidence of a deterioration of test scores in urban areas.","After over a decade of stagnation, the net enrollment rate in Tanzanian primary schools went from 53% in 2000 to 73% in 2002 (World Development Indicators, 2015), coinciding with the removal of primary school fees announced in 2001. This increase was driven mainly by an 82% increase in the number of children enrolled in Grade 1====. In absolute terms, the number of pupils enrolled in the first grade of primary school went from 894,894 in 2000 (before FPE was announced) to 1,628,195 in 2002, the first academic year after it was announced. Tanzania is no outlier–a sizeable number of Sub-Saharan African countries have recently experienced large, sudden increases in enrollment, which often followed Free Primary Education (FPE) policies (World Bank, 2009).==== And with 63 Million children of primary school age still out of school in the world, over half of whom in sub-Saharan Africa (UNESCO, 2018), more countries may follow suit.====However, there is evidence that, more than years of education accumulated, it is the cognitive skills acquired during schooling that matter for both individual outcomes on the labor market and for macroeconomic growth (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008). In addition, there is mounting evidence of the “often abysmal” quality of schooling provision in developing countries (Kremer, Brannen, & Glennerster, 2013, p.297). The levels of learning in many developing countries are so low, that there has recently been calls for a complete rethink of education systems across the developing world amidst a “learning crisis” caused not least by the international donor community’s narrow focus on education as school enrollment (Pritchett, 2013). It is therefore important to understand the consequences of accelerated enrollment growth, through FPE or other measures such as school construction programmes, on the quality of the learning environment.====Despite considerable concern about this issue in policy circles, there is no arguably causal evidence on the effect of the very large increases in enrollment seen in a number of countries on the test scores of the cohorts entering school at the time of expansion, whose learning would be most affected by the likely decrease in educational inputs per capita.==== In addition to filling this gap, I shed light on the impact of this rapid primary schooling expansion on a rich set of measures of educational inputs, thus contributing to our existing knowledge on the effect on test scores of schooling inputs such as pupil-teacher ratios and teacher characteristics in a poor country setting.====The removal of primary school fees took place simultaneously across Tanzania. But there is variation in the subsequent rate of enrollment growth across regions, which I first exploit using a difference-in-differences approach. Test scores are only available at two points in time (2000 and 2007), which prevents me from testing for differences in pre-existing trends. Instead, in order to address concerns regarding pre-existing trends as well as other potential sources of endogeneity of enrollment growth, I note that regions whose post-reform primary-school age population was larger relative to the pre-reform school-age population experienced larger primary enrollment growth rates. Therefore, schools in these areas experienced larger increases in the demand for primary education, independently of the potentially endogenous response of the regional enrollment rate to the school fee reform. Instrumental variable estimation exploiting this source of arguably exogenous variation, which is based on past fertility and past migration decisions, bolsters the causal interpretation of the effect of enrollment growth on schooling inputs and cognitive skills acquisition.====My main conclusion is that there was no substantial decrease in test scores overall. I also find that primary enrollment growth has led to sizeable increases in the pupil-teacher ratio (an increase by 6.9 pupils for an increase in enrollment growth by one standard deviation) and a worsening of average teacher experience and subject-specific knowledge. Point estimates of the effect of enrollment growth on pupil test scores are small in magnitude and statistically insignificant. The lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals imply that an increase in enrollment growth by 1 standard deviation led at most to a decrease in test scores of 0.15–0.16 standard deviation, which corresponds to about a fourth (third) of the rural-urban gap in language (math), or roughly a fifth (fourth) of the gap between children of fathers with more than primary schooling and the children of fathers who did not complete primary schooling. In other words, I cannot rule out some deterioration in the quality of the learning environment for the average pupil at the national level, but I can rule out a substantial worsening of quality overall.====The main message is therefore one of cautious optimism with respect to the possibility of broadening rapidly and comprehensively access to primary education without worsening schooling quality. However, when investigating the possibility of heterogeneous effects for urban and rural areas, I find evidence of a deterioration of test scores in urban areas, so that whether or not enrollment growth was welfare-enhancing depends on how the gains of the many winners are weighted against the losses of the (fewer) losers.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows.

We use a within-household estimator and data from nationally representative surveys of school-age children’s literacy and numeracy skills, which include retrospective information on preschool attendance. In both countries, school entry rules are not strictly enforced, and children who attend preschool often start primary school late. At ages 7–9, these children have thus attended fewer school grades than their same-aged peers without pre-primary education. However, they catch up over time: at ages 13–16, children who went to preschool have attended about the same number of school grades and score about 0.10 ==== higher on standardized tests in both countries. They are also 3 (5) percentage points more likely to achieve basic literacy and numeracy in Kenya (Tanzania).","School enrollment in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased substantially over the past two decades. However, many students fall behind the curriculum early on, and grade repetition and early dropout are widespread (UNESCO, 2012). Students also learn remarkably little in school: for example, only one in five third-grade students in East Africa has second-grade literacy and numeracy skills, and less than one third of sixth-grade students in Southern and Eastern Africa can solve a simple subtraction problem (Bietenbeck, Piopiunik, Wiederhold, 2018, Uwezo, 2015).====One possible reason why students in these countries perform so poorly is that they enter school unprepared. Specifically, to the extent that early and later learning are complementary, a lack of education before starting school reduces children’s efficiency in learning once they arrive there (Cunha & Heckman, 2007). High-quality preschool programs which prepare children for school are therefore often seen as a promising way to enhance learning outcomes (e.g. World Bank, 2018). In Sub-Saharan Africa, pre-primary education has been expanding rapidly, with the gross enrollment ratio doubling from 15% to 32% between 2000 and 2017.==== Whether preschools are actually effective at boosting student outcomes in this region is unclear, however, because rigorous empirical evidence is still scarce.====In this paper, we study the effects of preschool attendance on children’s schooling and cognitive skills in Kenya and Tanzania. Our empirical analysis draws on data from Uwezo, which conducts nationally representative household surveys of school-age children’s education and their literacy and numeracy skills. The surveys also collect retrospective information on preschool attendance, which we can relate to current outcomes of respondents up to 16 years of age. The main part of our investigation focuses on impacts on the highest grade of school attended and a composite test score, which summarizes a child’s performance on the standardized literacy and numeracy assessments. The data contain information on these outcomes for more than half a million children across the two countries, independently of whether they are currently enrolled in school or not.====Our regression framework compares the outcomes of children who did and did not attend preschool. For identification, we rely on within-household differences, thereby controlling for all determinants of outcomes and attendance that vary across families.==== We argue that the leftover variation between siblings is likely due to changes in the local availability of preschools, which came about because of an expansion of the pre-primary sector during our study period. In support of this claim, we show that even within households, children in later cohorts are much more likely to have attended preschool. To mitigate concerns about endogenous selection from the start, the regressions also control for a variety of predetermined characteristics that still vary between siblings.====The impact of preschool attendance on schooling follows an interesting dynamic pattern. In both Kenya and Tanzania, school entry rules are not strictly enforced, and for reasons discussed below, children who attend preschool often start primary school late. At ages 7–9, these children thus have attended fewer school grades than their same-aged peers without pre-primary education. However, once enrolled in primary school, children who attended preschool progress through grades faster and are less likely to drop out. Eventually, in both countries, they thus catch up and at ages 13–16 have attended about the same number of school grades as their peers.====In terms of cognitive skills, the estimates for the composite test score show that children who went to preschool outperform their peers in the long run. In Kenya, this effect fades in at early ages and soon stabilizes at a gain of about 0.10 standard deviations (SD). In Tanzania, in contrast, children who attended preschool outperform their peers from the age of school start, with long-term gains of the same order of magnitude as in Kenya. Separate regressions moreover reveal that among 13- to 16-year-olds, preschool attendance raises the likelihood of mastering basic, second-grade literacy and numeracy by 3 percentage points in Kenya and by 5 percentage points in Tanzania. Taken together, these findings show that there are important benefits from preschool attendance in both countries.====To ensure that these results are not driven by selection, we perform a variety of falsification tests and robustness checks. For example, we show that children who attended preschool do not differentially benefit from other educational inputs such as private tutoring, suggesting that our findings are not due to child-specific investments related to unobserved characteristics. Applying the method developed by Oster (2017), we also judge the importance of omitted variable bias more generally by observing the sensitivity of our regression results to the addition of controls. From this approach, selection on unobserved factors would need to be at least four times as large as selection on observed factors to explain away the long-term impacts on the composite test score.====Our paper contributes to a growing literature on the impacts of preschool education on children’s outcomes in developing countries, which has focused mostly on Asia and Latin America and which is reviewed in detail in Nores and Barnett (2010) and in Rao et al. (2014). Using retrospective data on preschool enrollment and the same within-household estimator as we do, Berlinski et al. (2008) find that Uruguayan children who attended preschool accumulate 0.8 more years of education by age 15. Applying the same strategy to Egyptian data, Krafft (2015) finds that preschool attendance leads to an additional 0.4 years of schooling among 18–29 year-olds. Behrman, Cheng, and Todd (2004), Berlinski, Galiani, and Gertler (2009), and Brinkman, Hasan, Jung, Kinnell, and Pradhan (2017) similarly document positive short-term effects of preschool attendance on children’s cognitive skills in Bolivia, Argentina, and Indonesia, respectively. In contrast, a randomized evaluation of a preschool construction program in Cambodia found negative short-term impacts on test scores of targeted children, a result that is partly explained by a shift from underage enrollment in primary school to enrollment in preschool (Bouguen, Filmer, Macours, & Naudeau, 2018).====To the best of our knowledge, the only other rigorous study of preschool effects in Sub-Saharan Africa is the paper by Martinez, Naudeau, and Pereira (2013), who report on an experimental evaluation of a model preschool program in the Gaza province of Mozambique. The authors find that two years after the start of the program, children were more likely to be enrolled in primary school and had higher cognitive and socio-emotional skills. In contrast to this small-scale evaluation, our study uses nationally representative data on preschool attendance and learning outcomes from two countries. Moreover, unlike most of the previous literature, we are able to examine the longer-term effects of preschool attendance.","Preschool attendance, schooling, and cognitive skills in East Africa",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571830596X,19 July 2019,2019,Research Article,123.0

Using a nationally-representative sample of US kindergarteners, we find significant effects of the parental education of classmates on math and reading, but not on socio-emotional skills. The effects are economically meaningful: reassigning classrooms so that all students have the same parental education composition would narrow the achievement gap between children of parents who are high-school-educated (or less) and those who are university-educated by 9 to 13 percent. These ","Numerous studies document the strong ties between parental education and their children’s achievement, educational attainment and wages (Bjorklund & Salvanes, 2011). Ninety-three percent of children whose parents have a university degree enroll in postsecondary education, compared to 72 percent of children with less educated parents (Cataldi, Bennett, & Chen, 2018). Children whose parents have a university degree are also four times less likely to repeat a grade in school, compared to those whose parents have only a high school degree.==== We explore whether the advantage of having better-educated parents spills over to help or hinder classmates.====There are many reasons we might expect students to benefit from being in classrooms where peers have better-educated parents. Most of these relate to correlations between parental education and cognitive or socio-emotional skills of their children. These correlations could arise for many reasons. For instance, better-educated parents tend to invest more in their children’s education; they may be better able to teach their children or engage in better parenting practices (Bianchi, Robinson, 1997, Guryan, Hurst, Kearney, 2008, Hill, Stafford, 1974). The literature generally supports positive spillovers from better-behaved or higher-achieving classmates (Epple, Romano, 2010, Sacerdote, 2011), though there is a strand suggesting the potential for higher-achieving peers to have negative effects through lower academic self concept (e.g., Marsh et al., 2008). The preparation of classmates could also matter indirectly by affecting the teacher’s pedagogical practices. Better-educated parents also tend to be more connected and better able to advocate for their children, which could have positive or negative consequences for classmates, depending on whether this involvement enhances or detracts from their learning (Walsh, 2008).====In this paper, we test whether parental education spillovers exist and investigate the sources of these spillovers. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey of Kindergartners (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the US in 1998/99, is well-equipped for addressing these questions. It includes rich survey data on both parental and teacher inputs, as well as both cognitive and behavioral measures of students’ abilities at the beginning and the end of the school year. A key challenge for identifying an effect of peers is nonrandom assignment of students to classrooms. In this case, an apparent effect of peer parental education could simply be a result of positive selection, i.e., the presence of better-educated parents signals better teacher quality in dimensions that are difficult to measure. We alleviate the more salient selection concerns by controlling for school fixed effects.==== The focus on kindergarten also helps alleviate concerns about within-school tracking, as parents and principals have less information in the first year of school from which to track students and arguably there is a greater distaste for tracking in early grades. Robustness checks and tests for random assignment within schools largely confirm this.====An additional concern with this strategy is whether there is sufficient within-school variation to identify peer effects.==== The within-school variation in peer parental education ranges from 0.17 to 0.20 and is more than half of the between-school variation. Furthermore, while the ECLS-K has unusually rich measures for testing our key hypotheses, a disadvantage is that not all students in the school were sampled, leading to measurement error in peer variables. Fortunately, we can address this by applying Sojourner (2013)’s method to correct for the measurement error from missing observations of classroom peers. This involves weighting the observed peer variables by the percentage of classmates that are observed.====We find that peer parental education matters and contributes significantly to existing inequalities. The source of these spillovers seems to be primarily from unmeasured skills, not captured by rich measures of initial cognitive and socio-emotional skills, nor by race or socioeconomic status. We develop a test for whether peer parental education primarily proxies for spillovers from some underlying unobserved skill. The test supports this hypothesis for math but not for reading. For reading, we find evidence of negative peer effects from some types of university-educated parents. We further investigate the source of these negative spillovers, using the rich perspective afforded by the teacher and parent surveys.====This paper contributes to a burgeoning literature on peer effects (See Brock, Durlauf, 2001, Epple, Romano, 2010, Sacerdote, 2011, for recent reviews). While a number of studies examine peer spillovers deriving through ability, racial composition, and behavior, less is known about spillovers from parental education. Haraldsvik and Bonesronning (2014), McEwan (2003), and Bifulco, Fletcher, and Ross (2011) are most related in studying the direct effects of peer parental education on test scores, though at later ages (fifth graders, eighth graders and high-schoolers respectively). Haraldsvik and Bonesronning (2014) and McEwan (2003) focus on Chile and Norway, respectively, and find significant effects of peer parental education on test scores. By contrast, Bifulco et al. (2011) finds no effect of peer parental education on GPA in the US.====We contribute to this sparse literature on the achievement effects of peer parental education by focusing on an earlier age and the US context, where the spillovers may differ from other countries due to different cultural norms, the emphasis teachers put on engagement of parents and pedagogical practices. Kindergarten is an important period for child development (e.g., Cunha, Heckman, Lochner, & Masterov, 2006) and parental education spillovers are of particular interest in kindergarten because of the important role parents play in supporting the child’s education at this age (Bono, Francesconi, Kelly, Sacker, 2016, Cunha, Heckman, 2008, Del Boca, Flinn, Wiswall, 2013, Vaughan, 2019). Parents may also be more aware and sensitive to how their child’s performance compares to their classmates, particularly for skills such as knowing how to read, and may adjust their investments or demands on the teacher accordingly, to the benefit or cost of other students in the class.====We also contribute to the literature on spillovers from peer parental education by using rich data on teacher and parent reports to understand underlying sources of these peer effects. Studies have used similar data to understand mechanisms of peer effects, but for other types of peer spillovers where the mechanisms may be different. For instance, Lavy and Schlosser (2011) and Lavy et al. (2012) distinguish between mechanisms of gender and ability spillovers using survey data on student and teacher reports of classroom climate and pedagogy. Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011) and Jackson (2016) show evidence of an indirect effect of peers arising through effects on teacher inputs. We extend the role of teachers beyond effort and teacher-student relationships to consider what skills the teacher chooses to emphasize. In distinguishing mechanisms, we also benefit from rich survey information from the parent. Our work is also similar in spirit to Hoxby and Weingarth (2005), De Giorgi and Pellizzari (2011), which distinguish between different potential mechanisms underlying peer effects based on modeling assumptions, as we do to provide evidence of spillovers from remaining unobserved skills.====Our research relates in interesting ways to the existing peer effects studies on income-related spillovers (e.g., Abdulkadiroglu, Angrist, Pathak, 2014, Ammermueller, Pischke, 2009, Boisjoly, Duncan, Kremer, Levy, Eccles, 2006) and racial composition spillovers (e.g., Card, Rothstein, 2007, Hanushek, Kain, Rivkin, 2009, Hoxby, 2000, Vigdor, Ludwig, 2008), strong correlates of parental education. We find that controlling for peer income and racial composition does not explain parental education spillovers, suggesting that the mechanisms of these effects could be quite different. An even larger literature illustrates the importance of peer achievement, most frequently measured by the lagged achievement students bring to the classroom (e.g., Sacerdote, 2011, for review). Again, despite having potentially better measures of initial skills from tests taken at the beginning of kindergarten (rather than at the end of the previous year where differential summer learning loss could have occurred (Borman & Boulay, 2004)) and unusually rich measures of socio-emotional skills, we find that peer parental education matters in ways not captured by the students’ initial performance. These findings re-enforce the importance of studying peer parental education spillovers in their own right.====In what follows, we first describe the data in Section 2. We then describe the empirical model in Section 3, how we deal with measurement error, estimates of the overall effect of peer parental education and robustness to concerns about non-random assignment. Section 4 tests whether initial measures of skill explain the spillovers from peer parental education and describes a test for whether the estimates are consistent with parental education proxying for remaining unobserved skill. Section 5 turns to the puzzle of why university-educated parents in reading fail to generate positive spillovers of equal or larger value to those generated by high-school-educated parents. Section 6 concludes.",Your peers’ parents: Spillovers from parental education,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719301219,17 July 2019,2019,Research Article,124.0

In this paper, we further explore the effectiveness of the lowest-ranked instructors: students. We confirm that students are almost as effective as senior instructors, and we produce results informative on the effects of expanding the use of student instructors. We conclude that hiring moderately more student instructors would not harm students, but exclusively using them will likely negatively affect student outcomes. Given how inexpensive student instructors are, however, such a policy might still be worth it.","Many universities offer courses that include tutorials (also called TA sessions or exercise sessions), which are small group sessions that complement course lectures. These sessions are staffed quite differently in different universities: while US institutions typically rely on PhD students, institutions in other OECD countries often use professors or a mixture of professors and students for tutorial teaching (Feld, Salamanca & Zölitz, in press). The advantage of using student instructors, that is, bachelor's and master's students who teach tutorials, is that they are cheaper than more-senior instructors.==== However, student instructors are also less experienced and much less qualified than professors. It is therefore important to ask whether student instructors can provide the same quality of education, or whether—in the words of the above quoted John Mulaney—they are like horses watching over dogs.====In this paper, we investigate how student instructors affect their students’ academic performance and labor market outcomes. We use data from a Dutch business school with two key features. First, each course has several tutorial sections, some of which are taught by students and others of which are taught by more senior instructors. This gives us the necessary variation in instructor type to answer our research question. Second, systematic assignment of students to instructors is not a concern in this business school; students assigned to student instructors and students assigned to senior instructors are very similar in a host of characteristics, including academic ability. This allows us to estimate differences in effectiveness between both types of instructors without worrying about selection bias.====This paper builds on our previous paper (Feld et al., in press), which uses data from the same environment to compare the teaching effectiveness of tutorial instructors with various academic ranks, including student instructors but also PhD students, postdocs, lecturers, and assistant, associate, and full professors. In that paper, we find no meaningful differences between instructors of different academic ranks in how they affect students’ grades, affect grades in subsequent related courses, or affect students’ earnings or job satisfaction after graduation. We only find that higher-ranked instructors receive better course evaluations, but even this difference is fairly small. These findings led us to conclude that universities should rely more on inexpensive student instructors for tutorial teaching.====In this paper, we focus on the role of student instructors to make three additional contributions. First, we estimate the effect of instructor type using a different methodology. In our previous paper, we use Chetty, Friedman and Rockoff (2014) value-added measures, which force us to restrict our sample to instructors who teach the same course at least twice. This restriction could introduce selection bias in our estimates if worse instructors end up teaching only once. In this paper, we estimate the effect of being assigned a student instructor by regressing individual student outcomes, as opposed to instructor value-added measures, on instructor type. This approach allows us to include all instructors, even those who taught only once, which shields our estimates from—and allows us to quantify—this bias. Second, we look at a broader set of student outcomes and explore more thoroughly whether student instructors affect students in particular courses or particular kinds of students. Finally, we explore how hiring more and hiring ==== student instructors would affect student outcomes.====As in Feld et al. (in press), we find that students taught by student instructors receive only marginally worse course grades and no worse grades in subsequent related courses. The effect on grades is driven by larger, yet small, negative effects of student instructors in non-mathematical courses, in non-first-year courses, and on low-ability students. We find slightly larger negative effects of student instructors on course evaluations than in our previous paper. This difference is partly driven by worse-rated student instructors being more likely to teach only once, illustrating that selection bias is a valid concern when using value-added measures. We again find no significant effect on earnings and job satisfaction, nor do we find any differences in length of job search after graduation or retrospective study satisfaction. Our results further dispel several other concerns about student instructors: they do not affect students’ chances of failing a course, nor do they make students study longer hours outside the classroom. Overall, we confirm that student instructors are almost as effective as more-senior instructors in tutorial teaching.====We then explore the potential consequences of hiring more student instructors. One concern is that hiring more students for tutorial teaching would mean hiring lower-quality ones, which would naturally occur if the business school recruits the best available instructors from a limited pool of applicants. We explore this concern by testing whether student instructors perform worse in the teaching terms in which many of them are hired. This is not the case. Another concern is that increasing the number of student instructors would expose students to too many student instructors throughout their studies. Although having a single student instructor may not be harmful, the effect of having multiple instructors throughout one's studies may add up. We do find some suggestive evidence that this is the case, though only for students exposed to seven or more student instructors (3% of our estimation sample). Together, our findings suggest that moderately increasing student instructors would not harm students in any meaningful way. We finish by discussing the potential effects of an extreme policy in which the business school would ==== use student instructors for tutorial teaching. Such a policy would likely have more negative effects on students than our estimates suggest. However, given the large savings potential, both in time and in money, of relying on cheaper instructors, such a policy might still be worth it.====Our paper relates to a few studies on how the origin and ethnicity of graduate teaching assistants (TAs) affect student performance. Lusher, Campbell and Carrell (2018) find that students’ grades increase when they are assigned to same-ethnicity graduate TAs. Borjas (2000) and Fleisher, Hashimoto and Weinberg (2002) study the effect of foreign-born graduate TAs, and reach opposing conclusions; Borjas (2000) finds that foreign-born TAs negatively affect student grades, whereas Fleisher et al. (2002) find that they have negligible, or sometimes positive, effects on student grades. Bettinger, Long and Taylor (2016) find that students are more likely to major in a subject if their first courses in that subject are taught by a PhD student. None of these studies, however, compares the effectiveness of student and non-student instructors.====Another related strand of literature looks at the effect of instructor characteristics on student outcomes at the university level. Bettinger and Long (2010) and Figlio, Schapiro and Soter (2015) find a positive effect of adjunct instructors, compared to tenure track and tenured instructors, on student performance. Hoffmann and Oreopoulus (2009) find that objective instructor characteristics, such as academic rank and salary, do not predict student performance, yet students’ evaluations of their teachers are positively correlated with student performance. De Vlieger, Jacob and Stange (2018) find that instructor performance in a college algebra course at a large for-profit university grows modestly with course-specific teaching experience, but is unrelated to pay. Fairlie, Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2014) find that minority students benefit from minority instructors. None of these studies explicitly consider student instructors despite their importance in higher education.

These standardized tests also have become increasingly central to accountability policies with the objective to evaluate, for example, school and teacher performance. The main intent of test-based accountability policies is to provide incentives that maximize student learning, but perverse incentives resulting from poorly designed accountability policies can have significant, unintended and undesirable consequences (Jacob, 2005). The existing widespread concerns over test validity and the manipulation of scores are therefore not surprising (Dee et al., 2016), yet until recently there has been surprisingly little empirical evidence related to test-based accountability and how it may induce manipulation of student test scores (Jacob, 2005).====Two recent empirical evaluations performed in the United States (Dee et al., 2016) and Sweden (Diamond & Persson, 2016) provide strong evidence that allowing for teacher discretion in grading standardized exams gives all the more reason for policy makers to be concerned. Dee et al. (2016) examine the causes and consequences of test score manipulation of high-stakes exit exams for New York State secondary-school students and find that teachers purposefully moved students just over predefined performance thresholds when grading their own students. Moreover, results varied systematically across and within schools. While black and Hispanic students are more likely to have a test score near a graduation threshold and are thus more often exposed to manipulation, they are less likely to have their test scores manipulated conditional on scoring just below a cutoff. Notably, conditional on scoring near a proficiency cutoff, white and Asian students, students with better baseline scores, and those with good behavioral records are more likely to have their scores manipulated due to teacher discretion. Diamond and Persson (2016) corroborate the existence of test score manipulation for Swedish compulsory schools, and similarly identify ‘a bad test day’-effect, suggesting that teachers exploit their discretion to undo potentially harmful consequences of idiosyncratic student performance. In contrast to the results in Dee et al. (2016), their estimates do not suggest that test score manipulation is related to student background characteristics. Furthermore, they find relative homogeneous positive implications for subsequent educational, labor market and life outcomes, highlighting that potential signaling mechanisms resulting from graduation could enhance a student’s academic motivation and/or teachers’ perception of academic ability.====This study adds to this emerging body of literature on local grading, teacher discretion and test score manipulation (see, also: Burgess, Greaves, 2013, Hanna, Linden, 2012, Lavy, 2008) by evaluating scores on high-stakes standardized exams at the end of secondary education in the Netherlands. It empirically investigates the existence of teacher discretion in grading and potential consequences for inequalities of student graduation opportunities. A specific contribution of this study is the ability to empirically expose the underlying dynamics of teacher discretion mechanisms, by exploiting variation in information, stakes ==== teacher discretion opportunities, as to validate a per-student utility model of teacher discretion.====For this purpose, a unique feature of the Dutch exam system is exploited in that subject teachers grade two similar standardized exams of some of their students twice over a short span of time. Yet, these two attempts differ vastly in terms of the ==== at hand and the ==== available, which can impact the validity of the observed student performance measure (Neal, 2013) and the associated teacher grading practices (McMillan & Nash, 2000). For the empirical evaluations, administrative data for the Netherlands is used for the period 2007–2012, covering 99% of the Dutch secondary school exam population. This data is augmented with information on the proportion of open questions on the (retake) exam.==== Since observed performance gains on the retake exam can potentially be related with teacher discretion, student ability boosting and mean reversion, we use the proportion of open questions as an instrument to identify the effect of teacher discretion. The identifying assumption is that that this measure affects potential teacher discretion (see also Schuurs, Kuhlemeier, & Gitsels, 2017), as it determines the degree of freedom a teacher has to manipulate grades, but not students’ ability boosting and mean reversion mechanisms.====First, this paper evaluates if observed performance gains can be predicted by variation in exam openness and to what extent students graduate as a result of teacher discretion. Next, this paper examines whether teacher discretion raises concerns of educational inequity with respect to unequal graduation opportunities within schools with respect to student gender and ethnicity. Finally, the paper explores variation in the proportion of students who graduate by means of a retake exam between schools to establish whether there are also potential concerns of between-school inequity.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2, outlines the Dutch institutional background and explains the exam and grading system in detail. Section 3 introduces a so-called graduation game that emerges in this context based on information and stakes and integrates these insights in a theoretical model for teacher discretion in (Dutch exam) grading.

By adopting a ,"Early school dropout remains an important problem that has adverse lifetime economic and health consequences in both advanced and developing countries. In the United States, 6.5% of 16-to-24 year olds have dropped out of school without receiving a high school diploma, with particularly high rates of dropout for Hispanic (10.6%) and black youth (7.4%) (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). In the European Union, while the average dropout rate was 11% in 2015, several Southern European countries have alarming rates: Spain 20%, Italy 14%, and Portugal 13%, for example. Early school dropout rates are much higher in developing countries, particularly in low-income countries with a high prevalence of child and adolescent labor (UNESCO, 2010).====The costs of high school dropout are strikingly high. In the U.S. alone, the average cost of an individual high school dropout is $250,000 over his or her lifetime in terms of lower tax contributions, greater reliance on Medicaid and Medicare, and higher rates of criminal activity (Levin & Belfield, 2007). High school dropouts are more likely to have lower lifetime wealth and report being in poor health, unemployed, and unhappy (Oreopoulos, 2007). They are also more likely to face incarceration (Lochner & Moretti, 2004). The estimated savings from reduced crime associated with a one-percent increase in high school graduation rates is $1.6 billion annually (Brunello & De Paola, 2013). Therefore, the goal of reducing dropout rates has been a priority area, as demonstrated by the “No Child Left Behind Act” (2001) in the United States and the “Lisbon Summit” (2000) and the “Europe 2020” strategic plans in the European Union.====In most countries, compulsory schooling laws are a commonly employed policy tool to prevent early school dropout. However, the impact of compulsory schooling on individual students is likely to display substantial heterogeneity. In developing countries, for instance, low returns to education and tight credit constraints often lead to significant gender differences in adolescents’ access to schooling. In particular, the lack of paid employment opportunities and the presence of cultural norms against girls’ participation in the labor force typically lock girls into the household domain, with no possibilities for education, employment, or training.==== Biased social norms and religious practices may impose additional constraints on the education of girls. Conversely, the availability of job market opportunities for boys in their adolescent years may allow them to gain early work experience with a tangible return and potential lifelong benefits. In other words, any intervention that extends compulsory schooling can potentially take boys out of employment and girls out of the house. From a policy design perspective, evaluating the costs and benefits associated with compulsory schooling laws requires first understanding who are the main compliers with an education reform.====In this paper, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of a compulsory schooling law in Turkey that made completing high school education mandatory. In April 2012, the Turkish parliament passed a new law to increase compulsory schooling from 8 to 12 years.==== Since the school starting age overlaps with the calendar year, we expect individuals born after January 1998 to be more likely to register for high school because they were more likely to be 8th graders in the 2011-12 school year. This implies that the individuals born before January 1998 could drop out after 8 years, whereas those born after January 1998 were bound to complete 12 years of education. Our identifying assumption is that these two cohorts born one month apart do not display any systematic differences other than exposure to the compulsory schooling law. In our fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design, we assign treatment according to an individual’s month and year of birth, with those who were born after January 1998 being assigned to the treated status. We use a nationally representative survey, the 2015 Household Labor Force Survey, which contains detailed information on education and labor market outcomes.====Our findings reveal that the reform was successful in increasing the education of both boys and girls. The main compliers with the reform among boys were those who would have participated in paid employment prior to the change in law, whereas female compliers would have likely not been in education, employment, or training (NEET), or they could have been engaged in unpaid work. Our results show that these gender differences remain unchanged regardless of differences in poverty rates across regions. However, we find that the reform had a positive impact on girls’ high school attendance only in more religiously conservative regions. We also find that the reform led to a significant decline in the NEET status of girls in more religiously conservative regions, with no evidence of a significant impact on those in other regions. The differences in regional levels of religiosity do not affect the results for boys.====The fact that compulsory schooling dramatically increased female enrollment in more religiously conservative communities highlights the importance of compulsory schooling laws in overcoming cultural barriers to female education by providing necessary incentives to parents. This is particularly salient in contexts where the main compliers are inactive adolescent girls who were previously neither investing in human capital accumulation nor gaining work experience in religiously conservative regions of Turkey.====After identifying the main compliers with the compulsory schooling law, we examine what types of schools the marginal students chose to attend in response to the law. In particular, we examine whether the reform had a differential impact on attending vocational versus academic high schools. Our findings indicate that the main compliers chose to attend vocational high schools as opposed to academic ones. In particular, in poorer and more religiously conservative regions, the vocational high school attendance of girls increased significantly, whereas we find no evidence of a significant impact for academic high schools. For boys, regardless of regional characteristics, the reform led to an increase in vocational high school attendance, while we observe no evidence of a significant impact for attendance at academic ones. Finally, we have some suggestive evidence that these effects are not operating through regional differences in vocational school supply. Since we assess the effects of compulsory schooling on a large number of outcomes, we adjust the standard errors for multiple hypothesis testing following Simes (1986). Most of our main findings are robust to this adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.====Our study relates to the extended literature on the causal effects of compulsory schooling laws on returns to education in the labor market (Angrist, Krueger, 1991, Oreopolous, 2006), health outcomes (Clark, Royer, 2013, Lleras-Muney, 2005), and fertility behavior (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2008, McCrary, Royer, 2011), among other dimensions. We contribute to this growing literature by offering the first study to examine the immediate effects of compulsory schooling on adolescent labor market outcomes by focusing on identifying the main compliers with the reform. This contrasts with previous studies that evaluate the medium- to long-run effects of compulsory schooling on adult labor market and health outcomes for the treated cohorts.====Second, a growing body of empirical work focuses on policy interventions against cultural barriers preventing girls’ access to education. Such barriers may include the parents being less willing to allow their daughters to travel to distant schools, an absence of sex-specific latrines, or a lack of female teachers. In Afghanistan, where the gender gap in primary school enrollment was 17 percentage points in 2007, Burde and Linden (2013) find that placing a school in a village significantly improves academic participation and achievement, particularly for girls. Their findings show that the gains for girls are large enough to remove the gender enrollment gap in treatment villages. Adukia (2017) finds that the construction of sex-specific latrines substantially increases enrollment of adolescent girls in India, and the author highlights that privacy and safety are particularly relevant for the schooling decisions of girls. Kazianga, Levy, Linden, and Sloan (2013) assess a “girl-friendly” primary school program in Burkina Faso, which included gender-segregated latrines, access to clean water, an increased presence of female teachers, and the provision of take-home rations for girls conditional on 90% attendance. Their findings also show a larger increase in girls’ enrollment compared to boys and that the unique characteristics of the schools accounted for the entire difference in treatment effects by gender. Meyersson (2014) finds that having a municipal mayor affiliated with the Islamic party increased female schooling in Turkey by increasing education facilities provided by religious foundations and relaxing the implementation of the headscarf ban in classrooms. Our study contributes to this growing literature by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of compulsory schooling using the pre-reform Islamic vote shares as a proxy for religious preferences, and showing that incentives provided by compulsory schooling laws help to alleviate the cultural barriers facing girls’ access to education.====Finally, our work joins a large literature that examines the causal effects of school attendance on child labor using exogenous variation from unconditional cash transfers (de Carvalho Filho, 2012, Edmonds, Schady, 2012), conditional cash transfers (Benedetti, Ibarraran, McEwan, 2016, Del Carpio, Loayza, Wada, 2016), or enrollment subsidies and scholarships (Edmonds, Shrestha, 2014, Ravallion, Wodon, 2000). A common finding in these studies is that cash transfers generate greater reductions in paid economic activities among boys than among girls, while they generate a significant decline in the performance of household chores by girls (de Hoop, Rosati, 2014, Edmonds, 2006). Moreover, the unconditional cash transfers result in a smaller increase in school enrollment than do conditional cash transfers (Baird, McIntosh, & Ozler, 2011), and parents generally prefer to send their sons rather than their daughters to school in the absence of conditionality (Akresh, de Walque, & Kazianga, 2013). Our main contribution to this literature is to examine the effects of high school attendance on an older group of children, adolescents, using exogenous variation from a compulsory schooling law. One advantage of our setup is the absence of a positive income effect for the treatment group, which is present in cash-transfer programs and might make it more difficult to disentangle the underlying mechanisms of income versus time constraints facing child labor allocation.","Compulsory schooling for whom?

We find that, of the 22 percentage points raw gap, about 13 percentage points is explained by differential subject choices and grades in secondary school.

There is no gender gap in science (the large gaps are in engineering and technology), and we also find a smaller gender gap when we include nursing degrees in STEM, showing that the definition of STEM used is an important determinant of the conclusions reached.","While education levels of women have increased dramatically relative to men in recent decades (Goldin, Katz & Kuziemko, 2006), women are still greatly underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) college programmes and occupations. Card and Payne (2017) show that, in the U.S. and Canada, the gender gap in the likelihood of graduating with a STEM‐related degree explains about 20% of the wage gap between younger college‐educated men and women, suggesting that the gender gap in STEM is important to understanding gender gaps in earnings.==== This issue is also important in terms of aggregate productivity; much evidence suggests that qualified STEM workers play an increasingly important role in increasing productivity and driving economic growth (Peri, Shih & Sparber, 2015).====Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand what determines college major choices. We examine this question by using unique data from Ireland. Ireland's centralized third level admission system provides an ideal laboratory because students provide a preference ranking of university programmes, allowing us to observe the college course preferences of all college applicants.==== Additionally, since college admission is almost completely determined by performance in a set of national examinations (the Leaving Certificate examinations), comparable information on prior preparation and relative performance across subjects is available for all applicants. We use this to examine whether the gender gap in STEM exists for boys and girls who have identical preparation at the end of secondary schooling (in terms of both subjects studied and grades achieved), or whether it is mostly due to differences in STEM-readiness that already exist at the end of secondary schooling.====We also investigate three broad explanations for the gender gap in STEM. The first is that girls do better in the Leaving Certificate and so have a broader menu of college course options. If non-STEM courses are more difficult to get into, this may lead to girls being less likely to do STEM. The second is that, even among boys and girls with the same overall Leaving Certificate achievement (as measured in “points”), girls/boys may have specific skills at the end of secondary schooling (comparative advantage) that make them less/more likely to do well in STEM relative to other courses and, hence, less/more likely to choose STEM courses in college.==== This comparative advantage should not be interpreted as being biological but may result from a range of environmental influences, such as family, peer, and school influences throughout childhood, that lead to skill differences at the end of secondary schooling (see, for example, Dossi, Figlio, Giuliano & Sapienza, 2019). We measure comparative advantage using grades in mathematics and English as well as grades in other subjects. The third explanation is subject choices during secondary schooling – boys may be more likely to have chosen school subjects that complement and facilitate subsequent STEM study at third level.==== Once again, differential school subject choices by gender could arise from biological factors or cultural factors, including the influence of teachers and parents, peer effects, a lack of female role models, perceived discrimination or for many other reasons.====Findings in the literature suggest a male comparative advantage in mathematics with boys generally found to do slightly better, on average, in mathematics but significantly worse than girls in less quantitative subjects (Goldin et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2013).==== Several papers have found that comparative advantage explains much of the gender gap in college STEM major choice. Aucejo and James (2016) find that comparative advantage can explain about 6.5 percentage points of the 17 percentage points gender gap in STEM in England. Likewise, Speer (2017) finds that it can explain about 6 percentage points of the 17 percentage points gender gap in his U.S. sample.==== Card and Payne (2017) find that, amongst STEM-ready students, about 3 percentage points of the 5 percentage points gender gap in STEM in Ontario is due to comparative advantage. Evidence that comparative advantage is relevant to the college gender STEM gap has also been found in China (Loyalka, Maani, Qu & Sylvia, 2017).====Most previous research has not studied the effect of school subject choices due to limited data availability. However, the few papers that have looked at this find that subject choices are an important factor. Using administrative data on college entrants in Ontario between 2005 and 2012, Card and Payne (2017) find that most of the differences in STEM enrolment between boys and girls results from differential readiness at the end of high school rather than due to differential choices of college major, conditional on being STEM-ready. Duta, Cristina, Marita and Smyth (2019) study variation in the freedom of choice of secondary school subjects across Ireland, Scotland and Germany and find that subject choices explain a larger fraction of gender differences in field of study in countries that have a less restrictive curriculum.====We add to the literature on the gender gap in STEM in several ways. First, unlike other papers in the literature, we observe preference rankings for all secondary school students who apply for college and, if relevant, the course accepted. Thus, we can study desired field of study for all persons who consider college, not just for the sample who actually attend. Second, we have grades for each of the 7 or 8 subjects taken in the Leaving Certificate examinations. These high-stakes exams are centrally set and graded and so are comparable across all students. They provide a detailed description of academic readiness at the end of secondary schooling and allow us to quantify the relative roles of general achievement, comparative advantage (as revealed through subject grades), and school subject choices in determining the gender gap in STEM. Third, while we do not include nursing degrees as STEM in our main analysis, we show that adding these to the STEM category has a major impact, showing that the definition of STEM used is an important determinant of the conclusions reached.====We find that, of the 22 percentage points raw gender gap in first preferences for STEM, about 13 percentage points is explained by differential subject choices and grades in secondary school.==== Strikingly, there remains an unexplained gender gap of 9 percentage points even for persons who have identical preparation at the end of secondary schooling (in terms of both subjects studied and grades achieved). There is considerable heterogeneity within STEM: There is no gender gap in science and the substantial gender gap in engineering is mostly explained by Leaving Certificate subjects and grades. On the other hand, most of the raw gap in technology remains unexplained, suggesting different policies may be required to tackle the gender gap in technology than in engineering. Additionally, gender gaps become much smaller when we include nursing in STEM. We also find that gender gaps are smaller among high-achieving students and for students who go to school in more affluent areas.====We find that differences in overall Leaving Certificate achievement between boys and girls have a negligible effect on the STEM gender gap. While there are systematic gender differences in subject-specific grades with boys doing better in mathematics and girls doing better in most other subjects, we estimate that male comparative advantage in STEM (as measured by Leaving Certificate subject grades) explains only about 3 percentage points of the 22-points gender gap. We find that boys and girls use different decision-making strategies when deciding whether to choose STEM with boys tending to look at their (intra-individual) comparative advantage in mathematics and English, while girls are more likely to decide based solely on their mathematics ability. We also find that comparative advantage plays a larger role for higher achieving students.====Leaving Certificate subject choices are much more important than grades in explaining the STEM gender gap. Differential subject choice in school may partly arise due to availability as boys’ schools are more likely to offer STEM-friendly subjects for the Leaving Certificate. However, the gender gaps in Leaving Certificate subject choices are just as large in mixed-gender schools, suggesting differential availability is not a major factor. Overall, we attribute most of the explained STEM gender gap to differences in subject choices between boys and girls in secondary school. ====, there are systematic gender differences in decision-making that lead to boys being more likely to choose STEM subjects in college.====The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next section, we describe the institutional background and data, and, in Section 3, we carry out some descriptive analysis. In Section 4, we present our main regression analysis of first ranked preferences and, also, show estimates for the sample of persons who choose to accept a college course.

This approach combines kernel matching with entropy balancing to account for selection bias and sorting on gains. Using data from the German SOEP, we evaluate the effect of work-related training, which represents the largest portion of adult education in ","Updating skills and abilities over the life cycle is crucial for workers, firms, and entire economies seeking to prevent human capital depreciation and to remain competitive in a globalized and ever-changing work environment (OECD, 2005, OECD, 2013). Particularly in industrialized countries, participation in continuing education and training (CET) has become widespread. For example, according to the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) 2015, approximately half of adults aged between 25 and 64 years took part in some CET activity (including open or distance-learning courses, private lessons, organized sessions for on-the-job training, and workshops or seminars—some of which might be of short duration) in OECD countries in a given year (OECD, 2017, p. 327). The majority of these activities are nonformal (approximately 92%), meaning that they are organized but are less institutionalized and structured than formal learning activities (which usually lead to the granting of credentials and certificates).====While there are numerous studies showing that work-related training affects individual labor market outcomes and benefits the performance of the firm, there is rarely any causal evidence on the extent of further non-pecuniary benefits from CET (Field, 2011).==== Focusing on the case of Germany, where participation rates are close to the OECD average,==== this paper provides an update on the monetary returns to CET and makes two key contributions to the literature on adult education. First, we address empirical challenges in the evaluation of wider benefits from training by transferring an extended flexible econometric framework from the labor economics literature into the literature that evaluates wider benefits of adult education. Second, we apply this framework to identify the effects of work-related training, which constitutes the majority (82%) of nonformal CET in Germany and elsewhere (Federal Ministry of Education and Research, 2015, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, 2017),==== on measures of civic/political, cultural, and social participation—measures that are related to social capital at the individual level (Putnam, 1993). Social capital outcomes are high on the political agenda because social capital is considered to facilitate collaboration and cooperation within a society, yielding positive economic and social externalities (see Section 2 for a discussion).====We use rich longitudinal panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) from 1992 to 2014. These data offer detailed information on pecuniary and non-pecuniary outcomes, participation in work-related training activities, and a rich set of socio-economic background variables. In empirical studies, social capital often constitutes an aggregate of two dimensions: personal involvement in social activities and trust in people generally (Huang, Maassen van den Brink, & Groot, 2009). While social capital is a multidimensional concept (Hoskins, Mascherini, 2009, Neira, Portela, Vieira, 2010) with no consensus about the exact definition (Scrivens & Smith, 2013),==== one can relate the first measure to a ==== dimension of social capital (i.e., the channels and opportunities through which interaction can take place) and the second measure to a ==== dimension (i.e., the level of trust, group identification, and the quality of social ties and networks) (Widén-Wulff & Ginman, 2004). We use eight non-pecuniary outcome variables to capture the structural dimension of social capital, which include interest in politics; participating in local politics; volunteering in clubs, organizations, and community services; attending artistic and musical events; being active in artistic/musical activities; and meeting with and assisting neighbors, friends, and relatives. To avoid ad-hoc definitions of how to combine the eight variables, we use a principal component analysis (PCA) that reveals and quantifies the underlying data structure. We also discuss the effects on trust in others and the number of close friends to capture the relational dimension of social capital. To measure participation in work-related training, the SOEP provides special survey modules in the years 2000, 2004, and 2008 that specifically ask the respondents about training activities in the last three years prior to the survey. Using this information, we define three periods before, one period during, and three periods after training participation for each of the modules.====Evaluating the effects of CET requires the construction of the counterfactual situation of what would have happened to training participants if they had not taken part in the training. Social experiments provide the gold standard for a causal evaluation because the treatment status is randomly assigned. However, data from randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiments are not available for many research questions that are interesting from a policy perspective. Moreover, (quasi-)experimental variation sometimes identifies a specific parameter that is hardly transferable to other interventions and population groups. Our approach therefore relies on methodological insights from the literature that studies the effects of training on labor market outcomes in a real world setting, considering the entire population that may be affected by the treatment. At the center of the framework is a regression-adjusted matched difference-in-differences approach (Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, Todd, 1998, Heckman, Ichimura, Todd, 1997, Smith, Todd, 2005b), which requires panel data to model the decision to participate in training. Using information from two periods before the training, the method accounts for selection into the training based on the levels and the trends of a large set of observable characteristics. Moreover, our econometric framework incorporates the use of entropy balancing to refine conventional matching weights (Hainmueller, 2012). By calibrating unit weights in the non-participation group such that average covariates of the reweighted comparison group satisfy prespecified balancing conditions, the approach ensures exact balancing between the participant and non-participant groups not only on the mean but also on higher moments such as the variance of the covariates. This approach is meaningful because we show that the participant group is a more homogenous selection of the population than the non-participant group. The regression adjustment uses individual fixed effects to control for further selection on time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Although our results are not very sensitive to the choice of the econometric model, we carefully assess the robustness of each step and discuss how changes in the empirical specification affect the estimates.====We find that participation in work-related training yields positive non-pecuniary returns in the form of higher civic/political and cultural participation. Those increases do not crowd out social participation. We do not find that trust or the number of close friends increase after participation in work-related training. To establish the econometric model, we estimate earnings returns to work-related training of approximately 5% on average, which confirms previous findings in the literature (Büchel, Pannenberg, 2004, Lechner, 1999b, Pischke, 2001). A series of robustness checks show that the results are not driven by selective sample attrition or functional form assumptions. While work-related training should primarily increase individual productive skills and abilities, thus leading to job promotions and earnings increases (De Grip & Sauermann, 2013), further results suggest that these improvements in skills and labor market outcomes are unlikely to explain our findings. By contrast, we provide suggestive evidence that work-related training opens up opportunities for networking, social interactions, and information exchange, which then lead to higher participation in civic, political, and cultural activities. Supporting this view, we do not find effects for distance learning courses where people rarely meet and interact with each other. In that sense, these benefits come as a by-product of activities engaged in for other purposes (Coleman, 1990). Because social participation, trust in others, and the number of close friends do not seem to be related to the participation in work-related training, we conclude that participation is characterized by low-intensity social interactions that do not foster relational dimensions of social capital immediately. Being aware that non-experimental data may still conceal correlations of unobserved factors with the treatment and outcome variables that may violate the identifying assumption of common trends in the participant and non-participant groups, we provide an extensive discussion to show that the results are unlikely to be driven by endogeneity bias.====Our paper is related to the literature that studies the returns to adult education. Supporting the widespread belief among researchers (e.g., Balatti, Falk, 2002, Field, 2011, Green, Preston, Janmaat, 2006, Portes, 1998) and policy makers (e.g., Council of the European Union/European Commission, 2015; Education Council, 2006, OECD, 2005, OECD, 2017) that there are wider benefits of adult education, some studies relate participation in CET to well-being, health, job satisfaction, and worries (Balatti, Falk, 2002, Burgard, Görlitz, 2014, Feinstein, Hammond, 2004, Georgellis, Lange, 2007, Jenkins, 2011, Ruhose, Thomsen, Weilage, 2019), social and political attitudes (Balatti, Falk, 2002, Feinstein, Hammond, 2004, Preston, Feinstein, 2004, Ruhose, Thomsen, Weilage, 2019), and measures of social capital such as membership in civic groups, political interest, voting, social networks, and trust (Bynner, Hammond, 2004, Emler, Frazer, 1999, Feinstein, Hammond, 2004, Preston, 2004a, Preston, 2004b, Rüber, Rees, Schmidt-Hertha, 2018). However, this evidence is almost entirely based on descriptive and qualitative studies, covering only specific questions (Blanden, Buscha, Sturgis, Urwin, 2010, Desjardins, Schuller, 2011, Field, 2011, OECD, 2010). Many of these studies also do not differentiate by the type of learner, which limits the possibility of identifying causal mechanisms (Field, 2011).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework of this study by introducing the concept of social capital and how work-related training may contribute to social capital. Section 3 introduces the data, explains the basic structure of the dataset, develops our measures of social capital, and discusses the construction of the treatment and comparison groups. That section also sets out the conditioning variables for the matching procedure. Section 4 describes the empirical setup and the implementation of the estimator. Section 5 presents the results, discusses the identification assumption, and performs a series of robustness checks. Section 6 discusses potential mechanisms by looking at effect heterogeneity along individual and training characteristics.

Based on that idea, Chile’s centralized university admission system introduced, in 2012, a “GPA-ranking score” variable. In contrast to other ranking-based criteria, the Chilean version ostensibly avoids classmate competition by basing scores on past cohorts’ GPAs. Also, the GPA-ranking is similar to an added bonus to the GPA score, and it does not replace the national admission exam. Such design incentivizes both academic effort and GPA ","In the United States, a major focus of higher education policy has been to increase the enrollment rates of racial minorities, particularly at flagship institutions. To achieve this goal, many higher education institutions introduced explicit affirmative action policies. However, in some cases (e.g., ====, 1996; ====, 2001), courts have declared such policies unconstitutional. In response, policymakers have changed admission criteria to include observable variables that are correlated with academic skills but independent of race or family income.====For example, after the ruling of ====, Texas introduced, for all its public universities, guaranteed admission to students with GPAs within the top 10% of each high school.==== Given that Texas high schools have high racial segregation, within-school ranking would be a performance indicator uncorrelated with race or family income (Cortes, 2010). In other cases, universities modified their admission criteria to benefit underrepresented minorities, such as by transferring some of the weight previously assigned to standardized admissions tests to high school GPA.==== However, the introduction of such policies can have effects beyond admissions: on the one hand, ranking-based admissions increase the marginal reward of studying and thus might increase learning; on the other hand, it can incentivize strategic behavior to manipulate the ranking variable (Cullen, Long, & Reback, 2013).====In this paper, we study the effects of a similar nationwide admission policy on high school students’ academic performance in Chile. Although Chile is largely racially homogeneous (Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, & Wacziarg, 2003), socioeconomic status (SES) is an especially strong determinant of achievement in a country with high SES segregation across schools (Mizala & Torche, 2012). Meanwhile, university admissions are based on the ==== (PSU) admission exam, which replicates the SES segregation pattern and results in highly unequal access to leading institutions. For example, 37.7% of the 2011 (pre-policy) entering class at ====, the flagship public university, came from unsubsidized private schools,==== which have less than 10% of total enrollment and where students from high income families represent, by far, the largest share of enrollment (Mizala & Torche, 2012). Even greater overrepresentation is observed at ====, the flagship private university, where 65.9% of the 2011 entering class came from unsubsidized private schools.====It is this unequal access to leading institutions, in addition to the financial pressure that tuition fees put on families, that precipitated the 2011 Chilean students’ movement for education reform.==== As the Chilean centralized admission system had been largely based on standardized admission exams, one of the policy responses to the students’ movement was the introduction of a new variable, called “GPA-ranking score” in the admission criteria of the leading universities. Although standardized admission exams remain important, the new admission criteria increased the weight of high school GPA and introduced a score bonus to reward students with GPAs exceeding the average GPA of their high school’s previous three graduating cohorts. In contrast with other GPA-based admission criteria, like the Texas Top 10% Plan, the Chilean ranking score ostensibly avoids competition between classmates, as it compares students’ GPAs to previous cohorts’ and does not guarantee admission to a fixed percentage.====The potential effects of such a policy can be summarized in three hypotheses. First, the new criteria may increase students’ incentives to study harder/better, which should result in higher achievement.==== Second, the new criteria may increase schools’ incentives to engage in strategic behavior, such as artificially inflating grades to improve their school’s university admission rates. Third, the new criteria may induce strategic behavior by students in their choice of high school. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence about the first two hypotheses.==== Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we observe that a cohort exposed for three years to the new admission criteria increases its 12th grade GPA by about 0.164 points, or 30.7% of a Chilean GPA standard deviation. Later, we use simulated instruments to test if the marginal incentives, in the form of a marginal score bonus as a function of the student’s position within the GPA distribution, produce different effects. Our findings show evidence of larger GPA increases within schools where, on average, the new variable presented greater incentives. In addition, we find evidence of larger GPA increases among low-SES students, but no evidence of larger increases (within schools) among the students that faced a higher marginal score bonus. Instead, our results show that GPA increased across the entire school cohort.====To test whether the GPA increase may be due to increased learning, we investigate whether GPA increases predict changes in standardized test scores or university admission exam-taking rates or performance. None of these achievement indicators show any significant correlation with the GPA increase, suggesting that the GPA increase is due to grade inflation rather than increased learning. In consequence, these results suggest that schools have adjusted grading strategically in response to the new university admission criteria.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Chilean university admission system. Section 3 reviews the literature related to ranking-based admission. Section 4 provides a simple conceptual framework to understand students’ decisions under the new admission criteria. Section 5 describes the data and methodologies used in the paper. Sections 6 and 7 provide the estimated effects of the new admission criteria on GPA and achievement, respectively. Section 8 concludes.",Increased learning or GPA inflation?

Results indicate that female students who attend schools with later start times get more sleep and score higher on reading tests. Male students get more nighttime sleep when schools start later, but their daily sleep is unchanged due to a decrease in napping; their test scores do not change.","Over the past decade, many U.S. school districts have pushed their high school start times later in response to surveys suggesting that teens are not getting enough sleep and evidence from sleep scientists suggesting that children's circadian rhythms shift to later in the day as they enter adolescence (Carskadon, Vieira, & Acebo, 1993). Poor or inadequate sleep is correlated with higher rates of obesity, higher rates of depression, higher motor-vehicle crash rates, and lower cognitive performance (Bostwick, 2018, Pilcher and Huffcutt, 1996, Roenneberg, 2013).==== Proponents of later start times argue that the lack of sleep resulting from early start times harms students’ mental and physical health (Wahlstrom, 2002). Therefore, shifting to later start times has the promise of increasing sleep, academic achievement, and health (e.g., Jacob and Rockoff, 2011, National Sleep Foundation 2013).====At the same time, shifting to later start times often occurs with much disruption to local communities’ schedules and can potentially raise busing costs.==== For example, changing high school start times would likely require employers who provide teenagers with after-school jobs and providers of extracurricular activities to make scheduling adjustments (Shapiro, 2015, Wahlstrom, 1999). It is also often argued by opponents of later school start times that moving the high school day later (both start and end times) would mean that sports teams could not practice after school or would have to shorten their practices due to less daylight (National Sleep Foundation, 2014). If students end up spending less time on these activities, later start times could diminish the human capital acquisition that usually results from students’ participating in these activities (Hinrichs, 2011).====The link between school start times and achievement has received much attention in the popular press, by the health community, and even by Congress. House Concurrent Resolution 176, introduced to Congress in 2007 as the “Zzz's to A's Resolution” but not passed, called for secondary schools nationwide to begin the school day after 9:00 a.m. More recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (2014) recommended that “in most districts, middle and high schools should aim for a starting time of no earlier than 8:30 a.m.” If delaying start times causes students to get more sleep, students may experience increases in positive health outcomes and cognitive performance—and ultimately academic achievement. Early start times, however, may not be detrimental to learning if students are able to adapt to waking up early or if teachers are more productive with early schedules. Some papers have examined whether changing school start times results in a positive effect on measurable academic outcomes, with mixed results (Carrell et al., 2011, Edwards, 2012, Heissel and Norris, 2018, Hinrichs, 2011, Luong, P., Lusher, L., & Yasenov, V. (2017)., Wong, 2011).====The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to examine whether school start times affect high school student learning, and (2) to examine the effects of school start times on students’ time allocation (especially sleep time) and health in order to understand the mechanisms through which changing start time affects student learning. This paper contributes to the literature on the effects of school start time in two ways: (1) we use longitudinal data from a nationally-representative sample of high school students aged 13–18 attending grades 9–12 (the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics [PSID–CDS]), whereas prior studies examined the effects of high school start time on student learning and health at a school, within a state or metropolitan area, or at the school level, and (2) we use time diaries to explore the effects of high school start time on students’ time allocation, which could help to explain any observed effects on academic achievement beyond a shift in sleep timing. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use time diaries to address the policy debate on the effects of school start time on after-school activities, including sports, homework, and part-time jobs. We are also the first to use diaries for a nationally-representative sample of students to examine the effect of school start time on sleep. Time diaries are believed to produce estimates of time spent doing activities that are more accurate than surveys asking about usual time spent on activities (Juster, Ono, & Stafford, 2003). Our time-diary estimates suggest that students actually sleep about an hour more than reported in surveys asking about usual sleep on a school night.====In our econometric analysis, our objective is to identify the causal effect of start time on academic achievement. When we estimate the effect of school start time on math and reading test scores, we include a rich set of controls for individual (including lagged test scores), family, high school, and community characteristics. However, because we are unable to control for unobservable characteristics (such as teacher quality) that may be correlated with both start times and test scores, we also use an econometric technique developed by Oster (2019) that relates selection on observables to selection on unobservables in order to estimate bounds on the true causal effect.====Our results inform the policy debate on the effects of changing school start times for high school students. For female students, we find that those who attend schools with later start times get more sleep and score higher on reading tests, though not on math tests. We find that shifting start time one hour later increases reading test scores by 0.16–0.28 standard deviations. Male students get more nighttime sleep with later start times; however, they do not get more daily sleep due to an offsetting decrease in napping, and we do not observe any effects of start time on their test scores. We also find that female students whose school starts later are more likely to be on a sports team, though they spend less time on other schooling activities (such as SAT prep) and leisure activities. Male students with a later start time spend less time watching TV and playing computer games. Lastly, we find no deleterious effects of changing start time on student employment or health.",Snooze or lose: High school start times and academic achievement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718306800,29 May 2019,2019,Research Article,131.0

Teacher absenteeism in primary schools in West Africa is estimated to be between 27–40% (Mbiti, 2016, Transparency International 2013). One potential solution has been to strengthen the monitoring of teachers (Banerjee and Duflo, 2006, Glewwe and Kremer, 2006, Mbiti, 2016). Yet despite numerous interventions, such as community-based monitoring, hiring local teachers and audits, improving teacher accountability continues to be a significant challenge. This is particularly the case in countries with limited infrastructure and weak institutions, where the costs of monitoring are particularly high. For example, in Niger, the subject of this research, teacher absenteeism in a previous adult education program was 33% (Aker, Ksoll, & Lybbert, 2012).====The introduction of mobile phone technology throughout sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to reduce the costs associated with observing teachers’ effort. By allowing governments and organizations to communicate with stakeholders in remote areas on a regular basis, digital technology may allow principals to more easily observe teachers’ effort. Similarly, digital technology could allow communities to provide more timely feedback on teacher performance, thereby improving their engagement in the educational system.====To address these questions, we conducted a randomized evaluation of an intervention in rural Niger that was designed to improve teacher accountability and adult students’ learning. Villages were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first was a two-year adult education program (basic literacy and numeracy) in Hausa, with normal monitoring visits by non-governmental organization (NGO) and Ministry staff. The second included the same curriculum and monitoring as the first, but villages also received a mobile intervention: weekly phone calls to the teacher, village chief and two randomly selected students. A variant of this intervention was implemented in a subset of mobile villages during the second year, in which only teachers were called. The third was a pure control group, with no adult education program or calls. No other financial incentives were provided for teachers in the short-term. The evaluation was carried out in 131 villages in the regions of Maradi and Zinder.====We find that both the adult education program and the additional mobile phone intervention improved students’ learning outcomes. Across both years of the program, students in the standard adult education program increased their math and reading test scores by 0.19–0.22 s.d., meaning that they were able to decode eight additional elements (letters, syllables, words) and solve two additional math problems. The mobile phone intervention led to an additional increase in math and reading test scores of 0.12 and 0.15 s.d., respectively, with stronger effects amongst called students. These magnitudes are comparable to the effects of computers, teacher training and smaller classrooms on learning outcomes in primary schools in developing countries (McEwan, 2015). After addressing alternative threats to identification, such as differential attrition and baseline imbalance, we find that the math results are robust across these different specifications.====This evidence is consistent with our hypothesis that, beyond its use as a pedagogical tool within the classroom, mobile technology can be used as a device to improve students’ learning. Yet a key question is the mechanisms through which these impacts occurred – as monitoring, motivation or reminders – and whether they primarily affected teachers or students. On the teacher side, teachers in mobile villages were more likely to keep attendance logs and pass a competency exam, although only the latter result is robust to multiple-hypothesis testing. On the student side, students in mobile villages were less likely to drop out of the course and called students had substantially higher test scores in the short- and medium-term, although only the latter is robust to multiple hypothesis-testing. While we do not find evidence that the mobile intervention increased the extensive or intensive margin of teacher attendance, given the quality of our attendance data, we cannot rule out the possibility that the calls did not affect teacher absenteeism.====From a policy perspective, the magnitude of the effects on students’ learning in mobile villages is relatively large, especially for called students, and cost-benefit calculations suggest that the calling intervention was cost effective. The question, however, is whether it is necessary to call all three stakeholders – the teacher, students and village chief – or just a subset. We did not find differential effects between calling all stakeholders or calling only the teachers during the second year, although this could be due to limited power. Nevertheless, our results suggest that simple calls could be a promising tool for policymakers to improve learning outcomes in rural areas, and merit future research.====Our results contribute to several strands of literature. First, despite decades of investment in adult education programs in developing countries, to our knowledge, it is one of three randomized evaluations of these programs (Banerji, Berry, & Shotland, 2017). Aker et al. (2012) evaluated the impact of a mobile phone-enhanced adult education program in Niger, finding that using mobile phones as pedagogical tools increased writing and math scores as compared to a standard adult education program. However, there was no pure control group. More recently, Banerji et al. (2017) evaluated the impact of a maternal literacy and at-home learning program in India, finding that these interventions increased mothers’ test scores by 0.05–0.12 s.d.====Second, our study contributes to the existing literature on the effectiveness of teacher monitoring, which primarily focuses on teachers of school-aged children (Guerrero et al., 2013, Mbiti, 2016). Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan (2012) and Cueto, Torero, León, and Deustua (2008) find that monitoring programs combined with financial incentives reduce teacher absenteeism, with the former study also finding improvements in children's test scores. Muralidharan, Das, Holla, and Mohpal (2017) find that increased school monitoring is strongly correlated with lower teacher absence. Cilliers, Kasirye, Leaver, Serneels, and Zeitlin (2018) find that local monitoring combined with financial incentives improves teacher attendance.==== Our experiment is somewhat unique in that it did not provide any explicit financial incentives for teachers, which may be easier for governments to implement, and focuses on an adult education program.====Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on community-based monitoring and inspection systems (Björkman, Martina, and Jakob Svensson, 2009, Olken, 2007, Bengtsson and Engström, 2013). There is extensive evidence showing that material and financial incentives can crowd out intrinsic motivation if agents are mission-oriented rather than self-interested, thereby suggesting that incentives or monitoring can lead to a null or negative effect on agents’ effort. At the same time, recent work suggests that extrinsic incentives may not crowd out intrinsic motivation (Bengtsson & Engstrom, 2013). Our study suggests that the latter effect may be at work, as teachers reported that “these calls…show that our work is important”.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on the setting of the research and the research design, whereas Section III presents the conceptual framework through which this intervention might affect student learning. Section IV describes the different datasets and estimation strategy, and Section V presents the results. Section VI provides evidence on the mechanisms and Section VII discusses alternative explanations. Section VIII discusses cost-benefit analyses and Section IX concludes.",Call me educated: Evidence from a mobile phone experiment in Niger,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718305697,24 May 2019,2019,Research Article,132.0

It provides full scholarships to economically disadvantaged public high school graduates who have been admitted to eligible universities. We exploit the random assignment of first-year students to small study groups at an elite university in Peru to evaluate how the interactions between relatively wealthy non-Beca18 students, who predominate at this institution, and Beca18 fellows affect early academic outcomes. We find that assignment to mixed study groups, composed of Beca18 and non-Beca18 students, on average improves performance on individual weekly/biweekly quizzes. In the case of Beca18 fellows, the positive effect of mixed-study environments is greater among fellows that possess relatively high academic ability as incoming students (that is, among those with higher pre-college academic ability). Interestingly, the opposite holds for non-Beca18 students. We identify two potential underlying mechanisms behind these results: (i) peers’ incoming (pre-college) academic ability and (ii) peer's attitudes towards effort and cooperation. Beca18 students in mixed study groups seem to benefit more from the relatively higher academic ability their non-Beca18 peers possess upon entrance. Non-Beca18 students appear to benefit from experiencing the higher effort and cooperation levels displayed by Beca18 fellows. Our evidence also suggests that some individuals may be adversely affected. These include Beca18 students who are toward the bottom of their socioeconomic group and non-Beca18 students who are at the top of their socioeconomic group in terms of pre-college ability distribution.","To promote social mobility and alleviate social inequalities, in recent years several governments in the developing world have significantly increased their efforts to improve the access of socially and economically disadvantaged youth to elite institutions of higher education (Beyer et al., 2015; Melguizo, Sanchez, & Velasco, 2016). Concrete examples of these efforts include the publicly funded programs SerPiloPaga in Colombia, PoliticadeCuotas in Ecuador and Beca18 in Peru. These programs provide financial aid to poor high school graduates who have been admitted to eligible, mostly private elite universities, subsequently increasing socioeconomic diversity at highly selective post-secondary institutions.====While a few recent studies have evaluated the impacts of these programs on enrollment and dropout rates (Londono-Velez, Rodriguez and Sánchez, 2017, Melguizo, Sanchez and Velasco, 2016), there is scarce evidence of how interactions between the wealthy students who predominate at elite universities and the poor students targeted by the programs influence key individual outcomes such as academic performance and social preferences. This paper aims to fill this gap. It presents experimental evidence on the academic peer effects related to close academic interactions among college students from opposite socioeconomic backgrounds in the context of the Peruvian Beca18 program. Beca18 provides full scholarships to high school graduates who live in poverty according to the Peruvian Household Targeting Index (SISFOH by its Spanish acronym); have achieved high academic standards at secondary school (in terms of high school GPA); and have been admitted into an eligible university.====More specifically, in order to estimate the academic peer effects of interest, we exploit the random assignment to small study groups==== of 568 first-term students in the 2016 cohort at an elite private university in Peru. While some students were assigned to (mixed) study groups containing both Beca18 fellows and relatively wealthy non-Beca18 students, others were assigned to (unmixed) groups containing only Beca18 or only non-Beca18 individuals. Students met in their study groups in weekly tutorial labs to review lecture material and prepare for their weekly/biweekly individual quizzes.==== Tutorial labs were, however, not held during the midterm and final exams periods (lasting ten to fourteen days each) and ended one to two weeks before final exams. Students were not required to work together in their study groups during midterm and final exams.====In the context of the Peruvian Beca18 program, it is not ex-ante obvious how the assignment of Beca18 and non-Beca18 students to the same study group will affect their academic outcomes. Consider first peer effects related to academic ability. Several studies suggest that on average, students benefit from interacting with higher ability peers (Brunello, De Paola and Scoppa, 2010, Carrell, Fullerton and West, 2009, Feld and Zölitz, 2017, Lyle, 2007, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2006). Nevertheless, as Peru lacks a national high school exit test or universal college admission exam, directly assessing the pre-college academic ability==== differences between Beca18 and non-Beca18 students and hypothesizing about which group will likely benefit from being assigned to work with higher incoming ability peers is problematic. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that several eligible universities applied differentiated admission mechanisms and criteria to Beca18 and non-Beca18 students, which complicates efforts to use admission scores to make academic comparisons.====At the university in which our study takes place, Beca18 fellows attend a six month pre-college remedial program, which aims to address their potential gaps in high school preparation. On the other hand, non-Beca18 students attend a separate highly intensive four week pre-college summer program, whose main objective is to assess their high school academic background. We take the GPA obtained by Beca18 students in their remedial program as a measurement of their pre-college (incoming) academic ability and use it to academically rank them. We proceed similarly with non-Beca18 students but use, in this case, the GPA obtained in the four-week summer program. However, given the different nature and objectives of the remedial and summer programs, the related Beca18 and non-Beca18 academic performance measurement are not comparable and cannot be used to assess the relative differences in incoming ability across Beca18 and non-Beca18 individuals.====Additionally, even if we were able to provide direct, ex-ante evidence on the relative pre-college academic differences among Beca18 and non-Beca18 students, socioeconomic segregation within study groups may still take place,==== limiting the scope of academic peer effects. Moreover, peer effects other than those related to academic ability can also influence students’ outcomes. Some instructors we interviewed indicated that Beca18 fellows are hardworking and collaborative; traits which, as recently suggested by Golsteyn, Non, and Zölitz (2017), may influence attitudes and motivation and consequently, the academic performance of their relatively wealthier peers.====This paper focuses on how mixed study group assignment in the context of the Beca18 program affects college students’ academic performance on two types of individual assessments during their first-term semester: i) weekly/biweekly quizzes (“practicas calificadas” in Spanish) and ii) midterm and final exams. The first take place during the regular class period and assess the material covered in previous weeks, which is generally discussed in tutorial labs. The second are cumulative evaluations, when lectures and tutorial labs are not held.==== In the case of weekly/biweekly quizzes, we find that students in mixed study groups on average perform better than those in unmixed ones. Our results also indicate that among Beca18 fellows, the treatment effect on these quizzes increases when pre-college academic performance is higher (high incoming ability fellows benefit the most); while among non-Beca18 students, the opposite pattern is observed (low incoming ability individuals obtain the highest gains). Our evidence also suggests that some students are negatively affected. These students are: Beca18 students in the bottom 20% and the non-Beca18 students in the top 15% of the respective Beca18 and non-Beca18 incoming ability distributions.====In the case of academic performance during midterms and final exams, the estimated average treatment effect is close to zero for both non-Beca18 and Beca18 students. However, we find evidence of heterogenous effects in pre-college academic ability among non-Beca18 students. As observed in weekly/biweekly quizzes, relatively low incoming ability non-Beca18 students benefit the most in terms of their midterm/final exams performance. Also, high incoming ability non-Beca18 students are negatively affected. Interestingly, the proportion of non-Beca18 students negatively affected is higher in this case than that observed for weekly/biweekly quizzes. We hypothesize that this particular result is likely related to the different intensities of study group interactions during the regular class period (when tutorials are held) and the exams period (when lectures and tutorials are not held).====Exploiting qualitative as well as indirect, ex-post, quantitative evidence related to our study context, we identify and discuss two potential underlying mechanisms for our first term results: (i) differences in peers’ incoming academic ability and (ii) differences in peers’ attitudes towards effort and cooperation. We argue that treated Beca18 fellows likely benefit from the relatively higher pre-college academic ability of their non-Beca18 peers while treated non-Beca18 students plausibly benefit from the relatively higher effort and cooperation displayed by Beca18 fellows.====Our results also indicate that non-Beca18 students with relatively low parental incomes obtain the highest academic gains and that mixed study groups seem to influence academic outcomes if they contain two Beca18 fellows but not if they contain only one. We finally explore academic performance during the second academic term and find that relatively low incoming ability non-Beca18 students still benefit from having been assigned into a mixed study group during their first-term semester; however, we do not find statistically significant effects for Beca18 fellows in this case (although the coefficients’ size and sign are similar to those observed in the first term).====Early studies that exploited exogenous variation in group composition to estimate college peer effects mostly took advantage of random or quasi-random assignment of students to roommates, dorms and residences (Foster, 2006, Sacerdote, 2001, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2006; Lyle, 2007, Zimmerman, 2003). While random assignment in such contexts helped researchers deal with the endogeneity and self-selection issues related to group conformation, roommates may not constitute relevant “academic interactions” or “reference groups” as they likely represent a small subset of an individual's peer group. Consequently, their use in empirical analysis can result in imprecise estimates (Carrell, Fullerton and West, 2009, Sacerdote, 2011). In our paper we are able to capture a relevant “reference group” as first-term students within the same study group are expected to intensively interact in tutorial labs linked to several of their first-term courses.====Among these early studies, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2006) also show that low-income college students benefit from having high-income peers. They hypothesize that this finding is associated with one of two factors: low-income students possess inferior study skills or believe less in the importance of education; nonetheless, the authors do not provide clear evidence on this matter. Our paper shows that not only low-income but also certain high-income students benefit from being paired with individuals from the opposite socioeconomic status and provides evidence on the potential related mechanisms.====More recently, Rao (2019) also studies the peer effects resulting from the school interactions between wealthy and poor students in a developing country context. He exploits a policy change in India forcing private schools to reserve a proportion of their seats for socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Rao mainly focuses on social preferences and discriminatory behavior but also explores impacts on learning outcomes, finding marginally significant negative effects on wealthy students’ English test scores. A key difference between our studies is that while Rao focuses on elementary school children, we study college students. Also, while he relies on an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to identify peer effects related to closely working with a poor student, we have precise knowledge of study group composition. Furthermore, while Rao focuses only on wealthy pupils, we also study academic outcomes among the economically disadvantaged.====As in our study, a growing amount of recent papers (both working and published) use random assignment of college students to relatively small study groups and find similar non-linear peer effects (Feld and Zölitz, 2017, Zölitz and Feld, 2018, Fischer, 2017, Golsteyn, Non and Zölitz, 2017, Kimbrough, McGee and Shigeoka, 2017 Thiemann, 2017). In all likelihood, the most closely related paper to ours is the study by Feld and Zölitz (2017) where 7500 students were randomly assigned to small class sections at Maastricht University School of Business and Economics (SBE). They find that college student's benefit from higher academic quality peers on average but, as in our paper, these results mask a fair amount of heterogeneity. In their case, low-achieving students are harmed by high-achieving peers. In terms of the mechanisms at play in the context of small study group interactions, particularly those related to peers’ attitudes towards effort, our paper closely connects to Golsteyn et al. (2017). These authors exploit random assignment to small class-sections, also at Maastricht SBE, and find that students perform better in the presence of more persistent peers. We must however highlight than none of the papers in this expanding literature has explored the role socioeconomic diversity plays in academic performance in small study groups in general and in the context of a social inclusion program in higher education in particular. Also, while our paper finds that peer effects are heterogenous in terms of incoming ability, supporting the most recent literature findings, it also shows that this observed heterogeneity, as well as the mechanisms driving it, may differ as a function of socioeconomic status.====Our paper provides valuable evidence on whether the active sorting of individuals into small study groups can be used by college and social program officers to improve the performance of disadvantaged students. In this sense, our work complements the findings in Carrell, Sacerdote, and West (2013).====The rest of the paper develops as follows: Section 2 describes the Beca18 program. Section 3 discusses the institutional context and study group random assignment. Section 4 presents the empirical approach and the short-term (first term) results. Section 5 discusses potential underlying mechanisms. Section 6 discusses second term impacts.

Finally, words associated with qualities of service (traditionally stereotyped as feminine) favor women more than men; whereas, words with traditionally masculine associations have a negative impact on women's evaluations.","Recent years have seen an interest in the study of women's low representation in different areas, of which academia is one. In the Mexican National System of Researchers (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNI), for example, women make up only one-third of the total. This low representation has important consequences. The lack of diversity in the sciences leads to the neglect of issues of vital importance for the welfare of women, such as the treatment of medical conditions that affect only them,==== or the impact of public policy on their lives.==== Another consequence of this lack of diversity, or lack of role models, is that fewer women choose academic careers, perpetuating the idea that academia is a masculine field.====One of the reasons given for this low representation is that the evaluation of academic work is subjective and can be guided by gender stereotypes. Men and women can be evaluated based on different standards of academic work and behavior.==== Such stereotypes can therefore bias tenure decisions against women. In this article, we present evidence of such bias and stereotypes in teaching evaluations, using big data from the internet site MisProfesores.com in Mexico. We download all the evaluations submitted to the site from 2008 to 2018, a total of slightly more than 600,000 student evaluations.====This data source has advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that the evaluations are completely anonymous, so they closely reflect students’ opinions. The site includes a section for narrative comments, on which we perform a quantitative text analysis. Among the disadvantages are that we do not know whether the evaluations represent a random sample of the students taking the course, because the students submitting the evaluations are self-selecting.==== Also, given the complete anonymity of the process, we do not know the gender or any other demographic data for the student submitting an evaluation. We therefore cannot analyze who is most likely to discriminate or express their opinions in different ways.====This type of study is pioneering in Mexico for its scientific analysis of big data generated on the internet. In the U.S., this type of data has been used extensively to analyze students’ opinions about their university courses. In one of the first examples in the literature, Kindred and Mohammed (2005) analyze why students evaluate their professors or use information from RateMyProfessors.com (RMP), the U.S. equivalent of ====. Felton, Koper, Mitchell, and Stinson (2008) use the data from RMP to analyze the correlations between the quality of a course and the perceptions of the students. Studies have also analyzed the validity of this type of online evaluation, including what is really evaluated on the site (Bleske-Rechek and Michels, 2010, Gregory, 2012, Otto, Sanford and Ross, 2008) and comparing it with institutional teaching evaluations (Brown, Baillie and Fraser, 2009, Clayson, 2014, Coladarci and Kornfield, 2007, Sonntag, Bassett and Snyder, 2009, Timmerman, 2008). In general, such studies have found that this type of voluntary and informal evaluation is correlated with the quality of the course and does not necessarily offer an extreme perspective on teaching performance. The findings indicate that the evaluations in RMP are positively correlated with formal institutional evaluations, although some note differences between evaluations submitted to RMP before and after institutional evaluations (Legg & Wilson, 2012), as well as halo or contagion effects in positive evaluations (Clayson, 2014, Lewandowski, Higgins and Nardone, 2012), suggesting possible biases.====Closer to the intent of our study, Stuber, Watson, Clarke, and Staggs (2009) investigate possible gender biases in the RMP evaluations and find no statistically significant differences between men and women. Reid (2010) looks for evidence of racial or gender biases in the evaluations, and finds that African-American and Asian-American professors receive lower scores, but finds little gender bias. More recent studies have attempted to control for differences between male and female professors, for example in teaching style or in the type of courses taught. MacNell, Driscoll, and Hunt (2015) artificially vary the gender of professors of online courses and find that women receive lower evaluation scores than men. Boring (2017) and Mengel, Sauermann, and Zölitz (2019) take advantage of a random assignment of male and female professors to courses and find biases against the women.====The approach closest to ours is that of Mitchell and Martin (2018), who find gender biases in evaluation of online courses. They also analyze the language students use in answers to open-ended questions and find that they describe male professors in terms of their competencies and female professors in terms of their appearance and personality. Our own study applies the methods of this latter study to analyze the evaluations in ====. We add to this analysis an exploration of how stereotyped language affects female professors’ total scores differently than those of male professors, further evidence of gender bias in teaching evaluations.====This topic is not only important in itself, but it may also have broader implications. The majority of Mexican universities have a system of student evaluations of professors. In some institutions this evaluation is an important factor in tenure or promotion decisions. At the same time, we know that there is a gap in the representation of male and female professors in Mexico. According to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI, 2015), 56% of college and university professors are men and 44% are women. Among researchers enrolled in the National System of Researchers (SNI), the difference is even greater: 66% men and 34% women. If student evaluations reflect gender stereotypes and biases, and are used in tenure and promotion decisions, that could help to explain the gender gap in teaching positions. It is not possible to prove such a link with the data from our study, but we hope that our results encourage further reflection and empirical analysis of the validity of these evaluations.====Our principal findings are as follows. First, there is evidence that women receive lower scores and a lesser perception of their performance than men, although the difference is relatively small: 1–2% of a standard deviation. Second, female professors receive far more comments than men about their appearance and personality, as found also by Mitchell and Martin (2018). Third, evaluations commonly refer to men as “====” or “====” (the title corresponding to their academic degree), but to women as “====” (“teacher”), showing greater respect to men than to women. This difference is pronounced: women receive twice as many comments with the word “====” as men. Fourth, there is great heterogeneity with respect to field of study, type of institution, and geographic region. Fifth, the word used most often to describe a class taught by a man is “excellent,” while that for a class taught by a woman is “good.” Sixth, the proportion of words referring to the demanding nature of the class or to being a “bad” professor is greater for women. Finally, our main contribution is to show that words associated with qualities of service (traditionally stereotyped as feminine) favor women more than men, whereas words with traditionally masculine associations have a negative impact on women's evaluations.====These results are consistent with the view that women are held to higher standards than men (Card et al. 2018; Ghosh and Liu, 2018, Hengel, 2019a, Hengel, 2019b). The consequences are significant. Women spend more time on publishing their research (Hengel, 2019a, Hengel, 2019b), and they also spend more time on teaching-related activities (El-Alayli, Hansen-Brown, & Ceynar, 2018) and university service (Guarino & Borden, 2017). Having lower scores on teaching evaluations may push them to invest further time in teaching preparation. The net result is that female professors have less time to produce new research. Furthermore, when their contribution in joint work is unclear, women pay the cost in their tenure evaluations (Sarsons, 2019). Finally, the toll of all this negative feedback on women's morale may not be trivial and needs to be explored. The overall environment does not contribute to closing the gap in representation of male and female professors in higher education.====This article is organized as follows.

Towards addressing informational asymmetries among citizens regarding the quality of both private and public services, performance accountability systems have been implemented in a wide variety of settings.==== Performance accountability systems have become an increasingly present feature of the United States education system over the last two decades, with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) arguably the most prominent. Given the array of salient information regarding academic quality (e.g., school report card grades), it has become relatively easy for citizens to hold school administrators and school board members accountable for poor academic quality (Barrows, 2015, Berry, Howell, 2007, Payson, 2017). The poor financial climate left in the wake of the Great Recession, however, has created a renewed focus on information and accountability related to the financial well-being of school districts. As school board members, treasurers, and superintendents all play a role in the financial outcomes for school districts,==== citizens likely also have ample reason to hold school officials accountable for poor school district financial outcomes. Citizens ability to do so, however, may be hindered by the lack of easily accessible and digestible school district financial health information.====Financial intervention systems provide a potential solution to this asymmetric information problem by making school district financial information more salient to citizens. This increased salience arises from the monitoring and publication of information on school district financial health and the sanctioning of school districts that are performing poorly financially. While these financial intervention systems have been found to impact voting decisions in local tax elections (Thompson & Whitley, 2017), this is the first study to consider how these types of interventions impact the turnover of school district officials and electoral accountability of school board members along financial quality dimensions.==== This study considers the specific case of the State of Ohio’s fiscal stress labeling program, which has the following features: (a) ====: the state monitors school district budget deficits; (b) ====: school districts with budget deficits receive a fiscal stress label and must develop financial recovery plans. The development and implementation of the financial recovery plan is undertaken by either the school district (fiscal oversight) or the state (fiscal emergency) depending on the severity of the budget deficit; (c) ====: notices regarding label receipt or removal and the financial status of these school districts are disseminated to the public through online press releases and local media exposure.====This paper assesses the effects of these fiscal stress labels on school board and school administrator turnover and examines the mechanisms driving the changes in school board turnover. The study examines school board roster and election results data in Ohio from 1999 to 2013 and school administrator rosters from 2007 to 2013. These data are analyzed using a difference-in-differences strategy that takes advantage of variation in the timing of fiscal stress label receipt and removal. School board members are found to be 5.2–5.5 percentage points more likely to turn over their seat following fiscal oversight and 11.4–13.4 percentage points more likely to turn over their seat after fiscal emergency. The higher turnover after fiscal emergency is primarily caused by a decreased voter preference for incumbents after the state takeover. In addition, school administrators are 16.1 percentage points more likely to lose their jobs following fiscal emergency. These results suggest that citizens may be placing greater accountability pressure on school officials due to the causes and consequences of the sanction (i.e., the state takeover) than the financial information these labels may provide.",Are school officials held accountable for fiscal stress?

After the end of the fourth week of classes, students who fell below a 70% threshold on a performance measure, or had an attendance rate below 75%, were referred to the university's Student Success Center for additional academic support. A referral consisted of students being informed of their status and being given optional assistance in course specific skills through tutoring, as well as training in general skills like ","Student progression and retention rates are of primary concern to college administrators and state legislators. Most college ranking systems factor in four and six-year graduation rates as part of the metric towards measuring the quality of the university and student success. Furthermore, from a financial standpoint, students who attend but do not complete college have relatively little additional earnings over students who finish high school but do not attend college. These students, however, will often have an additional financial burden from tuition payments and student loans.==== From a political perspective, more state funding of public universities and financial aid is increasingly being made contingent on students making timely progression towards their degree. For these reasons, colleges and universities have a strong interest in ensuring that students successfully progress towards their degree. Progression in the first-year college courses are particularly important for retention and graduation as many students, particularly first generation college students, make the transition from high school to college. According to a U.S. News report, one in three freshmen fail to continue on to their sophomore year.====In this article, we investigate the effectiveness of an early academic intervention on student performance in core economics courses at the University of South Carolina. In an initiative to help increase the success and retention rates of students enrolled in Principles of Microeconomics and Principles of Macroeconomics, students with poor performance and excessive absences early in the semester were referred to the university's Student Success Center (SSC). The SSC informed the referred students about already existing additional tutoring opportunities as well as training on general student success skills, such as time management and study skills. Since students were only referred if they fell below certain cutoffs, we estimate the effect of the intervention on future performance within a regression discontinuity framework.====Using data from the referrals, we compare student performance and attendance at the time of the referral to the student's performance at the end of the semester to investigate if students who fell just below the referral criteria did significantly better by the end of the semester than students who fell just above the cut-off point. We use as a measure of student performance at the end of the semester the percentage grade of twenty questions on the final exam common to all sections of the course. Our main results show that for students at or near the referral performance threshold, the intervention increased performance on the common questions by 6.5 to 7.5 percentage points. This result indicates that there is a strong effect from the referral. Furthermore, these gains are largest for the students who are less prepared for college, as measured through initial college math placement test scores.====Our work builds on the established literature in a few dimensions. First, we provide evidence that an early intervention can affect student outcomes. Second, we provide evidence that the “nudge” from the referral can, by itself, meaningfully change student behavior. Third, we find the impact of the intervention to be heterogeneous across individuals. Finally, our results show that students who are the least prepared for college, as measured by their performance on a college math placement test, benefit the most from the intervention.====The findings in this article help university administrators understand the importance of early intervention on student success, and thus allocate university funding in a more effective manner. If colleges are able to identify the students who most need study help and provide effective intervention programs, then implications for state allocation on school financing arise (Breneman, Abraham, & Hoxby, 1998).====The paper will proceed as follows: the second section describes the background literature, the third describes the data, the fourth defines our empirical approach, the fifth presents our main results, the sixth extends our analysis and presents results from falsification tests, and then we conclude.",Early intervention in college classes and improved student outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718305272,10 May 2019,2019,Research Article,136.0

We identify the effect of adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability at scale on children’s educational outcomes by combining data on the expansion of ART availability with two national household surveys that include HIV testing. Through a triple difference specification, we find that the availability of ART increased the likelihood that children in households with HIV positive household heads started school on time and were the appropriate grade-for-age. Two mechanisms were likely decreased incidental infections in the household and related care giving duties.","In the southern cone of Africa more than 10 percent of prime aged adults are HIV positive and 20% of children live with an HIV positive adult, creating a public health crisis with multigenerational effects (UNAIDS, 2015). HIV has no cure. Instead, the international response has been to treat those already infected and try to prevent additional infections. The primary treatment response has been the subsidized distribution of adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) to infected adults. Epidemiological studies have shown that the adherence to the prescribed ART regime increases adult health (Hammer, 1997, Wools-Kaloustian, Kimaiyo, Diero, Siika, Sidle, Yiannoutsos, Musick, Einterz, Fife, Tierney, 2006), and this improved adult health could have important benefits for children. Previous research has shown the effect of ill adult health on children. For example, Pitt and Rosensweig (1990), Yamano and Jayne (2005), and Evans and Miguel (2007) found that the ill health of others in the household impeded children’s educational access and attainment through care giving duties, labor substitution, and money available for nutrition and school expenses. In this paper we focus on the opposite question: the effect of a national, adult public health intervention on the children of the targeted adults. Specifically, we estimate the impacts of the at-scale, i.e. national, provision of ART on the schooling of children living in households with infected adults. Even though the national and international response to HIV/AIDS has been to provide free or subsidized ART, the effect of adult ART provision at scale (and corresponding improvement in adult health) on children’s schooling is unknown. Research is complicated by both a lack of data and compelling sources of exogenous variation in exposure to treatments. This study will provide the first estimates of the effect of a large scale subsidized adult ART program on children’s schooling.====We identify the effect of the availability of adult ART on children’s schooling through the timing and location of free ART availability and variation in adult HIV status, a triple difference specification. Zambia, the focus of our study, is one of the highest HIV prevalence countries in the world and has one of the most successful ART distribution campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa as one of the original President’s Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) target countries. Prior to the availability of ART in Zambia, one in seven adults aged 15–49 was HIV positive and one in five children of primary school age was living with a mother, father, or household head who was HIV positive (DHS 2002). In 2003 ART was effectively unavailable and by 2007, 40% of households were within 10 km of a treatment facility that distributed free ART. We combine unique health facility level data on the dates of initial ART availability and geographic coordinates of the facilities that provided ART with two national household surveys that include HIV testing modules. Because we are studying a nationwide program at scale, unfortunately we are somewhat limited by the available data. Due to privacy concerns we are unable to assign exact HIV status to all of the adults in our sample. In the interest of symmetry and to alleviate concerns of selective test refusal, we instead rely on the likely HIV status of the individual based on the HIV status of others in the demographic group. More details on the exact construction of this measure are in the Data Section.==== We include extensive controls in our primary specifications and numerous robustness checks to ensure that this data limitation is not confounding our estimates.====Our triple difference is then the interaction of a health facility ever providing free ART (spatial variation), whether the health facility distributed free ART prior to the date of the household survey (temporal variation), and the likely HIV status of adults in the household (variation in likely HIV status). This triple difference identifies the effect of adult ART availability on children’s educational outcomes in households with likely HIV positive adults, net of any location, time, or location by time variation that is common to both likely HIV positive and likely HIV negative households (e.g. differential development trends by region). Further, it controls for any differences across time for likely HIV positive and negative households. While we are unaware of any education programs that targeted children in HIV positive households or any programs that targeted households near to health facilities that distributed ART, our use of the interaction of likely HIV status and a time dummy variable and the use of the interaction of being near a health facility that distributed ART and a time dummy variable would control for these possibilities. Finally, we are unaware of any concurrent programs that specifically targeted HIV positive households in locations in which ART was available, other than the specific ART availability.==== Therefore, our estimates are the effect of adult ART availability on children’s educational outcomes.====We find that expanded ART availability increased the likelihood that primary school aged children who lived with a likely HIV positive household head enrolled in school on time and were the correct grade for age, a proxy for timely school progression. We do not find any evidence that ART availability differentially increased the likelihood of children being enrolled in school beyond the first two years of primary school, perhaps not surprising given that government primary schools did not charge fees, eliminating a common enrollment barrier. The results are similar if the reference adult is the mother or father. Because our labor market participation measures are coarse, we cannot confirm or reject that this increase is due to changes in the extensive margin of the adult labor supply. In contrast, we find substantial decreases in illness among children under 5, indicating that one potential mechanism is a decrease in incidental infections in the household or related care giving duties.====One strand of the existing economic literature on HIV/AIDS has focused on the detrimental relationship between adult HIV and adults’ and children’s outcomes. Both Akbulut-Yuksel and Turan (2013) and Fortson (2011) found that children in households with an HIV positive mother or in regions with a high with HIV prevalence had less schooling than expected. Ainsworth and Filmer (2006) and Kasirye and Hisali (2010) found a decrease in child school attendance during parental illnesses and prior to parental death. Focusing on adults only, Levinsohn, McLaren, Shisana, and Zuma (2013) used propensity score matching and found that HIV positive adults in South Africa were less likely to be employed.====Another strand of the literature has focused on the effects of the free or subsidized provision of ART and has taken one of three approaches. The first type used smaller scale clinic- or employer-based studies and focused on HIV positive adult recipients of ART with variation coming from the timing of the initiation of treatment. All individuals in these studies had sought treatment and were adhering to treatment. Hammer (1997) and Thirumurthy, Zivin, and Goldstein (2008) used longitudinal data on individuals in Western Kenya and found that the initiation of ART increased recipients’ labor supply and that children in household’s with HIV positive adults increased their weekly school attendance by over 20%. Habyarimana, Mbakile, and Pop-Eleches (2010) used a similar strategy with longitudinal data from a diamond company in Botswana and found that the initiation of ART decreased worker absenteeism. A second approach relied on temporal and spatial variation in ART availability, effectively difference-in-differences, but considered the effect on the whole population regardless of HIV status (e.g. Baranov, Kohler, 2014, Bendavid, Holmes, Bhattacharya, Miller, 2012, Friedman, 2014, McLaren, 2010). A third approach used a strategy similar to the current paper with the HIV status of individuals or other adults in the household as an additional source of variation. Baranov, Bennett, and Kohler (2015) used HIV status to limit their analysis to HIV negative households and found that ART availability increased the intensive margin of labor supply in three rural districts in Malawi. Lucas and Wilson (2013) and Lucas and Wilson (2018) used a similar identification strategy to the current paper and found that the availability of adult ART increased the weight of children under 5 years old in households with likely HIV positive adults and the weight of likely HIV positive women.====Our paper adds to the existing literature on five important margins. First, we have longer run outcomes (e.g. grade progression and enrollment decisions) that were not available in previous studies. Second, because we are using a national household survey we are able to estimate the effect over all HIV positive households, even those who did not seek, were not yet eligible given their disease progression, or did not adhere to treatment. Existing studies focus on individuals seeking and adhering to care at clinics. In a low-resource setting providing public health at-scale could have very different effects than providing care in individual clinics. Third, our estimates are the net effect on HIV positive households, eliminating any changes in outcomes that are common across all households. Fourth, we test the opposite side of the literature that has found that parental illness has negative effects on children’s schooling – can at scale public health improve parental health to overcome this deficit? Fifth, the ART distribution and expansion model in Zambia is common to other countries supported by the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and our estimates present a likely scenario for similar PEPFAR supported countries.",Effects of adult health interventions at scale on children’s schooling: Evidence from antiretroviral therapy in Zambia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571730688X,9 May 2019,2019,Research Article,137.0

We jointly model educational choices, ","Educational attainment in Brazil and its relationship with wages is characterized by a number of surprising phenomena that are not easy to reconcile. Since the 1930s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of individuals completing more than primary education and progressing to intermediate and high school education. At college, graduation rates increased steeply for those born until the early 1950s, but declined for the cohorts of the 1950s and 1960s, rising up again only for the most recent cohorts. At the same time, the wage premium to secondary and high school education declined, while the wage differential between college and high school graduates remained steadily high, above 100%. The aim of this paper is to understand why college graduation declined for the 1950s and 1960s cohorts despite high earning gains.====We start by describing the trends in relative education and wages, and the Brazilian school system. We show that there is no lack of availability in college positions, at least in the private sector. Only the public universities, with free tuition, are oversubscribed. Since there are vacancies at universities, other explanations are needed for the low responsiveness of the supply of college graduates. It could be that the observed wage differentials reflect the higher ability of college graduates and not the returns that the average high school graduate would face. Alternatively, individuals could be facing constraints to attend and complete college education. These constraints could be of a financial nature – university fees are too high – or originate earlier on in life due, for example, to lack of access to good schools at the intermediate level, which is a key determinant of the ability to enter and successfully complete college education (Binelli & Rubio-Codina, 2013). Moreover, psychic costs (e.g. Carneiro, Hansen, Heckman, 2003, Cunha, Heckman, Navarro, 2005) and lack of knowledge or uncertainty about future earnings gains from additional schooling could also play a significant role (e.g. Altonji, 1993, Cunha, Heckman, Navarro, 2005, Heckman, Lochner, Todd, 2006).====In addition, wage differentials are only part of the story: a very high differential on a low base may still not justify a very high up-front monetary cost. In other words, the internal rates of return may be negative if costs of college education are particularly high. We thus document the actual monetary costs of attending college and compute the internal rate of return to college relative to high school, taking into account the costs of education, the predicted wages (net of composition effects), and the participation rates in college and high school.====In order to compute the actual wage differentials and the internal rates of return that individuals are facing, we consider four education levels – primary, secondary, high school and college – and we estimate a joint model of educational choices, labour force participation and wages. The first component of the model – educational choices – isolates the determinants of educational choices and the impact of education quality and local labour market conditions on education. The second component – labor market participation – estimates the impact of education on labour market attachment, and allows us to control for selection into the labour market. The third component – wages – estimates the wage differentials for each level of education.====Crucially, we allow unobserved ability to affect all components of the model. In this way, we deal with the endogeneity of both schooling choices and of labor market participation, and we examine the effect of self-selection on ability on the returns to education. This is of particular importance, since the large increase in participation in high school may have substantially distorted the wage returns due to composition effects. We allow the impact of unobserved ability on wages to be education-specific and time-varying, thus allowing the wage differentials to be heterogeneous as in much of the literature on wage inequality.==== We estimate how changes in composition evolve by birth cohorts and how they affect the observed relative wage differentials. We show the importance of accounting for selection by comparing the average education wage differentials from the data with the differentials estimated from our model, as well as with the marginal and the internal rate of returns. To achieve identification we use information on schools’ availability and local economic conditions at the time and state of birth of the individual, having controlled for both state effects and aggregate time trends.====Our model is an extension of the models developed by Cameron and Heckman (1998), Willis and Rosen (1979) and Heckman and Sedlacek (1985), Heckman and Sedlacek (1990), which are based on Roy (1951). Cameron and Heckman (1998) discuss the limitations of schooling choice models that consider one schooling choice in isolation, such as the model developed by Willis and Rosen (1979) that focus on the transition from high school to college. Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2007) extends the model by introducing stochastic thresholds and interval-specific outcomes. Following Cameron and Heckman (1998), we model schooling choices using an ordered discrete-choice model that is consistent with a dynamic model of educational choices where wages are the individuals’ payoff of schooling choices. Importantly, we augment Cameron and Heckman’s (1998) framework by also modelling labour market participation, which could have been a second source of selection bias affecting returns to schooling.====Several papers have estimated the effect of education on wages, in many countries and using several different techniques to deal with the endogeneity of education.==== However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that jointly estimates wages, education and participation to simultaneously control for the endogeneity of education and participation in a middle-income country, and, importantly, compute both the average, marginal and internal rate of returns to education.====There has been some earlier work on Latin American countries, but none that endogenizes education choice and labor force participation simultaneously, and none that computes both the marginal and the internal rates of returns. Examples include Manacorda, Sanchez-Paramo, and Schady (2010) who decompose the changes in the returns to education in a sample of Latin American countries into demand and supply factors, but do not endogenize the education decision nor control for unobserved ability, and Jacoby and Skoufias (2002) and Binelli and Rubio-Codina (2013) who address the issue of self selection into higher education in a Latin American country but ignore the impact of selection on labor market participation. Rodriguez, Urzua, and Reys (2015) develop a schooling decision model with unobserved ability and tuition costs to estimate the heterogeneous effects of post-secondary education on earnings in Chile. As in Rodriguez et al. (2015), we estimate a model that allows for heterogeneous returns to schooling. However, in addition, we are able to simultaneously control for self-selection into education and work participation, and to estimate the internal rate of return, which is the relevant margin for educational choices.====A large literature also computes returns to schooling in high income countries. Heckman et al. (2006) compare the estimation of returns to schooling using traditional mincerian regressions with models that take into account psychic and tuition costs and non-linearities in education and experience. Among the most recent contributions on estimating the effect of education on wages, Heckamn et al. (2014) use proxies for cognitive and socioemotional abilities to control for ability bias and estimate heterogeneous effects of education on wages as well as on health. There is also an extensive literature that focuses on college education. Among the most recent examples, Bhuller, Mogstad, and Salvanes (2017) compute internal rates of return to college in Norway using rich data and taking into account taxation and pensions, and Ashworth, Hotz, Maurel, and Ransom (2017) calculate returns to college in the U.S. after taking selection and in-school work experience into account. Carneiro et al. (2003) develop a model of college choices that accounts for intrinsic uncertainty facing agents at the time they make their decisions about enrollment in school.

While alcohol related crime and deaths draw national headlines, recent studies provide strong evidence that alcohol consumption also impacts the academic development of college students. Exploiting the discrete change in legal access to alcohol that occurs at age 21, both Carrell, Hoekstra, and West (2011), hereafter CHW, and Lindo, Swensen, and Waddell (2013), hereafter LSW, find that legal access to alcohol causes a decline in student grades. While the studies agree on the direction of the effect, they conflict on its magnitude. CHW find that subsequent grades decline by 0.10 standard deviations at the Air Force Academy, while LSW find that they decline by just 0.03 standard deviations at the University of Oregon. LSW speculate that the smaller effect identified in their study may be due to the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) having less bite at the University of Oregon than it would at the Air Force Academy where adherence to the MLDA is strictly enforced.====In this paper, we seek to reconcile the literature by probing LSW's contention that legal access to alcohol causes a larger decline in academic performance in populations that find the MLDA to be more restrictive. To do so, we exploit predictable variation in the bite of MLDA for various student groups at the same institution. Adherence to the MLDA on college campuses is low, with over 60% of underage students reporting that they consumed alcohol in the past 30 days (Wechsler, 2001). The most common channel through which an underage student acquires alcohol is from an of-age peer, with of-age family members following closely (Wechsler, Lee, Nelson, & Kuo, 2002). This implies that students with a larger network of peers and relatives over age 21 face lower costs to obtaining alcohol when underage. Using information on a student's in-state status and membership in fraternities or sororities to proxy for their social network, we estimate the effects of the MLDA separately for groups with different social network strength.====Our findings indicate that legal access to alcohol reduces academic performance on average and provide evidence supporting LSW's contention that the effect size varies systematically with the bite of the MLDA. Replicating the baseline analysis from LSW in a similar setting—a different large public university—we find that legal access to alcohol reduces academic performance for the overall student body by 0.025 standard deviations. Groups that presumably experience larger increases in alcohol consumption upon attaining the MLDA experience larger declines in academic performance. In contrast, students with access to strong social networks that may enable them to easily acquire alcohol when underage experience no substantial decline in academics upon attaining the MLDA. Taken together, these results are consistent with both the relatively large and relatively small effects identified in prior studies.",Legal access to alcohol and academic performance: Who is affected?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718304576,8 May 2019,2019,Research Article,139.0

We also find that the program increased the representation of the poorest students in the top 9% of test takers. Survey evidence suggests that students spent more time and money preparing for the test.,"According to the World Bank, the prohibitive cost of tertiary education is one of the primary drivers of the substantial inequalities with regards to its access in Colombia (World Bank, 2012). In 2017 constant dollars, the average annual cost of tuition at a public university in Colombia was almost $900 US Dollars, while for private universities it is approximately $7300; the latter figure is over 40% of per adult national income (Ministry of Education of Colombia., 2016, The World Inequality Database., 2019).==== Attendance at tertiary institutions shows a clear pattern by income quintile. The composition of students is approximately 8.6% in the first quintile, 9.5% in the second, but over 44% for those in the fifth (OECD & World Bank, 2012, p.106). The rewards for attending college in Colombia are substantial: Bachelor’s degree holders earn on average 3.5 times more than those with only a high school degree (World Bank, 2013).====To help combat the inequality of access, the government has developed programs aimed at the poor for secondary and tertiary education,==== and in the second half of 2014, launched a new initiative to expand college access to low income students called Ser Pilo Paga (henceforth SPP), which roughly translates to “it pays to be smart”. Scholarships from this program were allocated based on both need and merit, awarding tuition and living expenses to students of low socioeconomic status who were the highest performers in the country’s high school exit exam, the Saber 11====. The SPP program appears to have been unique in that it was possibly the first competitive large-scale university scholarship program where very high performance on a standardized test was required yet only students of low socioeconomic status were eligible, with 10,000 scholarships having been awarded annually.==== The scholarship program stopped distributing new awards after 2018.====In this paper, we examine the extent to which students increased their performance on the high school exit exam as a result of the introduction of the SPP program, and seek to determine the channels through which any performance gains were obtained. Using administrative data from the government of Colombia’s education and socioeconomic agencies for the years 2014 and 2015, we exploit the sharp discontinuity in the SES measure of eligibility for SPP (the Sisben score) to examine the causal effect of the scholarship’s introduction on Saber 11==== test scores, and then observe whether the socioeconomic composition of the top 9% of test takers changes. Lastly, we overview the results of a large-scale survey at one of Colombia’s top-ranked private tertiary institutions to probe whether and how students reacted to the introduction of the SPP in terms of preparation and other measurable dimensions.====The following is an outline of the main findings of the empirical analysis. Examining the difference in test scores at the SES eligibility threshold, we determine that the causal effect of the scholarship is approximately 0.09 standard deviations, which is rather sizable in magnitude. These gains appear to be driven by students at the top of the ability distribution, with those at the 90th percentile of test scores experiencing increases in the neighbourhood of 0.17 test score standard deviations. The distribution of top performers before and after SPP was introduced changes: in 2015, students of the lowest social class have 18% increased odds of appearing in the top 9% of test takers relative to 2014. Survey evidence suggests that students spent about 9.8% more money to prepare for the test after the introduction of the SPP, and that they were more likely to take private in-person and virtual courses in order to prepare for the Saber 11====. The SPP also appeared to increase the subjective desires for high scores and the need to obtain a high score in order to earn a scholarship.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. It appears to be one of the first to investigate whether performance on a standardized test increases in the wake of additional incentives in the form of a valuable competitive scholarship program that uses the test to allocate the recipients, and the potential channels through which the increases occur.==== Perhaps the first paper to examine this question was that of Pallais (2009), who examines the effect of the introduction of Tennessee’s HOPE merit scholarship on ACT standardized test scores. Scores below the cut-off point to qualify for the reward were increased, but those above the cut-off saw no effect. There are several important differences between the SPP program and the HOPE scholarship. The first is that there were two different ways to qualify for HOPE, either through performance on a standardized test or through one’s high school GPA; qualifying for SPP could only be done via performance on a standardized test. The second is that the test score cut-off to qualify for HOPE is closer to the median of the distribution,==== while the SPP scholarship was awarded for students in approximately the top decile. The third is that financial need is not considered for HOPE, whereas for SPP, only students of low socioeconomic status are eligible. Lastly, the HOPE scholarship awarded an amount that is less than tuition, while SPP also covered living expenses (which can be considerable in Colombia’s larger cities).====Another paper that looks at ex ante outcomes due to the introduction of a scholarship is Bartik and Lachowska (2014). They examine the effect of the surprise announcement of the Kalamazoo promise scholarship, which pays a certain percentage of tuition depending on how long students have attended Kalamazoo Public Schools, a mid-sized school district with approximately 10,000 students from a range of different racial and economic backgrounds. The scholarship covers between 65% and 100% of college tuition, depending on how long the student had been enrolled at schools inside the district. Unlike SPP and HOPE, there were no GPA or test score requirements: the student need only enroll in higher education. Bartik and Lachowska (2014) find that the program increased high school GPA, but only for black students. However, school suspensions in the district decreased by a substantial fraction for the overall student population. The authors conjecture that improved behaviour is a channel through which the increase in high school GPA occurred.====Most papers examining the effects of competitive university scholarships focus on ex post outcomes, such as graduation rates and college grades. Research on the ex post effect of scholarship programs (such as on grades and graduation rates) has been conducted regarding Georgia’s HOPE scholarship program by Cornwell, Mustard, and Lee (2005) and Cornwell, Mustard, and Sridhar (2006), West Virginia’s PROMISE program by Scott-Clayton (2011), and Louisiana’s Opening Doors program by Richburg-Hayes et al. (2009). There is much research on the effect of short-term incentives on test score performance; Gneezy et al. (2017) provide an extensive review. One paper examines the effect of the Ser Pilo Paga program on college enrollment, stratification, and student diversity (Londoño-Veléz, Rodríguez, & Sánchez, 2018).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We conduct a brief overview of the Saber 11==== high school exit exam and the SPP program in Section 2. We outline the data and conduct some initial analysis in Section 3. In Section 4, we estimate the causal effect of the introduction of the SPP program using a sharp regression discontinuity design and investigate the robustness of the results, and then examine how the distribution of students in the top 9% of test takers has changed. Section 5 overviews the results of a survey given to students at a top private university in Colombia that graduated from high school between 2013 and 2016.

I exploit district and time variation in access to a state preschool program (CDEP) that targets disadvantaged four-year-olds (those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch or Medicaid). Using a difference-indifferences design, I estimate the effects by CDEP-eligibility status of ","The early years of a child’s life are arguably the most important for the formation of cognitive and non-cognitive skills in the short, medium, and long term. These skills are critical contributors to a child’s overall success in life (Heckman, 2006). In the United States, many believe that investing in the early stages of a child’s life can enhance that child’s readiness for school, resulting in academic improvements during school (Wong, 2015). This belief has motivated policymakers to invest in establishing publicly-funded preschool programs, including 4K programs, which are preschool programs serving four-year-old children.==== A number of studies have examined the effect of preschool programs on cognitive skills. The findings from most of these studies are consistent: preschool programs have demonstrated positive effects on academic achievement.==== This result is observed among studies based on Head Start,==== randomized experimental trials (Elango, García, Heckman, Hojman, 2015, Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, Yavitz, 2010, Heckman, Pinto, Savelyev, 2013), and preschool programs (targeted and universal) at the state level.====Given the consensus around the private returns to preschool, I examine if spillover benefits on academic performance exist from preschool. I define spillover effects as those deriving from exposure to South Carolina’s targeted preschool program (residing in a school district where the program was available at age four) that are not driven by participation in the program. Targeted students are those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch or Medicaid at age four. Non-targeted students are not eligible to participate in the program. Aside from participating, exposure to the preschool program is limited to students’ association with program participants. As a result, spillover benefits might arise through improvements in the school learning environment—aspects of an educational setting that impact students’ ability to learn (e.g., teaching pedagogy, social interactions, classroom decorum)—set in motion by program participants. In this way, all exposed students may benefit whenever such improvements occur.==== Lefgren (2004), Lin (2010), and Zimmerman (2003) each find positive peer effects on later academic achievement, although these studies do not consider the peer effects of preschool. Literature focusing primarily on the spillover effect of preschool on academic achievement is scant. One exception is Neidell and Waldfogel (2010) who consider the relationship between preschool peer enrollment==== and math and reading scores for a nationally representative sample of kindergartners followed through first and third grades. However, unlike my paper, their empirical approach lacks exogenous variation in the presence of peers who attended preschool. The authors find positive peer effects of preschool on kindergarten math and reading scores and first-grade math scores, with no effects present in later grades.====Important policy and empirical implications arise if spillovers from preschool exist. First, if such effects exist, previous estimates of the own-effect of preschool on academic achievement could be understated. Second, failing to account for spillover benefits from the public provision of preschool programs could result in such programs being underfunded. The current study seeks to determine whether or not a state preschool program has positive spillovers on the later academic achievement of students. I estimate the effect on the math and reading scores of South Carolina students in grades 3 through 5 of implementing, in funded school districts, the South Carolina Child Development Education Program (CDEP)====, a means-tested 4K program targeting four-year-olds who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch or Medicaid. Specifically, I exploit district and time variation in access to CDEP and use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect across all students of CDEP exposure. Additionally, I disaggregate (estimate separately) the effect by students’ CDEP-eligibility status. Having the ability to disaggregate the effect by CDEP-eligibility status allows me to test for the existence of spillover effects on the exposed, CDEP-ineligible students. I find that the introduction and subsequent funding of CDEP not only increases the third through fifth grade math and reading scores of exposed, CDEP-eligible students (by about 0.18 standard deviations) but also has positive effects on the third through fifth grade math and reading scores of exposed, CDEP-ineligible students, where math and reading scores increased by about 0.13 and 0.14 standard deviations, respectively. Lastly, to examine a possible mechanism for the positive spillovers on math and reading scores, I estimate the effect of CDEP on the number of disciplinary incidents involving students. I find that CDEP leads to a reduction in the number of disciplinary incidents among exposed, CDEP-eligible students but has no impact on the number of disciplinary incidents among exposed, CDEP-ineligible students. This result supports the possibility that CDEP indirectly benefits students, in whole or in part, through improvements to classroom decorum via fewer behavioral disruptions.====Since 1994, South Carolina has provided funding to its school districts for half-day 4K programs for disadvantaged four-year-olds via the South Carolina Education Improvement Act (EIA).==== EIA requires at least one half-day 4K classroom for each school district. Further, qualified four-year-olds in South Carolina have equal access across school districts to both Head Start, the largest publicly-provided preschool program in the United States, and the South Carolina Voucher Program, a program which subsidizes child care services for children from low-income families up to age 13. Compared to these other publicly-funded programs, CDEP’s eligibility requirements are less stringent.==== In school year 2005-06, the school year before implementation of CDEP, 36 percent of CDEP-eligible four-year-olds in CDEP districts were not being served by any publicly-provided preschool program. In the following school year, when CDEP was implemented, the share of CDEP-eligible students who were not being served by any publicly-provided preschool program declined to 25 percent. Thus, the expansion of preschool can be interpreted as combining an increase in the total number of eligible children who participate in a 4K program with an increase in the length and quality of the 4K program provided to eligible children who participated in a half-day 4K program.====Other studies have estimated the effect of the establishment and/or expansion of a preschool program. Many of these studies evaluate universal programs. Generally, these studies have demonstrated positive effects of preschool programs on cognitive skills in the medium term, concluding that disadvantaged children tend to benefit as much as, if not more so than, their more affluent peers. Fitzpatrick (2008) estimates the effect of Georgia’s universal preschool program on the math and reading scores of Georgia fourth graders, using a difference-in-differences design. In this study, the test scores of Georgia fourth graders that were eligible to participate are compared to the test scores of fourth graders not eligible to participate (those in other states and before implementation in Georgia). The author finds that the program increased the math and reading scores of disadvantaged children (those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) in rural areas. Cascio and Schanzenbach (2013) estimate the effect of the publicly-provided, universal preschool programs in Georgia and Oklahoma on fourth and eighth grade math and reading scores, using a difference-in-differences design. In this study, the authors compare trends in test scores for Georgia and Oklahoma, before and after the introduction of the programs, relative to the rest of the country. The authors find that the effect of the programs was positive for disadvantaged children (those eligible for free or reduced price lunch) on eighth-grade math scores.====Ladd, Muschkin, and Dodge (2014) estimate the effect of a means-tested, statewide preschool initiative in North Carolina, the More at Four Program (MAF), on the math and reading scores of all North Carolina third graders. Through MAF, the state provided funding to localities to provide slots for low-income four-year-olds in preschool centers. The authors identify the effect of MAF based on within-county variation across student cohorts in state dollars allocated to MAF and find that the program led to increases in math and reading scores. Also, the authors do address the possibility of spillovers from MAF by interacting the effect of exposure to MAF (residing in a county where MAF was available at age four) with indicator variables for the mother’s education and race. Their results provide evidence of spillover effects, although the authors do not disaggregate their effect by low- and high-income status, the basis for MAF eligibility. Dodge, Bai, Ladd, and Muschkin (2017), using a similar method as Ladd et al. (2014) but examining math and reading scores in grades 3 through 5, also estimate the effect of MAF and are able to disaggregate that effect by students’ free or reduced-price lunch status to examine the possibility of spillover effects more directly. The authors find that MAF had positive effects not only on students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch but also on students not eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and thus unlikely to have participated in MAF. Their result suggests spillover effects of MAF. Despite similarities between the current study and previous studies, examining the effects of preschool in a different setting using different data is important given increased policy interest in preschool and, as a result, the need to ensure that findings from other studies hold in different contexts.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of CDEP, including eligibility requirements and program quality. Section 3 discusses the data and the main empirical model being estimated. Section 4 reviews the main results and compares these to the existing literature.

The mathematics and science performance of minority and disadvantaged students has been especially troubling with blacks and Hispanics substantially underrepresented in the STEM labor market. In this paper we examine the impacts of a STEM enhancement program called Nurture thru Nature (NtN) on the cognitive (academic grades) and soft skills development of 139 elementary school students who attended the program over an eight year period (2010–2017). Utilizing a randomized experimental design or RCT with a control group of 491 elementary school students, we find that NtN slows the deterioration in students’ math and science grades relative to controls and improves soft skills such as conscientiousness, higher order thinking, empathy, and pro-social behavior.","In a recent report issued by the Business Roundtable (2017) a troubling picture of the U.S. workforce is presented that depicts too few workers with specialized STEM skills and abilities. Especially alarming are the deficits found in math and science knowledge and skills, computer skills, mechanical skills and operations monitoring capabilities (Rothwell, 2013, Stewart, 2018). The same Business Roundtable report notes that an increasing number of job applicants lack fundamental employability skills as well, i.e., the ability to “communicate effectively, read technical manuals, work successfully in teams and participate in complex problem solving” (p.1). This set of skills along with clarity of oral expression, listening skills, the ability to motivate others and conscientiousness are believed by many labor economists and business leaders to comprise a panoply of “soft” or non-cognitive abilities, critical for successful labor force participation (Attanasio, 2015, Cunha and Heckman, 2008, Heckman et al., 2006, Ibarraran et al., 2014, Stewart, 2018). Data published by the Manufacturing Institute (2016) and by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the scarcity of math, science and soft skills is most pronounced for African Americans and Hispanics (Committee on Highly Successful Schools or Programs for K-12 STEM Education 2011, National Science Foundation 2016), excluding many of these individuals from the higher wages and job security that accompany employment in STEM occupations.====While many gaps remain in our knowledge of human capital formation, two things have become increasingly clear: (1) skill and ability formation exhibit dynamic complementarities and interactions, i.e., abilities beget skills and more skills increase abilities (Attanasio et al., 2017, Heckman, 2000); and (2) efforts to build an individual's technical and soft skill portfolios yield their highest returns to investment when introduced at a young age, certainly well before entry to high school (Bagiati et al., 2010, Cunha and Heckman, 2008, Maltese and Tai, 2011). Tai, Liu, Maltese, and Fan (2006), for example, find that an early interest in pursuing a science-related career increased a child's chances of actually completing a science or engineering degree by about three and a half times. And increasingly the provision of “extra-school” robust natural and environmental science teaching, introduced at the elementary school level, has been identified as a promising pathway to STEM and green careers (Clarke, 2012, Royal Horticulture Society 2010; U.S. Department of Education, Green Ribbon Schools, 2018).====In this paper, we examine how a natural science focused STEM enhancement program titled Nurture thru Nature (NtN) can increase the technical and socio-emotional skills of disadvantaged black and Hispanic students from seven elementary schools in Central New Jersey, who were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (RCT). Inspired by the active learning philosophy of John Dewey (1976, 1990) and its extension in the forms of the outdoor education movement (Ord and Leather, 2011, Quay and Seaman, 2012) and wonders of nature teaching model (Camasso and Jagannathan, 2017b, Jagannathan et al., 2018), NtN focuses on the concomitant improvement of STEM cognitive skills and a set of socio-emotional or ‘soft skills’ that help facilitate the acquisition of the former.",Promoting cognitive and soft skills acquisition in a disadvantaged public school system: Evidence from the Nurture thru Nature randomized experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571830428X,13 April 2019,2019,Research Article,142.0

To study the effects of PE on adolescents, we analyze the impact of Texas Fitness Now (TFN), a four-year $37 million grant program that mandated daily PE for middle-school students in low-income schools. Using a regression discontinuity approach to exploit the cutoff in school eligibility, we find that daily PE mandates do not lead to overall improvements in student fitness, including cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility. Although we show that the program was ineffective at changing average student body composition, estimates indicate a reduction in the proportion of obese students. Using individual-level school records data, we find that PE does not lead to positive ==== in the classroom, including improvements in standardized test scores, or increases in attendance for 6th, 7th and 8th graders. Instead, we provide some evidence to suggest that PE reduces attendance rates and increases disciplinary incidents for middle-school students.","In the United States, the rate of childhood obesity has more than quadrupled in the past thirty years (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2016). One in three children are at risk of becoming overweight or obese, and among children of lower socioeconomic status, the risk is even higher (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016, Let’s Move, 2016).====From a public policy perspective, policies that seek to target the inputs to obesity, like food and exercise, can reduce negative externalities imposed by higher health care costs in the long run (Cutler, Glaser, Shapiro, 2003, Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, Wang, 2003, Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, Dietz, 2009). Given that children between the ages of 5–18 spend approximately 40 h a week at school and may eat several meals there, a natural policy solution to address childhood obesity and increase total social welfare is to encourage children to form healthy habits at school. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of one such initiative, Texas Fitness Now, on student health and academic performance.====Due to the concern of rising health risks and costs of obesity in recent years, federal and state agencies have created new guidelines and implemented numerous programs to encourage physical activity. Recently, medical authorities including the Institute of Medicine, American Heart Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have endorsed curricula that consist of at least 30 min of daily physical activity a day as a way to reduce obesity and overweight (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006, Institute of Medicine, 2013, Pate, O’Neill, 2008). Despite these recommendations, schools may not provide enough opportunities for students to meet this standard during the school day, due to resource or time constraints. Only 3.8% of elementary schools, 7.9% of middle schools, and 2.1% of high schools provide daily physical education (Lee, Burgeson, Fulton, & Spain, 2007).====Although physical education (PE) interventions are continually recommended by medical professionals as a strategy to increase physical activity and reduce childhood obesity, the results of such policies have been mixed. A literature review by Guerra, Nobre, da Silverira, and de Aguiar Carrazedo Taddei (2013) reports that only 1 out of 11 published studies that use randomized control trials to evaluate PE programs estimate significant reductions in body mass index (BMI). None find effects on body weight. And while a handful of studies document that increasing PE time can reduce obesity for young, elementary-school children (Cawley, Frisvold, Meyerhoefer, 2013, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016, Datar, Sturm, 2004, Waters, de Silva-Sanigorski, Bedford, Brown, Campbell, Gao, 2011), there is less evidence to suggest that such programs are effective at reducing BMI for middle-school or high-school students (Cawley, Meyerhoefer, Newhouse, 2007, Knaus, Lechner, Reimers, 2018, von Hippel, Bradbury, 2015, Wang, Yang, Lowry, Wechsler, 2003).====Separate from the effects on health, PE proponents argue that increasing physical activity yields large academic benefits by improving cognition, focus, and memory. There is a growing body of research implying that this may indeed be the case.==== In a recent report, the CDC describes analyses that link school-based physical activity, including physical education, to academic behaviors such as cognitive skills, academic attitudes, attendance, and achievement, and provides suggestive evidence of a positive relationship between physical activity and academic performance. (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2010).==== Moreover, studies evaluating increases school PE time appear to offer some affirmation that such programs can improve student outcomes (Carlson, Fulton, Lee, Maynard, Brown, III, 2008, Tremarche, Robinson, Graham, 2007).====That being said, one concern is that increasing PE requirements takes away important instructional time, which could lead to less learning and poorer student outcomes. In a review of 7 quasi-experimental studies, which focus on academic outcomes for students up to grade 6, Trudeau and Shephard (2008) finds that physical activity can be added to school curriculum without hindering student achievement. Dills, Morgan, and Rotthoff (2011) similarly explores this hypothesis and finds no statistically significant or economically significant impact of weekly PE on test scores for elementary-aged children, suggesting that PE at worst has no effect on academic achievement.====Based on the above research, we would expect that policies targeting physical activity have the ability to positively affect student behavior and performance, implying that there may be some scope for school-level services to play an even larger role. However, nearly all of the literature to date focuses on elementary-aged children, while much less evidence exists on the effects of PE on middle-school students. Accordingly, a fundamental policy question remains unanswered: how much can PE affect adolescent fitness and health, and how much do these programs translate to changes in attendance, disciplinary action, and academic performance?====To answer this question, we present new evidence on the effects of physical education requirements and contribute to a growing literature on how policies can address childhood obesity and student achievement. In particular, we estimate a model that exploits a discontinuity in eligibility criteria for Texas Fitness Now (TFN), a four-year physical education grant program targeting low-income students with the aim of improving overall health and well-being. Program-eligible schools included campuses teaching grades 6, 7, and/or 8 with a large majority of economically disadvantaged students. Participating schools received funds contingent on the agreement that they: (i) spent funds on new athletic equipment or services related to PE and (ii) ensured that students attend PE classes for 30 min each school day.====The Texas Education Agency (TEA) has since pointed to the positive improvements in fitness and body composition as evidence of the program’s success; however, the fact that fitness scores were increasing in each subsequent year of the program suggests that other factors probably contributed to the average increase observed across some Texas schools (Texas Education Agency, 2011).====Similarly, von Hippel and Bradbury (2015), uses a fixed effects model instrumenting for program participation over time, and estimates that TFN improved some measures of fitness for some groups, although they find no effects on BMI.==== However, the authors model estimates by gender as well as groups of years of the program separately, making both the overall average effects and local average effects of the program difficult to distinguish, and they do not provide any support for their identifying assumption, casting doubt on the validity of the research design.====This research addresses these shortcomings and builds on the existing literature in a number of ways. First, we employ a regression discontinuity design, using the eligibility criteria directly, to compare otherwise similar students across the TFN eligibility threshold. Under the plausible assumption that other determinants of student fitness and performance are smooth across the school grant-qualifying cutoff, this research design allows us to compare outcomes of students in schools just below the eligibility threshold to students just above the threshold. In doing so, we are able to provide evidence that any changes in student outcomes are a result of the program, and not an artifact of school selection or other unobservable characteristics. Below we present findings in support of this assumption showing schools eligible for physical education grant funding were similar to schools just below the cutoff in terms of size, other financial resources and student composition. Second, we use individual-level administrative data to study student outcomes, which constitutes an improvement on school-level data since it additionally contains information on student raw test scores, attendance and disciplinary behavior. Moreover, the granular nature of these data allows us to test for compositional changes and detect student attrition.====We find that Texas Fitness Now did not improve physical fitness, including overall body mass index (BMI), body fat, aerobic capacity, or strength and flexibility. However, we show that TFN was effective at reducing the number of obese students, implying that such interventions may be most effective for high-risk students.====Using individual-level data on student academic outcomes for Texas middle schoolers, we estimate no effect of the program on student achievement. Conversely, we present suggestive evidence that compulsory PE classes reduce attendance rates and increase incidents of disruption and misbehavior. These findings imply that interventions encouraging daily physical activity have the potential to negatively impact students if adolescents have a strong aversion to physical education.====Given the existing literature documenting the beneficial effects of physical education on elementary-aged students, these findings may be somewhat surprising. However, there are several potential explanations why 12–14 year olds respond differently than young children to physical activity initiatives. For instance, middle-school students may have already formed lifetime exercise and eating habits, and therefore are more obstinate than elementary-aged children to abandon unhealthy habits. Another explanation is that for economically disadvantaged and/or overweight teens, PE class may serve as a class period where students that struggle with aerobic exercises experience bullying and teasing.==== Finally, since middle-schoolers are less energetic, physical education could make teenagers more tired than younger students, which may contribute to more distractions or misbehavior in the classroom. Below, we explore these possibilities in an effort to shed light on the more comprehensive effects of PE requirements for middle-school students.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the Texas Fitness Now program in more detail. Section 3 describes the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 provides a discussion of the main results and potential mechanisms before concluding.","The effects of physical education on student fitness, achievement, and behavior",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027277571830726X,12 April 2019,2019,Research Article,143.0

The economic approach suggests that individuals provide high efforts whenever the expected benefits of an activity exceed the expected costs. However, we know little about the determinants of effort outside of experimental laboratories. Similarly, situations when individuals – instead of providing high efforts to maximize their economic gain – make the decision to simply lean back remain largely unexplored. In some cases, individuals with particular potential and great prospects may show high motivation to provide extraordinary performance, while in other cases, a positive outlook may actually lower effort levels, as it is possible to benefit from reduced effort costs while still obtaining a satisfactory level of achievement. By focusing on students from higher education institutions, we analyze individual effort decisions, which allows us to not only shed light on the determinants of human behavior in this particular educational context, but also beyond.====The decision situation faced by students in the system of higher education has a particular facet that makes it very interesting from an economic standpoint: Both society and the individual student benefit from educational achievement. The more educational achievement can be attained, the higher the individual labor market earnings are because of increased human capital (e.g. Chevalier, Harmon, Walker, Zhu, 2004, Kroch, Sjoblom, 1994, Wolpin, 1977), which thereby fosters overall economic prosperity. To achieve this, students can choose individual effort levels as a major determinant of educational outcome (e.g. Stinebrickner & Stinebrickner, 2008). This leads to a scenario in which students have incentives for putting large amounts of effort into studying, benefiting both the economy and society. In reality, however, indications suggest a lack of effort levels among students, such as declining amounts of time spent on studying (e.g. Babcock & Marks, 2011) and increasing study durations in numerous countries (e.g. Bound, Lovenheim, Turner, 2012, Brunello, Winter-Ebmer, 2003, Garibaldi, Giavazzi, Ichino, Rettore, 2012). This raises the questions regarding the determinants of study behavior and how the drivers of students’ commitment to performing well can be identified.====While there is a sizable literature on the outcomes of studying, there are not many studies dealing with economic decision-making in terms of student effort in higher education. Many of the contributions to research on educational achievement of university or college students focus on study outputs, such as grades, and analyze potential determinants, such as financial incentives or working during school (e.g. Kalenkoski, Pabilonia, 2010, Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner, 2003).==== Few papers provide a combination of empirical analysis and theoretical modeling, in which the latter considers the crucial role of student effort as a contributor to academic success (see e.g. Bandiera, Larcinese, Rasul, 2015, Krohn, O’Connor, 2005, Löfgren, Ohlsson, 1999).==== One example in this context is a study by Oettinger (2002), who discusses how university students make strategic decisions on effort levels, for which he assumes that incentives to provide effort increase in ability. In their study on student performance, Leuven, Oosterbeek, and van der Klaauw (2010) also take the role of effort into account but mostly focus on passing rates and how student performance can be raised by financial incentives. Similarly, Non and Tempelaar (2016) consider both effort and academic success in their empirical study on the role of time preferences, just as Chevalier, Dolton, and Lührmann (2018) do in their study on incentive schemes. There is also recent theoretical work on the role of examination rules for students’ effort decisions (Michaelis & Schwanebeck, 2016).====Apart from that, we concur with the conclusion of Delaney, Harmon, and Ryan (2013) who see a clear lack of knowledge on student inputs, despite the high level of interest in explaining study outcomes. While these authors provide the first empirical investigation into the determinants of student behavior in higher education using across-subject data, they omit two determinants that we consider to be as important as they are unclear in their actual role for effort decisions: ability and labor market prospects. Intuitively, one could expect that high-ability types have strong incentives to provide extra effort, as they benefit more from educational achievement, which also seems to be in line with the evidence from the above-mentioned studies. On the other hand, they could also use their promising situation to reduce effort when they are satisfied with a certain level of achievement. Similar arguments apply for job market prospects in general, which could also affect student behavior and help to explain low effort levels. Given the unclear relationships, we provide the first comprehensive discussion, theoretically and empirically, on how these factors affect students’ effort.====As a potentially important aspect, we consider multiple dimensions of student effort in our discussion. Whereas previous educational studies often focused on study time measured via lecture attendance, the role of this factor in educational achievement appears to be unclear.==== Given the heterogeneity of empirical findings in this context, we scrutinize whether study time is sufficient for capturing individual effort and question the underlying assumption that investing the same amount of time means investing the same amount of effort. Arguably, any given hour spent in the library or in the lecture room may consist of only focused learning, but it may just as well consist of only idle daydreaming. We therefore propose a distinction into a quantitative and a qualitative dimension of effort in order to learn more about the complex factor that effort certainly is. While in our theoretical discussion we distinguish between study time (quantitative dimension) and learning intensity (qualitative dimension), we attempt to capture the quantitative component via comprehensive time-use data and the qualitative component via subjective data on self-assessed effort levels in our empirical investigation.====In our theoretical modeling of student decision-making, we make some basic assumptions that conform to the previous literature. Students decide about both effort dimensions anticipating that higher effort is associated with a utility decline today, but improves educational achievements and hence increases expected income and utility after studying. Whether high-ability students provide less or more effort compared to low-ability students depends on two factors. First, considering each effort dimension separately, high-ability students have an incentive to increase effort, such as study time (at the expense of leisure), because this raises utility in the future, i.e. the substitution effect (SE). At the same time, however, high-ability students have an incentive to reduce effort because their high abilities per se ensure relatively good educational achievement and thus a relatively high level of expected income, i.e. the income effect (IE). Second, the way both effort dimensions are interlinked is crucial. If they were complements, high-ability students that provide high learning intensity would also choose a high study time, compared to low-ability students. If both dimensions were substitutes, however, high learning intensity would come at a price of lower study time and vice versa. These mechanisms also hold for our second determinant, i.e. job market prospects.====To gain testable predictions, we assume that both the students’ utility and educational production function are of a Cobb-Douglas type. This implies that a.) the SE dominates the IE and that b.) both effort dimensions are complements. As such, we expect that high-ability students provide higher effort (study time and learning intensity) compared to low-ability students. In addition, better job market prospects should increase the students’ effort in both dimensions during academic studies. The mechanisms in our model translate to many other economics contexts and thereby provide us with a general framework upon which we can discuss our empirical results. This is particularly helpful as our empirical findings for individuals in higher education do indeed deviate in some respect from expectations one may have at first glance.====To test theoretical predictions, we explore data from a broadly conceived investigation of students in Germany’s system of higher education, the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). The students’ cohort of the NEPS has not been utilized for similar purposes so far and allows us to inspect the role of ability, as an example, in ways not possible in most cross-subject datasets. Regarding this key student input, we can exploit data from comprehensive competence testing of university students to establish a measure that allows us to inspect this determinant of university students’ behavior without having to rely on proxies such as previous grades, which are likely related to an individual’s overall attitude towards providing effort. As we argue in our paper, this could be a particular problem for any attempt to find out about the actual impact of individual ability on effort. Finally, we provide evidence on the direct effects of job market prospects on student effort, as the outlook on future earnings reflects the channel through which students take their economic gains of studying into account. We thereby elaborate on the work of Brunello, Lucifora, and Winter-Ebmer (2004) who argue that subjectively expected returns to education are a key determinant for university students’ decision-making regarding educational attainment.====Our results from analyzing the NEPS data reject the prediction that ability positively affects effort levels. Instead, the evidence conforms to the notion that high-ability students use their advantage over low-ability ones to obtain additional utility by having more leisure time. We find that the higher the ability is, the lower self-assessed effort levels and weekly self-study hours are. As the latter predicts educational achievement in our data more strongly than the other activities, such as lecture attendance, this empirical result supports the notion of the ‘lazy genius’ who puts comparatively little effort into studying. Going back to our model, this speaks for a relatively strong IE and/or a relatively weak SE. Regarding job market prospects, we not only examine standard regression results but also apply an instrumental variable (IV) approach to address the potential reverse causality between effort and labor market prospects. To that end, we exploit official unemployment data reflecting variations in regional labor market conditions. We merge the data using information on prospective jobs and university location. The results from applying this approach align with those from running standard regressions and suggest that great job prospects positively influence effort, which confirms our theoretical prediction. Vice versa, we interpret our finding in such a way that not having good prospects may frustrate students, leading to decreased motivation for putting in high efforts into studying, which may contribute to the phenomenon of prolonged study durations, as argued by other researchers (e.g. Aina, Baici, & Casalone, 2011).","Young, gifted and lazy?

We study a Chinese policy which extended the duration of primary school from five years to six but did not change the curriculum. We exploit its gradual rollout over space and time to generate causal estimates of its impact on educational attainment and subsequent labor market outcomes. We find that the policy has small, largely positive effects on post-primary educational attainment, and raises average monthly income by 2.6%. The policy is progressive, generating higher returns (5–8%) among both women and the least educated. We estimate the policy has already reallocated 450 million years of labor from work to schooling and we generate cost-benefit estimates to quantify this tradeoff, highlighting the large public finance implications of this policy decision.","Nearly all countries regulate the duration of primary and secondary schooling. The literature on compulsory schooling has studied the impacts of changes to the age at which students are permitted to leave schooling and enter the labor force. This work has found substantial gains in health, wealth, and longevity to increasing the age at which students are first allowed to leave school (e.g., Almond, Li, Zhang, 2019, Angrist, Krueger, 1991, Devereux, Hart, 2010, Oreopoulos, 2007). Another key aspect of this regulation is the policy decision setting the number of years needed to finish each level of schooling.====In many countries, there are differentials in access and cost between levels of schooling, e.g., the introduction of school fees at middle or high school, or a limited number of admissions slots at higher levels (c.f., Lavy, 1996, Orazem, King, 2007). As a result, the duration of each level of schooling, and particularly primary school, has a large potential impact both on how many total years students spend in school and, as a result, on their later earning power. Examining Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets for the 74 developing countries where years of schooling data is collected, we find bunching in the number of completed years of education at those years where a level of schooling is completed - usually primary and lower secondary - in 48 of these.==== While recent work has begun to study the impacts of changes to school duration at the secondary and tertiary levels (Arteaga, 2018, Morin, 2013, Pischke, 2007),==== ours is the first paper we are aware of studying how changes at the primary level, the most common stopping point we see in our DHS data, affect educational attainment and labor market outcomes.====In this paper, we study a policy in China which extended the duration of primary school from five years to six while holding the national curriculum and duration of all other levels of schooling unchanged. We exploit the fact the policy was rolled out gradually over space and time to generate three sets of empirical results. First, we measure how the extra year of primary school affects overall educational attainment. Second, we estimate how the policy affects performance in the labor market. Third, we estimate the public finance implications of this policy which, to date, has reallocated more than 450 million years of labor from employment to schooling.====This policy differs importantly from policies studied in most prior work on compulsory education and the returns to schooling in the labor market. Most previous studies (e.g., those summarized in Card, 1999) use changes in compulsory schooling which also add to the set of skills students are meant to acquire. For example, both Angrist and Krueger (1991) and Oreopoulos (2006) study policies which induce students to spend an additional year in high school and, in so doing, advance further in the high school curriculum. This constitutes an increase in skills on the extensive margin. Our policy induces all students to spend six years learning the same material that unaffected students were made to learn in five, which instead is intended to increase skills on the intensive margin.==== Furthermore, it changed the parameters of the schooling decision students faced. To earn any given credential (primary, middle, high, or tertiary), students affected by the policy had to spend an additional year in school (and thus out of the labor market).====We identify the causal effect of the Chinese six year primary education policy on schooling and labor market outcomes using a stacked regression discontinuity (RD) design.==== Our running/forcing variable is month-by-year-of-birth (as in Oreopoulos, 2006, and Erten & Keskin, 2018, among several others). We recenter this variable around the policy implementation year in a given locality, and stack cutoffs (as in Pop-Eleches & Urquiola, 2013, and Abdulkadiroğlu, Angrist, & Pathak, 2014) across different policy implementation years.====We determine if, when, and how the policy is implemented in each of China’ s prefectures by collecting and coding thousands of official government documents, known as “educational gazetteers,” which report implementation at the local level, and match this to new survey and census data from China. We restrict our sample to the 280 prefectures (of 345) where we are sure the policy was implemented. Our identification strategy compares outcomes of treated and untreated individuals within each of these prefectures, using only those leaving primary school within an optimal bandwidth around the year when the policy took effect. We also generate parallel results using a difference-in-differences specification. As we are unable to generate a satisfactory test of the parallel trends assumption and the language of the policy suggests that this assumption is likely to be violated (details discussed in Section 3.1), we present these results in Appendix 5. They largely mirror the results we present in the body of the paper.====We first estimate the impact of this policy on years of schooling and the attainment of educational credentials. We find that the average number of years of completed primary schooling increased from 5.2 to nearly six for affected individuals. We find small changes in the proportion of individuals getting middle school and high school degrees, but no evidence that the policy changed the characteristics (parents’ education, number of siblings) of who earns which credential.====We then estimate the impact of the policy on labor market performance. We find that the policy does not affect individuals’ likelihood of being employed, but makes them slightly more likely (1.8 percentage points, or 6.7 percent) to work in government. Our main labor market result is that the policy increases monthly income by 2.63 percent, with about 20 percent of this gain coming from the increase in credentials, and the other 80 percent coming from income gains conditional on highest credential earned. The magnitude and precision of our estimate of the policy’s impact on income are robust to a battery of specification and robustness checks, including a permutation test. We then show that the magnitude of our estimate changes little after accounting for potential mediators such as experience differentials between affected and unaffected individuals.====Despite these low overall returns, we find the policy is redistributive. While it induces nearly all to forgo a year of earnings, its benefits are concentrated among a key disadvantaged group in China: those with only a primary or middle school education, whose income increases by between five and eight percent as a result of the policy. We argue that the basic cognitive and non-cognitive/socio-emotional skills reinforced in this extra year are most likely to help those with lower skill levels. Furthermore, our finding is consistent with other work showing that extending the time children spend in school most helps struggling students (Clay, Lingwall, Stephens Jr, 2016, Dobbie, Fryer, 2013, Meghir, Palme, 2005).====A primary impact of this policy is the reallocation of human resources from work to school. We estimate that the policy has reallocated more than 450 million years, or more than 900 billion person-hours, from the labor market to the pursuit of schooling to date.==== We perform a cost-benefit analysis to quantify the public finance implications of this massive reallocation of resources. We borrow the framework used in Duflo (2001) to compare the lifetime value of the increase in monthly income conferred by the extra year of schooling to the estimated cost of the lost year of productive activity in the labor market. Our preferred specification finds that the policy generates an overall net gain, though its benefits decrease over time with the decline in the per-cohort proportion of individuals with low levels of education, i.e., those who benefit most.====Our paper contributes to two active lines of inquiry. First, we add to the rich literature attempting to understand the education and labor market effects of changes to compulsory education policy (e.g., Card, 1999, Stephens, Yang, 2014). We advance this work in a few key ways. First, as mentioned at the beginning of this section, the policy we study constitutes an intended increase in skills on the intensive margin, as opposed to on the extensive margin studied in the vast majority of previous work. Second, we contribute to a nascent literature studying changes to the duration of schooling, as opposed to school leaving age. Furthermore, it is the first paper we are aware of to study a change in the duration of primary school, as opposed to changes in the duration of secondary or tertiary schooling as in Morin (2013) and Arteaga (2018). Third, the policy changes the duration of school for all students, not just a subgroup, and has already affected the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals.====The second line of inquiry we contribute to is the wider set of studies using large changes in education policy from developing countries to assess the merits of different policy options and their distributional effects (e.g., Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, Linden, 2007, Duflo, 2001, Lucas, Mbiti, 2012). To this work, we add the first analysis of a key policy lever - the duration of primary school - and show that it has potentially important redistributive properties.==== This is particularly pertinent for policymakers in the many developing countries with a sizable proportion of individuals who do not progress beyond primary or lower secondary school.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the history of education in modern China and describe the policy we study. In Section 3, we describe the data we use and our identification strategy. Section 4 contains empirical results related to educational attainment and Section 5 provides our empirical results relating to the labor market, a series of robustness checks, and our cost-benefit analysis.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of major switching, looking at the patterns of switching in both academic and non-academic dimensions. Low grades signal academic mismatch and predict switching majors - and the lower the grades, the larger the switch in terms of course content. Surprisingly, these switches do not improve students’ grades. When students switch majors, they switch to majors that “look like them”: females to female-heavy majors, and so on. Lower-ability women flee competitive majors at high rates, while men and higher-ability women are undeterred. Women are far more likely to leave STEM fields for majors that are less competitive – but still somewhat science-intensive – suggesting that leaving STEM may be more about fleeing the “culture” of STEM majors than fleeing science and math.","College major is one of the most-studied topics in labor economics and the economics of education. Many factors influence the major choice, including peers, course preparation, preferences, labor market conditions, and potential earnings. Over a third of students switch majors during their time in college, suggesting that major choice is best understood as a process (Chen, 2013). Despite the huge literature on major choice, however, relatively little is known about these switching patterns and what motivates students to switch majors.====We study switching using a nationally representative sample, making our results generalizable to the whole population of college students. We present a model of the major choice process and provide rich descriptive evidence on switching patterns. Our fundamental insight is that one can learn about the motivations for major switching by examining the destinations of the switchers. We study the correlates of switching but also the distance (how different the second major is from the first) and direction (how the characteristics of the chosen major change when a switch is made) of major switches. Not all major changes are created equal, as majors differ both in terms of course requirements and non-course characteristics. Some major changes represent “major changes”, while others are smaller corrections. We also provide a detailed analysis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, which are of particular policy interest and have high net switch-out rates among women.====Major switching is common; in our data, 37% of college graduates switch majors. Low grades are related to higher switching rates - and the lower the grades, the “larger” the switch. Surprisingly, these major switches do not lead to grade improvement, even if they involve moving to an “easier” major.====When students switch majors, they move to majors that “look like them”: females to female-heavy majors, blacks to black-heavy majors, and so on. Lower-ability women flee competitive majors, while men and higher-ability women are undeterred. These results are consistent with experimental evidence showing that women shy away from more competitive environments.====Women are far more likely to leave STEM majors than men are. While low grades strongly predict leaving STEM, they do not explain any of the gender gap. When women leave STEM, they often move to majors relatively close in science and math content but different in gender makeup, grading standards, and student ability, such as health fields.==== This suggests that they are not fleeing STEM because of a lack of competence or because they do not like science. Colleges seeking to retain more women in STEM fields must be concerned about more than just course content or women’s science readiness.====To motivate the empirical analysis, we develop a two-stage model of matching between students and majors. We model students as a vector with two sets of components: abilities and preferences.==== Majors, similarly, are a vector of academic (course) requirements and non-course characteristics. Information frictions can lead to initial mismatch between the student and her major, which may induce the student to switch majors. There are two sources of mismatch: academic mismatch and preference mismatch. The switching patterns we observe suggest that both are important.====Other papers have modeled major search as a process (e.g., Altonji, 1993, Arcidiacono, 2004), but we are the first to provide a detailed empirical analysis of the switching decision as a stage of that process. Our results offer new insights into why and how students switch majors. In understanding how a student arrives at her final destination, this intermediate step is critical.====The detailed focus on major switching also means that we do not study the dropout decision here. In Astorne-Figari and Speer (2018), we consider dropping out and switching majors as two possible responses to struggles. As we show there, men are more likely to drop out, while women are more likely to switch majors and graduate from college. In this paper, we focus on graduates and zoom in on the switching decision, which can tell us much about how students search for the right field of study. Our analysis is thus most relevant for students who are relatively sure of eventually graduating but want to find the best match for college and beyond.====Our results are consistent with most previous work, but we also provide new results and insights. In particular, we develop the concepts of “distance” and “direction” of switching in our analysis, which help us better understand students’ motivations. Those who struggle early in college not only switch majors more, but are likely to switch to very different majors. Our analysis includes factors typically studied in the economics literature on college major – e.g., grades and gender differences – but we also take insights from the education and psychology literatures, which emphasize a major’s culture and the personality match between student and major. While these things are difficult to observe in data, we develop proxies for them that help us say something about student preferences and major culture.====While our results are descriptive and cannot nail down causal effects, they do suggest that some explanations for switching behavior are more likely than others. For example, our results on women leaving STEM fields are strongly suggestive that non-academic factors are more important than academic ones in understanding that issue.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1.1 describes the previous literature and our paper’s relation to it. Section 2 presents a model of major choice and major switching. Section 3 discusses our data.

Estimates included extensive child and household controls and lagged cognitive scores to address unobserved individual heterogeneity in ability and early investments. Overall, household food insecurity at any age predicted lower vocabulary, reading, maths and English scores in early adolescence. Adolescents from households that transitioned from food insecurity at age 5 to food security at a later age, and adolescents from chronically food insecure households had the lowest scores across all outcomes. There was heterogeneity in the relationship between temporal occurrence of food insecurity and cognitive skills, based on developmental and curriculum-specific timing of skill formation. Results were robust to additional explanations of the “household food insecurity gap”, i.e. education and health investments, parental and children's educational aspirations, and children's psychosocial skills.","Following the large expansion in primary and secondary educational access called for in the Millennium Development Goals, equitable learning has become the new imperative in the Sustainable Development Goal education agenda (World Bank, 2018). Inequalities in child and adolescent learning achievements may have long-lasting effects on individual lifecourse income, productivity, health, and intergenerational transmission of poverty, undermining a country's overall economic and social development (Hanushek, 2013).====Policymakers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are increasingly considering the role of household food insecurity - a situation of unstable access to enough, safe and nutritious food - in children's accumulation of educational capital in order to devise multi-sectoral strategies for improved child learning, so that synergies with the social protection, health and food systems can be reaped (Bundy et al., 2017). Research on children's experiences of food insecurity at home in high-income countries—particularly the US—has suggested that household food insecurity has wide-ranging implications for children's school participation, learning and broader development. The timing of food insecurity and its persistence during sensitive periods of childhood may also be associated with poorer educational outcomes (Alaimo, Olson and Frongillo, 2001, Grineski, Morales, Collins and Rubio, 2018, Howard, 2011, Jyoti, Frongillo, Jones and Al, 2005). However, there is a serious dearth of research on the learning consequences of household food insecurity, particularly around its timing and persistence over childhood, in LMIC settings. In these contexts, the global burden of food insecurity is greatest and research on the linkages between food insecurity and early childhood undernutrition dominates much of the discourse (Chandrasekhar, Aguayo, Krishna and Nair, 2017, Reis, 2012). Yet, returns from education, socio-demographic factors, and structure of the social protection, food and education systems—all of which have the potential to impact on household food insecurity, as well as to moderate the association between food insecurity and cognitive achievements— vary widely from higher-income contexts.====In this paper, we investigate inequalities in adolescent learning achievements by household food insecurity trajectories. We do this by relying on rich longitudinal data following children at early childhood, mid-childhood and adolescence in India, the second largest country in the world and a leading emerging economy. The country is currently home to a third of the global adolescent and youth population, and the Indian Government has recently identified inequalities in young people's human capital as a major challenge to reap the demographic dividend (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation Government of India, 2017).====The need for robust evidence of inequalities in cognitive skills formation by household food insecurity trajectories is particularly pressing in India, which is in the midst of what has been defined as a “learning crisis” (World Bank, 2018). Since the 2000s, the country has achieved impressive expansion in school participation, but increases in learning levels have not followed: in rural India, only a quarter of Grade 3 students were at “grade-level” in reading and in maths in 2016==== (ASER Centre, 2017). While a large body of literature has decomposed learning disparities by gender, caste, household wealth, place of residence, and private schooling (Alcott and Rose, 2017, ASER Centre 2017, Azam and Kingdon, 2013, Dercon and Singh, 2013, Singh, 2015), we are not aware of work focusing on household food insecurity. This is especially surprising in this context, as the country bears the largest burden of food insecurity and malnutrition globally (Aurino and Morrow, 2018, Headey, Hoddinott and Park, 2016, Vellakkal et al., 2015) (also see Section 2.2).====Ending food insecurity is global priority as testified by Sustainable Development Goal 2. Despite recent UNICEF estimates that highlighted that at least 590 million children under age 15 live in moderately or severely food insecure households (Pereira, Handa, & Holmqvist, 2017), very few studies have addressed this topic in LMICs contexts, partially due to lack of data. Through this article, we aim at starting to fill this key evidence gap for policy-makers in those settings. The data we used are particularly suitable for examining this issue, as the study simultaneously collected information on household food security and cognitive development during three critical periods of skills formation. Further, the longitudinal dimension allowed for the estimation of “value-added” models of adolescent learning by including measures of early childhood cognition that control for early-life heterogeneity in children's ability and household investments, thus increasing the robustness of our identification strategy (Singh, 2015, Andrabi, Das, Khwaja and Zajonc, 2011, Todd and Wolpin, 2003). This way, we could investigate the extent to which the ‘household food security gaps’ in adolescent learning could be accounted for early-life differences in cognition and educational investments.====We add to the literature in four main ways: first, we provide robust evidence on the relationship between the timing and duration of household food insecurity during childhood and learning outcomes at adolescence in a key emerging economy. Evidence from the US suggested that, as in the case of income poverty, household food security is more often a transient rather than a permanent condition, with the majority of households moving into and out of food insecurity over time (Burke et al., 2017, Grineski, Morales, Collins and Rubio, 2018, Howard, 2011, Perez-Escamilla and Pinheiro de Toledo Vianna, 2012). Whether a similar dynamic pattern holds in India—where, proportionally speaking, the scale and depth of food insecurity is greater—and what the implications of this dynamics for adolescent learning are has been, so far, unclear. Second, as adolescents were assessed in multiple learning domains, including child receptive vocabulary, reading in the local language, maths, and English, we were able to investigate skill-based heterogeneity in the predictive power of household food insecurity. This aspect has also been relatively under-researched so far, in both high-income and LMIC settings. We expect some degree of heterogeneity by cognitive achievement, due to variation in developmental periods in which different skills are usually acquired and curriculum-based variation in the age in which different skills are taught. Third, we hypothesise and test a number of potential explanations that could account for adolescent learning disparities instead of household food insecurity trajectories. Thanks to the richness of our data, we were able to consider a wider set of possible pathways than previous studies, including education investments, health and psychosocial skills. Fourth, we investigated gender inequalities in this relationship, as inequalities between boys and girls in human capital are pervasive in India.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the background; Sections 3 and 4 present the methods and results, respectively.

This paper fills in the gap with data from the British Social Attitudes Survey. Firstly, using the OLS method, this paper finds that education and the three measures of trust—trust in people, trust in politicians, and trust in government—are all positively and significantly correlated. Secondly, to examine whether this correlation represents a causal effect, this paper exploits exogenous variation in educational attainment induced by the compulsory schooling reform in 1972. The regression discontinuity estimates suggest that the effects of education on the three measures of trust are all small and statistically insignificant. The findings imply that the OLS estimates may suffer from omitted variable bias and the effects of education on trust may be small.","In many countries, an important goal of public education is to build trust (Glaeser, Ponzetto, & Shleifer, 2007), because trust facilitates cooperation and coordination among people and allows a society to avoid inefficient non-cooperative traps.==== Many studies have investigated whether public education could improve trust (e.g., Alesina, La Ferrara, 2002, Borgonovi, 2012, Helliwell, Putnam, 2007, Hooghe, Marien, de Vroome, 2012, Nannestad, 2008, Oreopoulos, Salvanes, 2011, Schoon, Cheng, Gale, Batty, Deary, 2010). These studies typically use OLS regressions and find a positive correlation between education and trust, which seems to suggest that education could foster trust.====A major challenge facing researchers, however, is that educational attainment and trust could be driven by some common factors that are difficult to measure and control for. Firstly, personal ability or intelligence may affect both schooling attainment and trust. Secondly, individuals from better-educated families may achieve more schooling and are more likely to express trust towards others or government. Last but not least, people living in stronger communities may obtain more education and may find it easier to express trust towards others or government. If we do not address these potential omitted variable problems, we cannot draw any causal inferences between education and trust. Few studies have tried to address the endogeneity problem. An exception is Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopoulos (2004), which uses compulsory schooling laws as IV for educational attainment to examine the effect of education on trust in other people and federal government in the US, as part of their larger study focusing on civic participation. Their estimated coefficient for trust in other people is only significant at the 10% significance level, while the coefficient for trust in government is insignificant even at the 10% significance level. The authors do not show the robustness of these results because their main interest is voting participation.====Using data sets from the British Social Attitudes Survey, this study examines the association between education and trust with the OLS method and estimates the causal effect of education on trust with a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design. To conduct the RD design, this study exploits the compulsory schooling reform in the UK in 1972, which generated exogenous variation in educational attainment across birth cohorts. Although the OLS estimates suggest that education and the three measures of trust—trust in people, trust in politicians, and trust in government—are all positively and significantly correlated, the RD estimates indicate that the effects of education on the three measures of trust are all small and statistically insignificant. The results are robust when I use different sets of control variables, different bandwidths, and different ways to construct the dependent variables. The findings imply that the OLS estimates may suffer from omitted variable bias and the effects of education on trust may be small.====This study is related to two strands of literature. The first strand of literature explores the determinants of social capital (Alesina, La Ferrara, 2002, Schoon, Cheng, Gale, Batty, Deary, 2010, Welch, Rivera, Conway, Yonkoski, Lupton, Giancola, 2005). The second strand of literature investigates the impact of education on trust and civic participation (Borgonovi, 2012, Campbell, 2009, Dee, 2004, Helliwell, Putnam, 2007, Milligan, Moretti, Oreopoulos, 2004, Oreopoulos, Salvanes, 2011).====This paper develops as follows. Section 2 discusses the channels through which education can affect trust and introduces the background information for education in the UK; Section 3 describes the estimation strategy; Section 4 describes the data and gives the summary statistics; Section 5 examines the correlation between education and three measures of trust; Section 6 reports the RD estimation results; Section 7 checks robustness of the results; and the last section concludes the paper.",Does education foster trust?

While fully online models appear to have negative effects on student learning compared to in-person instruction, there is less evidence about models that blend elements of online and in-person instruction. In this study, I estimate the effect of adopting a blended approach to teaching called the emporium model in which students complete online work in an on-campus lab with instructors onsite to assist. Using a triple difference identification strategy, I find that using the emporium model compared to traditional instruction in remedial math courses in a state community college system reduces course pass rates, retention, and degree attainment. Effects were generally consistent across all three levels of remediation, suggesting there was little variation by students’ incoming placement test score.","Over the last ten years, online courses have become prevalent in higher education, particularly at community colleges (Parsad and Lewis, 2008, Allen and Seaman, 2013). Today, one-third of students take at least one course online (Allen & Seaman, 2013). Studies comparing online to face-to-face courses have found predominantly negative effects of online classes on grades, test scores, and progress in college, with larger negative effects for students with lower levels of academic preparation (Figlio et al., 2013, Xu and Jaggars, 2013, Bettinger et al., 2017, Alpert et al., 2016). While online courses can potentially reduce the cost of administering courses (Deming, Goldin, Katz, & Yuchtman, 2015), these savings appear to come at a cost to student success.====Blended learning interventions, which mix aspects of online and in-person instruction, might allow colleges to capture some of the cost-savings without worsening students’ outcomes. In this paper, I estimate the effect of adopting a lab-based blended learning model in remedial college math courses, compared to in-person instruction, on course pass rates, progress in college, and degree attainment in a midsize, state community college system. Approximately half of all four-year public colleges and two-thirds of all two-year public colleges offer hybrid or blended learning courses (Parsad & Lewis, 2008). However, the literature on the use of blended learning in college is limited to a handful of studies from microeconomics and statistics courses in four-year colleges. This paper will extend this literature by examining the use of lab-based blended learning at scale in a state community college system for a group of students who have less academic preparation.====If entering college students are unable to pass a placement test in math, reading, or writing, they can be assigned to as many as three remedial courses in a given subject, which they must complete before beginning college-level work. Remedial college courses are common. In a study of students beginning college in the 2003–2004 school year, 68% of two-year college students and 40% of four-year college students took at least one remedial course in reading, writing, or math (Chen, 2016). Math is the most common remedial placement, but also has the highest rates of failure, with only one-third of students completing the sequence of remedial math courses that they have been assigned to (Bailey, Jeong, & Cho, 2009). With the average remedial student taking 2.6 remedial courses, the estimated cost of providing these courses nationally is US$7 billion per year (Scott-Clayton, Crosta, & Belfield, 2014). In order to improve pass rates, increase the speed of remediation, and reduce costs, colleges have begun to experiment with different approaches to integrate technology into remedial courses.====This paper will examine a model of blended learning called the emporium model which consists of online instruction in a lab setting.==== Under this approach, students spend class time working at their own pace in a computer lab on a series of modularized lessons, practice problems, and assessments. Instead of providing lectures, instructors and teaching assistants are available onsite to provide personalized assistance to students as questions arise (Twigg, 2011).==== This model is unique from purely online courses, in which students typically do not come to campus or interact in-person with instructors, and is unique among blended learning approaches in that the online work is performed on-campus with instructors available to students. The emporium model was created at Virginia Tech in 1997 for introductory college math courses, but has spread more widely over the last decade to institutions ranging from state flagship institutions to community colleges (de Vise, 2012, National Center for Academic Transformation [NCAT] 2016). While blended learning models like the emporium model have grown in popularity, there is little evidence on how computer-based approaches to remediation affect students’ success in college (Rutschow & Schneider, 2011).====One reason colleges adopt the emporium model is that it can lower the costs of delivering remedial instruction by allowing colleges to raise class sizes, switch to less expensive instructors, or increase the number of sections faculty teach. While not all institutions choose to adopt cost-saving measures while switching to the emporium model, one estimate from 28 institutions found it reduced the cost per student by 20% on average.==== Advocates for the emporium model also argue that it can improve students’ outcomes through several channels (Twigg, 2013). First, the emporium model is modularized and mastery-based. If a student demonstrates proficiency in one part of the course, she can skip that portion and focus on other areas which are more challenging. This could help students to more efficiently address weaknesses. Second, students are allowed to complete the courses at their own pace. A motivated student could complete multiple remedial courses per semester, unlike under the traditional remediation approach. One the other hand, a student who has not mastered all of the material in the first semester can pick up where he left off in the second semester. Third, an alternative mode of instruction which is student-led and encourages students to take ownership of their own learning may help students who struggle with traditional lecture-based courses.====Between 2009–2010 and 2012–2013, eleven colleges in the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) adopted the emporium model in at least one of three math courses in the remedial math sequence. I exploit variation in the timing of the adoption of the emporium model across math courses and across institutions.==== Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (i.e. triple difference) identification strategy, I estimate the change in outcomes for cohorts of students within the same college and same level of math remediation before and after the adoption of the emporium model while differencing out the change for students in the same level of remediation in comparison colleges and the change for students in different levels of remediation within the same college.====Across KCTCS colleges, students can be required to complete up to three (sequential) remedial math courses before they can begin college-level work. Since students assigned to different levels of remediation are likely to have different outcomes regardless of their remedial course experiences, this design compares students who begin taking the same level of remedial coursework to one another. In addition to controlling for time invariant differences between students in different levels of remediation and students in different colleges, this design also allows me to difference out changes that affected all remedial courses within an institution (e.g. a change in the supports available to students in remedial courses) and changes within a given level of remediation across institutions (e.g. a change in the placement criteria used by KCTCS) that may have occurred at the same time as the introduction of the emporium model.====I find that using blended learning in a course reduces students’ ability to progress through remediation to credit-bearing courses. Students who are taught using the emporium model are ten percentage points less likely to pass their courses in one semester and are five percentage points less likely to take a college-level math course within three years of enrolling. Students are also six percentage points less likely to be enrolled in college by their second year than students taking the same remedial course under traditional instruction. Within three years of enrolling, students taught using the emporium model are five percentage points less likely to earn a degree. Effects were generally consistent across all three levels of remediation, suggesting there is little variation by students’ incoming placement test score.====One concern is that it may not be random which courses switched to the emporium model, and that if these differences were time-varying, they could bias estimates of the effect of the emporium model. For example, if colleges adopted the emporium model in a particular course in response to falling pass rates, this could pose a problem. To address this concern, I conduct event study analyses to test if the adopting courses have similar trends to the comparison courses in the pre-adoption period. I find evidence that suggests the timing of the adoption of the emporium model was likely exogenous.====Another concern is that students might switch their level of remediation in response to the introduction of the emporium model. When students first arrive on campus, they are typically given a placement test (or can use scores from a test they took previously) to determine their placement. However, students sometimes can retake the tests or are otherwise able to avoid remedial courses. If students are more (or less) likely to take these steps to adjust their level of remediation or avoid remediation entirely with the introduction of the emporium model, this could bias the results. To address this, I test for changes in enrollment in remedial courses and test for changes in the observable characteristics of students enrolled at each level of remediation and do not find evidence that these change systematically in response to the introduction of the emporium model.====While it is clear that students perform worse in remedial courses with the emporium model, it is not clear why. In the conclusion, I consider reasons why blended learning might have had such a large effect on a student's likelihood of passing their courses, including the possibility that students struggle with self-management and self-pacing. Because the assessment criteria were not necessarily aligned before and after emporium adoption, it is also possible that students were being held to a higher standard of understanding under the emporium model than before. Because the model typically standardizes assessments across classes and requires students to demonstrate their understanding before moving to the next topic, the new approach may have raised the bar on what is required for passing.====This paper contributes to a growing literature on blended learning. Three randomized studies comparing blended learning to purely in-person instruction have found few differences in students’ outcomes (Alpert et al., 2016, Joyce et al., 2015, Bowen et al., 2014). These studies have been limited to introductory microeconomics or statistics courses at large, four-year public colleges. Given that approximately two-thirds of community colleges report using blended or hybrid online courses, this study will expand the literature to a group of colleges that is highly policy relevant (Parsad & Lewis, 2008). Second, while these studies have strong internal validity, two of the three studies use a sample that is limited to students who volunteered to be randomized into a blended learning course – a group who is likely more amenable to taking a blended learning course than the average student. In contrast, this study examines the introduction of blended learning for all students without the option to participate. Third, most blended learning interventions have mixed students’ time in a course between an online component that the student can perform off-campus and an in-person section for either a lecture or a discussion section (Alpert et al., 2016, Joyce et al., 2015, Bowen et al., 2014). This paper examines a model in which students spend all of the course time working online in an on-campus computer lab with instructors available to answer questions.====One working paper to date has examined a computer-based intervention in remedial college courses. Boatman (2012) estimates the effect of three Tennessee colleges’ redesigns of their remedial math programs by comparing regression discontinuity estimates of the effect of assignment to remediation before and after the redesign. Two of the colleges’ redesigns used modularized, computer-based remediation reforms, similar to the emporium model. In one of these colleges, students were less likely to persist to their second semester after the redesign went into effect; at the other, there were no differences in students’ outcomes. This study builds on this study by examining the introduction of the emporium model at scale in a state community college system.",Moving the classroom to the computer lab: Can online learning with in-person support improve outcomes in community colleges?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718304904,19 March 2019,2019,Research Article,149.0

Using variation from 2656 retrofits across Georgia, we estimate effects of emissions reductions on district-level health and academic achievement. We demonstrate positive effects on respiratory health, measured by a statewide test of aerobic capacity. Placebo tests on body mass index show no impact. We also find that retrofitting districts experience significant test score gains in English and smaller gains in math. Our results suggest that engine retrofits can have meaningful and cost-effective impacts on health and cognitive functioning.","Nearly 25 million children ride over 500,000 buses to school in the United States each day. The predominantly diesel bus fleet contributes to air pollution exposure that may adversely affect children’s health and academic performance. Because of this, school bus retrofit programs have been enacted across the country, making use of up to $200 million in federal grants per year to local districts to replace or retrofit engines. We use information on 2656 of these school bus retrofits in Georgia, affecting approximately 150,000 students, to estimate effects on student health and academic achievement.====Diesel retrofits are an immediate and relatively inexpensive way to dramatically reduce diesel emissions.==== A large literature has estimated the effect of diesel engine emissions on ambient air quality, in particular on nitrogen oxide and particulate matter.==== A separate literature examines the effect of exposure to air pollution on children’s academic achievement and health.==== Yet, little is known about the direct effect of diesel emission reductions on children’s academic achievement or health. The only studies to investigate school bus retrofits on health outcomes are Beatty and Shimshack (2011), which finds that bus retrofits in Washington state lead to significant reductions in asthma and pneumonia doctor visits, and Adar, S. D., D'Souza, J., Sheppard, L., Kaufman, J. D., Hallstrand, T. S., et al. (2015), which finds that retrofits in Washington state reduce pollution and pulmonary inflammation and increase lung growth. No study we know of examines the effect of reduced exposure to school bus emissions on academic performance.====To address the causal link between diesel retrofits, student health and academic achievement, we exploit variation in the timing and location of over 2600 school bus retrofits across Georgia between 2007 and 2015. During our sample period, 15 percent of Georgia’s 180 school districts retrofitted a share of their fleet. Our measure of exposure at the district level is based on the proportion of the bus fleet retrofitted in a given district. We further refine this with the proportion of students who are bus riders and the average amount of time students spend on the bus. We match retrofitting data to two types of district-level outcome measures: student health and scholastic outcomes. For the former, we observe a state-mandated fitness evaluation known as FitnessGram.==== These health data include an established measure of cardiovascular health (aerobic capacity), which allows us to estimate effects on respiratory health, and BMI, which we take as a potential placebo against general health trends, though we discuss why BMI might also be affected by improved respiratory health. For scholastic outcomes we observe English and math end-of-grade test scores in addition to attendance.====We find positive and non-trivial effects of bus retrofits on student health. Retrofitting an entire fleet leads to a 4 percent increase in the average aerobic capacity of students, or roughly 1.8 units of ==== max, in our most conservative estimate. This effect is slightly larger when we weight treatment by the share of students in a district who ride the bus. In this case, retrofitting 100 percent of buses in a district where everyone rides the bus would yield a 5 percent improvement in aerobic capacity. We find no relationship between retrofits and our placebo, BMI. We show that effects on aerobic capacity are strongest for elementary school students.====We also find evidence that these retrofits affected student achievement. Retrofitting 10 percent of a district’s fleet increases English test scores by 0.009 standard deviations, so retrofitting an entire district’s fleet would increase test scores by nearly one-tenth of a standard deviation. Weighting by the share of students who ride the bus, we find that districts experience a 0.14 standard deviation increase from retrofitting an entire fleet when all students ride the bus. Estimated effects on math scores are also positive, but are smaller and noisier than those for English and often cannot be distinguished from zero. We find little evidence that attendance was significantly affected, though initial attendance rates were very high.====Our results suggest that retrofits are a cost-effective lever to improve both student health and achievement. A back-of-the-envelope analysis suggests that for each effect, benefits were far in excess of costs. The average retrofit required only $8,110 in our sample, suggesting diesel engine retrofits can be at least three times more cost-effective than class-size reductions for achieving a given test score improvement.","School bus emissions, student health and academic performance",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775719301530,15 March 2019,2019,Research Article,150.0

I link children residing in Georgia in 1910 to their responses as adults to the 1940 census and to district-level measures of school revenues. Georgia is attractive as a case study since State School Fund allocation rules provide a plausibly exogenous source of variation in school district revenues. The results suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in school revenues for the first three years of an individual’s schooling increases educational attainment by more than a third of a year and weekly wage earnings in adulthood by 7.14% (====) on average for whites.","Whether increased school resources improve student outcomes has been much debated in the economics of education literature over the last half-century. In a review of the literature, Hanushek (2003) concludes that increased resources have not led to noticeable improvements in student exam performance. However, test scores imperfectly capture the value of school outputs and recent studies have shown the effects of school resources on later-life outcomes may not be revealed by test scores (for example, Chetty, Friedman, Hilger, Saez, Schanzenbach, Yagan, 2011, Deming, 2009, Heckman, Pinto, Savelyev, 2013, Ludwig, Miller, 2007). And a number of studies have found a positive relationship between school resources and educational attainment and earnings as measured in adulthood (for example, Akin, Garfinkel, 1977, Card, Krueger, 1992, Rizzuto, Wachtel, 1980). Still, such research tends to present correlational evidence of the relationship between observed variation in school expenditures and student outcomes. Thus, Card and Krueger (1996) suggest exploring further evidence from natural experiments.====I consider a historical case study of the effect of school resources in Georgia during the early twentieth century on student educational attainment and wage earnings reported in 1940, exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in school district budgets generated by the rules governing the allocation of the State School Fund.==== Between 1877 and 1925 the State of Georgia appropriated funds to school districts in proportion to their school-age population as determined by the most recent school census. Since the school census was taken quinquennially, large changes in school-age population were often observed between school censuses (Baker, 2018). Assuming that the population of 6–18 year olds changed in a smooth and continuous way, a district showing an increase in official school-age population would have been “under-funded” relative to its actual school-age population in the years prior to the census update. Similarly, a district experiencing a decrease in school-age population between censuses would have been relatively “over-funded.” Thus, the infrequent census updates combined with the state’s budget allocation rule produced a plausibly exogenous source of variation in school resources per child at the county level.====To examine the impact of these periods of budget distress and surplus on long-run educational attainment and later-life labor market outcomes, I match children in the 1910 census living in Georgia to their responses as adults in the 1940 census, creating a linked sample of individuals. The census of 1940 was the first to ask all respondents about their earnings and educational attainment, the dependent variables of interest. Linking individuals to their childhood households in the 1910 census provides the county in which they likely attended school, as well as important family background characteristics. Identifying county of residence in 1910 allows for the data to be matched with school revenue information collected from annual reports of the Georgia Department of Education.====There is a related literature in economic history seeking to understand the determinants of education and labor market outcomes, often with particular attention to racial differences (see, for example, Margo, 1990, Orazem, 1987). However, up to the release of the 1940 census, it was not possible to link an individual’s childhood schooling environment to wage earnings and total years of schooling as an adult, for this period. In a recent addition to this literature, Carruthers, Wanamaker, 2017a, Carruthers, Wanamaker, 2017b utilize responses to questions in the 1940 census regarding place of residence in 1935 to discern the probable schooling location for 18–25 year old men in 1940. Carruthers and Wanamaker (2017b) use this approach to examine the impact of various school quality metrics on the racial differential in the earnings of young men. In a separate work, Carruthers and Wanamaker (2017a) use the same approach to estimate the impact of measured school quality—specifically, expenditures, term length, teacher salary, and class size—on annual income and occupation score by race. This work differs in that it provides estimates of the impact of school resources on both educational attainment and earnings, as measured in adulthood, using plausibly exogenous variation in school funding per child. Given that outcomes are measured at age 33–37 the estimated wage effects can defensibly be considered permanent. This paper also has the advantage of observing all individuals in their childhood household, the characteristics of which are used to alleviate concern that omitted variables (namely family background) are correlated with school resources.",School resources and labor market outcomes: Evidence from early twentieth-century Georgia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718305247,8 March 2019,2019,Research Article,151.0

The university´s selection process allows the use of a regression discontinuity design. We estimate both intent-to-treatment (offer admissions) and treatment-on-the-treated (enrollment) effects. The results show positive effects of offering admission to the prestigious university on the probability of enrollment, 13.8 percentage point (pp), 1.3 pp increase in academic credits a student need to repeat, and increment in 7 pp in probability of graduation. Despite no significant effects on the standardized university exit exam, we found positive effects on the probability of employment and earnings, 7.4 and 4.6 pp respectively. These results suggest that prestigious universities are more effective source of signaling in the labor market, but they are not more effective than other universities in developing human capital.","This research aims to test whether the graduate wages bonus from highly prestigious universities is due to these universities having an additional effect on the formation of human capital or whether the bonus is due to university signaling effect. This paper found positive effects on the probability of employment and earnings from attending a private university but no significant effects on performance as measured by a standardized university exit exam. These results suggest that an increase in graduate wages is due to a university signaling effect and not enhanced human capital.====Human capital is defined as the accumulation of skills and knowledge that influence individuals’ productivity. In this theory, individuals invest in education until the marginal gain in productivity is equal to the marginal cost (Schultz, 1961). The human capital theory suggests that the labor market recognizes the individual abilities level and determine the salary according whit this level (Schultz, 1972). According to this, people with higher abilities should have a higher salary than those who do not. On the other hand, pioneers in signaling such as Spence, 1973, Arrow, 1973 and Stiglitz (1975) demonstrate that direct productivity gains are not necessary to explain the observed monetary return to schooling. Signaling suggests that the labor market cannot identify the individual abilities level. This lack of information forces the labor market to determine the salary according to the signal that the individual can give (Hussey, 2012); for example, to hold college diploma or MBA diploma. Our research seeks to show that the university prestige is a signal for the labor market.====Estimating the differences in return between prestigious and non-prestigious university is difficult due to self-selection problems. In the absence of exogenous variation at university entry, the comparison between these kinds of universities in labor outcomes confound individual's characteristics and the education contribution. This paper aims to contribute to a nascent empirical research on causal effects of university attendance. Arteaga (2018) uses data from the Andes University, to estimate the effects of reducing the length of the career in economics and administration. Saavedra (2009) and MacLeod, Riehl, Saavedra, and Urquiola (2017) use similar data and found that college reputation is positively correlated with graduates’ earnings, while the salaries fixed in their job offer. Additionally, it contributes in analyzing the value added in higher education.==== We use a discontinuity in the entry exam of a highly selective and prestigious university in Colombia to estimate the effects of offering entrance to those close to the entry cutoff, versus those who did not receive this university's offer, just below the cutoff point.====We aim to advance the empirical evidence on the causal effects of university education in two directions. First, we use several sources of administrative data to estimate effects at different points of the educational process of individuals. We are able to estimate effects on repetition, dropout, graduation, time to graduation, and a standardized university exit exam. Likewise, we are able to estimate the impact of university on probability of employment during the first year in the labor market and on wages. Second, the majority of evidence comes from developed countries; in contrast, our paper sheds light on the trajectory of individuals in a middle-high earning country. An increasing number of individuals are finishing secondary education and demanding tertiary education in several middle earnings countries. Understanding the returns to university education in middle earnings countries is critical.====There is consensus in the literature on the positive effect of years of education on salary (Hoekstra, 2009). There is less agreement on the role that university quality or prestigious university has on returns to education, or its effect on variables such as student retention, graduation, and enrollment, among others (Black and Smith, 2004, Brewer et al., 1999, Dale and Krueger, 2002, Hoekstra, 2009). Additionally, evidence for the effect of university quality on salaries is mixed, while at the same time failing to clearly identify whether any positive effect is due to students being more highly educated (value added – human capital), or whether the effect comes from market signaling.====Other evidence shows that low-income individuals who apply for admission to any selective college have educational achievement at levels similar individuals who apply for admission to other less selective colleges (Hoxby and Avery, 2013, Hoxby and Turner, 2013).====An important feature of our data is the availability of Colombian's university exit exam. The literature on returns to education has seen important developments in recent years, generating a wide consensus on the positive impact of years of education on salary. This contrasts with very little evidence on the impact of educational university quality on salary and less evidence about signaling effects (Hoekstra, 2009). The evidence is mixed, as some empirical evidence suggests a positive effect of university quality on salaries (Brewer et al., 1999, Hoekstra, 2009, Saavedra, 2009), while other studies suggest that university quality has no impact on graduates’ salaries (Dale & Krueger, 2002, 2011).==== The availability of the specific university exit exam allows us to have a first approximation of the contribution of quality associated with a highly selective university. We advance the estimation of Saavedra (2009) in that our data include a period in which this exam became obligatory for any graduating individual in Colombia. This difference is quite important since the selection problems are exacerbated previous this period.====The admission process of the university is based on the high school exit exam, Saber 11. Applicants have to declare a major; each major has a specific cutoff point. Some majors are more selective (for example, engineering) than others (for example, arts). Individuals above the major-specific cutoff point are offered a place in the university. We use the place offer to estimate intent-to-treat effects for those individual (just) above and (just) below the cutoff point. In turn, we instrument (locally) enrollment in the college with the Saber 11 score to find a treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimator. We run a fuzzy design, with the running variable Saber 11 and enrollment as the instrumented variable (Jinyong, Todd, & van derKlaauw, 2001).====Our strategy follows closely Hoekstra (2009) and Saavedra (2009). Hoekstra estimate effects on earnings from attending a flagship state college in US. He uses a RD strategy, based on the entry process of the university. He found positive large impacts on earnings. Our paper extends Hoekstra's paper to a developing country (Colombia) and to different outcomes, including college exit exams. Saavedra (2009) estimates the return to a highly selective college in Colombia, using data similar to our data. He uses an RD design as well, finding positive effects on probability of employment one year after college. In contrast to our data, he uses college exit exams at a moment in which the exam was optional. We extend the period under analysis, with the starting year the moment in which the exam was obligatory. This will dissipate any concerns about self-selection in taking college exit exams. Additionally, and given theoretical considerations of differential market remunerations to different careers, we present estimates by academic major (Dale & Krueger, 2002).====We find that the aggregate impact of offering admission to a high competitive university is significant and positive for enrollment, the percentage of academic credits a student repeats, and graduation rates, with effects of 13.8, 1.3, and 7 percentage points, respectively. We find no effect on dropout risk, the time it takes students to graduate, the time it takes a graduate to find employment, or their scores on the standardized university exit exam. The last result is particularly important in light of a positive effect of 7.4 percentage points on the probability of finding a job one year after graduation and a 4.6 percentage point differential on earnings. Given large differences in returns to education for different majors, we estimate effects by five majors: engineering, health, sciences, economics and administration, and arts and humanities. We found large differential impact across these majors. Moreover, given that the TOT estimators scale up the point estimate by the differential probability of enrollment between the (marginal) students offered and not offered place, these estimators are larger for actual enrollment in university.====We divide this paper into five sections. Section two briefly presents some background on higher education in Colombia. Section three describes the data and the identification strategy, and we present the results in section four.

This is an important question in the UK where less than half of STEM graduates work in STEM occupations, and where this apparent leakage from the “STEM pipeline” is often considered as a wastage of resources. To address it, this paper goes beyond the discrete divide of ==== into STEM vs. non-STEM: using UK online vacancy postings, we measure STEM requirements at the level of ====, by classifying each posting as either STEM or non-STEM based on its job description text instead of its occupation identifier. We find that 35% of all STEM ==== belong to non-STEM ====, and that 15% of all vacancies posted in non-STEM ==== are in fact STEM ====. Moreover, STEM jobs are associated with higher wages within both STEM and non-STEM occupations.","To what extent do employers in non-STEM occupations (e.g. ====) require and value knowledge and skills that are typically only acquired through a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education?====This is an important question in the UK where less than half of STEM graduates work in STEM occupations (e.g. ====).==== The apparent leakage from the “STEM pipeline” is often considered as problematic for two main reasons. Firstly, some studies argue that it leads to shortages of qualified workers within STEM occupations, thereby negatively impacting UK’s long term growth by, for example, hindering investments in R&D, technology, and innovation (cf. for instance Forth, Mason, 2006, Harrison, 2012, Levy and Hopkins, 2010). Secondly, STEM education is more expensive and often more difficult to acquire than non-STEM education. Therefore, if recruiters in non-STEM occupations do not actually require and value STEM knowledge and skills but simply like hiring STEM graduates for their “foundation competencies” (Bosworth et al., 2013), “logical approach to solving problems” (Mellors-Bourne, Connor, & Jackson, 2011) or just because they believe that STEM graduates should be more capable than their non-STEM fellows, the UK might be wasting considerable amounts of money and efforts.====Another possibility, however, is that the binary classification of occupations into STEM vs. non-STEM is imperfect and has become inappropriate because of trends like digitization and the arrival of Big Data, which transform business operations and infiltrate STEM requirements outside positions that are typically considered as STEM.====Indeed, “STEM occupations” are a relatively arbitrary construct. They are identified using either judgment (BIS 2014, Chevalier, 2012, Department for Innovation, Universities, and Skills, 2009, Greenwood, Harrison, Vignoles, 2011, Mason, 2012, Mellors-Bourne et al., 2011), or data-driven approaches (Bosworth et al., 2013, Rothwell, 2013), or a combination of both (UK Commission for Employment & Skills, 2015). Most studies recognize that “the issue of precisely where to draw the line between STEM and non-STEM never goes away” (Bosworth et al., 2013), that “neither Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system codes nor Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes are particularly valuable to [classify STEM employment]” (Mellors-Bourne et al., 2011), and that “STEM degree holders working in a non-STEM occupation may still be using their STEM skills” (Bosworth et al., 2013).====The only way to shed more light on this important issue is to go beyond ==== and measure STEM requirements at the level of ====. We attempt this by examining the universe of UK online vacancy postings. Our data comes from ==== (BGT), a labour market analytics company that collects and processes information on all UK online vacancies posted on employer websites, major job boards, government databases, etc. Where available, BGT collects job titles, occupation, industry and employer identifiers, education, experience and discipline requirements, wages, geographical locations ... and, most importantly, transforms the job description texts into sets of keywords, e.g:====Our goal is to identify STEM jobs as those “involving activities that can only be satisfactorily carried out by individuals with STEM skills” (Bosworth et al., 2013). We design a machine learning algorithm that classifies vacancies as either STEM or non-STEM depending on the “steminess” of the keywords in their job descriptions. Keywords with higher steminess correspond to skills and knowledge that are exclusively or much more likely to be taught in STEM disciplines (e.g. ====), or job tasks, tools and technologies for which a STEM education is typically required (e.g. ====). Our classification algorithm achieves an over 90% correct classification rate when tested on the sample of vacancies where discipline requirements are stated explicitly. Correct classification here means that the keywords-based classification of the job is STEM when the qualification requirement is a STEM discipline and non-STEM when the discipline stated is also non-STEM.====Using this method, we classify 33 million online vacancy postings collected by BGT between January 2012 and July 2016. We find that around 35% of all STEM ==== (i.e. jobs classified as STEM based on the keywords) belong to non-STEM occupations. As expected, most of the jobs within STEM occupations are identified as STEM (81% of all), while, in non-STEM occupations, STEM jobs remain a minority - around 15% of all. However, even these small percentages add up to a significant number of STEM employment opportunities outside STEM occupations. Ignoring them leads to underestimating the overall demand for STEM knowledge and skills. For instance, in 2015, according to our classification, 2.66 million STEM jobs were advertised online, while the number of jobs posted in STEM occupations was only 2.15 million. Hence, equating STEM jobs with STEM occupations would make us underestimate STEM demand by around half a million vacancies.====Economists and policymakers often argue that the STEM pipeline leakage is problematic because STEM graduates receive a wage premium only if they stay in STEM occupations, i.e. “STEM skills are not particularly valued in non-STEM occupations” (Levy & Hopkins, 2010). The evidence typically mentioned is the Department for Innovation, Universities, & Skills (2009) report, which uses the Longitudinal Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (LDLHE) and the Labour Force surveys and, therefore, cannot distinguish between STEM and non-STEM jobs within non-STEM occupations. By contrast, our approach allows us to make this distinction. Although our results are not directly comparable because we examine the wage premium for STEM from the labour ==== side, we find that STEM jobs are associated with higher wages within both STEM and non-STEM occupations. Moreover, conditional on a full set of four-digit occupation fixed effects, there is no statistically significant difference between the wage premium offered for STEM knowledge and skills in STEM occupations and the STEM premium offered in non-STEM occupations.====Our results do not necessarily contradict but rather extend previous evidence. Indeed, within non-STEM occupations, nothing prevents STEM graduates from selecting non-STEM jobs for which non-STEM graduates are also qualified and no STEM premium is offered. The distinction with prior studies is the finding that around 15% of recruiters in non-STEM occupations do require and value STEM knowledge and skills.====Overall, our empirical results imply that the STEM pipeline leakage may be less problematic than previously thought because a significant proportion of jobs in non-STEM occupations can only be satisfactorily fulfilled with people possessing a certain level of STEM knowledge and skills, which, within the UK education system, is typically acquired through a STEM education. Moreover, our findings suggest that STEM shortages may exist not only in STEM occupations but also in non-STEM ones.====Nonetheless, the STEM pipeline leakage remains problematic for two main reasons. First, STEM graduates working in non-STEM occupations could still be selecting non-STEM jobs, thereby wasting their skills and not receiving any premium for their STEM education. More importantly, there could be more efficient ways of satisfying the STEM demand in non-STEM occupations than training full-time STEM graduates. Indeed, digging further into the STEM requirements of ==== (i.e. STEM jobs in non-STEM occupations), we find many skills and knowledge that could certainly be acquired through appropriate training that is less advanced than a full-time STEM degree - e.g. learning how to code in, say,==== or==== does not necessitate a Bachelor in Computer Sciences.====Increasing the number of students enrolling in STEM disciplines is one of the most popular solutions proposed to reduce STEM shortages (e.g. Rothwell, 2014). Our findings, however, suggest that a more efficient way of satisfying STEM demand within non-STEM occupations would be to teach more STEM in non-STEM disciplines, thereby equipping non-STEM graduates with the STEM skills required by STEM jobs within non-STEM occupations.====Our paper inscribes itself in the literature employing online vacancies’ data to investigate labour market dynamics and/or inform education provision policies. Although this type of data comes with important caveats, it is highly valuable to both academics and policymakers because of the advantages it presents over surveys. Reamer (2013), for example, gives an interesting overview of how real-time labour market information could be used by different federal agencies and trade associations in the US to better align education programs with current labor market demand. He also discusses the pros and cons of such usage.====The BGT data itself has already been used in a variety of internal and external research projects.====In the UK, BGT have partnered with the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to create an online skills calculator that “compares entry-level employer demand and the number of learners completing related programmes of study”.====In the US, the paper most related to our work is Rothwell (2014). He uses a subset of the BGT data for which the duration of the vacancy is known to show that STEM job openings take longer to fill than non-STEM positions at all education levels. Contrary to our paper, STEM jobs in Rothwell’s paper are still identified at the ==== level. In particular, he uses O*NET Knowledge scales, as explained in his other paper (Rothwell, 2013). He does not seek to use the keywords from the vacancy descriptions to classify the job postings as STEM or non-STEM directly. Instead, he defines the value of each BGT keyword, called “skill”, as the average salary cited in the postings containing it. He finds that more valuable skills are advertised for longer and that STEM positions tend to demand more valuable skills.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We start by introducing the UK BGT data in Section 2. In Section 3, we design and test a machine learning algorithm to classify job postings into STEM and non-STEM. We then turn to the characteristics of STEM jobs in the UK in Section 4. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first attempt at going beyond the discrete divide of occupations into STEM vs. non-STEM and documenting the ==== of STEM jobs. We look at both – how STEM jobs are distributed across occupations and the percentage of jobs within an occupation that are STEM (STEM density). We can think of the latter as a novel continuous way of describing the importance of STEM requirements at the occupation level. In future work, occupational STEM densities could potentially be employed to help get more precise estimates of STEM demand. Currently, benchmark projections of demand for STEM-educated workers (e.g. Harrison, 2012, Wilson, 2009) are typically developed by combining a historical analysis of patterns of employment by discipline from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) with the forecasts of employment growth by broad sectors and major/sub-major occupations produced in the ==== by the UKCES (cf. UK Commission for Employment & Skills, 2016 for most recent report). However, as noted in Wilson (2009), this approach reflects “both supply and demand influences”. We hope that our STEM density estimates could help future research get rid of the supply influence, and, therefore, provide a cleaner estimate of STEM demand.

Results confirm students substitute grant aid for both paid labor and borrowing. An average increase of $1100 in grant aid reduces weekly job hours by 1.5–2 h per week for women, corresponding to a decline in annual earnings of $850, and reduces borrowing by an average of $300–$400 dollars among all students. We find limited evidence of grant aid's impact on academic outcomes.","The federal government, state governments, and private institutions annually invest billions of dollars in grant aid to improve human capital investment in postsecondary education. Ample evidence demonstrates that, in the absence of these sources of aid, college enrollment rates would suffer (see Deming & Dynarksi, 2010, and Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013 for reviews of the literature). A growing body of evidence also suggests the investment in grant aid enhances persistence and degree completion among enrolled students. Observational studies demonstrate a positive association of grant receipt and persistence (Cabrera et al., 1992, Dowd, 2004, Mendoza et al., 2009), and quasi-experimental (Alon, 2011, Bettinger, 2004, Bettinger et al., 2016, Castleman and Long, 2016, Clotfelter et al., 2016, Henry et al., 2004, Schudde and Scott-Clayton, 2016, Scott-Clayton, 2011a) and experimental (Angrist et al., 2014, Angrist et al., 2009, Brock and Richburg-Hayes, 2006, Goldrick-Rab et al., 2016) analyses provide causal evidence that grant aid has a positive effect on persistence.====Although grant aid appears to improve enrollment and persistence, we have less evidence on how the receipt of grant aid alters students’ financial choices and behaviors, specifically how grant aid affects labor market participation and student loan borrowing decisions. Economic theory suggests students likely substitute some combination or earnings and borrowing with grant aid, but most of the extant literature examines only one form of substitution in isolation. For example, Broton, Goldrick-Rab, and Benson (2016) measure the effect of aid on hours of paid labor while ignoring borrowing, and Marx and Turner (2018) identify the impact of grant aid on borrowing but do not observe hours of labor market participation. Students do not make the borrowing or work decisions in isolation. Over the course of a few months when enrolling in postsecondary education, they jointly choose levels of borrowing and hours of labor market participation based on their remaining unmet need after accounting for grant aid.====This paper assesses the impact of grant aid on both borrowing and labor market participation to observe how students substitute grant money with student loans and earnings while enrolled. In order to identify these substitution effects, our analysis tests the exogenous receipt of grant aid on labor market participation, the likelihood of borrowing, and borrowing amounts. To provide causal evidence, we exploit an income threshold for federal Pell Grant eligibility by applying a regression discontinuity design to four waves of national data from 2000 to 2012. The Pell Grant is the largest single source of need-based grant aid for college attendance and is provided by the federal government to income eligible students. There is a threshold for Pell Grant eligibility roughly based on income such that students below the threshold are eligible to receive a portion of the maximum award. Previous work has found that Pell Grant eligibility has little effect on whether or where students enroll in college (Carruthers and Welch, 2017, Rubin, 2011); however, conditional on enrollment, eligibility for the Pell Grant at this threshold provides an average increase in grant aid of approximately $1100 at four-year colleges and insignificant amount at two-year colleges relative to those just short of the eligibility threshold.====Better understanding the substitution effects of exogenous grant aid on borrowing and earnings enables an examination of the mechanism by which grant aid may increase persistence. Receiving grant aid enables students to shift time away from the labor market toward academic studies. If students spend less time participating in the labor market while enrolled, they can allocate more time to accumulating additional college credit, increasing academic performance, or becoming engaged with their institution, all of which may lead to enhanced persistence and human capital (Crisp and Nora, 2010, Dundes and Marx, 2006, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2003).====The possible reduction in work hours while enrolled is a widely cited but rarely tested hypothesized mechanism of grant aid's effect on persistence (Castleman and Long, 2016, Henry et al., 2004; King & Bannon, 2002). While studies exist that identify the effects of grant aid on persistence and academic outcomes (Brock and Richburg-Hayes, 2006, Castleman and Long, 2016; Goldrick-Rab et al., 2016), and the effect of grant aid on paid work while enrolled (Broton et al., 2016), rarely are these outcomes examined collectively with the exception of a few recent papers we discuss below. Our analysis also considers the effect of grant aid receipt on academic outcomes of credit accumulation and performance to examine this hypothesized mechanism.====Empirical estimates provide causal evidence that grant aid does substitute for other forms of postsecondary education financing. Receiving an additional $1100 in grant aid reduces paid weekly work hours for women at four-year institutions by about 1.5 h per week and reduces student loan borrowing among all recipients by $300–$400 per year; however, there is little evidence of differences in academic performance or increased credit attainment. While our identification strategy precludes us from directly assessing whether individual simultaneously reduces borrowing and work, students are, on average, substituting money from both student loans and paid labor for grant aid, but the results do not conclusively support the hypothesis that grant aid increases persistence through a reduction in hours of work.====Our findings contribute to the literature on the causal effects of grant aid on labor market participation and borrowing behavior of students investing in human capital through postsecondary enrollment. Recently there has been a growing interest in this area, and there are a few studies that examine the joint decisions of borrowing and labor market participation (Denning et al., 2017, Page et al., 2017, Park and Scott-Clayton, 2017). Our work contributes to this budding area of research by providing estimates at a different spot in the income distribution for four-year institutions using national data.====How students choose to substitute between grant aid, work, and loans is of growing interest to researchers and more importantly, it also has implications for the design of federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs. Although we find no immediate implications of these substitution effects on academic performance, changes in work behavior and reduced borrowing likely have effects on more distal outcomes we cannot observe in our data. If one goal of grant aid is to reduce borrowing among low- and middle-income populations, we must better understand how students’ labor market participation and borrowing decisions are affected by grants.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide an economic framework for considering the substitution of grant aid with earnings and borrowing and outline the theory of mechanisms that underlie grant aid's effect on persistence. We describe our data and empirical strategy in Section 3. We employ the standard suite of regression discontinuity checks to ensure that its application in this context is appropriate. Section 4 provides our main models’ results and tests alternate specifications for robustness. We discuss our results and conclude in Section 5 with a broader discussion of our findings.","Monetary substitution of loans, earnings, and need-based aid in postsecondary education: The impact of Pell Grant eligibility",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718300906,26 February 2019,2019,Research Article,154.0

We document a general flattening in the CWP for birth cohorts 1970 and onward in each survey and even a decline for birth cohorts 1980–1984 in the NLSY. We discuss potential reasons for this finding and show that the empirical discrepancy is not a function of differences in composition across surveys. Our results provide crucial context for the vast economic literatures that use these surveys to answer important policy questions about intertemporal changes in the returns to skill.","The college wage premium (CWP) measures the wage differential between college graduates and high school graduates and is the outcome of both demand and supply factors. A well-documented and seminal point in the economic history of the United States is when the CWP suddenly rose in the 1980s and continued to rise throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. We investigate whether this trend has continued to hold more recently and how consistently the trend holds across commonly used surveys.====Using the five major U.S. household surveys, we document a substantial rise in the CWP in each of the surveys for birth cohorts 1950–1970. However, this was followed by a flattening thereafter. The flattening occurs for both men and women, although the CWP is noticeably higher for women than men in most birth cohorts in each of the data sets. Our findings corroborate recent studies that have documented declining employment prospects, income levels, and returns to skill among recent birth cohorts (see Beaudry, Green, & Sand, 2014, Guvenen, Kaplan, Song, and Weidner (2017), Valletta, and Gallipoli & Makridis, 2018). Surprisingly, we document a ==== in the CWP in the NLSY for birth cohorts 1980–1984.====The five major household surveys we analyze are the Decennial Census 5% Public Use Micro Sample (hereafter Census) and the American Community Survey (ACS); the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups (CPS); the 1979 and 1997 National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79 and NLSY97); the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID);==== and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In each survey and for each birth cohort, we estimate unconditional log wage regressions to calculate the CWP for full-time/full-year workers aged 25–34.==== Ours is the first study to compare trends in the CWP across these five commonly-used household surveys.====We investigate whether our findings can be explained by differences across surveys in the levels of observed characteristics such as demographic, education, or employment variables. We find no major discrepancies. We conclude that the differences are likely due to differences in survey architecture (i.e. sample size and collection methods, or whether the survey is repeated cross-section versus longitudinal). We also examine the wage premium between graduate degree holders and college graduates (which we call the GWP) and find that this premium is gradually rising even as the CWP is flattening.====Our results have implications for the long and growing list of studies that examine cross-cohort changes in the returns to skill. Many studies use the CPS or decennial Censuses for this type of research (see Goldin and Katz, 2007, and many others), but there are a growing number of studies using the NLSY (see, e.g. Altonji, Bharadwaj, Lange, 2012, Ashworth, Hotz, Maurel, Ransom, 2017, Bacolod, Hotz, 2006, Böhm, 2017, Castex, Dechter, 2014, Deming, 2017, Lee, Shin, Lee, 2015), as well as the PSID (see Cortes, 2016, Yamaguchi, 2018, and others). To our knowledge, no studies have used the SIPP for these types of analysis.==== Our findings suggest that researchers should not necessarily expect to see the same trends in each major survey. Furthermore, our findings serve as a stimulus to future research to quantify which specific factors are behind the flattening and decline that we find.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the next section describes in more detail the data sets and key variables we use; Section 3 presents our key results; and Section 4 offers discussions and conclusions.",Has the college wage premium continued to rise?

To improve the quality of apprenticeships, the government introduced binding minimum standards for all apprenticeships, known as Specification of Apprenticeship Standards for England (SASE). The SASE came into effect in August 2012 and introduced a minimum duration of one year and learning time of 280 h for all apprenticeships, regardless of the sector. Following the 2015 General Election====, the Government announced further reforms of the apprenticeships standards and regulations, as well as the introduction of an ”Apprenticeship Levy” to fund for three million new apprenticeships====Yet little is known about the effectiveness of specific features of apprenticeship programmes, such as duration or learning hours. Increasing apprenticeship duration and learning time may improve the quality of the training, and result in improved educational and labour market outcomes. The education literature suggests that if learning is a cumulative process, then extra teaching time should improve learning outcomes. A number of studies exploit cross-country variation in teaching times (number of days spent at school) to show that teaching time is positively associated with educational outcomes (Lavy, 2015, Rivkin, Schiman, 2015, Wossmann, 2003). In addition, studies using experimental or quasi-experimental variations in teaching time show that longer teaching time improve learning outcomes (Marcotte, 2007, Meroni, Abbiati, 2016, Pischke, 2007).====However, apprenticeships differ from traditional schooling in several ways. First, unlike school, apprenticeships are typically not part of the compulsory schooling system. Increasing the duration of apprenticeships increases the opportunity costs of undertaking them, which could make them less attractive to young people. Second, apprenticeships are a way to gain relevant work experience as much as a way to gain a qualification. If the most valuable part of the apprenticeship is gaining initial work experience, then increasing the duration may have little effects on labour market outcomes.====Finally, apprenticeships involve not only learners and teachers but also employers. Increasing the length of apprenticeships and time dedicated to learning could affect the demand for apprentices. For instance it could adversely affect employers by increasing training costs.==== Conversely, longer apprenticeship duration could increase demand for apprentices as they may have more time to make a productive contribution to the firm (Malcomson, Maw, & McCormick, 2003).====In light of these major differences compared to traditional schooling, the effect of increasing the duration of apprenticeships may differ from the effect of increasing length of school year in primary and secondary school.====While there is little evidence on the effect of changing specific features of apprenticeships programmes some studies from Germany suggest that introducing more flexibility and modularisation help increase achievement for people at higher risk of dropping out (Hafeli, 2004, Kloas, 2001). Therefore, the introduction of binding standards for all apprenticeships, which reduced the flexibility of the apprenticeship system, may improve quality of apprenticeships and but also have an adverse effects on starts and completion, especially among weaker learners.====In this paper, we examine the effect of the introduction of binding standards on starts and achievement of apprenticeships, as well as labour market outcomes of apprentices. Whilst the reform introduced a minimum duration for all sectors, we show that many sectors were virtually unaffected by the reform. In these sectors, the duration already exceeded a year prior to the reform. Duration increased sharply in some service sector apprenticeships, but remained stable in a number of other service sector apprenticeships as well as sectors traditionally offering them like hairdressing, construction, engineering or vehicle maintenance and repair. Therefore, the reform offers a unique quasi-experimental setting to analyse the effect of increasing the duration of vocational programmes on various outcomes. Exploiting this feature, we use a Difference-in-Differences approach to estimate the impact of this reform on number of starts of apprenticeship, achievement rates as well as labour market outcomes. We contribute to the literature on the effect of instruction time on learning outcomes by studying the effect of increasing the duration of apprenticeships whilst the existing literature primarily focus on duration of schooling. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use a quasi-experimental approach to analyse the effect of apprenticeship duration on labour market outcomes.====Our findings show adverse effects on achievement of apprenticeships and increased drop-out from apprenticeships. We also find that the reform increased earnings in the medium run. This improvement is driven by people who achieved the apprenticeship, which indicates that the reform improved the quality of the apprenticeships.",The longer the better?

We use administrative data pertaining to the entire Swedish population born between 1916 and 1945. According to our empirical results, the opening of a new lower secondary school in a municipality increased the baseline probability of running for political office by 10–20%, and the probability of holding office by 20–30%.","How can democracies ensure that the most suitable persons become political representatives? For classical enlightenment liberals such as Montesquieu, Condorcet, and Mill, the expansion of public education was key to a well-functioning democracy. Equal access to education was pictured as the most effective means of ensuring that the most suited men, and later women, could stand as political candidates.====Thomas Jefferson’s famous plan for the establishment of public education in his home state of Virginia provides a good example of this line of reasoning. Among other things, Jefferson called for the creation of public grammar schools at the county level, at which the most gifted students could continue their studies after primary school, and urged that the location of these schools should “be as central as may be to the inhabitants of the said counties” (Jefferson, 1984, p. 369). By increasing the availability of post-primary education, Jefferson hoped to improve and enlarge the pool of talent from which the ruling class, the natural aristocracy, would be drawn and could be trained (Carpenter, 2013, p. 4). The provision of good public schools in close proximity to the children’s homes was thus vital for securing the prosperity of democracy.====Despite the fact that many theorists, such as Jefferson, have made strong assumptions about the positive democratic effects of expanded educational opportunities, few empirical studies have examined whether access to education during adolescence is related to the likelihood of becoming a politician as an adult. This study seeks to address this shortcoming in the previous literature by studying if a series of school openings in Sweden, that provided youth growing up in less urban areas with better access to secondary schooling, increased their likelihood of seeking political office later in life. More precisely, we examine how better access to education affects both the likelihood of running for, and winning, political office.====The present study thereby relates to the large literature studying the relationship between education and political participation. Most of this literature has focused on political acts that are undertaken by many citizens, such as voting, protesting, and signing petitions, i.e., the emphasis has been on various types of ==== (Kam, Palmer, 2008, Nie, Junn, Stehlik-Barry, 1996, Persson, 2015, Sondheimer, Green, 2010, Wolfinger, Rosenstone, 1980). Much less attention has been devoted to rarer forms of political participation, such as running for, or holding, political office (but see Lindgren, Oskarsson, & Dawes (2017)). The most important reason for the absence of research on this issue is the lack of adequate data. Given that political candidates constitute such a small fraction of the overall population, it is usually not possible to study political recruitment using traditional representative surveys. Another factor complicating research in this area is the difficulty of disentangling the effect of education from the effect of all other factors that may influence both educational choices and political activity (Kam & Palmer, 2008).====In this paper, we seek to overcome these problems by analyzing the expansion of the public education system in Sweden using unique administrative data pertaining to the entire Swedish population born between 1916 and 1945. More precisely, we use a difference-in-differences approach to analyze how the establishment of lower secondary schools in municipalities that previously only had primary schools affected the chances of the children in these municipalities to run for or hold political office as adults. To the extent that Jefferson and others were correct in assuming that the provision of public schools in close proximity to the children’s homes would enlarge the recruitment pool for political positions, we should expect to observe more politicians among the cohorts that were young enough to enroll in the new schools. This is indeed what we find. According to our empirical results, the opening of a new lower secondary school in a municipality increased the baseline probability of running for political office by 10–20%, while the probability of holding office increased by 20–30%.====The article is structured as follows.

This paper uses data on first-year engineering students at a large, selective engineering school to investigate how peer gender, race, and ability, as well as instructor gender, can impact grades and persistence in engineering. Our findings indicate that gender diversity in the classroom improves all students’ propensity to continue in engineering, and an increase in underrepresented minorities improves grades for minority students. Peer ability also has a strong impact, with an increase in lower-ability students pulling down achievement and persistence in engineering of the bottom of the ability distribution, and an increase in high-ability students improving achievement for all. Finally, our results suggest students benefit from a more diverse ability grouping of their peers in the classroom. We find some evidence that male students are more sensitive to peer ability than are female students.","In the last decade, we have seen an increased interest in the production of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) graduates, with a particular focus on the underrepresentation of women and minorities (Black and Hispanic). This attention has been prompted by the importance of STEM graduates in our workforce, and a predicted need for more graduates from a broad range of backgrounds in these fields. However, the proportion of women participating in STEM fields decreases along the academic pathway from undergraduate to Ph.D. degree. Within the broad STEM field, the issues of underrepresentation of women and minorities and the need for a larger work force are particularly striking in engineering. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects a higher rate of growth over the rest of this decade for engineering occupations than the average occupation (National Science Board, 2012). Engineering is also one of the higher paying STEM fields (e.g., Del Rossi and Hersch, 2008, Webber, 2016). Employment in engineering is widely accepted as a well-established pathway toward a stable and well-paying career. Despite this, women make up roughly 21.6% of the Bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering (Yoder, 2017). For these reasons, many have found it important to examine the factors that influence the decision to enter engineering, as well as succeed in the field.====Although there are many points along the academic pathway to consider, one that may be of particular importance is the first class students take in engineering. This class is the first opportunity a student has in a college setting to observe the material, her peers, and her potential role models or mentors in the faculty. The grades received in this class, for example, are the first college-level signals that students can use to evaluate their own skill or aptitude for the subject. Additionally, an atmosphere or learning environment that feels “foreign” may be unappealing or even discouraging for some students to continue to take additional courses in the field. In contrast, having more students who are similar in some dimension, perhaps by gender or race, may make the classroom feel more familiar, and therefore, encourage a student to continue in a field and/or improve performance. The potential positive effects due to similarity could also extend to the faculty member instructing the class. Many feel that having an instructor of the same gender or race may improve students’ outcomes and increase the probability that they will later choose that field as their major. Finally, the academic ability of a student's classroom peers could affect the learning experience as well, either negatively or positively.====In this paper, we consider the first class taken in a field as a gateway to future courses and persistence in that field. We test whether the first class in a field leaves a first impression that has implications for future choices. Using data on students who matriculate into an engineering program at a large Midwestern research-intensive university, we examine how students’ experiences in their first required course in engineering, taken in the first semester of college, influence their outcomes. Our data allows us to identify causal impacts, as all students are randomly assigned into sections of the course for their first semester. We focus on the grade received in the course, as a measure of direct achievement, and persistence in engineering past the first year. We also attempt to identify how peers can influence academic outcomes, by examining various models of peer effects. In so doing, we can more fully explain how class composition could impact student achievement. Our results not only shed light on the importance of the characteristics of the first class taken in a field, including the instructor of the class, but also provide critical information on how peers can influence each other's outcomes in the classroom and beyond.====Our paper contributes to the literature in a number of important ways. First, our findings indicate that peers can have a significant impact on achievement in a course, as well as on persistence in the major past the first year both through ability as well as demographic characteristics. All students benefit from an increase in the representation of female students in the classroom as they are more likely to persist in engineering past the first year. However, an increase in underrepresented minority students in the classroom benefits fellow underrepresented minorities only. This second finding is new to the higher education literature on peer effects. Our second main contribution is that our results regarding the effects of peer ability show more complex dynamics than mere linear-in-means effects, bolstering the literature in this area. We find that a more heterogeneous ability grouping is beneficial for students in the middle of the ability distribution, with no impact for those in the tails. However, an increase in students in the bottom of the ability distribution has a negative impact, particularly for fellow lower-ability students. An increase in top-ability students improves everyone's grades, including lower-ability students. Altogether, the results of this paper indicate that first class impressions in an academic field are important, and that these first impressions influence current academic achievement as well as students’ subsequent choice to remain in the major. This paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we briefly discuss the long literature in this area, followed by an introduction to the conceptual theory regarding peer effects in Section 3.

Utilizing data for New York State school districts from 1998/99 to 2013/14, we estimate difference-in-differences models to assess the effect of charter schools on enrollment and student composition. Then, we estimate an expenditure function, using data prior to the charter school program, to measure the costs associated with reaching a given performance standard for students in various need categories and different enrollments. Next, using the entire data set, we run a second expenditure function to determine changes in efficiency associated with charter school entry. We find that charter schools increase the cost of providing education, and that these cost increases are larger than short-run efficiency gains, but are offset by efficiency gains in the long term.","Since the beginning of the charter school movement, concerns have been raised that charter schools would drain resources from traditional public schools and increase per pupil costs by attracting students that are the least costly to educate (Arsen et al., 1999, Molnar, 1996, Moody's, 2013). On the other hand, advocates have argued that competition created by charter schools can be “a tide that lifts all boats” by pushing public schools to increase efficiency (Hoxby, 2003b). Given the financial constraints many school districts faced after the Great Recession (Hull, 2010, Jackson et al., 2018) and the growing number of charter schools (NCES, 2018), the question of how charter schools influence districts’ student composition, costs, and efficiency is more salient than ever.====A few studies have examined the impact of charter schools on district revenues and expenditures finding negative fiscal impacts, i.e. that the loss in revenues due to charter schools are greater than expenditure reductions made possible by transfer of students to charter schools (Arsen and Ni, 2012, Bifulco and Reback, 2014, Ladd and Singleton, 2018). Charter school programs typically transfer revenues close to average spending per pupil from traditional public schools to charter schools. However, a substantial proportion of a districts costs are fixed over some short-term, and thus, the amount of spending the district can shed when a student transfers to a charter school is less than average spending per pupil. Note that this argument is one about short-run fiscal impacts. From a long-run perspective, a much lower proportion of a district's costs are fixed and so the amount of spending a district can shed in response to a charter school enrollment should be much closer to average per pupil spending and the amount of revenue transferred to charter schools.====Nonetheless, charter schools can have longer run fiscal impacts on traditional public school districts for at least two reasons. First, the transfer of students out of traditional school to charter schools can shift the cost function faced by a local school district. That is, charter school enrollments can increase the per pupil expenditures required by a district using standard technologies and practices to achieve targeted student outcomes. A significant literature shows that the per pupil expenditures required to achieve targeted student outcomes, i.e. district costs, are influenced by the number of student served and the additional needs students may have (Downes, 2004, Downes and Pogue, 1994, Downes and Stiefel, 2008, Duncombe and Yinger, 1998, Duncombe and Yinger, 2005, Duncombe and Yinger, 2008, Duncombe and Yinger, 2011a, Duncombe and Yinger, 2011b, Eom et al., 2014, Imazeki, 2008, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2003, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2004, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2006, Reschovsky and Imazeki, 2001, Reschovsky and Imazeki, 2003). In particular, larger school districts might be able to achieve economies of scale and thus require lower per pupil expenditures to achieve a given level of outcomes. Thus, when a traditional public school district loses students to a charter school the district may suffer diseconomies that increase the per pupil costs of achieving educational outcomes. Also, students from low-income families, English language learners, and/or students with disabilities will tend to have additional needs, and thus require more resources to achieve educational outcomes. So if transfers to charter school change the proportion of students served by a district who are in these high need categories, then that can also shift the cost function faced by a school district.====Several studies have tried to estimate the effect of charter schools on student composition in traditional schools. Regarding the enrollment of low-income students, the evidence is mixed, with several studies finding that charter school have higher concentrations of nearby poor students than traditional public schools (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2009, Carnoy et al., 2005, Epple et al., 2016, Sass, 2006) and others finding lower concentrations of poor students in charter schools compared to nearby traditional public schools (Booker et al., 2008, Finnigan et al., 2004, Hoxby et al., 2009, Tuttle et al., 2010). Most researchers agree that charter schools serve fewer special education students and English language learners than nearby traditional public schools (Abdulkadiroglu et al., 2009, Bifulco and Buerger, 2015, Finnigan et al., 2004, Miron et al., 2010, Sass, 2006). As some charter schools specialize in educating these student groups, however, there is a large variation in what students are drawn to charter schools (Thernstrom & Thernstrom, 2003). None of these studies have tried to quantify the effect of enrollment changes that result from charter schools on district costs.====The second way that charter schools can affect district expenditures, and thus their long-run fiscal position, is by influencing district efficiency. Thus, if competition for students and revenues spur school districts to use resources more efficiently to achieve student outcomes, then the per pupil expenditures a district spends to achieve a given level of student outcomes will decrease. Several studies have tried to estimate the effect of charter schools on the performance of students who remain in traditional public schools (Bettinger, 2005, Booker et al., 2008, Cordes, 2017, Imberman, 2011, Zimmer et al., 2009). Only a few researchers have found positive effects and most studies have found no effect at all.==== However, because these studies do not simultaneously examine the effects of charter schools on district expenditures, they do not tell us the effect of charter schools on school district efficiency. Among the studies of which we are aware of, one has tried to estimate the efficiency of charter school relative to traditional public schools (Gronberg, Jansen, & Taylor, 2012), but none have tried estimate the effect of charter schools on the efficiency of traditional public schools.====This study draws on concepts from the literature on educational costs to estimate the effect that charter schools have on the amount of per pupil expenditures districts spend to achieve a given level of student outcomes, i.e. on district costs and efficiency. More specifically, we investigate the following three research questions: 1) what is the impact of charter schools on student composition and enrollment in traditional public schools; 2) what is the effect of changes in student composition and enrollment caused by charter schools on district costs; and 3) how does charter school competition affect school district efficiency.====Our empirical strategy builds on techniques applied in program evaluation (Angrist and Pischke, 2009, Card and Krueger, 1994) and education cost-function research (Downes, 2004, Downes and Pogue, 1994, Downes and Stiefel, 2008, Duncombe and Yinger, 1998, Duncombe and Yinger, 2005, Duncombe and Yinger, 2008, Duncombe and Yinger, 2011a, Duncombe and Yinger, 2011b, Eom et al., 2014, Imazeki, 2008, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2003, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2004, Imazeki and Reschovsky, 2006, Reschovsky and Imazeki, 2001, Reschovsky and Imazeki, 2003). Utilizing data from New York State, we start by using difference-in-differences models to estimate the effect of charter school entry on district enrollment and the percentages of students in various need categories. Next, we estimate an expenditure function using information for the 1998/99 school year, the only year in our data set without charter schools, controlling for service outcomes, factors related to district costs, and other factors that might influence district efficiency. The results of this expenditure function provide us with cost measures for students in various need categories and enrollment. Additionally, we estimate a second expenditure function utilizing all years in our data set, including only previously defined treatment and control districts, and adding districts and year fixed effects to measure the impact of charter schools on school district efficiency. In a final step, using estimates from the difference-in-differences models and the first expenditure function, we calculate changes in district costs associated with charter school entry and compare them with the charter school efficiency effects from the second expenditure function.====Our findings are consistent with research showing that charter schools increase the proportion of students in traditional public schools who come from low-income families and who have disabilities. We also find that the entry of charter schools is associated with a decrease in the proportion of students who have limited English proficiency in traditional public schools. However, only the changes in students receiving free lunch caused by charter schools are large enough to have a statistically significant impact on per pupil costs. Overall, charter schools increase the minimum per pupil amount a typical sized district needs to spend for a given level of performance by 7.5 percent in the short-run and by 7.1 percent in the long-term.====Our results also suggest that efficiency gains in response to charter school entry decrease the per pupil amount districts spend to achieve a given level of outcomes by 3.6 in the short-term and 6.8 percent in the longer-run. This finding is consistent with literature showing that charter school entry leads to improved service provision in traditional public schools. Comparing cost increases and efficiency gains, charter schools increase traditional public schools’ expenditure per pupil used to reach a given performance level by 3.9 percent in the first four years and by 0.25 percent five and more years after charter school entry. Thus, on average, charter schools increase costs in the short-term but increases in efficiency offset these cost increases in the long run.====We further find that school districts with high levels of charter schools enrollments, relative to districts with small charter school enrollments, experience smaller increases in costs and larger efficiency gains leading to net reductions in the expenditures used to achieve a given level of outcomes of 4.6 percent in the first four years after charter school entry and 11.6 percent in later years.====Our findings contribute to the existing literature in the following ways. First, we provide additional evidence that charter schools impact enrollment and student composition in traditional public schools. Second, our study establishes, theoretically and empirically, that charter school programs can influence the cost and efficiency of traditional public schools districts, and that both of these factors have to be considered in estimating the net effect of charter schools on spending in traditional public schools. Third, we develop an approach that combines methods from program evaluation and cost function literature to estimate the effects of charter schools on school district expenditures—clarifying both the strengths and limitations of the approach. Finally, we provide evidence that the entry of charter schools in New York has both increased both per pupil cost of education and efficiency in traditional public school districts.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows.

During this period, governments began to enact major changes in public policy. Ethiopia led the way with an ambitious program to introduce mother tongue instruction (MTI) into primary school for roughly half of all primary school students in the country. This was followed by the 1995 nationwide removal of school fees for grades one through ten. In the 1990s, similar programs were introduced in Malawi and Uganda (Deininger, 2003, World Bank, 2009), and since 2000 at least 15 additional countries implemented their own free primary education (FPE) reforms. In the year following the introduction of these reforms, grade one enrollment increased an average of 25% over the previous year, while the average class size also increased 10%. The increase in crowding prompts concerns that these policies have the potential to exacerbate the trade-off between schooling and learning that is prevalent in many parts of the world (Hillman, Jenkner, 2004, Pritchett, 2001, Pritchett, Banerji, Kenny, 2013, Tiongson, 2005, Watkins, 2013). However, a recent systematic review by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie - Snilstveit et al. 2016) found that there is currently insufficient evidence to form a conclusion regarding how the removal of school fees may impact school attendance and learning. This paper addresses this issue by using a difference-in-differences framework with a continuous treatment measure that can be constructed using data that are contained in most household datasets. A measure of each reform is used to separately identify the distinct impacts on schooling and learning, and to evaluate the overall progress generated by Ethiopia’s ambitious education program.====Building on the conceptual framework of Lucas, Mbiti, 2012a, Lucas, Mbiti, 2012b, this paper uses a difference-in-differences approach that combines geographic variation generated by pre-reform levels of schooling with temporal variation defined by the timing of the policy changes to identify the impact of each reform. Applying this method, the effect of the introduction of mother tongue instruction and the removal of school fees in Ethiopia is examined by combining three different post-reform data sources: the 2007 round of the census, the 2005, 2011 and 2016 rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and the 2016 Living Standards and Measurement Study (LSMS). The removal of school fees led to an estimated increase of between 0.72 and 1.05 years of schooling. However, the introduction of MTI had the opposite impact, reducing years of school completed by between 0.18 and 0.28 years with no concurrent impact on literacy. A joint measure of the two reforms finds the net effect of the two programs is roughly 0.7 additional year of schooling, and most importantly yields evidence that each additional year of school leads to an increase in literacy (11.8 p.p.), knowledge of family planning (6.6 p.p.), knowledge of HIV (5.3 p.p), and the likelihood of knowing an HIV testing location (6 p.p.).====The construction of a continuous treatment measure generated by pre-reform variation in schooling is necessary to identify the impact of national policy changes in a setting without a discrete jump in schooling. In developed settings, identification strategies are generally more straightforward. The literature often utilizes a dichotomous reform indicator variable denoting one cohort as pre-reform and the next cohort post-reform, such as studies in Norway (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2008, Monstad, Propper, Salvanes, 2008), Italy (Fort, 2012), the U.K. (Clark, Geruso, & Royer, 2014), Sweden (Holmlund, Lindahl, Plug, 2011, Lundborg, Nilsson, Rooth, 2014), and the U.S. using the exact day of birth (McCrary & Royer, 2011). In developing settings, due to issues such as late school entry and high repetition rates, the ability to use a discrete cutoff is largely removed, although Aguero and Bharadwaj (2014) and Grepin and Bharadwaj (2015) showed it is possible in Zimbabwe. The more common approach has been to exploit two separate dimensions of variation, the timing of the reform and geographic variation in the implementation. For example, Duflo, 2001, Duflo, 2004 used variation in the construction of primary schools to examine the relationship between education and wages in Indonesia, and Osili and Long (2008) exploited similar variation in Nigeria to study how education impacts fertility.====When evaluating national policy changes such as an FPE reform that removes compulsory school fees in all primary schools across the country, there is no geographic variation in the implementation of the reform itself. Previous work examining the impact of malaria eradication exploited pre-intervention levels of the disease to generate variation in the expected impact of the anti-malaria programs (Bleakley, 2010, Lucas, 2010, Lucas, 2013). The benefit to this type of strategy is that it does not depend on variation in the implementation, but the geographic component of the variation is determined solely on the pre-intervention characteristics of each geographic district. Lucas, Mbiti, 2012a, Lucas, Mbiti, 2012b applied a similar strategy using variations in pre-reform grade completion rates to generate geographic variation. They examined the effect of the 2003 FPE reform in Kenya on gender differences in schooling and sorting into private schools in 2007. This analysis identified the effect of the reform’s intensity by using the concept that Kenyan districts with more students dropping out prior to taking their post-grade eight exam have more room for improvement following the removal of school fees. This paper adopts the central concept of this approach, that the expanded access to schooling is expected to have a greater impact on areas that have relatively lower initial levels of schooling.====In addition to the removal of school fees, Ethiopia also introduced instruction in local languages in a number of regions across the country. It is argued that learning one’s mother tongue language, the language a child grows up speaking in his/her household, promotes classroom participation and self-confidence (Bamgbose, 1984, Benson, 2000, Trudell, 2005), improves literacy (Lucas, McEwan, Ngware, & Oketch, 2014), and future knowledge of the national or foreign language previously used for instruction (Benson, 2000, Brock-Utne, 2007, Taylor, von Fintel, 2016). In support of these conclusions, cross-sectional work at the country-level found significant evidence that distance of the local language to the official language in a country has a large negative impact on human capital and health (Laitin & Ramachandran, 2016). Rigorous RCT interventions that focus on introducing MTI into the classroom have also found significant impacts on test scores in Cameroon (Laitin, Ramachandran, & Walter, 2017) and Uganda (Kerwin & Thornton, 2018). In Uganda, Kerwin and Thornton (2018) took the important step of also building a cost efficient program that could be expanded to a larger scale implementation. With only small changes to the implementation procedure the positive results of the original RCT did not persist. This change in outcome highlights the potential value of evaluating large-scale policy changes outside of the constant observation of the RCT setting.====No consensus regarding the best practice for the language of instruction in sub-Saharan Africa has been established, this is in part due to the relative lack of analysis of large-scale policy changes on the topic. Studying 1955 changes in the language of instruction in South Africa, Eriksson (2014) found a positive impact on literacy and schooling. Specifically relevant to this study is work examining the impact of MTI policies in Ethiopia. Seid (2016) and Ramachandran (2017) both employed a difference-in-differences framework, triple-difference in the case of Ramachandran (2017), with a dichotomous definition of treatment and a 1994 introduction of the policy change. These studies found a positive impact of the MTI program on schooling and learning. However, from interviews with Ministry of Education officials and regional education bureaus, Zenebe Gebre (2014) found that a vast majority of the eligible population was exposed to the new languages of instruction between 1991 and 1993. This change in timing is largely verified by Boothe and Walker (1997). With this new evidence, Zenebe Gebre (2014) found a contrasting conclusion, that MTI had a negative impact on enrollment and schooling.====This paper finds evidence that the increased schooling generated by the removal of school fees leads to significant increases in learning across a number of health related measures from the DHS. This increase in learning is present even without any evidence of increased reading, suggesting that the additional schooling generated by the FPE reform improves student’s ability to retain information. The negative impact of MTI on schooling is found to be concentrated in areas of the country that chose not only to switch the language of instruction, but also to switch from an Amharic script to Roman script and introduce the newly translated material into the classroom within a year. Prior to this reform, local languages had not widely used the Roman script. The same negative impact was not found in regions of the country that switched languages, but continued to use the Amharic script. This finding is consistent with the conclusion from Kerwin and Thornton (2018) that small details in the implementation of local language instruction can have significant impact on the program’s effectiveness. Additionally, although the introduction of MTI has a negative impact on schooling, the program does not reduce literacy. Like Lucas et al. (2014), these findings suggest that a more consistent language of instruction could lead to gains in learning even with problematic implementation. This study adds to the literature by examining the impact of two major changes to education policy in Ethiopia from the early 1990s. It is the first to identify the impact of the introduction of FPE, and uses detailed information on the implementation of MTI that is verified across two independent sources.",Schooling with learning: The effect of free primary education and mother tongue instruction reforms in Ethiopia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775716302163,April 2019,2019,Research Article,160.0

We estimate the impact of public school closings in Philadelphia on student achievement and behavioral outcomes. While school closures had no effect on the average achievement of displaced students, achievement increased among displaced students attending higher-performing schools following closure. The achievement of students attending receiving-schools, however, was negatively affected by the receipt of displaced students. School absences increased significantly for displaced students following closure. We also find that the achievement of displaced and receiving-school students declined as the fraction of displaced students attending a receiving-school increased, and displaced students missed more days of school and received more suspension days the farther they traveled to their new school following closure. These findings suggest that the academic and behavioral consequences of closing urban schools depend on the school settings displaced and receiving-school students experience in the wake of closures.","Urban school districts across the United States have increasingly relied on closing traditional public schools as a strategy to address declining student enrollment, fiscal constraints, poorly maintained school infrastructure, and low academic performance (Brummet, 2014, Engberg et al., 2012, Steiner, 2009, Sunderman and Payne, 2009). Between 2000 and 2010, at least 70 urban school districts closed an average of 11 traditional public schools (Engberg et al., 2012).==== Critics of school closings point to the adverse influence student mobility has on academic achievement and school performance (de la Torre & Gwynne, 2009), and that these mobility costs are concentrated among economically disadvantaged and minority students (Hanushek et al., 2004, Raudenbush et al., 2011). Student mobility has also been shown to lead to negative behavioral outcomes for students, including increased school absences and higher levels of misconduct (Engec, 2006, Rumberger, 2003, Simpson and Fowler, 1994, Wood et al., 1993). Others contend that closing under-performing schools may benefit displaced students if they attend new schools with better academic environments. The efficacy of closing schools may also depend on the concentration of displaced students that enroll in receiving-schools following closure. Policies that lead to the closing of the lowest-performing schools, for example, may result in negative spillover effects on students in higher-performing schools that receive displaced students.====The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) is among the largest districts in the U.S. and provides an excellent setting for understanding the impact of urban school closings. Between the 2011–12 and 2012–13 school years, the SDP closed more than ten percent of its traditional public schools, which included the lowest-performing and most under-enrolled schools. We estimate the effect that closing these schools had on the academic achievement and behavioral outcomes of displaced students. We also estimate the effect school closings had on the achievement and behavioral outcomes of students attending schools that received displaced students in the year after closure. Finally, we assess whether the effects of closing schools varied by the school settings experienced by displaced and receiving-school students following closure.====Relying on a difference-in-differences strategy and student-level administrative data for SDP elementary and middle school students, we find that closing schools had no impact on the average academic achievement of displaced students. However, achievement improved significantly for displaced students who enrolled in higher-performing schools and schools with a lower concentration of displaced students following closure. In contrast, students attending schools that received displaced students experienced a significant decline in academic achievement; these negative spillover effects persisted for two years after receiving displaced students, and the decline in achievement was greatest for students attending schools with the highest concentration of displaced students.====We also find that school closures adversely affected the behavioral outcomes of displaced students and their receiving-school peers. For displaced students, school closures significantly increased the days of school missed due to absences, and the effect of closures on absences was greater for displaced students attending schools with a higher concentration of displaced students. School absences and out-of-school suspension days increased as the distance displaced students traveled to their new schools increased. Finally, for students attending schools that received displaced students, school absences and out-of-school suspension days were greatest among students attending receiving-schools with the highest concentration of displaced students.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes the extant literature on school closings. We then describe the setting in which schools in Philadelphia were identified and selected for closure. Next, we describe the student-level data, and present evidence on the patterns of student enrollment following school closure.

We proxy occupational knowledge with mandatory visits to job information centers (JICs) in Germany while still attending school. Exogenous variation in the establishment of JICs makes it possible to estimate intention-to-treat effects in a difference-in-differences setup. Combining survey data with the data on JIC openings allows for detecting whether individuals benefited from the comprehensive information service. The results suggest that individuals who went to school in administrative districts with a JIC have higher educational attainments, experience educational upward mobility, and have a smoother transition to the labor market.","In many industrialized countries, students have to decide early in life which educational track to follow and which job to learn. These educational and occupational choices are often made under uncertainty. Students may be uncertain about their own abilities and tastes, skills needed for particular work, local labor market conditions, future job prospects, or earnings profiles. A key ingredient for making a well-informed decision is the availability of job-related information or, in other words, occupational knowledge. While there are different ways to retrieve job-related information privately, in many countries, it is publicly provided in the form of occupational education in classrooms or information facilities outside schools.====The aim of the present paper is to study the effects of introducing a comprehensive and nationwide occupational information program on individuals' educational choices and labor market outcomes by opening job information centers in Germany. Among educators and policy makers, there is typically little doubt about the general societal value of publicly providing job-related information (OECD, 2004). However, research to date has been limited in estimating potential benefits of occupational information programs. In particular, there is hardly any evidence on interventions at the national level. We make use of a comprehensive and nationwide reform of occupational education in Germany, namely, the establishment of job information centers (JICs) at different times in different regions. JICs provide young people with very detailed and comprehensive information on occupations, employment and income prospects, local labor market conditions and educational pathways. Exogenous variation in the location and timing of opening of JICs allows causal inference in a difference-in-differences framework. We analyze outcomes of students at different points over the life-course, in particular education and educational mobility, job search and job matching as well as labor market attachment.====Theory suggests several reasons why providing comprehensive job information in general–and the availability of JICs in particular–might influence individuals' choices and outcomes. First, providing information about the number and types of occupations and job vacancies available to young people in their region of residence might improve the quality of the match between workers and companies (Miller, 1984). Similarly, providing information about job prospects and future earnings profiles may lead to efficiency gains if young individuals are more likely to find an occupation that matches their skills and interests (Borghans, Golsteyn, & Stenberg, 2015). Third, job counseling might help students to make choices that are less affected by their parents,==== prevailing gender roles or individuals' perception of their own identity (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Favara, 2012). Fourth, recent empirical studies suggest that educational choices are influenced by students' expectations about their economic returns to educational fields (Papay et al., 2011, Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2011, Zafar, 2011). Thus, there is reason to believe that job market knowledge acquired through visiting a JIC might alter students' expectations and, as a result, have an impact on their educational choices and labor market outcomes.====We are able to study the effect of the provision of job information on short-term (e.g., educational attainment of secondary schooling, educational upward mobility), medium-term (e.g., labor market outcomes in the first five years after entering the labor market) and long-term outcomes (e.g., geographic mobility 15–20 years after entering the labor market). We expect the following effects: the information treatment reduces the importance of family and community background on educational choices of the individuals, for example by encouraging young people from low-education backgrounds to choose higher education paths than their parents and/or role models within their social environment. Thus, we expect an increase in the probability of finishing a higher school track and overall higher educational upward mobility. In the medium-term (after the treatment), the information provision might improve the match between workers and companies and thus should reduce job search duration and the share of involuntary job changes. As a third proxy for quality of job match, we measure geographic mobility or, to be more precise, the absence of the latter. We assume that individuals prefer to stay in their known environment. Thus, the better the (local) job match, the higher the probability of staying in the same region. In the long run, we expect that the information retrieved via the job information center visit should lead to more stable employment relations, since expectations of individuals potentially better match the real profiles of specific occupations within the firms. This should lead to both higher employment and less unemployment.====This study uses quasi-experimental evidence on young people from different types of schools and with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. Unlike other studies, we are able to estimate effects for an entire country. Thus, we complement experimental studies based on university student populations (Booij et al., 2012, Wiswall and Zafar, 2015) or students from high schools in one city (Oreopoulos & Dunn, 2013). Another important contribution is that we examine the effects of information provision that is very detailed and comprehensive, since job information centers provide information media on hundreds of different occupations, vocational training and apprenticeships, higher education, job descriptions, earnings and employment prospects, and information about the local labor market. Note that the present study estimates the impact of a bundle of information (rather than the effect of one particular type of information). For the analyzed setting, this is a benefit rather than a limitation, since, from a policy perspective, it is hard to imagine an active policy information program that provides individuals with only one specific type of information (i.e., educational requirements for a particular occupation) without also informing them about the earnings potential, or the number of apprenticeships available in the local labor market.====Our empirical estimates suggest that the availability of a job information center causes a large and significant increase in the likelihood of experiencing upward educational mobility and improves the chances of acquiring the highest general school degree of individuals who started at low- or intermediate-track schools. For instance, the likelihood of experiencing upward educational mobility increases by approximately 8–12 percentage points among students in low- or intermediate-track schools. Individuals who went to school in an administrative district with a JIC are also less likely to become unemployed or to involuntarily lose their job at the beginning of their labor market career. Furthermore, the estimates appear to indicate that visiting a JIC improves job matching. These findings are robust to the inclusion of various explanatory variables, for various subsamples, and different time trends.====In the difference-in-differences research design, a key assumption for identification is that there are no contemporaneous shocks or changes on the district level that are correlated with the establishment of JICs and the various outcome measures. We present detailed evidence to verify this assumption. First, we present graphical evidence supporting the common trend assumption for various educational and labor market variables using rich administrative data. Second, we estimate survival analysis models showing that the timing of JIC openings is uncorrelated with contemporaneous or pre-determined variables on the district level. The estimates show that the timing of JICs’ opening is not statistically significantly correlated with initial educational and labor market characteristics. For example, JICs were not more likely to open sooner in districts with a high youth unemployment rate, or in regions with a high proportion of educated people. Furthermore, we find no empirical evidence that pre-existing trends in education or local labor markets are correlated with the timing of JICs’ opening.====Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting that information programs are effective at improving individuals' educational choices, in particular among students at low- and intermediate-track schools. Exploiting variation across regions and over time enables us to measure general equilibrium effects. As such, we complement the local estimates from randomized experiments among upper school students from selected colleges or universities (Booij et al., 2012, Oreopoulos and Dunn, 2013, Wiswall and Zafar, 2015).",Occupational knowledge and educational mobility: Evidence from the introduction of job information centers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718301079,April 2019,2019,Research Article,162.0

The theory of action behind the bonus program is simple: SRBs result in greater numbers of highly effective teachers at participating schools, who subsequently drive larger student gains than the teachers who would otherwise fill their positions. To examine whether students in high ==== schools benefit from retention of highly effective teachers, we use differences in eligibility for schools to offer bonuses and the discrete timing of the program in a matched sample, difference-in-differences framework. Results indicate that schools who offered SRBs saw greater test score gains in subsequent years, especially on state reading exams.","High-quality teachers are one of the most important school-based components in the production of student achievement; however, value-added studies of teacher effectiveness consistently find large variations in teacher classroom performance (Aaronson, Barrow, & Sander, 2007; Hanushek, 2011, Kane et al., 2008, Rockoff, 2004, Sanders and Rivers, 1996). While the majority of test score gaps along the lines of income and race are attributable to outside-of-school factors and are evident very early in life (e.g., Fryer and Levitt, 2004, Heckman, 2006), the distribution of effective teachers represents a potentially important equity-promoting lever that is disposed to policy intervention. Top-performing teachers, defined as teachers whose value-added estimates are at or above the 95th percentile, produce as much as three times the achievement growth in students when compared to low-performing teachers (Hanushek, 2011). Simulations further indicate that the systematic reassignment of highly-effective teachers to low performing schools could radically reduce across-school achievement gaps (Chetty, Friedman, & Rockoff, 2014a).====Research has equally established that minority and low-income students—particularly those in schools with high concentrations of poverty or racial minorities—are more likely to be staffed by teachers graduating from less competitive colleges, teachers instructing out-of-field, and novice teachers (Clotfelter et al., 2011, Iatarola and Stiefel, 2003, Lankford et al., 2002; Podgursky, Monroe, & Watson, 2004; Podgursky & Springer, 2011). For these reasons, a strong body of research has sought to better understand what makes highly qualified or effective teachers decide to stay or leave a school, or exit the profession altogether, with particular emphasis on schools’ racial composition, disparities in working conditions, the distribution of economically disadvantaged students, and compensation (Boyd et al., 2008, Clotfelter et al., 2011, Feng, 2010, Feng et al., 2010, Scafidi et al., 2007, Steele et al., 2015).====In recent years, a growing number of states and districts have implemented various forms of financial incentives to shift the performance distribution of teachers within and across schools. One class of these incentives - selective retention bonuses (SRBs) —are a frequently considered strategy to curtail attrition of targeted groups such as highly-rated teachers, or teachers of hard-to-staff subject areas like math and science. SRBs differ from conventional pay-for-performance plans by systematically targeting the composition (increasing the average level of teacher effectiveness) and continuity (reducing the amount of unwanted turnover) of a school's faculty. Several studies have found relatively promising results when estimating the effects of financial incentives’ capacity to promote retention at high-need, low-performing schools (e.g., Clotfelter et al., 2008, Glazerman et al., 2013, Springer et al., 2016). However, extant literature tells us relatively little about the impact of SRBs on their ultimate goal: improving student academic outcomes.====This study bridges a gap in the literature by estimating the effect of a SRB policy for high-rated teachers on low-performing schools’ ability to elevate student test scores. The theory of action behind SRBs is simple: SRBs result in greater numbers of highly effective teachers at participating schools, who subsequently drive more measurable student learning than the teachers who would otherwise fill their positions. To examine whether this conceptualization holds true, this study uses rich longitudinal administrative data from the State of Tennessee, where a retention bonus program for highly effective teachers in Priority Schools (high poverty schools identified as having the lowest test scores in the state) was recently implemented, and was found to stem unwanted attrition.====The estimated effects of Tennessee's SRB program were modest in magnitude, increasing the likelihood of a highly-effective teacher returning by roughly 20 percent. High-performing teachers represented less than 25 percent of the faculty in Priority Schools. However, the radical differences between the retained Level 5 teachers’ estimated effectiveness and that of their likely replacements results in the equivalent of a profound intervention. As reported in Springer et al. (2016), the 321 teachers==== who accepted bonuses and remained in their schools had overall teacher effectiveness ratings more than a full standard deviation above the state average, and the average of teachers hired by Priority Schools was roughly two-thirds of a standard deviation below the state average. Thus, for every teacher retained as a result of the one-time bonus, students taught by that teacher experienced an increase in teacher effectiveness of 1.7 standard deviations.====There are several other pathways through which SRBs might improve school-level performance. Recent studies have found significant positive effects on student achievement through a number of factors, such as positive peer effects on colleagues who work with highly effective teachers (Jackson and Bruegmann, 2009, Sun et al., 2017) and a reduction of teacher churn within and across schools (Redding, 2017, Ronfeldt et al., 2013).==== For these reasons, we hypothesize that schools who distribute retention bonuses for highly effective teachers will elevate student test score gains by increasing access to effective instruction, faculty stability, and positive peer effects on colleagues.====In the sections that follow, we first describe the specific SRB policy context in Tennessee, then review background literature on selective retention bonuses. Next, we describe the data sources, construction of the analytic sample, and the primary strategy for estimating the impacts of the bonus program. Finally, we present results for both student achievement and changes in teacher composition by subject area, followed by a discussion of policy implications of the findings with respect to the following research question: To what extent do students’ test scores at low-performing schools benefit from offering retention bonuses to highly effective teachers?",Selective retention bonuses for highly effective teachers in high poverty schools: Evidence from Tennessee,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775717304971,February 2019,2019,Research Article,163.0

These tests have real consequences: their results feed into accountability systems, which have been used for more than a decade to hold schools and districts accountable for their students’ learning. We examine the rollout of computer-based testing in Massachusetts over 2 years to investigate test mode effects. Crucial to the ","Computer-based testing is rapidly spreading across the assessment landscape. There are significant advantages of using computer-based tests (CBTs) to assess student achievement, such as more flexibility in test item design, access to a large repository of items, reduced scope for cheating, and faster turnarounds for score receipt (Parhizgar, 2012). In addition, computer literacy is essential in the workplace, for both finding jobs and succeeding at them (Murray, Sherburn, & Pérez, 2007). Not surprisingly, many national and international assessments are in the process of moving online or have already done so, including the ACT, PISA, and NAEP.==== The two consortia of Common Core–based tests that deliver K-12 testing, Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and Smarter Balanced, are also in the process of transitioning to online testing.==== And as of 2016, nearly two dozen states administer K-12 state assessments online (Farmer, 2016).====Anecdotal reports from the initial implementation of PARCC in several states have revealed lower scores for students who take PARCC online.==== Examples abound: in Ohio, a survey of districts found that 85% of districts administering PARCC on paper received an “A” grade, compared to only 17% of online districts.==== In Illinois, 43% of students who took PARCC on paper scored proficient or above in ELA, compared to 36% of students who took the test online. In Maryland, middle school ELA students in Baltimore County scored worse on the online test after controlling for student background and prior achievement.==== However, these observed differences could reflect pre-existing differences across students rather than inherent difficulty of online testing.====In this paper, we use the rollout of online PARCC in Massachusetts to investigate whether these findings are reflective of real differences in student achievement or of the causal effect of delivery mode, which we refer to as test mode effects. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of PARCC test mode effects conducted with multiple years of data across an entire state. In 2015, some districts began transitioning to the PARCC assessment. These districts had the choice of using the paper or online version of the test, and nearly half administered the online format in 2015 or 2016. As described below, three districts allowed schools to make their own decisions about adopting online testing, so our estimation strategy uses school-level variation in online testing rather than district level. Crucially, the PARCC is not computer adaptive and PARCC describes the content of the online test as “significantly overlapped” by the paper version's content (Pearson, 2016).====Using school-level difference-in-differences models and regressions that control for prior student achievement, we find that students administered an online exam score systematically lower than if they had taken the test on paper. In particular, students taking the online version of PARCC scored about 0.10 standard deviations lower in math and about 0.25 standard deviations lower in English language arts (ELA) than students taking the paper version of the test. After several robustness checks, we reject the most plausible competing explanations for these findings. We find no evidence of differential pre-treatment trends in test scores in online schools. We also find no evidence of an effect on science exams that were administered on paper for all schools, even those that switched to CBTs for math and ELA. Finally, we find that the effects cannot be explained by the switch to the PARCC assessment: schools that switched to CBTs in the year after their switch to PARCC tests experienced declines in achievement that are nearly identical to those that switched during the first year of PARCC testing.====Our estimates of mode effects in math and ELA represent extremely large changes in measured student learning: up to 5.3 months of learning in math and 11.0 months of learning in ELA in a 9 month school year.==== Our preferred estimates of the effects of online testing in the second year of administration suggest that mode effects for second-time test takers were about one third as large as the first year in math and about half as large in ELA. Student familiarity with online testing explains part of the reduction in effect size in both subjects, and we find some evidence of general improvements in student performance on the online ELA test. In addition, our exploration of the dynamic effects of online testing suggests that we are truly measuring a mode effect rather than an assessment transition effect. For example, we find substantial online test penalties for third grade students – taking PARCC for the first time – in both 2015 and 2016.====Second, we explore whether states that have fully moved to online testing should expect heterogeneity in test mode effects based on student background, which could cause test mode effects to be conflated with true differences in student achievement across subgroups. For instance, there may be systematic differences in students’ comfort level with CBTs depending on their access to computers in the home and at school. Low income and minority households are significantly less likely to have high speed internet connections (Richtel, 2012). Urban schools are also less likely to have computers with Internet access, making it more difficult to implement or practice with CBTs (Garland, 2012). While we find little systematic evidence of variation in treatment effects by student demographic group in math, we find that ELA mode effects are stronger for students at the bottom of the achievement distribution, for English language learners, and for special education students.====The differential between students’ online and paper based performance could have important consequences, not only for students themselves but also for their teachers, schools, and communities. For instance, standardized tests have a wide range of potential consequences for students, including identification for gifted and talented programs, consideration for special education programs, and being flagged for grade retention. Our findings on CBT transitions are also consequential beyond the impact on individual students in three important ways. First, in many states, the results of standardized assessments support teacher evaluation, school accountability determinations, student graduation, or the distribution of school resources. Second, families make residential location decisions in part based on measured performance of local schools (Black & Machin, 2011). Third, student test scores are frequently used as an outcome by researchers. Many of the large states frequently used to conduct education research, such as Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina, have recently administered both paper and CBTs simultaneously or plan to in the near future.==== These states are frequently sites of education research. Based on a search of papers using the I2 series JEL codes published in American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, or Journal of Public Economics between 2013 and 2017, of those listing a state in the abstract, 26% (5 of 19) reported one of these four states. The public K-12 systems in these four states alone contained nearly 7 million students in 2014–15, or approximately 13 percent of public school children in the United States.==== Failure to take into account mode effects may lead to biases in empirical analyses of education policies, especially for analyses of school-wide programs. For example, an analysis of a policy change in Massachusetts targeting schools that happened to adopt online testing during the same time frame could find negative effects even if the true policy effect were null or positive.",Is the pen mightier than the keyboard?

A unique dataset that links teacher quality to school characteristics, housing prices and characteristics, and Census data is used to estimate a difference-in-difference model to estimate the impact of the teacher quality release on housing prices. These results are then used to estimate the impact of the data release on residential and school ","For the first time in February 2012, the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) publicly released a list of individual value-added scores for thousands of its fourth through eighth grade public schoolteachers. Parents and stakeholders in NYC previously obtained school quality information from NYC DOE produced School Progress Reports, but they never had access to information measuring the impact of individual teachers on their students. This is important because these new data on school quality could impact consumer choices.====This teacher quality data release was not the first of its kind. In fact, many districts began supplementing traditional observation based teacher evaluations with value-added measures of teacher quality because of Race to the Top (RTTT) funding, which has focused more attention on the use of student achievement as a component of teacher quality. However, not all districts and states that have calculated teacher quality measures have made these data public, and there has been some controversy about the release of identifiable teacher data. The debate and discussion around teacher value-added has focused on issues of teacher privacy and whether or not it is a good measure of teacher quality, but has not focused on the potential consequences of the release on housing values and demographic shifts.====Research has shown that value-added scores provide unbiased estimates of teacher quality using parent and school characteristics that were not controlled for in traditional student growth estimates (Chetty, Friedman, & Rockoff, 2014). There is evidence that accountability data impacts housing choices (Black, 1999, Figlio and Lucas, 2004, June, Kane et al., 2003), but there has been limited research that investigates the impact of these data on housing prices and demographics. There is reason to believe that there are unintended consequences of the teacher quality data release, and this is the first paper that explores the effects of these data on residential and school demographics.====This paper investigates the effect of the release of teacher value-added scores on housing prices in New York City by using a newly-created data set that links teacher value-added scores to real estate prices in the city. While the movement from one district to another has been explored (Black, 1999, Figlio and Lucas, 2004, June) and in large districts that cover several metropolitan areas (Imberman & Lovenheim, 2015), the movement within one district within one large city has not been examined.====The advantage of this data set is that the information transmission effects can better be studied within one large district in one municipality, where other effects, such as city services, are held constant. In this sense, the data does not suffer problems associated with studying teacher quality information across school districts or municipalities where differences in property taxes, job opportunities, the housing market, crime rates, and demographics could confound measurement. Because of this, this study can analyze the demographic changes within school zones and provide evidence that the lower income neighborhoods were among the areas that were most impacted by the teacher quality release.====The first question that is investigated is as follows: did the value-added release, in fact, affect home prices? The answer appears to be “yes”; the results here suggest that home prices increased 3.7% with every ten percentage point increase in the weighted multi-year teacher quality average for elementary schools.==== Using a hedonic difference-in-differences model, the data suggest that the housing market responds significantly to the new information that was provided by the release of the teacher quality information, even when considering the school grades and other variables that may influence teacher quality measures. These results suggest that the highly debated release of teacher quality information may have large implications on housing choices and policy-makers should be cautious when releasing this information.====The second important contribution of this paper is to investigate the effects that the teacher value-added data release had on neighborhood and school composition. This paper finds that household sorting changes the demographics of neighborhoods in areas where there is high teacher quality. However, what is more interesting is that the largest increase in prices occurred in neighborhoods where the income level of the neighborhood before the release was in the lowest quartile. These neighborhoods were predominately African-American and Latino, less educated, in lower income classes, and had lower housing values.====In addition, school compositions have also changed in the areas with higher teacher quality. Schools with higher teacher quality saw an increase of free and reduced priced lunch students in schools that had a higher percentage of black and white students who were qualified for free or reduced priced lunch.====These findings have important implications for the information-related aspect of school choices for parents. If valued-added measures have such a large effect, it suggests that other indicators of school quality represent imperfect or noisy measures. While this paper does not directly address why there is such imperfect information, my investigation into how this new influence affected neighborhood and school demographics suggests that those parents with the greatest financial means were most likely to exploit this new information.====The policy implications of the value-added release show that the release of information might in fact hurt the very people such information was designed to help. The lowest income families are most likely in need of such data because they lack the time and resources to acquire this information by other means. In addition, urban education policy needs to come to grips with the fact that when there are many elementary schools within a district, information about the quality of the school appears to still remain a barrier to school improvement. The charter school movement, for example, was started to create competition with public schools, but if new information has dramatic effects on real estate prices, it suggests that any policy designed to improve school quality might in fact not have very much impact if information acquisition remains difficult or noisy. And lastly, education policy is not independent of the real estate markets; if urban education policies are designed to improve educational outcomes of low-income residents, then housing affordability across neighborhoods needs to be part of the policy-equation. How can school choice work if low-income families find they can no longer afford to live in a neighborhood with high-quality schools?====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section reviews the relevant literature on school quality and its impact on housing choices. Section 3 describes the data used in the models presented in Section 4. Then, Section 5 discusses the results in four parts: (1) how the data release impacted housing prices, (2) the differences in how housing prices were impacted by neighborhood, (3) neighborhood demographic changes as a result of the teacher quality release, and (4) school demographic changes as a result of the teacher quality release.

Using administrative data from the University System of Georgia, I investigate the effects of recent consolidations on educational quality and efficiency. Comparing cohorts matriculating after consolidations to similar cohorts at non-consolidated institutions reveals that consolidation increases retention rates and the fraction of students graduating on-time with four-year degrees. Spending data and conversations with USG administrators suggest that increased spending on academic support (advising), made possible by ==== in student services, are likely responsible for the gains.","For years, public higher education systems have responded to fiscal pressures with consolidations. In 1974, the University of Wisconsin system combined with the Wisconsin State Universities system to avoid program duplication and contain growing costs (University of Wisconsin, 2016). In 1995, Minnesota restructured its public system of state colleges, community colleges, and technical colleges to improve efficiency (Healy, 1996, Shecter, 1996). Other states to consolidate their state university, state college, or community college systems include Kentucky (1997), Kansas (1965–2008), Alabama (2015), Louisiana (2015), Texas (2015), and Georgia (2013–2018) (Diamond, 2013, Hamilton, 2013, Marcus, 2013, Mytelka, 2015, Ohman, 2011, Warren, 2008). Most recently, in October 2017, University of Wisconsin officials announced a plan to merge all two-year campuses with four-year institutions, and the President of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities System announced that the state’s 12 community colleges will be consolidated into a single community college, a plan prompted by the state’s dire financial situation (Megan, 2017, Savidge, 2017).====It is unsurprising that many state systems are implementing structural changes to improve efficiency since fiscal pressures have only intensified in recent years. Between 2003 and 2013, state appropriations declined dramatically with public research institutions receiving 28% less funding per student in 2013 than 2003 and public community colleges receiving 9% less. As of the 2016 fiscal year, state appropriations in all but five states were still below pre-recession levels (State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, 2016). In the midst of lower levels of state appropriations, all sectors of the higher education market have increased spending in real terms on education and related expenses. Public community colleges increased spending by 4.3%, and public research universities increased spending by 11.9%. Consequently, net tuition revenue has constituted an increased share of spending (Desrochers & Hurlburt, 2016), and state policymakers have identified consolidations as one way to improve efficiency.====Consolidations are an attractive response to increases in spending due to potential economies of scale. A merged institution can operate with a single admissions or registrar office and consolidate libraries, health services, and athletics programs. Additionally, a merged institution can cut its administrative payroll by retaining fewer administrators to oversee larger institutions. For example, Connecticut policymakers predict that combining 12 existing community colleges will save the system $28 million, primarily through replacing 12 separate community college presidents, chief financial officers, and provosts with a single vice chancellor, a single provost, and a single chief financial officer (Megan, 2017). However, potential savings are not limited to administrative spending. Instruction may also have economies of scale if institutions can consolidate program offerings, a goal of both the Minnesota mergers in the 1990s and the Georgia mergers in 2013 (Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, Healy, 1996).====Mergers will increase the productivity of institutions if there are overall cost savings that do not decrease quality or quality improvements that do not increase overall costs. However, the effect of mergers on productivity is theoretically ambiguous due to potential disruption effects of reorganization and uncertainty surrounding cost savings (Healy, 1996, Wieder, Woodhouse). Administrators who oppose consolidations in Georgia and South Carolina have cited challenges in combining institutions with dissimilar missions (Rivard, 2013, Rivard, 2015, Shain, 2014, University System of Georgia, 2013)), and students have worried about how mergers will affect their educational experiences (Rivard, 2013, Rivard, 2015). Little evidence exists to inform the debate since effects of college and university mergers have rarely been rigorously investigated.====In this paper, I examine five recent mergers within the University System of Georgia to provide the first quantitative evidence on the quality effects of consolidations in a public US higher education system. These mergers are typical of many public consolidations in that administrators have predicted fiscal savings through economies of scale and plan to redirect savings to spending that will increase student attainment. In fact, the USG Board of Regents has adopted increasing educational attainment as its first guiding principle for assessing potential consolidations (University System of Georgia, 2011a). USG combined eight institutions into four in 2013 and subsequent mergers followed in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.====Using a differences-in-differences methodology, I compare student retention and graduation outcomes for cohorts enrolling just before and just after consolidation relative to cohorts at similar non-affected institutions in the USG. Rich administrative data allow me to observe student-level covariates such as demographics, financial aid receipt, and measures of pre-college preparation which allow me to account for cohort composition changes which could otherwise bias estimates of merger effects.====My evidence indicates that the USG consolidations increased retention of first-time undergraduate students.==== The main estimates indicate that the mergers increased the probability that a student re-enrolled for a second year by 1.7 percentage points. Since 21% of students dropout after the first year, this represents an 8% decline in first-year dropout. I find no similar retention effects for partially treated cohorts (i.e., students who matriculated prior to consolidations but who were exposed to consolidations partway through their studies). Consolidations also increase the fraction of students pursuing a Bachelor’s degree who graduate within four years by 4 percentage points. Since only 14% of Bachelor’s degree students pre-consolidation finish on time, this corresponds to an 29% increase in on-time graduation.====I assess several potential mechanisms underlying these gains. The most obvious potential explanation is increased overall spending per student as prior work has established that increasing spending, especially on academic support, is an effective way for public institutions to increase postsecondary attainment (Deming & Walters, 2017). My point estimates, while imprecise, suggest that the retention gains did not come at the cost of overall increased spending per student. Instead, consolidations allowed affected institutions to shift spending from student services to academic support in such a way that overall spending was unaffected. Discussions with USG administrators reveal that the increase in academic support spending is likely reflective of the hiring of additional advising staff.====Even if consolidations increase productivity by improving student outcomes without increasing costs, it is not clear that they are welfare improving for students. It is possible that consolidations lead to higher tuition and fees for students through institutions exercising market power or charging for improved quality. However, I find no evidence that consolidated institutions increase prices by raising sticker prices or decreasing institutional grant aid. Taken as a whole, my results suggest that consolidations were beneficial for students and most likely reflect productivity improvements realized at the affected campuses.====To my knowledge, there is only one existing study assessing impacts of higher education mergers quantitatively. A 2014 working paper by Capuccinello and Bradley investigates the impacts of college mergers in the United Kingdom on dropout rates. They find that mergers early in their sample period reduced dropout risk while mergers later in the period increased risk. Since early mergers were voluntary and mergers in the later period resulted from government pressures to improve cost effectiveness, they conclude that involuntary mergers are the most likely to have adverse effects for students. By contrast, my results indicate that involuntary mergers in the U.S. can actually benefit students.====The question of how to most efficiently deploy state resources in financing higher education fits into a broader literature investigating the most efficient way to publicly provide goods and services. Previous work has investigated the quality and efficiency implications of K-12 school consolidations as well as whether there are economies of scale in providing police services (Beuchert, Humlum, Nielsen, & Smith, DeLuca, 2013, Finney, 1997, Gordon, Knight, 2008). Generally, these studies have found no evidence of economies of scale, and when consolidations have occurred, they have not improved quality. For instance, Beuchert et al. (2016) document that for primary schools in Denmark, consolidation has adverse effects on student test scores. The success of USG consolidations is notable because the student impacts are unusually promising.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides background on the recent consolidations in Georgia.

Using data on students admitted to Chinese colleges from 2005 to 2011, we characterize the general patterns of mismatch between colleges and students based on students’ scores on China’s National College Entrance Exam and find evidence of substantial overmatch and undermatch. Results from a generalized difference-in-differences model indicate that switching from the Boston mechanism to the Chinese parallel mechanism lowered the probability of mismatch by approximately 6%. Allowing students to submit their college preferences after learning their exam scores rather than before the exam reduced the probability of mismatch by 18%.","Student-college academic mismatch occurs when students’ academic ability could send them to higher quality colleges, but they end up at lower quality ones, or vice versa. This type of mismatch between colleges and students can be severe (Dillon, Smith, 2017, Smith, Pender, Howell, 2013), constraining the production of human capital and negatively affecting a society’s overall welfare. To improve the match between students and colleges, policy makers around the world have experimented with various policy tools, two of the most popular of which are matching mechanisms and information campaigns.====Many cities in the United States and abroad have implemented matching systems to assign students to schools at the K-12 level. These systems involve students submitting an ordered list of schools they would like to attend, schools giving priority to students in their admission offers, and an algorithm processing application lists and priorities to assign students to schools. Cities differ in their choices of matching mechanism. For instance, Charlotte, Seattle and Barcelona use the Boston mechanism (BM), while some cities, including New York and even Boston, have adopted versions of the Deferred Acceptance mechanism (DA).====Policy makers in a number of locations have also begun implementing information campaigns in efforts to help students make better informed college choices. Broadly speaking, information in this context includes knowledge of factors affecting students’ choice of college. For example, policy experiments in Charlotte, Ghana, and Montana have provided students with more information on school-level academic performance, admission standards, and student loan debts (Ajayi, Friedman, Lucas, 2017, Hastings, Weinstein, 2008, Stoddard, Urban, Schmeiser, 2017). Starting in 2003, China began giving high school students access to their college entrance exam scores before they submit their college choice list.====Despite the prevalence of these two types of policy reforms, debate continues as to which matching algorithm and which types of information are most useful for improving academic match. The theoretical literature has thoroughly studied the properties of different matching mechanisms, and lab experiments have been designed to validate these theoretical predictions (Abdulkadiroglu, 2013). However, empirical evidence on various mechanisms’ efficiency in reducing mismatch is scarce, and even less is known about the role of information in reducing academic mismatch in centralized admission processes.====To help address these gaps in the literature, in the current paper, we use administrative data from China to empirically examine the extent of academic mismatch and analyze how matching mechanisms and information campaigns can mitigate it. Using reforms to college admission processes that took place in China between 2005 and 2011 as natural experiments, we explore student-college matching outcomes under different matching and information policies. The current study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on how different centralized matching mechanisms affect student-college match using a large administrative dataset. Our results show that the Chinese parallel mechanism (CP), a simplified version of DA, can reduce academic mismatch between colleges and students compared with BM. Our findings also highlight the critical importance of information: Allowing students to learn about their test performance before they submit their college preference lists can substantially reduce mismatch.====China’s institutional background offers a few distinct advantages for our study. First, starting in the early 2000s, different provinces in China independently and gradually reformed their college admission policies. All provinces used BM to match students and colleges based on students’ scores on the National College Entrance Exam (NCEE) until 2001, when Hunan province began to experiment with CP. Other provinces have since followed Hunan in adopting CP. Similar phased-in features exist in information mechanism reforms. These reforms provide sufficient exogenous variation to allow us to examine the impacts of different matching and information mechanisms on student-college mismatch.====A second advantage is the availability of population data on students’ matching outcomes in China’s NCEE from 2005 to 2011. Our dataset includes all students who were admitted to college during the sample period (about 16 million students), with information about students’ test scores, the provinces where they took the test, and the colleges in which they enrolled. The population data provide much greater external validity than would otherwise be possible using experiments to evaluate student-college match quality under different matching mechanisms.====Finally, previous studies have estimated structural models to quantify welfare changes when switching from BM to DA (Agarwal, & Somaini, Calsamiglia, Fu, & Güell, Kapor, Neilson, Zimmerman, 2017). One challenge encountered in these studies is that it is difficult to define match quality, as the schools discussed in these contexts have preferences for many student characteristics. In China, colleges strictly prefer students with higher test scores, which makes it relatively straightforward to define mismatch between students and colleges.====We first describe patterns of matching between students and colleges in China. Following Bhattacharya and Mazumder (2011), we calculate transition probabilities for students’ scores and colleges’ ranking percentiles and find that there are sizeable probabilities that students with low exam scores being matched with high-ranking schools, and vice versa.====We then estimate a generalized difference-in-differences regression model to quantify the effects of different matching mechanisms and information policies on mismatch for students in first-tier colleges. Following Dillon and Smith (2017), if the gap between a student’s score percentile and a college’s quality percentile is greater than 20, we define it as a mismatch. Our results show that moving from BM to CP yields a 6% decrease in mismatch. Allowing students to submit their college preferences after receiving their NCEE scores rather than before they take the exam reduces mismatch by 18%. Combining the two policies achieves little additional reduction in mismatch. The use of CP coupled with post-score preference submission, currently the most popular policy bundle, achieves approximately a 25% improvement in matching efficiency.====We also test whether the policies’ effects differ by subgroup. For students in first-tier colleges, students from provinces with higher admission quotas, and students in the science track, submitting preferences after the release of scores is more effective in reducing mismatch than the move to CP. In comparison, for students in second- and third-tier colleges, students from provinces with lower admission quotas, and students in the humanities track, the introduction of CP is more effective at reducing mismatch than the reform to the timing of college preference submission. We argue that the relative sizes of the policy effects depend on the available choices of colleges and chances of admission for students in different subgroups. BM punishes students with lower chances of admission more heavily if they are not admitted to their first-choice college, so transitioning to CP is more effective in reducing mismatch among these students.====We conduct a few robustness checks to address concerns about endogeneity, nonacademic factors and our definition of mismatch. We find no differential pre-existing trends between early-reform and late-reform provinces, easing concerns about provinces self-selecting into policy reforms. Further, our estimation is robust to the use of alternative college ranking systems and the inclusion of students’ possible location preferences in the model. We also confirm that our findings do not change when we define mismatch using different thresholds.====Our paper contributes to a large body of literature on the matching mechanisms used in centralized matching processes. Since the seminal work by Abdulkadiroglu and Sönmez (2003), economists have studied matching systems intensively. (See a survey by Abdulkadiroglu (2013)). Chen and Kesten (2017) examined the theoretical properties of variants of DA in China. However, despite an abundance of theoretical studies, little empirical work has examined whether DA offers superior matching efficiency compared with BM in the real world. Most empirical studies have used experimental data to compare match quality under DA and BM (Calsamiglia, Haeringer, Klijn, 2010, Chen, Sönmez, 2006, Featherstone, Niederle, 2016, Pais, Pintér, 2008). The theoretical predictions in the literature are derived under strong assumptions, and most experimental studies follow these assumptions. For instance, participants in these experiments often have complete information on everyone’s ability and college preferences and are asked to choose from fewer than 10 colleges. As a result, such experiments fail to capture the complexity of real-world matching processes. High school graduates in China must compete with millions of peers and choose from thousands of colleges; they cannot fully predict everyone else’s ability and preferences. Therefore, it is important to empirically examine the matching issue using actual data. The only other study with a similar empirical context was conducted by Wu and Zhong (2014), who used data on one department in one elite university in China–a much less representative sample than is provided by our dataset.====The current paper also contributes to a smaller body of literature on the role of information in college admission processes and is among the first to evaluate how changes in available information in a matching system affect match quality. Many scholars have argued that students’ knowledge of their own ability and chances of college admission can be crucial to their admission outcomes. Kapor et al. (2017) concluded from survey data that many students have incorrect beliefs about their admission chances that affect their choice-making behavior and placement outcomes. Hoxby and Avery (2013) found that low-income students are much less likely than their higher-income peers to apply for selective colleges where they actually have a high probability of admission; they attributed this finding to students’ lack of information. However, no study that we know of has examined how changing the information available to students in matching systems could affect matching outcomes. China’s college admission reforms provide a unique policy experiment, enabling us to study how changing the availability of information about students’ exam scores and admission probabilities could improve match quality. Lien, Zheng, and Zhong (2016) and Lien, Zheng, and Zhong (2017) analyzed this issue theoretically and experimentally from an ex-ante fairness and efficiency perspective. In contrast, we focus on ex-post matching outcomes, making a beneficial addition to their findings. Additionally, prior studies have examined several types of information provided to students, including how information on college quality, financial aid, and the returns to higher education can influence college enrollment (Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, Sanbonmatsu, 2012, Hastings, Weinstein, 2008, Peter, Zambre, 2017, Stoddard, Urban, Schmeiser, 2017); our paper, meanwhile, examines a policy focused on providing information about students’ own ability, proxied by their scores on a standardized test. The only other study focused on a similar type of information was conducted by Foote, Schulkind, and Shapiro (2015), who examined the effects of students receiving information about their own college-readiness after taking the ACT on their subsequent college enrollment decisions. Our paper is distinct from theirs in two respects. First, Foote et al. (2015) studied students’ responses in intensive margins, while we focus on responses in extensive margins. Second, we study the role of information about students’ own ability in a centralized matching process, while they analyzed this issue in a decentralized admission process.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 documents the institutional background details; Section 3 introduces the data and describes the patterns of mismatch; Section 4 presents our empirical strategy and results, and Section 5 concludes by describing the implication of the study’s findings for research and policy.",Admission mechanisms and the mismatch between colleges and students: Evidence from a large administrative dataset from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718300712,February 2019,2019,Research Article,167.0

To study this relationship, I use two-sample two-stage least squares where I instrument for preschool participation using an indicator for the availability of universal preschool. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health and the Current Population Survey October Supplement, I find suggestive evidence that high-quality preschool participation disproportionately benefits children from low-education households. That is, for children from low-education households, I observe that preschool participation reduces the probability of ever having been diagnosed with behavioral or conduct problems, and requiring the use of special therapy. For children from high-education households, however, I observe that preschool participation increases the probability of ever having been diagnosed with behavioral or conduct problems, and requiring the use of special therapy.","It is the belief of many researchers and policymakers that a high-quality preschool education can improve a child’s long-term outcomes. Often, however, the only options available to low-income families are Head Start programs, many of which are oversubscribed. During the 1990s, Georgia and Oklahoma introduced Universal Preschool (UPK) programs with the intent of addressing this inequity by increasing access to a preschool education. These programs provide free and voluntary access to a preschool education for all four-year-old children statewide (i.e., all children who turn four on or before September 1), while satisfying most of the quality benchmarks set by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) (Barnett, Carolan, Fitzgerald, Squires, 2012, Barnett, Carolan, Squires, Clarke Brown, 2013, Barnett, Carolan, Squires, Clarke Brown, Horowitz, 2015).====Prior research routinely observes that UPK programs increase preschool participation (Cascio, Schanzenbach, 2013, Fitzpatrick, 2010) and that children exposed to these programs have higher test scores in kindergarten and the fourth grade (Fitzpatrick, 2008, Gormley, Gayer, 2005). While test scores can inform us about a child’s cognitive skill, they tend to provide little insight into a child’s non-cognitive skill (Heckman & Rubinstein, 2001). For that reason, other papers have used scores from teacher administered tests and evaluations to measure the effect of UPK on non-cognitive skill (Gormley, Gayer, 2005, Gormley, Philips, Newmark, Welti, Adelstein, 2011, Magnuson, Ruhm, Waldfogel, 2007). The literature has also looked at the effect of preschool participation on long-run outcomes such as criminal activity, high school completion, years of schooling, income, and life expectancy (Reynolds, Temple, Robertson, Mann, 2001, Rossin-Slater, Wüst, 2015, Smith, 2015).====My contribution to this literature is twofold. First, I exploit the introduction of UPK in Oklahoma and Georgia to study the effect of preschool participation on the probability of ever being diagnosed with certain intellectual and behavioral disorders in childhood. In this paper, the phrase intellectual and behavioral disorders is used to describe the following conditions: learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, behavioral or conduct problems, and requiring the use of special therapy.==== These outcomes can be thought of as proxies for cognitive and non-cognitive skill. For example, a learning disability diagnosis is arguably representative of a child’s ability to reason, remember, and problem solve (i.e., cognitive skill). Similarly, a behavioral or conduct problems diagnosis can be representative of a child’s softer skills such as their interactions with peers, and temperament (i.e., non-cognitive skill). In other words, the estimates presented in this paper provide valuable complementary evidence to the existing literature. Second, these diagnosis outcomes are for children between the ages of four and seventeen, allowing me to estimate the short- and potentially medium-term outcomes of high-quality preschool participation.====To examine the relationship between preschool participation and the probability of diagnosis, I use a two-sample two-stage least squares (TS2SLS) framework where I instrument for preschool participation using an indicator for UPK availability. More specifically, I use data from the October Supplement of the CPS to predict the probability of preschool participation at the age of four. I then use that predicted probability, and data from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), to estimate the effect of preschool participation on the outcomes of interest. Leveraging this strategy, I observe that preschool participation does not have a statistically significant effect on the probability of ever being diagnosed with the intellectual and behavioral disorders considered in this paper. Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006) provide a potential explanation for this observation. Their work suggests that the ability and engagement of parents plays an important role in the human capital accumulation of children. In other words, children from low-socioeconomic status (SES) households might benefit more from programs like UPK.====I, therefore, stratify my estimates by the highest level of educational attainment in the household, which serves as a proxy for the SES of the household.==== For children from low-education households, I observe that participating in UPK reduces the probability of ever being diagnosed with behavioral or conduct problems, and requiring the use of special therapy as a child by 7.3 and 13.5 percentage points, respectively. For children from high-education households, I observe that participating in UPK increases the probability of ever being diagnosed with behavioral or conduct problems, and requiring the use of special therapy as a child by 5.6 and 10.8 percentage points, respectively.====My analysis points to the following conclusion. Preschool participation disproportionately benefits children from low-education households by reducing their probability of diagnosis (i.e., an improvement in non-cognitive skill). The obvious explanation is that, for children from low-education households, UPK provides an environment that is of higher quality than their counterfactual. Conversely, for children from high-education households, the observed relationship between UPK and the probability of diagnosis suggests that their counterfactual environment is of higher quality than the treatment environment. This finding is consistent with Vandell, Belsky, Burchinal, Steinberg, and Vandergrift (2010), who find that high-quality early childhood care is associated with an increase in cognitive skill, and a decrease in externalizing behavior at age 15.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I briefly discuss UPK in Georgia and Oklahoma, as well as the related literature. In Section 3, I present my empirical strategy. In Section 4, I discuss the data, why I use TS2SLS, the observations excluded from the analysis, and how I define the instrumental variable. In Section 5, I present the first-stage and TS2SLS estimates. And finally, in Section 6, I provide some concluding remarks.",The effect of preschool participation on intellectual and behavioral disorder diagnoses: Evidence from surveys on children’s health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775717303667,February 2019,2019,Research Article,168.0

This paper evaluates the labor market effects of Virginia’s school-to-work vocational evaluation program, PERT. Using a unique panel data set containing more than a decade of labor market and service information, we provide the first-ever assessment of the long-term employment impacts of a transitioning program for youth with disabilities. Overall, the estimated effects are substantial: PERT has an estimated median quarterly rate of return of nearly 30%.","For youth with disabilities, the process of “transitioning” to adulthood, whether in terms of completion of school, entering the labor force, or household formation, has long been recognized to be an important public policy concern (Luecking & Wittenburg, 2009). This population, which comprises about one-eighth of American youth (NCES, 2001), has employment rates that are about 20 percentage points lower than their same-age non-disabled peers and employment spells about one-third shorter (Newman, Wagner, Cameto, & Knokey, Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Garza, & Levine). Also, with 1.3 million persons aged 14 to 30 on the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefit rolls (O’Day & Stapleton, 2009), the resulting long-term costs to society of caring for transitioning youth with disabilities are particularly high.====To combat unsuccessful transitions, a combination of legislation, public policy, and program initiatives have now been in place for more than a quarter century to establish a formal delivery system of training programs for transitioning youth with disabilities (Shandra & Hogan, 2008). The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 required that students with disabilities be provided a vocational assessment. Subsequently, the passage of amendments in 1990 to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandated transition planning for students in special education to begin no later than age 16 (Fabian, 2007). Most recently, on July 22, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) which, among other things, requires state vocational rehabilitation agencies to set aside at least 15% of their program funds to provide services to transitioning students with disabilities.====This paper evaluates the labor market effects of one state’s school-to-work vocational evaluation program, Virginia’s Post-Secondary Education and Rehabilitation Transition (PERT) program. Using a panel data set containing more than a decade of employment and service provision information for disabled youth who applied to receive vocational rehabilitation (VR) services from the Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services (DARS), we provide the first-ever assessment of the long-term (over five year) employment impacts of a transitioning program for youth with disabilities.==== While the short-run impacts of transitioning youth programs are certainly important, there are good reasons to think that the short- and long-run effects may differ. Long-run evaluations of intensive employment training for other at-risk populations – similar in many respects to the human capital development services provided transitioning youth with disabilities – imply different and, in some cases, much greater employment impacts in the period four to six years after assignment than in the initial three-year study period (Couch, 1992, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2018, Friedlander, Burtless, 1995, Hotz, Imbens, Klerman, 2006). This is especially true for transitioning youth where there is “considerable uncertainty about the persistence of training effects” (Hotz et al., 2006).====In addition to using the longitudinal labor market outcome data, we introduce an innovative model to evaluate the impact of the PERT program on the long-run labor market outcomes of transitioning youth with disabilities. PERT primarily serves as a screening program aimed at providing recipients individually-tailored VR and schooling services. As such, PERT participation enters the model in three distinct ways: a direct effect on employment and earnings, an indirect interaction effect with schooling, and an indirect interaction effect with VR services provided by DARS. To do this, we incorporate PERT in a modified version of the Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2018 multivariate discrete choice model where VR services are endogenously selected and allowed to have a direct effect on labor market outcomes. Importantly, this structural approach allows us to account for the complex interactions between PERT, schooling, and VR to model the endogenous selection of VR and PERT services and to fully assess counterfactual scenarios.====Within the model, we allow the provision of PERT, VR services, and labor market outcomes to be endogenous. We address the selection problem using the longitudinal data, a factor model, and instrumental variables that are assumed to impact service receipt but not the latent labor market outcomes. Given these exclusion restrictions, the parameters are not solely identified from functional form assumptions. In particular, we instrument for the provision of PERT services using programmatic restrictions on the number of students allowed to sign up for PERT; each school system is given a fixed number of slots to allocate. This “slot constraint” is associated with the PERT participation probability but arguably uncorrelated with unobserved labor market factors. In addition, following Doyle (2007); Maestas, Mullen, and Strand (2013), and Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2018, we instrument for VR service provision using the propensity of an individual’s VR counselor and field office to assign clients to services. As discussed below, these counselor/field office variables are related to VR service provision but have no direct effect on labor market outcomes.====This paper complements and extends our earlier work on the impact of VR services in Virginia (see Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, and Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, & Stern, 2018). In that work, we used these panel data and a structural model of VR service provision and labor market outcomes to examine the impact of VR services on clients with intellectual disabilities (Dean et al., 2015), mental illness (Dean et al., 2017), and physical impairments (Dean et al., 2018). While the results imply substantial heterogeneity across service types and impairments, in general, VR is found to have a positive annualized median rate of return ranging from about 20% for clients with mental illness and intellectual disabilities to 169% for clients with physical impairments. In this paper, we extend the data and model used in Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2018 in several important ways. Most notably, our focus in this paper is on evaluating the impact of the transitioning youth program PERT, not on VR services. To be clear, VR services are accounted for in our model as there are important interactions between PERT and VR. To do this, we introduce a model of PERT participation with participation constraints (see Section 4.1) and extend the Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2015, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2017, Dean, Pepper, Schmidt, Stern, 2018 model of VR to allow for interactions between PERT, schooling, and VR services (see Section 4.2). The DARS data provide information on youth who applied for services and data from the Virginia Department of Education (2000) provide information on the total numbers of disabled youth in each district (see Section 3.3). These VDOE data allow us to estimate the PERT selection probabilities (see Section 4.4). Importantly, the model of PERT service provision is entirely new. Finally, instead of restricting the analysis to VR clients with particular limitations (e.g., mental illness), our focus in this paper is on the population of transitioning youth with disabilities. These youth are an important but understudied subgroup, particularly in light of the WIOA legislation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section provides an overview of PERT and compares its salient features to those of other vocationally oriented programs serving transitioning youth with disabilities.

Still, the English experience provides an instructive case for other countries considering implementing or abolishing tuition fees.","The economic importance of higher education (HE) is well-established. Economic evidence demonstrates that education fuels economic growth and global competitiveness (Aghion et al., 2009, Valero and Van Reenen, 2016), whilst more educated societies have been shown to have higher levels of volunteering and voting (Dee, 2004), better birth outcomes and higher levels of school readiness in the next generation (Currie & Moretti, 2003) and lower levels of crime (Lochner & Moretti, 2004). Yet higher education systems across the world are becoming increasingly financially fragile (Johnstone, 2009). Demand for a college education has continued to grow—in the developing world fueled by demographic increases in the traditional college-age cohort and increasing secondary school completion rates, and in the developed world too, with rising demand for skilled labour. This increasing demand for higher education coupled with increases in per student costs (which tend to grow with the pushing out of the technological frontier) mean that for many countries, it is difficult for government to maintain funding.====Yet despite these financial pressures, many countries (France, Sweden, Scotland) have resisted the idea of financing the HE sector by drawing upon private resources through tuition fees. Meanwhile, some countries and states where tuition fees have been long established are now swinging back towards free higher education. For example, in June 2017, New York became the first US state to offer all but its wealthiest residents free tuition not only at its public community colleges, but also at public four-year institutions in the state. The new program, called the Excelsior Scholarship, does not make college completely free, nor is it without significant restrictions.==== Still, the passage of this legislation demonstrates the growing strength of the free college movement in the United States. In England (the focus of this study), one of the original architects of tuition fees, Lord Adonis, recently called for their abolition (Adams, 2017), whilst the main opposition party's popular manifesto pledges to abolish fees, highlighting that the issue of who should pay for higher education is still very much a live one.====The free college movement is typically motivated by concerns about inequality in higher education access and falling enrolments. Fees are seen as a financial barrier which would particularly exclude young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, the Scottish government routinely argue that higher education should be “based on the ability to learn not on the ability to pay” (SNP, 2016) whilst Bernie Sanders's campaigned pledged that “every American who studies hard in school can go to college regardless of how much money their parents make”. Yet, concerns over enrolment and equity are also a key element of the arguments of those in favour of fees; Lord Adonis originally argued that with money raised from tuition fees, “concerns about access for poorer students could be met, while providing a vital new source of income for the universities” (Adams, 2017).====Given the increasing financial pressure on HE systems throughout the world, which of these two courses of action would achieve the goals of increased enrolment, access and quality? Is it possible to charge relatively high rates of tuition fees and also protect (and even improve) these three goals, or do tuition fees stand in the way of these goals? In this paper we examine this question, in the context of the English HE system which has, in just two decades, moved from a no fees, low aid college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world.====We particularly consider these three outcomes since, in designing higher education finance policy, there is widespread agreement on policy objectives (Barr, 2013)====: (i) facilitating student enrolment (thus promoting human capital accumulation and economic growth, as well as other societal benefits associated with a more educated population); (ii) protecting access of under-represented groups for equity and efficiency reasons, and (iii) maintaining quality in the sector through adequate per-head investment==== . Yet, as described, there is far less consensus throughout the world on how to achieve these goals, and debate over the role of tuition fees is politically charged.====England is an appropriate setting for this research. Until 1998, domestic full-time students could attend university completely free of charge with no tuition fees charged to the student. Students were still expected to cover their own living expenses, which the majority did through a government backed student loan. But concerns about declining quality at public institutions, government mandated caps on enrolment, and sharply rising inequality in college attainment led to a package of reforms which began in 1998, including the introduction of tuition fees. Whilst initially modest, these reforms paved the way for much more dramatic changes in the financing of HE in England; just two decades later, most public universities in England now charge £9250 per annum—equivalent to about $11,380, or 14% more than the average sticker price of a U.S. public four-year institution.==== The typical English bachelor's degree recipient is now expected to graduate with around £44,000 (approximately $54,918) in student loan debt, more than twice the average debt of graduates from even the most selective US institutions.====Several prior studies have examined specific aspects of this major policy shift over time. For example, previous studies have used particular elements of the reforms to estimate the causal effects of maintenance grant changes (Dearden, Fitzsimons, & Wyness, 2014) or bursaries (Murphy & Wyness, 2015) on student enrolment, while Azmat and Simion (2018) look for changes in enrolments, institution choices, and labor market outcomes for cohorts just before and just after reforms in 2006 and 2012. Dearden, Fitzsimons, Goodman, and Kaplan (2008) focus on the effects of the 2006 reforms on the distribution of repayments across graduates, as well as the implications for taxpayer spending. Other studies focused on inequality in higher education have analyzed the connection with funding reforms (Blanden and Machin, 2013, Crawford et al., 2016).====These studies offer important evidence on the impact of certain elements of the reforms, holding all else equal. But, because the reforms were intentionally multifaceted, and rolled out over a long period of time, attempting to estimate the causal impact of one policy in isolation could lead to misleading conclusions and provide an incomplete picture of whether the reforms as a whole achieved the intended goals.====Yet, to our knowledge, there has not been an integrated, comprehensive assessment of the goals and outcomes of this massive policy shift. We believe that such an assessment—which by necessity is primarily descriptive in nature—can provide a valuable complement to more discrete causal analyses. Our contribution, therefore, is to synthesize the evidence to document how the burdens of higher education finance have shifted over the 20 years since the 1998 reforms, and to examine whether the totality of changes since then have been successful at meeting the goals originally set out by reform proponents, in terms of enrolment, access, and some proxy measures of quality.====In many cases, we draw upon (or replicate) previously reported estimates of student numbers, participation among specific student groups, taxpayer spending and university resources. But we also provide new estimates on student liquidity relative to the cost of living, student satisfaction since the reforms, and particularly around long-term trends in student funding per head, which we examine over a longer time period than prior work has done (for example we report student funding per head going back to the 1960s, and proportions enrolled back to 1994). We believe our analysis can provide a valuable case study for other countries currently without tuition charges (such as many in Western Europe), or for those contemplating tuition abolition (e.g. New Zealand; several US states). Though the contexts of each country will be different to that of England (financially and politically), the underlying economic principles, and thus many of the underlying economic tensions may be similar enough to draw useful insights from the English experience.====We illustrate that England's reforms shifted the costs of higher education away from the taxpayer and towards graduates themselves, with universities and students the key financial beneficiaries. While it is impossible to know for certain what would have happened in the absence of the reforms, our analysis shows that at minimum enrolments have continued to rise despite these dramatic shifts in how the system is financed. Moreover, after many years of widening inequality, socioeconomic gaps in college participation appear to have stabilized in the years since the initial reform. Looking at our third dimension—university quality—we show that tuition fees have played a crucial role in protecting investment in the sector. Per-student expenditures, having fallen to an historic low in the years pre-reform, have fully recovered since the introduction of tuition fees. While per-student funding is only the roughest of measures of institutional “quality,” we also show that student satisfaction rates have broadly increased over the course of the reforms.====Our results have important implications for other countries considering changes to their finance systems. Our work confirms that drawing on private resources can alleviate the challenge of insufficient resources that is present in free HE systems. Moreover, our study suggests that there are several key features of the English system that can moderate the impact of rising tuition on enrolments and access, including: (1) deferring all tuition fees until after graduation so that no student pays anything up-front; (2) increasing liquidity available to students to cover living expenses; and (3) automatically enrolling all graduates in an income-contingent loan repayment system that minimizes both administrative burden and the risk of default. Indeed, student loans have the potential to be a powerful tool for college access, if the burdens of repayment are minimized and the system is sufficiently simple for students to understand its benefits (an area where England has been less successful).====The rest of the paper is set out as follows. Section 2 documents the situation in the UK prior to the reforms, the debate surrounding them and then the details of the successive reforms since 1998. Section 3 describes our empirical approach and data sources. Section 4 examines the empirical incidence of these policy changes over time: who pays and who benefits. Section 5 evaluates how these policy changes in relation to the three policy goals of, enrolment, access and quality using a range of administrative data sources. Finally Section 6 concludes with a discussion of policy implications.","The end of free college in England: Implications for enrolments, equity, and quality",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775717306404,4 December 2018,2018,Research Article,170.0

Our estimates suggest that an increase in education by one year led to a 5.3% increase in probability of first birth aged 24 or above, 9.4% increase in probability of first birth aged 27 or above, and 13.3% increase in probability of first birth aged 30 or above. The mechanisms driving these findings are not due to an incapacitation effect – by keeping young people in school or university they have less time or opportunity to have a child – but due to a combination of human capital and signalling effects.","Teenage fertility rates in the United Kingdom (UK) are the highest in Western Europe, and second only to the United States (US) in the developed world. On average, however, adolescent fertility rates have fallen in many developed countries. For example, Fig. 1A shows that there has been a considerable reduction in the variation in teen fertility rates over the last fifty years, with a significant convergence across countries. In the UK, the teen birth rate has also fallen dramatically, from 85 births per 1000 women aged 15–19 in 1960 to just under 30 in 1980, stabilising over the period until the 1990s when the trend began to fall again. Reduction in the number of births to teenagers has been a significant policy target because of the negative consequences for both the effects on the child (Francesconi, 2008, Royer, 2004) and the mother (Chevalier & Viitanen, 2003).====There is also a concern with delays in fertility. The average mean age of women at first birth has risen by almost three years in the last two decades (OECD, 2016). Women after the age of 35 face a higher risk of having a preterm birth and are more likely to have a child with an abnormal condition as well as suffering other complications (Jolly, Sebire, Harris, Robinson, Regan, 2000, Royer, 2004). Delays in fertility may ultimately lead to childlessness, which may then have knock-on effects on replacement rates. For example, Fig. 1B shows age-specific fertility rates at selected ages by year of birth in England and Wales from 1920 and 1995. There are many more births to women over 35 compared to forty years ago. Not only has the average age increased (for example, the average age of women at first birth in the UK was 28.6 in 2014 compared to 26.6 in 1995; OECD, 2016, Fig. 3.6), but the tail of the distribution has become longer as well.====There have been a number of policy interventions in the UK aimed at reducing teenage fertility==== and improving health during pregnancy.==== The other side of the policy, other than direct prevention, is to mitigate any potential detrimental effects of teen pregnancy by helping mothers during pregnancy, and once the child has been born. Education is in the policy framework but it is typically focused on getting teenage parents back into education.==== Indeed, there is a strong correlation between education and maternity rates among under 18-year-olds. Fig. 1C shows that the correlation between having no qualifications and maternity rates of women under 18 is 0.68 (seen in the left panel of Fig. 1C). The right panel shows a strong negative connection between maternity rates of women under 18 and proportion of them with a degree. The focus in this paper is on the potential impact of improving education as a mean to prevent teen fertility and postpone first birth, rather than directly tackling the problem once it has occurred. For example, Kearney and Levine (2012), find that the lack of opportunity and being on a low economic trajectory is the cause of teen childbearing, and that the lack of the chance of advancement prevents the investment in teen human capital.====In this paper we examine the effect of education on the reduction in teen fertility and the extent to which fertility is delayed due to more schooling. In order to demonstrate this, we exploit variation in education due to a reform in England and Wales which took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This reform was a combination of changes in policies that led to a large expansion in education, which significantly raised education levels across the whole education distribution, thereby considerably reducing the number of individuals with low education levels in birth cohorts exposed to the expansion. Our approach is to think of these cohorts as a ‘treated’ set of individuals whose education was raised and we can compare their education and the timing of first birth with a ‘control’ set of cohorts who did not benefit from the expansion. Overall, the proportion of 18-year-olds in full-time education rose from around 17% in 1985 to over 35% in the late 1990s. Further, the proportion of women with a college degree increased from 13% to 30% from the late 1980s to the early 1990s (Walker & Zhu, 2008). We call this period of change the education expansion (EE).====This is the first paper that utilises the large expansion of the UK post-compulsory education system that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s in order to investigate the relationship between education and fertility timing. We use an instrumental variables (IV) approach to show that the raise in education levels as a result of the EE did not lead to a statistically significant reduction in the probability of having a child as a teenager. However, we do find that this source of variation in education led to delays in having a first child for women.====The body of evidence points to the effect of education on fertility being driven by a combination of a human capital effect and an incapacitation or incarceration effect: by keeping young people in school or university they have less time or opportunity to have a child (Black, Devereux, & Salvanes, 2008). However, we find no evidence that the mechanism driving our results are due to an incapacitation effect because the EE has effects that are beyond the ages that would be binding. Instead the results point to both a direct human capital effect and an improvement in labour market opportunities as a result of the raise in education levels and holding qualifications.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

This is an occupation where direct gender discrimination is less likely since salaries are determined by a union pay scale and women constitute the majority of employers. Using data from the American ,"Gender pay gaps continue to persist in a broad set of occupations. While the overall gender pay gap has improved over the last few decades, women continue to earn less than men in similar occupations (Blau & Khan, 2007). Some explanations for these gaps include differences in mobility across firms (Ransom & Oaxaca, 2005), labor market experience (Mincer & Polacheck, 1974), and work hours (Bertrand, Goldin, & Katz, 2010). Direct gender discrimination can also play a role, as evidenced by studies that vary the ability to observe the gender of an employee when making promotion decisions (Goldin & Rouse, 2000) or audit studies in which similar men and women apply for the same jobs (Neumark, Bank, & Van Nort, 1996).====In this paper, we examine gender wage gaps among K-12 educators in the US. This is an interesting setting since the majority of employers are women, and thus less likely to discriminate against other women, and salaries are largely set by union pay schedules, leaving less room for direct discrimination than in other fields. It is also meaningful because teacher compensation is low to begin with and declining relative to comparable workers in other occupations (Allegretto & Mishel, 2016). We use personal income data on the 500,000 K-12 educators in the 2005–2014 waves of the American Community Survey and find a gap of almost $12,000 per year. This gap is reduced by about 30% when we control for being an administrator, having a graduate degree, and the grade level taught. Each of these factors has a large impact on educators’ incomes and suggests ways in which districts could reduce gender pay gaps. These include providing a smaller pay increase for teachers with a graduate degree or creating tracks through which teachers could reach salaries similar to those of administrators.====We also construct a new dataset of public K-12 educators using public employee salary data available from 10 different states over multiple years. This dataset includes a sample of over 6 million teacher-year observations. We find that the raw gender gap in teacher salaries is much smaller—about $4900–in this sample. When we examine income distributions in both datasets, we find that the income distribution is very similar by gender when looking at public salaries; however, the distributions of male and female salaries are very different when using personal income reported in the ACS. Men are much less likely to report incomes less than $40,000 and much more likely to report incomes above $70,000. Since the income reported in the ACS includes income from all jobs, this comparison across datasets suggests that an important source of the gender gap in personal income among teachers may stem from additional sources of income that teachers seek outside of their regular teaching job.",The gender gap in K-12 educator salaries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775718302978,February 2019,2019,Research Article,172.0

I add a third dimension to disentangle differential exposure effects in reform years (years with extraordinarily large numbers of returners). The main finding is that being exposed to returning SEN students during the reform period has a negative effect on test score gains of moderate size (−0.04 SD), corresponding to half a month of learning gains per year or 5% of the initial test score gap between students from well-educated and less well-educated homes. An investigation into the mechanisms shows stronger effects in schools with little or no recent experience with accommodating returners, in particular if these schools must accommodate several new returners at the same time. The effect in reform years is not significantly stronger than in nonreform years, indicating that no additional harm is caused by the larger return flows in reform years.","Countries around the world organise education for children with special education needs (SEN) in different ways. The models adopted include segregated settings, such as special schools or separate classes in mainstream schools, and fully inclusive settings where SEN students are taught alongside their regular programme peers. Average per-student costs in segregated settings tend to be significantly higher than in regular classes, but there is no conclusive evidence of the benefits of segregated education. Yet, in many countries, educational opportunities for SEN students include teaching in segregated settings. As placement in special schools or classes may not necessarily last for the whole school career, some students eventually return to regular classrooms.====Another driver that may send students back to regular classrooms is a heightened political focus on inclusive education. Today, the general thrust is to provide special needs education in a fully inclusive setting (i.e., in regular classrooms), which is widely regarded as desirable for equality and human rights (World Health Organisation, 2011), and in many countries, education policies are shifting towards inclusive education.==== Yet researchers, policymakers, practitioners and parents have raised concerns about the impact that returning SEN students may have on the learning outcomes of their regular classroom peers. As returners are not used to coping in a regular classroom setting, the transition into regular classrooms is likely to pose challenges both to the returning student, teachers and peers and may influence learning outcomes. Such externalities may come in the form of disruptions, changing pedagogy or altering resources in regular classrooms. Understanding these effects is therefore crucial for educational policymakers organising the transition towards more inclusive education.====Across European countries 2.3% of students within compulsory schooling are educated in segregated settings (World Health Organisation, 2011). Yet countries vary widely in the number of children who receive education in segregated settings. In some countries segregated education is virtually non-existent (Italy, Portugal, Spain), while other countries exclude part of the student population from fully inclusive education (e.g., Belgium (French), Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands).==== Also, in the United States, raising the share of SEN students educated in regular classrooms is a policy target (Fletcher, 2010).====While there is a general consensus that all learners should be educated in fully inclusive settings to the extent possible, the evidence on the impact of mainstream education on academic outcomes for SEN students is not conclusive, and there is only little empirical evidence on potential spill overs on classmates. Recent evidence on the effects of the inclusion of children with various kinds of disadvantages in regular classrooms suggests that there are negative spill over effects on their peers.==== However, research focusing specifically on the effect of including SEN students in mainstream classrooms on their peers’ outcomes is scarce, and the results are mixed. Estimating the effect of having SEN students as classmates, Fletcher, 2009, Fletcher, 2010), Kristoffersen, Krægpøth, Nielsen, and Simonsen (2015) and Gottfried and Harven (2015) find negative effects on other learners,==== while Friesen, Hickey, and Krauth (2010) and Ruijs (2017) find no significant effects.====This study examines the effects on peers’ reading scores associated with returning SEN students from segregated education to regular classrooms and exploits a recent reform towards more inclusive schooling to find out whether negative externalities are larger in reform years, when policy efforts to increase the percentage of students educated in fully inclusive settings send larger numbers of SEN students back to regular classrooms.====Using full population data from Denmark, I estimate the impact on test score ==== of being exposed to same-grade SEN peers who have recently returned from segregated education. Moreover, to control for non-random selection, this study takes advantage of longitudinal information from administrative registers on individual students in multiple student-grade cohorts to control implicitly for time-invariant student effects and school-by-grade effects on test score gains. This is similar to the specification in Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2002), but is here applied to exposure to recent returners (instead of to SEN students in general). The effect of being exposed to a returning SEN student on the achievement of regular classroom peers is thus identified by changes over time in the presence of returners in one's grade cohort. To disentangle the differential exposure effects in reform years (i.e., years with extraordinarily large numbers of returners), I enhance the main specification by a third dimension. The triple-differences model provides strong causal identification.====This study contributes to the literature as the first study of the externalities of returning SEN students on their peers’ educational outcomes. Returners may be more difficult to accommodate in regular classes and may be more disruptive==== than SEN students who are educated in inclusive settings throughout school. This may be because they may on average have a higher degree of special needs (as they have been sent to special classrooms and schools in the first place) or because they face an entirely new education setting upon their return that they may not easily adapt to. Understanding the impact of returners is relevant in particular for school systems moving towards a more inclusive approach to educating students with special needs.====On top of contributing to the literature on the effects of SEN students in regular classes, this study places itself within the broader peer effects literature (Epple and Romano, 2011; Sacerdote, 2011 provide overviews). For example, linking peer achievement or characteristics to students’ learning, contributions related to this study are Ammermueller and Pischke, 2009, Angrist and Lang, 2004, Lavy et al., 2012, Lavy, Silva and Weinhardt (2012), Lefgren (2004) and McEwan (2003).====The main results provide evidence of negative externalities of returning SEN students on peers’ reading gains during reform years, when return flows are large. The negative effect is of modest size (−0.04 SD). An investigation into the mechanisms showed stronger effects in schools with little recent experience with accommodating returners, in particular if these schools enrol several recent returners. The effect in reform years is not significantly larger than in nonreform years.====The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a short presentation of the institutional background.

We identify the effect using discontinuations of the program and add to the literature on multiple unordered treatments by suggesting approximations of the effect against a specific option (here 9th grade). Discontinuation significantly increases enrollment in and completion of high school education for students at the affected margins, which under ==== assumptions translates into a negative effect of the preparatory program. There is no effect on enrollment in and completion of a ====. Robustness and placebo analyses suggest that results cannot be explained by violations of ==== assumptions.","On average, 17% of 25-34-year-olds across OECD countries had not completed upper secondary schooling, in 2014 (OECD, 2015). As young people with no formal education perform less successfully in the labor market, the lack of formal education is widely seen as an important economic and social issue in the OECD countries. Therefore, the school systems of many countries offer preparatory courses for upper secondary schooling at the end of compulsory schooling or remedial courses during high school, to prevent dropout. In most countries, these courses are of relatively short duration, while in some countries they comprise a full extra year of education, a 10th grade. This is the case in, for instance, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Finland, and Denmark. The present paper examines the impact of such an extra optional preparatory school year on upper secondary school enrollment and completion in Denmark.====Estimating the causal effect of participation in a voluntary preparatory program is difficult because students are not randomly assigned to this extra year. We address this selection problem by exploiting discontinuations from 2008 through 2012 of the preparatory program at several public schools. The high frequency of discontinuations in this period was most likely driven by legislational changes in 2008 and 2010 and not school quality. We use the discontinuation at the school where the student attended 9th grade as an instrumental variable (IV) for participation in the preparatory program at a public school. This IV estimator identifies the effect of treatment at public schools versus no treatment, where no treatment includes both students completing elementary school after 9th grade and students enrolling in an alternative 10th grade at a private boarding school. This is a common counterfactual, sometimes denoted “treatment as usual”. Because students face three unordered choices of what to do next at the end of elementary schooling, IV cannot identify the treatment effect compared to leaving elementary school after 9th grade only, without further information (Heckman & Vytlacil, 2007). We show that the treatment effect is a weighted average of the treatment effects of the two types of 10th grade versus 9th grade, and that the weights can be estimated. This result is used to describe the relative importance of the pairwise comparisons, and to argue that we can approximate the treatment effect compared to leaving elementary school after 9th grade for a subgroup of the population.====To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the causal effect of a voluntary preparatory extra year of education following compulsory schooling on later education choices. Thus our findings are related to both the vast literature showing that an extra year of education provides substantial pecuniary benefits (e.g., Gunderson & Orepoulous, 2010) and the narrower literature on the effectiveness of remediation and preparatory programs targeting low-ability adolescent groups. Recent literature has highlighted the ineffectiveness of many programs targeting adolescents, both in absolute terms and relative to earlier interventions (Heckman, Humphries, & Kautz, 2014). However, a number of studies have also found positive short-term effects of specific preparatory programs: An evaluation of targeted remedial education for under-performing high school students in Israel reports positive short-term effects on college enrollment rates (Lavy & Schlosser, 2005). Likewise does a study based on a randomized controlled trial in the US, of a non-academic tutoring program for students in the 9th and 10th grades in public schools, also report positive effects on graduation rates (Cook et al., 2014). Two other US programs designed to help students in grades 9–12 to enroll and succeed in college were also evaluated by means of randomized controlled studies. The effects of the programs were modest for the average student, but large for children with lower educational expectations or for younger students. The effects however became negative over time for some groups (Rodriguez-Planas, 2012). We are only aware of two studies from Europe. A study evaluating a program for students aged 7–11 with ‘special educational needs’ in England finds no overall effects on subsequent educational attainment (Keslair, Maurin, & McNally, 2012). The only continental European study evaluating the effect of a preparatory program of which we are aware is Martins (2010). This study evaluates the effect of a preparatory program in Portugal targeting low-achieving 13-15-year-olds with the aim of improving their non-cognitive skills, such as discipline, self-control, and patience. Martins (2010) finds that the program was successful in reducing grade retention. This finding is in line with results of the literature reviewed in Heckman et al. (2014) and Conti and Heckman (2010), where the authors highlight the fact that non-cognitive skills may be particularly important for adolescents, because they are malleable over a substantial age range and impact both skill formation and outcomes, such as crime and employment.====The results of the current study show that experiencing a discontinuation of the preparatory program—the voluntary 10th grade option—significantly lowers the likelihood of students enrolling in high school, and increases the likelihood of not enrolling in upper secondary education at all. Under four standard assumptions, the reduced form results translates into local average treatment effects (LATE) of the preparatory program for the group of compliers, who regret their choice of 10th grade, when experiencing a discontinuation. We show that although the group of compliers on average differs from the overall treated group of students (who enroll in 10th grade) on parameters like gender and ethnicity, these two groups do not, on average, differ significantly on parameters like socio-economic background and if they live in small cities. The IV results suggest that the preparatory program lowers retention in and completion of high school education but has no effect on retention in and completion of vocational education, but an overall negative effect on enrollment in upper secondary education. The overall negative effect on enrollment is not found in placebo tests and is robust across alternative model specifications and examinations of potential violations of the LATE assumptions, including analyses with 9th grade as counterfactual.====The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of the 10th grade option in Denmark and various other countries, and of legislative changes that likely spurred the discontinuations of the 10th grade option. In Section 3, we introduce the data, and in Section 4 we outline our empirical strategy and discuss the LATE assumptions in the current setting. In Section 5, we present the results, and, finally, in Section 6 we discuss and put the findings into perspective.",Is it good to be LATE?

Before the policy, a typical child spent up to three years in pre-school, and four years in primary school. The reform reorganized the system so that pupils would spend two years in pre-school (at ages 4 and 5) and five years in ====. The timing of national tests and of the incremental process of implementing the reorganization allowed us to use a DDD approach to make causal estimates of its effect on student achievement. The reform increased 5th grade students’ mathematics scores by 0.10 SDs and reading scores by 0.12 SDs over student gains in untreated schools. These effects are robust across various treated cohorts, and across alternative samples of schools.","Most children worldwide now begin some form of compulsory education at 6 years old or younger.==== Although there is increasing agreement that school should start early in childhood (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, Heckman and Masterov, 2007), much more controversy surrounds the content appropriate for younger children to optimize learning. Should their hours in school be organized around play or around a more structured reading and math curriculum? What is the impact of these curricular choices on cognitive skills?====In this paper, we investigate this question by analyzing the influence on two such outcomes—student achievement and several indicators of student behavior—of a national educational reform in Brazil. The reform converted a final year of pre-school into an additional year of elementary education, increasing focus on early literacy and numeracy. Our analysis exploits the unequal timing of implementing the policy that reorganized school grades across Brazilian schools. We show that students in schools affected by the policy increased their average test scores by 0.10–0.12 SD on a fifth-grade test.====Traditionally, studies have associated the number of years that students stay in school with educational and longer-term outcomes (Angrist and Krueger, 1991, Duflo, 2001, Mincer, 1974). Those studies aim to isolate the effects of additional years of education on student outcomes from other observable and non-observable factors. Several lessons have emerged from this literature. Additional years of education affect educational outcomes such as attendance and test scores. Starting school earlier, through programs such as early childhood education and pre-school, also have positive benefits for students (Havnes and Mogstad, 2011, Heckman and Masterov, 2007).====Whereas research on school-age entrance compares the benefits for students who enter primary school at an earlier age relative to students who enter at a later age (for a review, see Stipek, 2009), this paper sheds light on another important and generally neglected aspect of early entrance: the consequences of substituting an additional year of elementary school (an elementary school academic curriculum) for the last year of pre-school (a pre-school curriculum).====We hypothesize that starting elementary school a year earlier rather than spending an additional year in pre-school increases student scores on tests applied at the end of elementary school. The reason for the increase, we posit, is that the earlier entering six-years olds are taught an extra year of academic curriculum that includes mathematics and reading in place of a pre-school year of a play-oriented socialization. The content of the academic curriculum is directly relevant to performance on the 5th grade test, but the previous pre-school curriculum was only ==== related, mainly through helping students acquire affective (behavioral) and “readiness” skills that impact cognitive skill acquisition (see, for example, Kautz, Heckman, Diris, Ter Weel, & Borghans, 2014).====Even if this seems obvious, there is considerable controversy over the most effective form of changing educational organizations to increase exposure to content (Stipek, 2009). McEwan and Shapiro (2008), for example, estimated the effect of the delayed entrance of students in primary education and show that a one-year delay reduces the probability of retention and increases student test-scores. Elder and Lubotsky (2009) also analyzed the effect of kindergarten entrance age on school achievement. Their results tend to contradict McEwan and Shapiro, in that they show delayed entrance in kindergarten negatively affecting children's educational outcomes, particularly for those groups with fewer resources and educational opportunities. Recent evidence rooted in the developmental psychology literature also supports this last result. Fuller, Bein, Bridges, Kim, and Rabe-Hesketh (2017), for example, compares pre-K with a higher academic emphasis versus pre-K with a more significant social skills emphasis and found that students in academic pre-K achieve higher test scores.====Our study has considerable advantages over previous research on the benefits of early entrance in primary school. For example, we have a clear counterfactual—we present strong evidence that almost all 6-year-old students were experiencing pre-school before the reform, and the reform required the treated 6-year-old cohorts to be exposed to an elementary school curriculum. Our study also analyzes data for the entire country, mitigating concerns about the external validity of results such as those found in the previous literature.====To estimate the impact of changing the curriculum received by 6-years old children, we analyzed a school reorganization reform implemented in Brazil between 2003 and 2010. The reform required schools/local authorities to enroll 6-year-old students in the first grade of elementary school rather than in the final year of pre-school. Most important, in this reform, most students did not receive an additional year of schooling—rather, they were taught a year of elementary curriculum in place of a year of the pre-school curriculum. Because different schools implemented the reform in different years—mainly based on administrative decisions at the state and municipal level—over the period 2003–2010, we could compare average student achievement by the school in the final year of elementary school during this period. We compared the fifth-grade achievement of students in schools that had begun admitting six-year-old students into first grade (thus exposing them to five years of elementary school by the time of the fifth-grade national test) to the fifth-grade achievement of students in schools that continued to admit students into second grade at seven years old, thus exposing them to only four years of elementary school at the time they took the fifth-grade test.====To address concerns related to how local authorities may have chosen schools in which to implement the reform, we focused our main analysis on the group of schools that offer elementary and middle school grades in the same schooling complex. Therefore, in the same school, we can observe cohorts of elementary grade students that receive and not receive the treatment, and same year cohorts of students in middle school who never received the treatment but experienced the same contemporaneous changes affecting the school unit that implemented the reform.====The implementation timing of the reform and the two groups of students in the same school allow us to estimate a triple difference model commonly used in the analyzes of social programs (Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2009, Yelowitz, 1995). In the first difference-in-difference, we compare average student 5th-grade achievement scores of treatment schools with the average student 5th-grade achievement of control schools, before and after the implementation. In the second difference-in-differences—called the ""naïve"" or ""placebo"" DD (Asim & Dee, 2016)—we compare the average achievement of the (untreated) 9th graders in treatment schools with (untreated) 9th graders in control schools, before and after the implementation. The difference between these two DD estimators, the DDD, give us the effect of substituting a year of elementary school for a year of pre-school, net of possible trends and contemporaneous shocks within treated schools.====Our results indicate that replacing a year of pre-school with a year of elementary school increases schools’ average test scores by 0.10 SD in math and 0.12 SD in reading test scores. We also perform a series of estimates specifically designed to check the robustness of results. For example, we do not find any changes over time on average characteristics of students, teachers, and principal/school characteristics, which suggests that our parallel trend assumption holds. We run a placebo model using data for years before the policy implementation, and we do not find positive gains for treated schools, which is additional evidence to support our parallel trend assumption. We also compare results using alternative control groups, and the results did not change. This comparison indicates that sample selection is not driving our results. We run a traditional difference-in-difference model for schools that offer only elementary school, and not middle school. The positive results still hold for this alternative sample. In sum, our empirical analyses provide compelling evidence that the reorganization of early grades positively and significantly impacts elementary school average test scores in mathematics and reading.====Using the latest two available national tests (2013 and 2015) we estimate whether the effects of the early entrance program were maintained for the subset of 9th graders who had been in the first two cohorts entering first grade at six years old. We found that the achievement gains on the 9th grade test due to early entrance were still positive but had somewhat declined from the 5th grade test gains, to 0.02 − 0.06 SD.====In addition to test score gains, we investigate whether the reform revealed school-readiness issues for younger students through non-test scores outcomes observable in 5th grade. We found that teachers of treated (early entrants) and control (7-year-old entrants) students did not report significantly different student behavior or effort when asked about these as potential problems in their students’ learning development. We also found that teachers of the younger, treated students do not report any greater self-esteem problem for learning than teachers of the older control students.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Whether higher education financing policy is able to facilitate this expansion is a critical issue for both education outcomes and economic growth. Using cross-sectional earnings data from the Chinese Household Income Project we find that a significant proportion of low-income graduates have a high likelihood of experiencing financial difficulties with current loan arrangements, implying high levels of financial hardship, a reliance on family members to meet repayments in order to avoid difficulties, and for some, default. In contrast we show that a properly designed income-contingent loan scheme has the potential to significantly mitigate, even eliminate, these concerns without attendant high budgetary costs. Our findings have important policy implications for Chinese higher education financing.","Internationally over the past six decades economic growth and technology improvement have been associated with the expansion of higher education institutions (HEI) and college graduation rates; almost every country has experienced a rising rate of university graduates, with such a trend set to continue (Barr, 2012). Lauded for the positive spillover effects on society, higher education nonetheless is increasingly recognized as having significant private returns, it being reasonable on equity grounds that all taxpayers do not bear the full cost of higher education. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe that higher education students in most countries now contribute to the cost through tuition charges, a situation much different to the widespread experience of international higher education practice as short as 40 years ago (Chapman and Doris, 2019).====China's higher education has undergone important changes since the late 1990s. In the 15 years from 1999 the number of HEIs more than doubled, and undergraduate and postgraduate student numbers increased by over five times (MOE and NBSC, 2015). At the same time higher education financing has changed from a completely government funded system to a multi-channel cost-sharing and recovery system, with supporting data being provided below. This implies potentially high financial burdens for low-income families with the associated prospects of restricting further development of China's higher education and skill-upgrading of the labor force, potentially associated with adverse consequences for poverty reduction.====A policy intervention designed to alleviate the financial stress associated with having to pay tuition are national student loan systems, and these have been used world-wide to address the capital market problem associated with investment in post-compulsory education skills explained in the Introduction to the Special Issue (Chapman and Doan, 2019). China significantly expanded formal education loans in the late 1990s (PBC, MOE and MOF, 1999), with the current financing system consisting of three types of mortgage-style loans, known as time-based repayment loans (TBRL).====This paper investigates student loan schemes for China. As conceptual background to the motivations for our research, we refer readers to the discussion in the Introduction of the Special Issue which examines the costs and benefits of the two design systems for student loans. The essential difference between the TBRL and its alternative, income-contingent loans (ICL), is that the former requires constant repayments of debt on the basis of time, but ICLs are collected depending only on income. Unlike an ICL, a TBRL takes no account of capacity to pay and, unlike a TBRL, ICL repayment periods differ very significantly between debtors because the level and structure of graduate lifetime incomes vary so much between people.====We start with an empirical examination of the difficulties faced by borrowers with respect to meeting TBRL repayment obligations, which is much more likely to be the case for graduates/debtors receiving low incomes, even if only for a short period. With the use of recent cross-sectional earnings data we provide the first quantitative analysis of repayment burdens associated with the current Chinese student loans system. The results illustrate that borrowers have a high probability of experiencing excessive financial hardship in repaying loans when their incomes are at the low end of the distribution of incomes for graduates by age and sex. The adverse implications of this experience are fully explained in Chapman and Doan (2019).====We then examine the implications of ICLs with which the borrower can achieve consumption smoothing over the entire life cycle and is immune from default risks, which are the two key advantages over TBRLs (Chapman, Higgins, and Stiglitz, 2014).==== These benefits help explain why ICLs have become either a reality or are in prospect currently in many countries.====No prior research has explored ICLs in China's context, and this study fills the gap. We provide evidence for China that an ICL can be designed to perform both more equitably and with lower subsidies than TBRLs, which would mean that reform of this type, so long as this can be designed properly, has significant potential in assisting the future development of higher education in China. Whether or not the ever-improving institutional and administrative environment is currently sufficiently efficient to allow low-cost collection of an ICL remains a critical question posed in the conclusion.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of student loans in China. Section 3 describes the data employed in the empirical exercises. Sections 4 and 5 report and examine, respectively, the repayment burdens for TBRLs and the effects of ICLs for China. Section 6 considers two sensitivity tests related to the econometric methods used, and offers a caveat concerning the possible under-estimation of subsidies calculated for ICLs related to emigration.

This paper focuses on the relatively small share of borrowers with very large balances. The share of borrowers with large balances increased sharply during the 2000 s, and these borrowers now account for a large portion of all outstanding loan dollars. For example, borrowers with balances above $50,000 accounted for less than a fifth of all borrowers in 2014, but half of all debts. The majority of these borrowers avoid default and see high labor market earnings, however a small fraction of these borrowers, particularly at for-profit institutions, see adverse labor market and repayment outcomes. While borrowers with large balances tend to avoid defaulting on their loans, many borrowers are avoiding repayment through other channels, such as income driven repayment plans and loan forbearance.====In an earlier paper, we showed that increases in the number of new borrowers at for-profit and public two-year community college students led to a surge in student loan defaults (Looney & Yannelis, 2015). For these borrowers, the problem was not the size of their debts, which were small, but their ability to pay: many had dropped out, or attended programs that failed to lead to a decent job, or were economically disadvantaged to start with. In 2015, half of defaulted borrowers owed less than $10,000. In many cases, borrowers defaulted at the first instance after leaving school, suggesting they had neither the means to pay nor the wherewithal to enroll themselves in programs to avoid default. The high default rates among low-balance borrowers and low-default rates elsewhere gives the impression that the major problems in the student loan program are isolated among borrowers with relatively small balances.====In reality, the expansion in student lending—and its associated risks to students and taxpayers—was more pervasive across all types of postsecondary education, and among graduate students and parents, as well as undergraduates. And problems are apparent, if less visible, among borrowers accumulating large student debts. In this paper, we draw on administrative data to examine the changing experience of borrowers who accumulate balances above $50,000 (all figures are in constant 2014 dollars). Borrowers rarely accumulate such debts. Only 2% of borrowers owed that much in 1990 and only 5% in 2000. But higher loan limits, the elimination of limits on “PLUS” loans (which include loans to parents of undergraduate students and loans to graduate and professional students), expansions of loan eligibility to online programs (including online graduate programs), and rising costs have allowed many borrowers to accumulate not-before-seen levels of debt.====Because such borrowers are mostly graduate students, often at selective institutions, or parents who passed a credit check, they are perceived to be low risk. Indeed, default rates are not even published for certain types of such loans. When they are, however, default rates are not by themselves a reliable measure of loan performance because many borrowers use income driven repayment plans, long deferrals, or forbearances to postpone or avoid default even in the face of unmanageable debts. For example, while default rates began to fall in the mid-2010 s, rather than signaling improvements in loan payments, repayment rates (the share of the original balance students had repaid after 3 or 5 years) fell. Today, for the first time, more large-balance borrowers are falling behind on their payments than are making progress reducing their debts.====The increase in borrowing among graduate, parent, and high-balance undergraduate borrowers has many troubling similarities to the increase in borrowing at for-profit and public two-year community colleges that resulted in high rates of default. A growing share of large-balance borrowers took out loans to attend for-profit schools, which have poor repayment outcomes and worse labor market outcomes compared to other institutions (Eaton et al., 2018, Looney and Yannelis, 2015). For borrowers starting to repay loans in 2000, less than 5% of borrowers with repayment balances above $50,000 borrowed to attend for-profit institutions. In 2014 that share surpassed 20%. Historically, most large borrowers were graduate and professional borrowers. Today, they are increasingly likely to be parents and independent undergraduate borrowers, whose economic outlook tends to be riskier, and less likely to support substantial borrowing over time.====Beyond the types of borrowers and institutions involved, loan sizes and loan performance have changed in worrying ways. The sheer dollar amounts owed by these students is well above historical norms, and given the long amortization schedules typical of large-balance borrowers, the total costs of these loans, including principal and interest, are consuming a rising share of some borrowers’ lifetime incomes. Many large-balance borrowers who are not in default have low repayment rates, and repayment rates have slowed over time. The median borrower who originally owed less than $50,000 in the early 2000 s paid off his or her debt within ten years of entering repayment, while the median borrower who had borrowed more than $50,000 in debt while in school still owed about 75% of the original balance. A potentially worrying trend starting in the early 2010 s is that large-balance borrowers, for the first time, owe more than their initial repayment amount in the first years of repayment—on average they are falling behind rather than making progress. In addition to the recession, this trend coincides with the introduction of new repayment options, such as income driven repayment, and increased take-up of forbearances, policies that allow borrowers to reduce or suspend their payments without defaulting.====Looking beyond the aggregate trends, the variation in repayment rates across individual institutions for graduate and parent borrowers is just as broad as the variation in undergraduate outcomes, suggesting that even though average outcomes for borrowers may be positive, many borrowers at higher-risk institutions are experiencing much worse outcomes. Thus, a relatively small share of borrowers may have large impacts on aggregate repayment and taxpayer burden.====These trends have outsized implications for the budgetary effects of the loan program and the well-being of students. Despite the fact that large-balance borrowers have low default rates and represent only a small fraction of defaulted borrowers, they now account for almost half of all dollars in default. Those defaults impose costs both on the students themselves as well as on taxpayers from uncollected loans and costs of collection.====The results of this paper have implications for policies designed to improve student outcomes and reduce risks to students and taxpayers associated with unpaid loans. Because a small subset of borrowers accounts for the majority of dollars in default, changes targeted to a small number of individuals and institutions could have large implications for taxpayers and the students involved. Screening large-balance borrowers, risk-based limits on credit, eliminating certain types of loans, and applying institutional accountability rules to graduate or parent loans might reduce adverse outcomes and improve economic welfare (Cox, 2016, Lochner and Monge-Naranjo, 2011, Lochner and Monge-Naranjo, 2015). This paper also contributes to a growing literature that documents facts about the student loan market, which is now the largest source of non-mortgage household debt in the United States (Avery and Turner, 2012, Brown et al., 2014, Looney and Yannelis, 2015). The paper is closely related to Lochner and Monge-Naranjo (2014), who study alternative repayment measures for student loan default. However, our paper emphasizes the distribution of loan balances and the impact of large-balance borrowers on repayment.====Section II discusses the administrative data used in the paper and provides a brief overview of student loan programs in the United States. Section III presents new facts about the rise of large-balance borrowers and how increased student loan borrowing limits allowed borrowers to accumulate those balances. Section IV discusses changes in the characteristics of large-balance borrowers and the institutions they attended. Section V presents new facts about the labor market and repayment outcomes of large-balance borrowers. Section VII concludes.",How useful are default rates?

This paper examines the contemporary profile of students entering career academies in a large, diverse school district and estimates causal effects of participation in one of the district's well-regarded academies on a range of high school and college outcomes. Exploiting the lottery-based admissions process of this technology-focused academy, we find that academy enrollment increases the likelihood of high school ","In the United States, between 15 and 20 percent of adolescents fail to finish high school (NCES, 2015). Gaps in completion by race, ethnicity, and gender persist despite marked gains made by minority students in the early 2000s – with the graduation rate for females exceeding that of males by 12 percentage points (Murnane, 2013). Those who fail to complete high school fare very poorly in the labor market and future prospects are dim. Demand for individuals with at least some form of postsecondary training has expanded and labor market projections forecast continued growth for such “middle-skill” jobs (Carnevale et al., 2013, Holzer, 2012, Holzer, 2014). An unintended consequence of recent policy discussions that fiercely focus on college-going and “match” (e.g., Smith, Pender, & Howell, 2013) is that they divert attention from the many students who never confront college choices because they fail to complete high school.====Despite the importance of educational attainment for individuals in terms of skill acquisition and earnings as well as for the country as a whole in terms of economic growth (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008) and enhanced civic engagement (Dee, 2004), there is a paucity of solid evidence on interventions capable of improving high school completion (Murnane, 2013). Given thin evidence about a key social goal, research that explores promising high school innovations in a manner capable of uncovering causal effects on completion (or lack thereof) is critical to future human capital development.====Career academies represent one initiative aimed at improving students’ attachment to and performance in high school while simultaneously exposing them to options for postsecondary study and work. Such academies are within-school, multi-year programs that integrate career and technical education (CTE) courses, project-based learning, internships, and other activities organized around specific career themes (Levesque et al., 2008). They are intended to improve student engagement in high school by directly linking schoolwork to local employment contexts and the kinds of jobs students might later pursue. While the concept of career academies is not new, the students they serve, their curricular foci, and their goals have evolved alongside shifts in the surrounding policy landscape. This evolution of goals is well-documented by the leading national advocacy consortium for career academies in its “National Standards of Practice” (NCAC, 2004 & 2013). The first set of standards, issued in 2004, argued that career academies were an essential component of the “high school reform” movement and central to engaging students who might otherwise drop out of school. Nearly a decade later, the consortium more forcefully argued that career academies served to enhance college and career opportunities for all students – not just those enrolled in potentially underperforming high schools (NCAC, 2004 & 2013).====There is scant work on the causal effects of participation in career academies. The strongest evidence comes from a lottery-based study conducted by MDRC that focused on nine academies in operation during the 1990s (Kemple, 2001, Kemple, 2004, Kemple and Willner, 2008, Kemple and Willner, 2011). Since that time, the foci of career academies have grown and the slate of students served by such academies has widened. Indeed, a recent, nationally representative sample of career academy enrollees included substantially higher proportions of white and male students and a lower proportion of Hispanic students, compared to the MDRC sample (Kemple & Snipes, 2000; NAF, 2017). In addition, the surrounding policy context has shifted. The academies of the 1990s operated in an era prior to No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and its attendant high-stakes accountability requirements and prior to the unveiling of the Common Core State Standards and development of “career- and college-ready” standards for all students. Thus, our broad aim is to update the literature on career academies that was established in a limited manner during a time when education policy looked distinct from what is has for the past two decades.====In this paper, we first use rich administrative data from the Wake County Public School System in North Carolina (henceforth “Wake County”) to characterize the contemporary profile of students enrolling in that district's extensive system of career academies. Wake County is the largest school district in North Carolina and resembles the nation in terms of the demographic and socioeconomic makeup of its students (Ingels et al., 2011). We begin by descriptively documenting gaps in career academy participation by gender, race and ethnicity. We then estimate the causal effects of participation in one academy, the Academy of Information Technology (AOIT) within Apex High School, by exploiting the fact that enrollees were admitted by lottery. We estimate causal effects of enrollment in this academy on a range of educational outcomes during high school as well as measures of college enrollment and choice. AOIT is a well-regarded and adequately funded academy that has garnered recognition from the National Academy Foundation National Academies Foundation 2013, National Academies Foundation 2016). Any study that focuses on a limited setting such as one school faces a tradeoff between internal and external validity. Here, we highlight three attributes of our empirical context that enhance the value of our key findings from the lottery-based analysis. First, the counterfactual condition is exceptionally clear. In the vast majority of studies of schools of choice (e.g., charters or magnets) that exploit lottery-based admissions, the control condition is an amalgamation of various paths students who lose the lottery pursue. This is because lottery losers frequently have additional choices of which to avail themselves if they lose their top-choice lottery. This muddies subsequent interpretation of causal effects and associated policy implications. In our case, across the cohorts in our study, 92 percent of the students who lose the lottery for the career academy enroll in the regular high school track within the same school. Thus, the treatment-control contrast is crisp and our estimates will clearly represent the effect of career academy enrollment relative to enrollment in the regular high school track. Second, students who attend AOIT begin in the 9th grade, a pivotal grade in terms of future dropout risk (Neild, Stoner-Eby, & Furstenberg, 2008). This element of the treatment contrasts with MDRC's analytic sample in which nearly three-quarters of enrollees began in the 10th grade (Kemple & Rock, 1996) – and thus may influence downstream high school outcomes. Third, the career academy that operates within Apex High School focuses on information technology. While MDRC's sample of schools included two electronics academies and one video academy (Kemple & Rock, 1996), these kinds of technology – and the era in which they operated – likely differ substantially from the context of AOIT, where the foci are web design and computer programming.====In the penultimate section of the paper, we extend and deepen our discussion of external validity. For now, the reader ought to hold in mind that the results of the lottery-based portion of our analysis flow from a well-implemented program in a relatively high-performing, well-resourced high school. Thus, these features of the setting are a part of the framework of factors that shape the treatment-control contrast and the effects that flow from it on our outcomes of interest (Cook, 2014).====To preview results, we find that recent career academy enrollees across the district are generally higher performing than their non-academy peers. We document small gaps in the propensity to enroll in a career academy by ethnicity and English proficiency status that cannot be explained by differences in prior academic achievement or high school choice sets.====We then exploit the lottery-based admissions process of one technology-focused academy to estimate causal effects of career academy participation on high school attendance, achievement, and graduation, as well as college-going. We find that enrollment in this academy increases the likelihood of high school graduation by about 8 percentage points. Academy participation reduces 9th grade absences and markedly increases in the likelihood of earning an IT industry certification but has little effect on academic performance and rates of AP course-taking during high school. Along the postsecondary margin, we find that participation in this academy increases the likelihood of college enrollment within one year of expected, on-time high school graduation for males but not females.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide some basic background on career and technical education with a focus on its use in school-based career academies, synthesize existing literature on the effects of career academies, and situate our contribution in that literature. Section III chronicles the development of career academies in Wake County in North Carolina and provides a descriptive overview of student access to career academies. Section IV details the data we use to examine the causal effects of participating in one of the district's well-regarded academies on a range of educational outcomes. Section V describes our empirical approach to estimating those effects. Section VI presents our main findings.

Unusually among OECD countries, the fee component is not accompanied by a student loan scheme, which has led to growing concerns about restrictions on access and hardship for students’ families. Moreover, an increase in the fee level is being considered as a solution to substantial underfunding of the higher education system. In this context, the government is currently considering the introduction of a student loan scheme. The aim of this paper is to assess the feasibility of various alternative schemes in terms of concerns about both affordability for graduates and the consequences for public finances.====In conceptual and policy terms there is a consensus that government intervention is required in the financing of higher education. Such intervention can take the form of provision of a taxpayer funded system and/or government-backed student loans. Student loan schemes exist in many countries, and can be broadly broken into two types. The first entails a mortgage-type loan, which is either provided directly or guaranteed by the government, and has the main feature that graduates repay the amount borrowed over a fixed time period. An alternative approach is an income-contingent loan (ICL) system, which has been adopted in several countries as an alternative to mortgage-type loans. The critical feature of an ICL is that borrowers repay their debt only once their incomes surpass a given threshold, with the size and duration of repayments beyond this depending on the borrower's income.====Although student loans are available in many countries, there are several reasons for concern about the feasibility of introducing student loans in Ireland, and these are discussed in the context of the history and policy environment of Irish higher education funding in Section 2. Section 3 outlines the econometric approach taken to simulating the earnings distribution for Irish graduates; it also describes the data and reports the disaggregated estimations of life-cycle earnings profiles for Irish female and male graduates. These estimates are then used to simulate the effects of mortgage-type loan schemes on repayment burdens, with results being presented and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 uses the same estimated earnings profiles to simulate the likely collection experience of ICLs of various designs to illustrate the affordability of such approaches from the perspective of both graduates and public finance subsidies.

It is argued that a government-run scheme of income contingent loans (ICLs) for higher education would achieve superior outcomes. We advocate a refinement of existing ICLs schemes. Following Apps, Long and Rees (2014), the paper proposes a piecewise-linear repayment schedule that serves both equity and efficiency objectives.","Higher education is an essential engine of economic growth. However, there is a lack of consensus as to how higher education should be financed. In most European countries, higher education is largely free. In some other advanced economies, such as the USA, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, students must pay substantial fees to attend universities or colleges. Facing such fees, many young people must rely on loans to finance their own education, and some must give up hopes of attending a tertiary institution. While some can borrow from parents or relatives, others resort to loans offered by financial institutions (with or without guarantee from the government). In some countries, the government operates an income contingent loans (ICLs) scheme whereby the amounts the individuals are required to repay in any period is dependent on their income in that period. A striking example of success is Australia’s ICLs scheme, originally known as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). HECS was used for the payment of tuition fees for all undergraduate university courses.==== The success of the Australian ICLs system for higher education financing has been praised internationally.==== In this paper, I argue that ICLs operated by the government is an efficient and equitable way of financing higher education.==== In addition, I will present some arguments for further refinements of the current ICLs schemes so as to improve the outcomes.====According to Stiglitz (2014, p. 31), income contingent loans “represent an efficient way of implementing equity contracts for human capital.” When repayments for loans are contingent on the income of the borrowers, the loans contracts practically become equity contracts: a government that provides ICLs is effectively sharing the risks with those who make investments in their human capital. The main reason why these risks should be shared by the government rather by private investors is that the moral hazard and adverse selection problems can be more efficiently mitigated by the government, thanks to its superior ability to collect information about individuals’ income. The market system, by itself, would not provide efficient ICLs schemes, because of high informational and enforcement costs that private lenders face.====This paper provides a theoretical justification for ICLs to support higher education. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, I review the arguments that in some areas of economic activities the free market does not ensure an efficient outcome. In Section 3, a simple model of ICLs is presented, and its efficiency properties are discussed. In Section 4, I propose a piecewise linear repayment scheme as an improvement over the linear scheme.
