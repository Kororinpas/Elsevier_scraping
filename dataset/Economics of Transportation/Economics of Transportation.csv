This literature has identified the conditions under which centralisation or decentralisation is the preferred option from the viewpoint of overall social welfare. The leading preference-matching argument supporting decentralisation is the ability of lower-tier governments to better customise the attributes of the service to the preferences of its constituents (Oates, 1972). By contrast, if the service involves substantial spillovers between regions, centralisation might be more efficient, because local governments may neglect spillover effects on other regions. These include classical consumption externalities (such as pollution and congestion) as well as fiscal externalities, for example due to tax exporting (Arnott and Grieson, 1981). Several more recent studies questioned the implicit assumption in the early fiscal federalism literature that central governments are unable to provide differentiated local services (see, for example, Lockwood, 2002, Besley and Coate, 2003, Knight, 2004). Taking into account the political decision making process and allowing such differentiated service provision then clearly weakens the case for centralised decisions (Besley and Coate, 2003).====Importantly, the focus in the above literature has been on whether or not decentralisation is desirable for society as a whole, using aggregate social welfare as the relevant criterion. In this paper we take another look at the assignment of authority to different government levels, emphasising the implications for individual regions. The analysis of local welfare in multi-level governments has received limited attention in the literature so far, probably because it seems obvious that local communities would support decentralisation. In the original framework of Oates (1972) this is a plausible hypothesis, since local communities are the main beneficiaries of the decentralisation of public goods, and their welfare is unaffected by any spillovers to other regions. Moreover, the possibility of tax exporting implies that regions are interested in attracting activities with outside users they can tax. The present paper shows that by the same token, however, regions may avoid producing public services that generate spillover benefits to other regions. This is especially the case if service provision – e.g.==== ====due to scale economies – imply financial losses to the region operating the service. Regions may instead prefer that loss making services would be operated by other regions or by the federal government; it allows them to benefit from the service offered while avoiding having to finance the subsidies to cover the financial deficit. Public transport may well be the prototype example of this behaviour. For example, a suburban region may prefer that public transport connecting the suburbs and the inner city is organised and financed by the city government. The suburban region benefits from the service offered while the city may carry the largest burden of covering the subsidies. In general, regions may prefer other regions to offer the public transport service even when it implies that the attributes of the service (such as its price and frequency) are sub-optimal from the local perspective.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to investigate the effects of decentralisation of ==== services with spillovers for individual regional authorities.==== We consider a federal system with a higher-level ‘federal’ government and several lower-level ‘regional’ governments, and we study the provision of a public service that can be provided by each of the different governments. To make this setting more concrete, we study the provision of a public transport service connecting the suburban and urban regions in a large metropolitan area. Both urban and suburban residents commute to a common central business district. Household labour supply requires commuting, and due to agglomeration economies, transport supply has a positive impact on urban productivity and wages. Road and public transport users suffer from congestion and crowding externalities, respectively, and road use imposes further inconveniences on urban residents. There are no congestion tolls; road use is under-priced. The two transport modes are imperfect substitutes so that some of the negative externalities of road use can be neutralised by high-quality and affordable public transport services. Public transport is operated under scale economies, and we consider both the fare and the frequency of service as explicit policy instruments. We then ask the following question: What is for a given region the preferred government to operate the public service under investigation? For example, under what conditions will the urban (suburban) region be better off if the public transport service were operated by the suburban (urban) or federal government?====Within this setting, the model distinguishes four potential regimes of transport provision: (i) centralised, ==== decision making; (ii) decentralised decision making by the ==== government; (iii) decentralised decision making by the ==== government; (iv) ==== service provision in monopoly.==== We study how the choice between these institutional regimes affects the quality and pricing of public transport. More importantly, using these results, we study the preferences of local (urban or suburban) residents in terms of public transport governance regimes.====The analysis shows that, in general, which governance structure is considered most appropriate by different regional communities depends on the extent of benefit spillovers, the magnitude of operational subsidies, and the allocation of the financial burden of the subsidies across regions. On the one hand, the region operating the service has control over pricing and frequency decisions. On the other hand, both the urban and suburban regions benefit from fiscal spillovers when another government provides the service. A free-rider strategy can then be realised in the centralised regime and especially when the neighbouring region becomes responsible for service provision.====Numerical implementation of the model to a generic but not unrealistic example finds that public transport provision leads to a financial deficit in all centralised and decentralised scenarios. Under such circumstances, local residents do not benefit from decentralising the service to their own government, primarily due to the subsidy burden. We find that the urban region achieves higher welfare with suburban control over the service and, more surprisingly, they consider privatisation as superior to their own urban governance regime. The suburban community would prefer federal service provision, because in this case fares are low and service quality is very high, and the subsidy burden can be shared with urbanites from a common tax pool. By contrast, the federal regime is the least preferred alternative for urban residents. These results suggest a potential conflicts of interest between the urban, suburban, and federal governments.====Our analysis is motivated by the diversity we observe in the governance of suburban public transport in cities around the world.==== For example, in several countries such as Austria, Belgium and Denmark, even purely suburban rail services are operated by national railway companies. In Paris, suburban rail supply is controlled by a transport authority owned by the surrounding Île-de-France region. In several German conurbations, the commuter networks are tendered by regional (state) authorities. The ownership structure of suburban railways may also change over time. For example, the rail network of London’s metropolitan area has been part of the national rail franchise system since the 1990s, but Transport for London, owned by the urban government, is now taking control of several lines including Crossrail, a new service linking the Eastern and Western suburbs through the city centre. By contrast, the city of Budapest in Hungary has handed over the suburban rail network it owned to the national railway operator in 2016. These examples suggest that a fiscal federalism approach is highly relevant in the context of public transport provision.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 relates the current paper to the literature on fiscal federalism and on the economics of public transport provision. In Section 3 we develop a model and derive analytical pricing and frequency rules for four governance regimes (centralised, urban, suburban, private). In Section 4 we implement these rules in a numerical simulation and investigate the main determinants of local support for decentralisation. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",Subsidised transport services in a fiscal federation: Why local governments may be against decentralised service provision,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012223000126,29 March 2023,2023,Research Article,1.0

Given two neighboring, competitive ports, the disasters may cause independent damages to either port, or to both ports simultaneously; consequently, some shippers avoid loss by using the unaffected port if an independent disaster occurs in their local port. Since such inter-port risk sharing benefit increases with the share of independent disasters in all disasters, the socially optimal investment decreases with the disaster independence. However, the risk sharing benefit only attributes to the shippers' surplus and does not attribute to profits from the port management, so it does not affect investment of private port authorities that maximize the profits. Such an ignorance of the risk sharing benefit by the private port authorities is likely to lead to underinvestment in disaster adaptation facilities under a lower disaster independence.","Seaports face risk of various natural disasters that destroy and significantly reduce their function. There are various types of disasters which differ in, among others, frequencies, scales, and measures to mitigate the damages. For example, natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and storm surges caused by climate change, have raised worldwide concerns for the past decade, and many countries have taken measures, or made the plans, to deal with the risk (e.g. ====; ====). Some countries also face other types of disasters, such as earthquakes, as well as climate change. In Japan, for example, earthquake resistance of ports has been promoted after several major earthquakes in recent years.====). ====Availability of the risk sharing is largely dependent on characteristics of disaster and the geographical characteristics of ports. For example, impact of climate change is more profound in low-lying ports such as those in the Netherlands (====). The 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake in Japan was a direct earthquake whose effect stayed local, so although the facilities at Kobe Port were devastated, those at the neighboring Osaka Port were not. In this way, even for nearby ports, possibility of risk sharing may increase when the degree and type of disaster risks they face are different. The possibility of such risk sharing in actual ports is case-by-case, and we need detailed assessments based on various scientific expertise in disaster prediction. It is nevertheless important to carry out economic analysis to actively utilize forecasts obtained through them for disaster countermeasures at individual ports.====In this study, we theoretically investigate socially desirable port investment and management by an appropriate combination of disaster adaptation investment in individual ports and risk sharing between ports. Many existing studies have investigated disaster adaptation investments by private and public entities, considering only disasters that have symmetric and simultaneous impacts on two competing ports (====; ====; ====, ====; ====; ====). ==== also considered asymmetric disaster scales between ports, and investigated disaster adaptation investments with possible contracts between terminal operators to transfer excess capacity in the case when disasters occur. While we extend the two-port model analyzed in several previous studies, this is the first study to consider possibility of independent (so-called “local”) disasters at each port, as well as the wide-spreading (“common”) disasters that affect both ports.==== As a consequence, we consider that shippers can switch to the other port when their local port is damaged by a local disaster. Furthermore, we introduce a parameter to represent the share of such local disasters to represent the degree of independence of disastrous shocks between the ports, which is simply called “disaster independence”. We find that, when the disaster independence is high and the expected disaster scale is enormous, the socially optimal level of disaster adaptation investment is small because disaster risk can be mitigated rather by the inter-port functional sharing.==== Finally, we examine the effect of geographical distance between two ports. When the distance is large, risk sharing becomes less available and social necessity for adaptive investment increases, while equilibrium investment levels of privatized port management may decline due to reduced port competition.====This paper is organized as follows. Section ==== presents the model, and Section ==== provides the basic analysis. Section ==== investigates the various forms of port investment and management. Section ==== examines several extensions of the basic settings. Finally, Section ==== contains concluding remarks.",How should ports share risk of natural and climate change disasters?

When a regulator maximizes the utility of consumers, the profit of service providers, or the weighted sum of both, it prefers single-till regulation when there is a positive profit from the non-core good. On the contrary, when the regulator maximizes the profit of the (infrastructure) monopoly, dual-till regulation is preferred if the profit from the non-core good is positive. Under a positive profit from the non-core good, consumers and service providers prefer single-till regulation, while the monopoly prefers dual-till regulation. Consumers and service providers thus have an opposite preference to the monopoly. If a regulator implements dual-till regulation under a positive profit from the non-core good, it reveals its preference for the monopoly's profit, suggesting that the regulator may be captured by the monopoly."," examine this question theoretically, and demonstrate that the answer depends largely on the following two conditions. The first condition is whether the solutions under social welfare maximization yield a positive or negative regulatory profit; and second, whether the profit of non-core business is positive or negative. For example, if the solution under unconstrained welfare maximization yields a negative regulatory profit and the profit from non-core business is positive, then single-till regulation yields higher welfare.====When implementing regulations in practice, the second condition is clear and relatively easy to verify. For instance, large airports often earn large profits from non-aeronautical service (i.e. non-core businesses in the context of an airport).==== In contrast, the first condition is more difficult to apply in practice, because the regulator needs to know a hypothetical regulatory profit under unconstrained welfare maximization, which is not directly observable.====In this paper, we show that the first condition is not needed in certain specific cases. If the first condition is unnecessary, given that the second condition is directly observable, a regulator can arrive at which regulation, single-till or dual-till, is preferable much more easily. Our result is therefore effective in helping design regulatory policies in practice. Moreover, our method can, as explained below, be used to unveil the regulator's preference for the benefit of users (i.e., consumers and service providers) or for the profit of a regulated monopoly.====Our main results are as follows: First, when a regulator maximizes the utility of consumers (e.g., air passengers), single-till regulation is desirable when the non-core good yields a positive profit. In this case, under unconstrained social welfare maximization (maximization of consumers' utility), the optimal prices of the core and non-core goods are zero, because lowering prices makes consumers' utility higher. Zero prices make the regulatory profit negative. Thus, the first condition is automatically determined by the assumption that the regulator maximizes consumers’ utility, and only the second condition of a positive profit from the non-core good matters.====Second, when the regulator maximizes the profit of service providers (e.g., airlines who use the airport as an input), single-till regulation is also desirable under a positive profit from the non-core good. In this case, under unconstrained social welfare maximization (maximization of the profits of service providers), the optimal prices of the core and non-core goods are zero. This is because: i) lowering price of the core good makes the profit of service providers higher; and ii) lowering price of the non-core good makes the demand for the core good higher, which in turn increases the profit of service providers, under the assumption that the core and non-core goods are complementary. Zero prices make the regulatory profit negative. Thus, again, the first condition is automatically determined by the assumption that the regulator maximizes the profit of service providers, and only the second condition of a positive profit from the non-core good matters. Third, as a natural consequence of the above two results, single-till regulation is preferred under a positive profit from the non-core good, when the regulator maximizes the weighted sum of consumers’ utility and the profits of service providers.====Fourth, when the regulator maximizes the profit of the (infrastructure) monopoly, dual-till regulation is preferred if the profit from the non-core good is positive. This is because the monopoly's profit is larger when the positive profit from the non-core good is unregulated. Consequently, if the profit from the non-core good is positive, consumers and service providers prefer single-till regulation while the monopoly prefers dual-till regulation. In a nutshell, under a positive profit from the non-core good, consumers and service providers prefer single-till regulation, whilst the monopoly prefers dual-till regulation; consumers and service providers have a totally opposite preference to the monopoly. Our result thus offers a formal demonstration of the regulatory practice showing that airports in general are strongly in favor of dual-till regulation, whilst airlines are strongly in favor of single-till regulation (e.g., ====). Finally, the above results show that if a regulator implements dual-till regulation under a positive profit from the non-core good, then the regulator reveals its preference for the monopoly's profit, compared to consumers' utility or service providers' profit. This implies that the regulator is captured by the monopoly, because it can raise consumers' utility (or/and service providers profits) by adopting single-till regulation.====This study crucially depends on ====).”==== We consider that the regulator is captured by service providers when it maximizes service providers’ profit, and by the monopoly when it maximizes its profit. Single-till or dual-till regulation has been examined in a different context from regulatory capture theory,==== and the relationship between regulatory capture and the choice of single-till or dual-till regulation has not been formally analyzed. Thus, our result is a relevant contribution in this aspect too.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section ==== sets up the model. In Section ====, we derive results in the case of no congestion at the infrastructure/facility (e.g., airport); whereas in Section ====, we take the congestion into account. Section ==== shows the result of numerical examples. Section ==== concludes the analysis and discusses areas of further research.====First, we Prove ====.

Specifically, we construct a model in which the incumbent airline confronts the entry threat of an entrant airline and strategically decides whether to deter or accommodate the entrant airline by choosing its flight frequency. We show that concession revenue sharing between the airport and the incumbent airline may enhance the market power of the incumbent airline, which improves or harms welfare. In addition, concession revenue sharing also diminishes the incentive for the incumbent airline to deter entry, which improves welfare. Our novel results provide important policy implications by determining that the effects of concession revenue sharing depend on the revenue share rate and the airport capacity.","In recent years, airport management has faced several environmental changes. In particular, financial self-sufficiency has grown in importance, and thus airports do not rely on government support. Consequently, the commercialization of airports has accelerated worldwide, and concession (commercial) revenue from non-aeronautical activities has become increasingly important compared to revenue from traditional aeronautical activities, especially for private airports (e.g., ====).====In parallel with the growth of concession revenues, various vertical agreements between airports and airlines are becoming popular in practice (e.g., ====, ====, ====).==== As noted in ==== and ====, concession revenue sharing has been concluded between airports and airlines, such as Tampa International Airport in the US and Ryanair in Europe. In many other cases, revenue sharing occurs when airports allow airlines to hold their shares or manage their facilities. For example, Terminal 2 of Munich Airport was jointly funded by the airport operating company FMG (60%) and the airport’s dominant carrier, Lufthansa (40%) (====). Thus, concession revenue from this terminal is shared between FMG and Lufthansa.====Some previous studies (e.g., ====, ====) have pointed out that concession revenue sharing may have important implications for both competition and welfare, as discussed in detail in Section ====. Specifically, concession revenue sharing allows airlines and/or airports to internalize the demand complementarity between aeronautical and concession services. Hence, concession revenue sharing increases the outcomes of both types of services and improves their profits and welfare.====However, as shown by ====, revenue sharing with a specific airline may have anti-competitive effects. For example, concession revenue sharing can strengthen the airline’s market power and increase only that airline’s output, which may harm welfare. Such anti-competitive effects of concession revenue sharing with a specific airline can be applied to a situation in which an incumbent airline with a concession revenue sharing faces the threat of a new airline entering that airport. As shown in previous studies (e.g., ====, ====), although airlines often face potential entrants and attempt to strategically address them, it is still unclear how concession revenue sharing between an airport and an incumbent airline affects the strategy of that airline, which faces the threat of an entrant airline.====This paper investigates how concession revenue sharing affects an incumbent airline’s strategic flight frequency choice for entry deterrence and thus yields profits and welfare. Specifically, we consider a market consisting of an incumbent and a new entrant airline. The incumbent airline agrees to concession revenue sharing with an airport that has limited capacity and receives a part of its concession revenue. Since the incumbent airline chooses its flight frequency before the entrant airline, the incumbent airline strategically decides whether to deter or accommodate the entrant airline in its flight frequency. In other words, the incumbent airline can determine whether to deter the entrant airline by increasing its flight frequency, thereby occupying the limited airport capacity. Therefore, we explore the effects of concession revenue sharing with the airport on the flight frequency choice of the incumbent airline in the market.====Our results show concession revenue sharing has two different effects on the frequency choice. The first is the effect of encouraging the incumbent airline to increase its flight frequency to improve concession revenue, which has been discussed in previous studies. This effect raises the anti-competitive risk that the entrant airline will be blocked by non-strategic decisions pertaining to the flight frequency of the incumbent airline. However, once entry is accommodated, it helps airlines to provide high-quality (high flight frequency) services, resulting in welfare improvement.====Second, the incumbent airline considers the concession revenue from passengers of the entrant airline. This effect reduces the incentive for the incumbent airline to deter the entrant airline strategically. When the incumbent airline decides whether to deter the entrant airline, it faces a trade-off between the revenue from maintaining its ==== power and the cost of its excessive flight frequency. Concession revenue sharing increases the incumbent’s profit when the entry is accommodated. Hence, the incentive for the incumbent airline to maintain its monopoly power decreases relatively. Therefore, we propose that concession revenue sharing has another welfare-improving effect.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section ==== explains the related literature. In Section ====, we describe the setting of our model. Sections ====, ==== present the derivation of the equilibrium.

To date however, the impact of commuting on health and absenteeism has not been considered as part of the wider economic benefits of transport projects.====In this paper we take up the issue of commuting and sick-leave. There are two strands to the existing literature. One attempts to measure the effects of commuting time and distance on subjective and objective health outcomes, assuming that there is a direct or indirect link between commuting and health, or what may be called ==== absenteeism.==== ==== is an example of this approach. The other strand emphasizes the endogeneity of the decision to call in sick and may be termed the ==== absenteeism approach as in ==== and ====.====We follow the above papers and use an individual unbalanced panel of formal sector workers in Santiago, Chile, to study the effects of commuting time on sick-leave behavior between the first quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2019. This data comes from the Chilean unemployment insurance scheme and contains information on wages, type of labor contract, medical licenses, education, marital status, age, gender, residential location as well as the identity, location, ==== and firm size of the employer, among other variables. Our data is a publicly available random sample of 20% of all workers of the unemployment insurance scheme as of March 2019.====Observing a worker with a medical license in a given month is our indicator of sick-leave behavior. These licenses are granted by doctors if a worker is ill, had a work or non-work related accident or, in the====case of women, also for maternal leave, a pregnancy pathology or if she has a child under one year of age with a serious illness.==== The medical license will prescribe the number of days a worker can legally be absent from his or her employment due to health reasons.====Compared to previous studies, our data has several advantages. First, it is monthly rather than annual data. Second, it is a very large random sample, with over 39 million observations from over 500 thousand individual workers, reducing sampling bias, at least as formal sector workers are concerned. Third, previous studies use a measure of sick-leave that is self-reported and often refers to the number of days absent from employment during the last year. In contrast, in this paper, we have administrative data on whether a worker took sick-leave for each month, thus reducing measurement error considerably. Fourth, although locational data for workers and employers are at the municipal level (44 urban and sub-urban counties close to Santiago) we use a grid of 718 zones from the 2012 Santiago mobility survey (ESTRAUS zones) to estimate average commuting time for each municipal origin–destination pair, and do not rely on recall survey questions as is the case with most of the received literature (however, we are not able to identify travel mode in our data).====Another feature of our paper is that we analyze the effects of major transport investments in Santiago (the extension of the underground Metro system and one sub-urban commuter train) on sick-leave behavior. ==== evaluates the impact of a new metro line on labor market informality in Mexico City. However, neither of them take up the issue of sick-leave. As far as we are aware, our research is the only study of commuting time, transit investments and sick-leave in a developing country context.====Our empirical results indicate that longer commuting times to the workplace (highly correlated with distance) increase the probability of a worker taking some sick-leave in a given month.

However, there may still be a residual endogeneity issue if laid-off workers take the opportunity to find a new job with a location better suited to their particular circumstances. We argue further below that this potential endogeneity problem would most probably bias our results towards zero. Therefore, these results are conservative in the sense that they may underestimate the true effect of travel times on sick-leave behavior.====To estimate the economic importance of the relationship between commuting times and sick-leave, we simulate a 20% fall in average commuting travel-time (around 4.9 min per trip). This would reduce medical related work absence and generate an economic benefit of close to 36 million dollars per year.====With respect to infrastructure investments, results indicate that metro and commuter rail extensions during our sample period reduced sick-leave for those workers who potentially benefited from these projects. This suggests that there are additional benefits from these transit investment beyond conventional travel time savings.====To date few studies have analyzed the relationship between commuting time and absenteeism. Our literature review indicates that only one study looks into this issue directly (====). Our paper then contributes to bridge this gap in the literature and hopefully will motivate more research in this area.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a literature review of the relation between absenteeism and commuting time or distance. We explain the main features of our paper and how it fits into this literature. Following that, we present the data used, how variables were constructed and a descriptive analysis of sick-leave absenteeism for Santiago. We then present the model and estimation results, followed by an analysis of the impact of metro and rail extensions. We then present a discussion of the policy implications of our findings in the context of the ‘wider economic benefits’ of transport investments. The paper ends with a summary of our main conclusions and a discussion of potential avenues for future research.====Given its linear structure, the linear probability model is easy to estimate in a panel data setting. However, it is well known that this model may not be a good approximation to a true binary response model (e.g. logit or probit) when the outcomes are close to 0 or 1. However, estimating a non-linear binary response model with panel data is not trivial since it is usually not possible to factor out individual fixed effects. Even when this is possible, individual fixed effects are not estimated and thus marginal effects of changes in the independent variables of the model cannot be calculated.====In order to obtain marginal effects, all individual fixed effects must be estimated as parameters of the model. However, the number of these parameters increases with the number of individuals (====) in the data. This raises two problems. First, the computational difficulty of estimating such a large number of parameters. Second, the incidental parameter problem implying that coefficient estimates are not consistent as the number of individuals in the panel increases for a fixed ====.====To tackle both problems, ==== propose a pseudo-demeaning algorithm and incidental parameter bias correction to estimate logit or probit panel data models. Their algorithm exploits the sparseness of the Hessian matrix when fixed effects have to be estimated and is computationally more efficient by orders of magnitude compared to alternative algorithms for large ==== and/or ====. As for the incidental parameter problem, ==== use the bias correction proposed by ====.","Urban commuting time and sick-leave medical license use: An empirical study of Santiago, Chile",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000387,25 November 2022,2022,Research Article,6.0

We assess the cost-efficiency of policy instruments evaluating vehicle costs and prices, fuel costs, and externalities. We find that a carbon emissions standard achieves emission reductions at a much lower cost than a portfolio mandate for electric cars.","There is a clear gap in the EU's emissions reduction policy: transportation. While countries across the EU continue to decrease national emissions through the tradable emission system for industry and power generation (EU ETS) and through building and electric appliance regulations for the building sector, transport emissions continue to grow. The transport sector stands for 27% of total EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2017. Road transport is responsible for 73% of the transport emissions and more specifically cars stand for 44,5% of GHG emissions (EEA, 2017). The EU relies on two overlapping instruments to reduce CO==== emissions in the light vehicle segment. There is the minimum 10% share of renewable fuels in the car sector and there is the CO==== performance standard for new passenger vehicles. In the last years, the car sector relied mainly on biofuels to reach the mandated share of 10% renewable power in the transport sector. However, the new directive on renewable energy in the EU (RED II), sets out new biofuel sustainability criteria that will be difficult to meet by with current biofuels, the minimum renewable energy share of transport will be met by the introduction of Electric Vehicles (EV).====The EU does not see the current taxes on gasoline and diesel as carbon taxes because these taxes are within the authority of the member states. The automotive fuel taxes are used to raise general tax revenue, to pay for the road infrastructure and to limit other externalities of car use, but, in the end, they act as carbon taxes. They act as carbon taxes because they are strictly proportional to the amount of fuel (and carbon) consumed. The level of automotive fuel taxes is high in the EU and makes the road transport sector the sector with, by far, the highest carbon taxes: 200 to 300 €/ton of CO==== compared with ETS prices of 30–80 € and almost zero carbon prices for home heating in some countries (OECD, 2019). So, even if the emissions in the road transport sector did not decrease, this sector is not the priority sector in terms of cost-efficient climate policy.====With this background, one needs a good benefit-cost analysis to justify stricter CO==== performance standards for cars. In the EU, the regulation on emissions of new cars sold in the EU in 2030 will limit the emissions to practically half of the average emission level in 2019 (59 g of CO==== per vehicle kilometer rather than the 110–115 g emitted in 2019). There are currently plans in the FIT for 55 framework to implement even stronger standards for 2035. By 2035, all new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU should be zero-carbon (European Commission, 2021). The Electric Vehicles are considered as zero CO==== emission cars==== and are therefore an important element in achieving the emission reduction target.====In the US, there have been several cost-benefit assessments of stricter emission standards for new cars. Goulder et al. (2012) used a monopolistic competition model of the US car market with seven differentiated producers to examine the effects of fuel efficiency standards for the average of the new cars they sell in California. Producers can improve the fuel efficiency of their car sales by changing the pricing of their models but also by technological improvements that are costly. The technological improvement is specific to each producer. They also take into account the side effects on the secondhand car market. Their main finding is the large leakage (>80%) of a fuel efficiency standard at the level of a US state. Gillingham and Langford (2019) assess retroactively the benefits and costs of introducing hybrids and find high market benefits on top of the environmental benefits. For the EU there are much less assessments of fuel efficiency standards. The European Commission (European Commission, 2017b) produced its own positive regulatory assessment of the fuel efficiency standard for cars abstracting largely from a market framework. This assessment is problematic on several accounts. First, it assumes that consumers are very myopic and only take into account the fuel costs of the first three years. Second, they consider the consumer price rather than the producer price of fuel as the resource cost of gasoline. Third they assume irrational behavior for the car producers.====The direct effects of regulations and price incentives on EV penetration have already been widely studied using empirical consumer choice models. The emphasis in these studies was to find the most effective instrument to increase the share of electric vehicles in the market and not to assess the cost-efficiency of the reduction of the average emissions of cars.====In this paper we take a simplified but more global stance to the assessment of the fuel efficiency standard set by the EU. We study the cost-efficiency of different instruments, including explicitly the demand and supply response to incentives. The supply response is essential to assess the dynamic abatement costs: what is the welfare cost of decreasing strongly the emissions in the car sector via fuel efficiency regulations when also the cost of developing new technologies is included. More specifically, we offer three complementary contributions to this literature.====The first contribution is to clarify the discussion on the role of different policy instruments on future costs and performance via R&D and learning by doing, so including the lagged effects of policy instruments. This is necessary to arrive at a correct dynamic cost comparison of policies. Too often one compares the user costs of a new technology once the technology has been fully developed and its production scaled up (future electric car) with the user cost of the old technology (present gasoline car).====The second contribution is to include a reduced representation of the power sector as EV may serve as complement to the introduction of renewable energies. The third contribution is to include the other external effects of car use in addition to climate external costs.====To include the learning by doing and the R&D effects, we adapt the two period renewable electricity model of Fischer and Newell (2008) to the passenger car market. We distinguish only two types of cars: Gasoline Vehicles (GVs) and Electric battery vehicles (EVs) that are produced by a limited number of producers that behave competitively. EVs can become cheaper through two knowledge building effects: by learning by doing and by pure R&D. Also, the fuel efficiency of GVs can improve over time thanks to pure R&D. How much both technologies improve depends on the policies in place. Policies can incentivize car producers to produce more electric cars (learning by doing) but can also stimulate them to invest in R&D that reduces the costs of EVs and the cost of more fuel efficient GVs. Consumers are differentiated in function of the number of days per year they make a short or long trip. This differentiation serves two purposes. As EVs still have a difficulty to cover the long trips, this will segment the consumers between EV adopters and GV adopters. The number of days with short trips will also determine the availability of car batteries for Vehicle to Grid (V2G) storage. The electricity production model used is simple and the V2G option is modelled as in Greaker et al. (2022).====We use the two-period model for a simplified dynamic cost comparison of two main types of policy instruments: tradable carbon emission standards for new cars and a tradable portfolio mandate with a minimum of electric vehicle sales. This numerical comparison offers several insights. First, it shows that the market share of EVs depends strongly on the type of policy instrument used. Second, we find that the share of EVs is not necessarily a good indicator for a successful carbon policy. We find that the carbon emission standards for new cars with a tradeable permit scheme across car producers can achieve the emissions reduction goals at a lower cost than the portfolio mandate that focusses on a minimum share of new electric cars. Third, a fuel efficiency standard can reduce carbon emissions in the car sector at average costs of 100 €/ton of CO==== while simple tax and purchase tax instruments may cost well over 200 €/ton of CO====.====Our paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we survey the existing policy instruments with a focus on the EU. In section 3, we present the formal model and in section 4, we derive the effects of different policy instruments in the theoretical model. In section 5, we discuss the calibration of the model using data for the German and European car market. We present the policy results in section 6.

This is driven by concerns over low driver wages. Two recent labor regulations that were passed in California are Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) and Proposition 22 (Prop 22). AB5 classifies drivers (and other gig-economy workers) as employees as opposed to contractors. The implication is that ride-hailing companies must pay drivers a minimum wage and associated benefits, and that the drivers work full-time. This negatively impacts the TNC business model in two ways: (a) wage effect: higher wages and benefits reduce profit margins significantly, and (b) flexibility effect: having a base of full time drivers reduces the ability of TNCs like Uber and Lyft to match driver supply to customer demand on a fine temporal scale. As an alternative, TNCs lobbied fiercely for Prop 22. This regulation offers drivers 120% of minimum wage, but only for driving hours spent servicing a trip (====).====This paper studies the impacts of these and other possible regulations using data from the city of San Francisco. We develop a market-equilibrium model that captures passenger demand and driver supply in response to TNC’s ==== decisions. We show that the flexibility effect under AB5 can be largely mitigated by offering staggered driver shifts. The wage effect is substantial and undermines the viability of the TNC business model. We find that the wage effect leads to a 18% decrease in TNC profit, whereas the flexibility effect results in a profit reduction ranging between 1%–10% depending on how shifts are designed. On the other hand, Prop 22 will preserve TNC profitability, but the guaranteed engaged time wage promised by Prop 22 is insufficient to materially increase driver wages. We show that this concern cannot be addressed by further increasing the engaged time wage, as it will increase passenger fares, increase driver cruising time, reduce efficiency, and significantly reduce TNC profit. We then suggest suitable modifications to each of the above regulations that can improve outcomes for drivers and passengers without jeopardizing the TNC business model.",None,An analysis of labor regulations for transportation network companies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000351,5 November 2022,2022,Research Article,10.0

However, this goal can only be achieved if the tax reduction is indeed passed through to consumers. Previous studies on tax reduction pass-through rates have focused mainly on products with relatively stable prices. In contrast to such products, the prices of airline tickets, train tickets, or hotel rooms are not stable, but can vary significantly in terms of factors such as travel dates or purchase timing (e.g. booking early vs. booking late). Prices in these markets are often determined by profit-maximizing revenue management (RM) systems. Such an RM system would, however, not only determine prices, but also impact on pass-through rates if taxes were reduced. Against this backdrop, we provide novel insights into the tax pass-through literature by analyzing the influence of an RM system on value-added tax (VAT) reduction pass-through rates in Germany’s long-distance passenger rail market.====In Germany, there are generally two different VAT rates: the regular rate of 19%, and a reduced rate of 7%. Long-distance passenger rail transport has been subject to the regular rate, but in September 2019, the German Federal Government agreed on various measures to support climate protection, one of which was increasing the attractiveness of long-distance passenger rail transport by reducing its VAT rate from 19% to 7%. The VAT reduction became effective in law on January 1, 2020.====The CEO of Deutsche Bahn (DB), the largest german railway company, stated that they would completely pass-through the tax reduction to passengers (Deutsche Bahn, 2019). Also, DB stated that they would refrain from the usual annual price increase, which implies that passenger prices should have been reduced by ====. In Germany, the displayed prices are always tax-inclusive, thereby corresponding to what passengers actually pay.====The VAT reduction, and DB’s pledge to pass it through completely, makes for an interesting case of policy analysis. This is due to the different ticket options that DB offers. On the one hand, the more expensive “Flexpreis” tickets have a fixed price per city-pair, are valid for all trains on the booked city-pair and travel date, can be cancelled at no cost, and thus offer considerable flexibility for passengers.==== On the other hand, there is a limited number of “Sparpreis” tickets with generally cheaper prices determined by an RM system (Wagner et al., 2020). They are tied to a specific connection and cannot be cancelled for free. The first part of the theory section below is dedicated to the price-setting considerations that DB faces, as we shed more light on the basic insights of the demand determinants when both fixed-price tickets with flexible connection choice, as well as cheaper, connection-bound tickets with varying prices are offered.====Due to the above differences in ticket types, passing through the VAT reduction to passengers might not be straightforward. While a complete pass-through should be easy to implement in a booking system for fixed price tickets, a complete and equal pass-through can be complicated when prices are determined by a profit-maximizing RM system. These prices generally increase when booking closer to the departure date, which is reflected in a rising price path. A full pass-through of the VAT decrease would then tilt this price path downwards — which, however, might no longer be optimal for the RM system. Consequently, the RM system would re-optimize the new price path, potentially leading to different pass-through rates for different purchase timings.====To further illustrate this notion, we consider a simple example with two prices under the old VAT regime: a lower price ==== charged to the earliest bookers, and a higher price ==== that is charged when all tickets with the lower price are already sold. Complete pass-through is then announced and confirmed by displaying the new ticket prices ==== and ====, respectively. Effective pass-through now depends not only on changes in ticket prices, but also on the availability of lower price tickets. If the price reduction for the cheaper tickets leads to an earlier date of selling them, there will be customers that would now have to buy the higher price tickets instead of the lower price tickets, thus facing effective pass-through rates different from 100%. Moreover, the ratio of lower price tickets to higher price tickets (which is not known to the public) can change because of the increased demand, resulting in a different number and share of passengers traveling with cheaper tickets and thereby again impacting on effective pass-through rates.====Our paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, we extend the work on tax pass-through by explicitly deriving a general pass-through expression for an ad valorem tax rate under monopoly. The importance of pass-through rates for optimal taxation is highlighted by Myles (1989), who shows that optimal tax rules depend on the degree of forward-shifting of changes in taxation. Bulow and Pfleiderer (1983) show for three different demand curve forms that cost pass-through depends on the demand curve form. We then add to the literature on general pass-through rates by extending the monopoly case described for a unit tax in Weyl and Fabinger (2013), to a situation with an ad valorem tax. Previous comparisons of ad valorem and unit taxation are conducted by Delipalla and Keen (1992) for a Cournot oligopoly with homogeneous products, and by Anderson et al. (2001) for a Bertrand oligopoly with differentiated products. Similar to the monopolistic unit-tax pass-through rate that is outlined in Weyl and Fabinger (2013), our expression for the ad valorem case shows that the ad valorem pass-through rates of a profit-maximizing monopolist also depend on the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of the inverse marginal cost curve, and the elasticity of the inverse marginal surplus function.==== Thus, using a profit-maximizing RM system could make pass-through rates of Sparpreis tickets dependent on these characteristics and reduce the monopolist’s power to strictly pass through 100% of the VAT reduction to each passenger group.====Second, we are – to the best of our knowledge – the first to empirically analyze the degree to which taxes are passed through to consumers in the context of RM-based price setting systems. In our context, RM can be described as the “practice of controlling the availability and/or pricing of travel seats in different booking classes with the goal of maximizing expected revenues or profits” (McGill and van Ryzin, 1999 p.==== ====250). The authors also note that the term revenue management “has largely replaced the original term yield management” (McGill and van Ryzin, 1999 p.==== ====250). For sectors with relatively stable prices and where RM systems are uncommon, however, there exists a larger number of papers analyzing the empirical pass-through rates of tax reforms. The literature shows that for most sectors with rather stable prices, tax reductions were only passed through partially to consumers (e.g. Benzarti and Carloni (2019) for French sit-in restaurants, or Kosonen (2015) for Finnish hairdressing services). While tax reductions are often only passed through partially, the pass-through rates for tax increases are generally higher than for tax reductions (e.g. Benzarti et al., 2020, Doyle and Samphantharak, 2008, Kenkel, 2005). Additional analyses show that pass-through rates can differ significantly between sectors (Carbonnier, 2007), and that the degree of over- or under-shifting also depends on the type of taxation, with a greater effect of specific taxation than of ad valorem taxation (Delipalla and O’Donnell, 2001). In addition, the level of competition (Hindriks and Serse, 2019) or the type of store (Harju et al., 2018) can impact on pass-through rates, and constraints in the supply chain reduce tax pass-through rates (Marion and Muehlegger, 2011). For a more detailed overview of analyses of pass-through rates for products with stable prices, we refer to Benedek et al. (2020).====In the empirical part of our paper, we then use an extensive set of fixed-price Flexpreis and RM-based Sparpreis ticket price observations from before and after the VAT reduction, in order to calculate and analyze pass-through rates. The empirical results show that the VAT reduction was passed through completely to passengers traveling with fixed-price Flexpreis tickets, with pass-through rates very close to 100%. For passengers traveling with RM-based Sparpreis tickets, however, pass-through rates can vary significantly from 100% – depending on when they travel and when they book their tickets. In general, pass-through rates are higher when booking closer to the departure date and for more expensive Sparpreis tickets. Hence, it appears that less price-elastic passengers benefit more from the VAT reduction than others. This pattern need not be the deliberate intention of DB, which pledged to completely pass through the VAT reduction, but can also be the result of using an RM system for its Sparpreis ticket prices.====Third, we add to the literature on price-setting in the transport sector. The transport-related literature on price setting behavior based on RM systems often refers to the airline market. As outlined by Alderighi et al. (2015), there are two main strands of theory for price-setting behavior in the airline market. The capacity-based theories suggest that the prices of remaining tickets increase with the number of seats already sold (Dana, 1999, Deneckere and Peck, 2012). Time-based theories suggest that intertemporal price discrimination is used to exploit the heterogeneity of consumers, which can exert two opposing effects on prices: (i) advanced-purchase discounts can reduce ticket prices for early-bookers and thus lead, c.p., to increasing prices when booking closer to the departure date (e.g. Gale and Holmes, 1993, Dana, 1998), (ii) the higher risk of potentially unsold seats reduces the option value of further waiting for passengers with a higher willingness to pay (WTP), thus leading to decreasing prices when booking closer to the departure date (e.g. Gallego and van Ryzin, 1994, Möller and Watanabe, 2010). Empirical papers find support for both capacity-based and time-based theories (Alderighi et al., 2015). The overall price dispersion in the airline market depends, among other factors, on the level of competition, with Borenstein and Rose (1994) and Stavins (2001) finding a positive effect, and Gerardi and Shapiro (2009) finding a negative effect when using an improved panel data regression setup. Dai et al. (2014) find a non-monotonic effect of competition on price dispersion, with a positive impact in concentrated markets and a negative impact in competitive markets. In contrast to the airline market, price setting in other transport markets is understudied. Exceptions are Bharill and Rangaraj (2008), who consider the ticket price structure of the Indian Railway, and Gaggero et al. (2019), who analyze the price setting of Flixbus, the European market leader for long-distance bus services. Accordingly, our paper provides valuable insights into the price-setting behavior of one of Europe’s largest railway companies.====Fourth, the literature on tax pass-through rates for the transport sector is, to the best of our knowledge, generally very scarce. Jørgensen and Santos (2014) theoretically analyze pass-through rates under different competitive scenarios. They show that tax pass-through rates are highest under collusion, and lowest under Cournot competition with complementary services. With substitute services, the results are ambiguous. For the US airline industry, Bradley and Feldman (2020) find that having to post tax-inclusive prices instead of tax-exclusive prices leads to a shift of the tax incidence from consumers to producers, and Chuang (2021) finds that domestic aviation taxes are over-shifted to passengers in the US. None of the transport-related papers in the literature, however, analyze VAT pass-through rates in the long-distance passenger rail market or consider the idiosyncrasies that exist when dealing with prices that are determined by RM systems.====Fifth, we study the interesting case of an explicitly stated pledge of one company to pass through the tax reduction completely to all customers, and the subsequent implications for actual pass-through rates. We show that DB can only deliver on its promise for the fixed-price Flexpreis tickets, whereas pass-through rates may differ significantly from 100% for certain passenger groups traveling with RM-based Sparpreis tickets. This has interesting policy implications, because it shows that in markets where RM systems are common, tax reforms might not have the intended impact on customer prices — even if companies pledge to pass through the entire tax reform. Thus, companies that use RM systems run the risk of losing the power to pass-through the changes in taxation exactly as they want to. Actual pass-through rates are then determined by the RM system itself, based on various factors such as customer’s approximated demand elasticities.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, the theory of DB’s price setting behavior is outlined, and general pass-through rates for a monopoly with an ad valorem tax are derived. The data used in the empirical part is described in Section 3, and Section 4 analyzes the determinants of DB ticket prices. The actual pass-through rates are analyzed for fixed-price Flexpreis tickets in Section 5, and for price-varying Sparpreis tickets in Section 6. The results are discussed and policy implications drawn in Section 7, with Section 8 concluding.",I would if I could: Passing through VAT reductions in the german rail industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000375,28 October 2022,2022,Research Article,11.0

Regarding punctuality as an essential prerequisite for an IIT, we would not recommend doing so. Regarding overall welfare, the situation is less clear. We model both a route ","With its four railway packages, the European Commission (EC) has gradually liberalized the railway market over the past twenty years. For non-profitable passenger rail services (usually short-distance), the Commission aims at competition for the market, whereas for commercial passenger rail services (usually long-distance), the Commission aims at competition in the market, also called on-track competition (Perennes, 2017). The idea behind this is to make rail services more attractive in terms of quality and fares and to raise efficiency.====However, at least in Germany, despite being one of the countries with open access to long-distance passenger rail services, intense on-track competition is not evident so far. Furthermore, it has been decided politically to introduce an integral interval timetable==== (IIT), also for long-distance services. For franchised short-distance services, an IIT already existed on a regional level, but the coordination of the various systems was still lacking. With the aim of shifting more traffic on to the environmentally friendly rail mode, politicians now want to tackle this. Thus, implementing the IIT concept on a supraregional level throughout Germany for short- and long-distance as well as freight rail services, which was initially a vision of individual industry players, has become part of the current government’s program. Accordingly, a target timetable has been developed on behalf of the Ministry of Transport, which infrastructure planning in particular will have to be based on. This master plan is called Deutschland-Takt.====In this course, it is possible to induce on-track competition. The predefined IIT-train-paths==== could be allocated to train operating companies (TOCs) in such a way that several operators run trains, compete for passengers (to express it more precisely), on the same route. Alternatively, the IIT-train-paths could be allocated to TOCs in such a way that only one operator runs trains on each route (Cherbonnier et al., 2018). The empirical literature does not clearly show whether on-track competition, where it occurs, produces the desired effects. For Sweden, Italy and the Czech Republic, there is empirical evidence that market entry, as expected, goes along with lower fares.==== This effect is at least short-term and varies in size. However, Laroche and Lamatkhanova (2022) investigate the impact of intramodal competition on the interurban railway market in Europe (more specifically, considering France, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany), and thereby also take intermodal competition with coach and carpooling services into account. They find that on-track competition has a significant positive effect on frequencies, but no significant effect on economy class fares. This might be due to the fact that on-track competition is mostly between the incumbent and a newcomer, who avoids a price war for getting profitable. Regarding the profitability of TOCs, Tomeš et al. (2016) stress that it is jeopardized by on-track competition, they find a negative impact on profits.====It is at this point that the question arises whether on-track competition is (still) desirable when introducing an IIT, i.e. when the frequency of service is exogenous and thus not a decision variable of the TOCs. Related to this question are the following: Does on-track competition lead to more punctuality as an essential prerequisite for an IIT? Does it lead to lower fares and cost-efficiency? According to the IIT concept, short- and long-distance trains usually run at half-hourly or hourly intervals, arrive at hubs from various directions almost simultaneously, and depart again in various directions after a short transfer time. This leaves reliable slots for freight transport and passengers should benefit from convenient transfers (Hesse, 2019). Since transfer times in an IIT are particularly short, trains have to be particularly punctual. The fact that punctuality is a prerequisite for an IIT is therefore indisputable.====Thus, the first step is to determine whether punctuality is the responsibility of TOCs at all. According to a study on punctuality in rail traffic in Germany, which was carried out by kcw on behalf of the Green Party, the following events are among the most frequent causes of delay: A lack of rolling stock due to limited reserves, delayed provision of trains and a lack of (vehicle- or route-informed) staff (Berschin et al., 2019). Although staff shortages are a general problem in the railway sector and punctuality also depends on infrastructure and other external conditions, punctuality is thus the responsibility of TOCs, at least to a certain extent.====In this paper, we attempt to find answers to the above-mentioned questions. We therefore model both a route duopoly==== and a monopoly, and compare them from the perspective of welfare economics. We find that in a route monopoly, trains are more punctual and fares are higher than in a duopoly. This is because a monopolist is not exposed to intramodal price competition, which may be at the expense of quality in the form of punctuality. Furthermore, a monopolist has a fixed cost advantage when investing in punctuality. If the market is regulated in such a way that rail traffic is maximized, welfare is higher in a monopoly. If such regulation is not binding anyway, this result does not change without it. Otherwise, without regulation, welfare is higher in a monopoly if the lower delay costs overcompensate for the higher fare, so that more passengers travel by train, compared to a duopoly, or if the fact that in the monopoly, there are fewer passengers is overcompensated for by the higher monopoly profit.====This result is in line with that of Alvarez-SanJaime et al. (2015). They simulate on-track competition between two TOCs on a high speed rail line and a competing air transport service operator, and find that the entry of a private TOC increases welfare only if it entails a very large increase in rail-traffic demand. Broman and Eliasson (2019) also simulate on-track competition, and conclude that it certainly increases welfare, since passengers acquire large gains at the expense of operators. They consider competition on fare and quality as we do, but in the form of frequency, which is fixed in the IIT-framework we analyze. In contrast to the duopoly model on which our analysis is based, the dominant TOC does have an incentive to invest in quality (here: additional departures). If its frequency is higher than that of the newcomer, price competition is weakened. We do not consider a dominant TOC at all, because we assume competition on a level playing field in the EU’s target.====Analyzing the two market forms from the perspective of welfare economics initially led us to Spence (1975). He finds that, whether quality is set higher or lower than the social optimum, depends on the difference between consumers’ marginal and average valuations of quality. But it is – unlike with price – not a question of market form. Additionally, the duopoly model of vertical and (exogenous) horizontal product differentiation of Ma and Burgess (1993) contains valuable insights concerning our research question. They eliminate the Spence effect by using linear demand functions, so that consumers’ marginal and average valuations of quality are always equal, and obtain the following result: When firms compete for consumers by setting quality and prices sequentially, and higher quality requires higher fixed (and marginal) costs, quality is set lower than the social optimum whereas the price is set above marginal cost, since firms have some market power from horizontal product differentiation. Quality is set lower than socially optimal, since firms anticipate a price war, instigated by the respective other competitive firm when being at a quality disadvantage. To prevent the price war, in equilibrium, firms strategically underinvest in quality.====For Great Britain, Smith and Ojeda Cabral (2022) find that quality in the form of punctuality for most TOCs comes at a cost. There are proactive and reactive costs of punctuality and unpunctuality, respectively. Proactive costs of punctuality for (maintaining) the rolling stock and staff are mainly fixed costs, which are not incurred for every single service, and certainly not for every single passenger. Thus, by running more services on a fixed route, a TOC can generate economies of density (Wheat and Smith, 2015). Moreover, TOCs invest in punctuality before setting short-term fares. If fares are the same for all departure times, which are fixed with an IIT, passengers nevertheless prefer different departure times, i.e. there is exogenous horizontal product differentiation. This renders the duopoly model of Ma and Burgess (1993) applicable to the railway and for our question in particular. We not only apply, but also complement and extend the duopoly model by deriving the market result (in terms of punctuality and fare) in the reference monopoly case, and by relaxing the assumption of an infinite reservation price. According to Webers (1996), the idea of introducing a finite reservation price is due to Lerner and Singer (1937) and Smithies (1941).====With our paper, we pick up where Smoliner et al. (2018) left off. They comparatively analyze the IIT-implementation in Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, and conclude that only with public service contracts, can one rely on a centrally planned IIT.==== In terms of awarding IIT-train-paths in the framework of public service contracts, Smoliner et al. (2018) stress that bundling the train paths should be evaluated further. They already note that train path bundles should not be too big, in order to attract private TOCs (see also Nash et al., 2019), whereas the circulation of rolling stock and further parameters should also play a role. In a previous paper on the welfare effects of on-track competition, we concluded that, if delay is common and tickets are operator-tied, with respect to bundling train paths one should also consider the impact on the effective frequency (Brand and Sieg, 2020). In this paper, as the next step, we endogenize delay. In doing so, we contribute to the related literature in that we identify further aspects that should be taken into account when bundling IIT-train-paths for award.",An integral interval timetable for long-distance passenger rail services: Time to reconsider targeting on-track competition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000363,18 October 2022,2022,Research Article,12.0

Nowadays there are almost 2 000 BSS in operation worldwide and several cities are planning new BSS (Yu et al., 2021). This rapid expansion seems to be explained both by the need to reinforce sustainable urban transport policies and by the availability of new technologies that make these systems feasible, convenient, accessible and safe (Fishman, 2016).====Even though shared bicycles are generally seen as a sustainable travel mode, their environmental impact is somehow contested. In general, the effect of BSS on traffic related externalities depends on two factors, the travel mode that users would have used should the BSS be not available, and the amount of vehicle-kilometers introduced by the relocation of bicycles, usually made with motorized vehicles such as small trucks. Assuming that BSS replaces walking for short trips and taxis for long trips, Zhang and Mi (2018) estimate large reductions in petrol consumption and CO==== and NO==== emissions from the BSS in Shanghai. A more nuanced picture emerges from Fishman et al. (2014), who estimate a reduction on motorized vehicle use due to bike sharing in Melbourne, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Washington D.C., but an increase in London, the latter explained by a low substitution of car trips, relative to the addition of truck kilometers to rebalance the bicycle fleet.====Beyond environmental effects, the financial aspects of BSS have not been studied in depth. According to Midgley (2009), most systems need to be financially supported by public transport agencies or through public resources, either directly or indirectly through private-public alliances, where typically advertisement rights are waived in return for the operation of the systems. In China, BSS have been heavily subsidized by municipal governments to encourage non-motorized transportation and offer flexible, convenient and low-cost mobility options (Lohry and Yiu, 2015). Another example is Bicing, the Barcelona system, which is financed in part with revenues from car parking fees (Midgley, 2009).====The issue of financing BSS is inherently related to the decision on how to price the use of shared bicycles in an optimal or efficient manner. In order to address the problem of setting optimal pricing rules in BSS, the case of public transport is quite illustrative, as it shows that design and pricing are two faces of the same problem. For synthesis, the resources consumed in the production of trips are twofold: on the one hand there is investment and operation of the system and, on the other, there is the time contributed by the users when accessing or egressing (walking to and from a station), waiting at the origin or destination (for a vehicle or for a site to park, respectively), and riding the vehicles. In public transport the optimal design attained by minimizing the sum of all elements is such that service frequency (measured in vehicles per hour) and vehicle size increases and the spacing of lines diminishes as patronage grows (Mohring, 1972; Jansson, 1980; Chang and Schonfeld, 1991). The overall effect is that average user's time diminishes (scale economies) making marginal costs lower than average costs. This results in an optimal fare that falls below operator's costs when average users' costs (the time already paid by the users) are subtracted from the total marginal costs, inducing an optimal subsidy (Jara-Diaz and Gschwender, 2003). In essence, this happens because of the reduction in both access time and in waiting time –the so-called ====–.====The inclusion of a passenger crowding externality in public transport design has been shown to challenge frequency-related total cost savings, as crowding increases the users' cost==== and the optimal fare, which in the presence of crowding externalities covers a larger part of the operator's cost (e.g., Tirachini et al., 2014; Börjesson et al., 2017; Jara-Diaz et al., 2022). Crowding externalities in public transport also increase the frequency of service and the size of vehicles (Jara-Díaz et al., 2005). In the case of bike-sharing, a crowding effect happens when demand is close to supply, because users cannot find available bicycles at stations straightaway, increasing waiting time. Ideally, the BSS design should avoid such circumstances as much as possible, either through optimal decisions on the number of bikes and the number, location and size of stations, or through fleet rebalancing activities to optimize the spatial deployment of bikes.====The previous discussion suggests that in the case of the BSS the growth of demand in space is likely to induce an (optimal) increase of four design variables: the number of stations (spacing reduction), the number of bicycles, the number of sites, and the number of bicycles repositioned. Indeed, all four elements have a cost, but their increase would have a positive impact on users by reducing access and waiting times.====It is therefore convenient to study the optimal design and pricing of a BSS considering all the resources consumed, i.e., those contributed by the operator (capital and operating costs) plus those contributed by the users (their time). The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we synthesize an enormous amount of information regarding characteristics of a number of BSS where data is either available or feasible to construct; this is done aiming at the extraction of structural elements to understand the design of those systems. Second, we develop novel microeconomic strategic models for BSS design to find the optimal values for the design variables - spacing and number of stations, number of bike slots per station, number of bicycles, and number of repositions - and the corresponding optimal fares and subsidies per bicycle trip, as functions of the use of the system. We begin by formulating and solving analytically a basic model where origins and destinations are distributed uniformly at all times (no waiting times). Then, a second model is developed, where waiting for a bike or a site is introduced, ending with a third model where repositioning is included as a strategy to diminish waiting times, the number of vehicles needed and the number of sites, at the expense of increasing operating costs. We obtain that the optimal money price per trip increases as the model contemplates waiting and repositioning, and that in a first-best scenario without budget constraints, an optimal subsidy per trip is justified due to the existence of economies of scale in the setting of station-based bike sharing systems. Scale economies in BSS were also found by Soriguera and Jiménez-Meroño (2020) in their design model, where optimal prices are not dealt with. Our formulation departs from other models in the literature that seek to optimally locate a given number of stations in order to maximize demand (Mix et al., 2022) without linking design and pricing decisions.====In our models we obtain optimal first-best prices per trip, both analytically and numerically. The analytical solution allows us to study the effect of each relevant parameter in general, independent of any numerical application. The estimation of optimal fares and subsidies has relevant policy implications, as we show that the optimal subsidy per trip increases as the coverage area of the BSS is larger. Such outcome might be an issue for the applicability of subsidies in real-world systems when a geographical expansion of the service (to cover a wider area of a city) is pursued. Moreover, this increase in the subsidy per trip for larger areas might be an explanation for the fact that in several cities around the world, BSS are constrained to middle- and high-income areas (see, e.g., Mora and Moran, 2020; Duran-Rodas et al., 2021; Tiznado-Aitken et al., 2021). We elaborate on this issue when analyzing our results, and connect our findings to the insights of the empirical literature on the spatial and social equity of bike sharing systems.====In the following section we first present the evolution of the BSS as described in the literature and then we identify the main characteristics of a BSS using information on the evolution of nine systems extracted from various sources, showing the empirical relations between each of the design variables (number of stations, spacing, sites, bicycles and vehicles repositioned) and total system use. In Section 3 we formulate three models for the design and pricing of BSS – without and with waiting time, without and with repositioning – finding analytical solutions for some variables. In Section 4 we show the simulated results for design and pricing, concluding that an optimal subsidy that decreases with patronage is needed. In Section 5 we synthesize and conclude.",Optimal pricing and design of station-based bike-sharing systems: A microeconomic model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000247,11 August 2022,2022,Research Article,13.0

To ensure that passengers did not sit next to a stranger, Delta did not sell the middle seat on its flights that had them. Its principal rivals, American Airlines and United Airlines, sold all seats. Analysis of the non-stop routes on which Delta faced head-to-head competition with American or United reveals that Delta was able to charge a 10% fare premium and increase its relative market share by 4.7 percentage points from its middle seat policy.","During the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines restricted the number of passengers on their flights and the seats that passengers were able to sit in to ensure that strangers were not sitting next to one another. These policies, commonly but somewhat inaccurately referred to as not selling, blocking, or withholding the middle seat, were implemented in response to the United States (U.S.) Government's recommendation that individuals maintain six feet of distance in public settings to reduce virus transmission.==== As airlines were not legally required to limit the number of passengers onboard, the policies may have been an attempt to encourage travelers to return to the skies at a time when demand was historically low.====Two of the three large legacy full-service network carriers in the U.S., American Airlines and United Airlines (American and United, respectively), abandoned their in-flight capacity restrictions by the end of June 2020. The other legacy carrier, Delta Air Lines (Delta), continued to block the middle seat until vaccines were widely available in April 2021. Fig. 1 shows the monthly load factor (i.e., the percent of seats occupied) for the domestic service of each legacy carrier from January 2019 to December 2021. Demand in spring 2020 was so low that passengers were able to socially distance themselves onboard irrespective of capacity restrictions. By summer 2020, however, American achieved a load factor of 60%, followed by United that fall. When COVID-19 cases surged in winter 2020–21, the load factor for both airlines declined yet again, eventually returning to pre-pandemic levels by spring 2021. Until April 2021, Delta's load factor never rose above 50%, and it did not return to pre-pandemic levels until July 2021.====In an earlier paper on this topic, we calculated that Delta raised its fares by 15% compared to American or United in the period from Quarter 3, 2020 to Quarter 4, 2020 (Hyman and Savage, 2021). The fare premium was equivalent to $23 on an average one-way trip. That paper used data from 1,358 routes. While some of these routes were competitive, most were routes in which one of the three legacy airlines monopolized the route. This paper focuses on the subset of routes in which passengers were always able to choose between a legacy carrier that sold the middle seat and a legacy carrier that did not. Specifically, we analyze vertical product differentiation on 54 non-stop routes where Delta was in head-to-head competition with American or United.====We estimate the magnitude of the fare premium that Delta charged as well as the market share gains Delta may have had from its middle seat policy. We find that Delta was able to charge a fare premium and increase its market share. Because Delta restored its flight schedule sooner than American or United, the market share gains can be attributed to passengers’ preferences for higher relative flight frequencies in addition to the extra space onboard. Finally, we investigate if the fare premium and market share gains differ by route. Might regional variation in attitudes towards COVID-19, as measured by vaccination rates, or in relative valuations of air travel, as measured by the recovery of demand on a route, lend insights into how passengers value space differently during a pandemic?",The effect of vertical product differentiation on fare and market share: Evidence from Delta Air Lines’ middle seat policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000259,9 August 2022,2022,Research Article,14.0

Therefore, this study can improve our understanding of the nonlinear impact of air pollution on housing prices and provide a basis for formulating and revising policies related to housing prices.","With the rapid development of China’s economy, air pollution has become an increasingly prominent problem and a great challenge that the Chinese government needs to face (Fong et al., 2020). In the four decades since the reform and expansion stage, China’s urbanization rate has increased rapidly. In 2017, China’s urbanization level exceeded the world average by 3.7 percent (Chuanglin, 2018). However, the continuous increases in the energy demand, industrial expansion and private car ownership in megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have led to the serious deterioration of air quality. According to the Bulletin on the State of China’s Ecology and the Environment released by the Ministry of Ecology and the Environment of China in 2019, only 157 of 337 cities at or above the prefectural level met the air quality standard in China, and 180 cities, accounting for 53.4% of all considered cities, exceeded the standard. The reasons for the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events, such as smog, in Chinese cities are comprehensive, but such events generally stem from problems related to urban development, such as extensive urban development, an unbalanced energy structure, low energy efficiency, and inefficient environmental governance (Yan et al., 2018).====Air pollution has a negative impact on human health, and it has adverse effects on property values. Ebenstein, Fan et al. noted that the concentration of PM==== in northern Chinese cities is significantly higher than that in the south because of the use of coal-fired heating in northern China, and the cost of energy switching would be enormous; however, the average life expectancy of residents in the north is 3.1 years that of residents in the south (Ebenstein et al., 2017). Moreover, with a focus on establishing a moderately prosperous society, living standards, quality of life, and the environment have improved, and these factors, especially air pollution, have attracted increasing research attention (Hao and Zheng, 2017). Therefore, to assess the controlling costs required to achieve effective urban air governance, we need to quantify the economic value of urban air quality.====We choose housing price as a quantitative indicator of the economic value of clean air. Housing is not only a fundamental guarantee for human life but also a family’s fixed asset, and housing prices can affect the macro-economy through several channels (Huang et al., 2009). In China, with the development of real estate marketization in 1998, residents began to increasingly consider location and environmental factors when choosing houses. According to the spatial equilibrium model of urban economy, housing prices can reflect residents’ preference for environmental factors, including clean air (Lan et al., 2020, Albouy, 2016). Improving air quality will increase housing’s value, and this growth will be transmitted to the real estate market in the form of rising housing prices or rent (Lai et al., 2021). In addition, residents’ expectations for air quality also affect current housing prices (Tra, 2010). If real estate owners expect the air quality around their houses to rise in the future, they will more highly estimate a current home’s price, which will cause residents to pay more for the expected clean air. According to current relevant research results, air pollution has a significant negative impact on urban housing prices (Harrison Jr. and Rubinfeld, 1978, Smith and Huang, 1993, Koblyakova et al., 2021). Studies on the impact of pollutants on housing prices have helped increase people’s awareness of environmental protection, reduced the cost of improving air quality and supported the government’s formulation of public policies on air pollution (Zou, 2019). To date, these topics have received considerable attention in the research community and have been recognized as key challenges, especially concerning marginal willingness to pay (MWTP). By measuring residents’ MWTP for clean air, we can also calculate the welfare cost of air pollution, or equally calculate the welfare benefit of clean air. It is worth noting that the goal of our research is to assess the relationship between input variables and target housing prices. Therefore, this research can be defined as a regression prediction analysis.====In many existing works on the relationship between air pollution concentrations and housing prices, linear regression prediction methods have been widely used; these methods consider historical air pollutant data and built environment information to forecast and analyze housing prices. The most common linear regression prediction methods include the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis method and the spatial econometric method, which considers spatial heterogeneity (Zou, 2019, Casetti, 1972, Fotheringham et al., 2001, Kestens et al., 2006, Bitter et al., 2007, Chen and Jin, 2019, Mei et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2018, Sun and Yang, 2020, Trojanek et al., 2017, Cohen and Coughlin, 2008, Suryowati et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2018, Li et al., 2019b, Gilderbloom and Meares, 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Brécard et al., 2018, Le Boennec and Salladarré, 2017, Wen et al., 2017). However, most current housing price research considers the impact of infrastructure on housing prices and lacks consideration of the impact of air pollutants, including PM==== and NO====, on housing prices. Second, the existing methods for simulating the relationship between impact factors and housing prices are generally based on linear regression; therefore, it is difficult to accurately fit the nonlinear relationship between impact factors and housing prices. Based on the above problems, we must urgently develop a new method that can effectively fit the nonlinear relationship between impact factors and housing prices and quantify the MWTP for clean air in cities.====Traditionally, the impact of air pollution on housing prices can be regarded as a regression problem, that is, involving the modeling and analysis of relevant historical data, including data on pollutants and the built environment. Many studies have shown that in the process of housing price changes, the interactions and effects of related factors are complex (Kumar and Imam, 2013, Alvanchi et al., 2020, Huang and Yi, 2010). These complex interactions and effects must be taken into account for housing price prediction. Moreover, when studying the impact of pollutants on housing prices, it is important to fully consider the features of pollutants and to correlate pollutants with other influencing factors.====Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in regression problems in recent years and can effectively fit the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. Tree-based boosting learning algorithms, especially gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs), which combine multiple weak learning regression trees, have been widely used in solving classification and regression tasks. Compared with traditional regression prediction models, the GBDT is more stable and interpretable and shows better predictive performance by combining multiple weak learning regression trees (Zhang and Haghani, 2015, Tu et al., 2021).====The main goals of this study are to explore the nonlinear impacts of air pollution on housing prices and identify the relative importance of explanatory variables. This study can provide scientific support for the development of region-specific air quality improvement programs and policies. The main contributions of this study are as follows.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the previous related studies.

Drawing from data spanning 2006 to 2015 for Japan's new car market, we apply the aggregate random coefficients logit model to estimate consumer demand with rich substitution patterns. We find that Japanese consumers primarily focused on fuel costs and future registration ","Governments worldwide promote and subsidize eco-friendly vehicles to address environmental problems and the depletion of oil. For example, eco-friendly hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) hold about 20% of the market share in Japan, and clean diesel vehicles held about 50% of the European market in the past. Preferential taxation and subsidies underlie these increases in vehicles with internal-combustion engines (ICEs). Such preferential treatment on tax or subsidies quickly ameliorate problems presented by vehicle expenses and taxes, provided they accommodate consumers' preferences in vehicles and response to fiscal incentives. Thus, governments subsidize or preferentially tax their purchase or registration, and consumers more readily accept such vehicles.==== Their high market penetration suggests that fiscal incentives do affect consumers’ vehicle choices, and it is an important environmental problem to diffuse eco-friendly vehicles via such policies.====Vehicle owners worldwide generally incur multiple taxes. Governments tax vehicles by engine displacement or chassis size through purchase or registration taxes and driving indirectly through fuel taxes. Economic theory favors fuel taxes because they directly affect the driving that causes environmental problems (Parry and Small, 2005). However, consumers might continue to buy fuel-guzzling vehicles if they undervalue the future savings of fuel-efficient and eco-friendly vehicles, a situation Jaffe and Stavins (1994) call the Energy Paradox.==== Thus, effective vehicle taxation requires clarifying whether consumers correctly value future costs compared with purchase prices. Allcott and Wozny (2014) and Grigolon et al. (2018), for example, show that the US and European auto markets have entered the paradox.==== In such markets, taxes and subsidies to buy or register vehicles are a valuable tool for spreading eco-friendly vehicles.====Japan's auto market has the following three features. First, Japan imposes higher vehicle taxes than other countries. In 2016, taxes on vehicles (excluding fuel taxes====) with engine displacements of 1,800 cc driven for 12 years were 30 times higher than in the US, 14 times higher than in France, 2.9 times higher than in Germany, and 2.1 times higher than in the UK (Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, 2016b).==== Second, Kei cars (standard of minicars unique to Japan) hold about 40% of Japan's new car market (Fig. 1). From the perspective of Japanese markets, Kei cars seem too small and underpowered to command a sizable market share. However, they do so because low registration taxes motivate their purchase.==== Third, HEVs are expensive, but their Japanese market share exceeds 20%, because they are fuel-efficient (Fig. 1). It can be inferred that the prevalence of Kei cars and HEVs in Japan's auto market is due to low future costs, such as registration taxes and the cost of fuel, and consumers have strong preferences for such tax preferential treatment and fuel efficiency. In fact, this paper shows that Japanese consumers are assumed to value future cost savings over purchase prices, while this distinguishes Japan from European countries and the US.==== Nonetheless, current Japanese policies favoring eco-friendly vehicles rely on taxes levied at purchase. Therefore, policymakers seeking to promote eco-friendly vehicles must clarify the extent to which consumers consider lifecycle costs of vehicle ownership.====To analyze consumer valuations of current and future costs, we employ Berry et al.’s (1995) random coefficient logit model, which lets us use aggregate sales data to estimate demand for vehicles with rich substitution patterns.==== This paper analyzes the reaction of consumers to taxation on purchasing and registering vehicles and fuel with data from 2006 to 2015 including periods of staring in earnest to provide tax incentive for eco-friendly vehicles. Further, counterfactual experiments are conducted to find whether fuel taxes or registration taxes are desirable for diffusing eco-friendly vehicles.====We show that consumers primarily value future fuel costs and future registration taxes followed by purchase prices. Specifically, for a ¥1 saving in discounted present values of fuel costs and registration taxes, consumers will pay ¥6.07 and ¥4.66 more in purchase price, respectively. For this reason, preferential taxation for Kei cars may substantially distort choice of vehicles because consumers are responsive to tax that are salient (Chetty et al., 2009). It also implies that to promote eco-friendly vehicles Japan should reduce registration taxes rather than reduce taxes on their purchase. Counterfactual experiments under a fixed amount of tax revenue reveal that increasing both fuel and registration taxes improves average fuel efficiency at the expense of social welfare. These findings imply that increasing fuel tax represents a greener energy policy in terms of promoting fuel efficiency.====This study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of preceding studies. Section 3 outlines Japanese vehicle taxation and recent vehicular tax reforms.

If there is uncertainty about the required time to meet the connection, some users might engage in risky behavior by, e.g., increasing their traveling speed. We examine whether the frequency level at a transfer connection may influence the incentive to engage in such risky behavior. We develop an optimization model in which users select an optimal speed in a two-stage process. A simulation study is performed to study the behavior within a wide range of possible preferences and trip characteristics. Our results suggest that increasing the departure frequency may provide a greater incentive for engaging in risky behavior – increasing social costs by increasing the number of accidents. The result is dependent upon average trip length, the initial frequency and the user's perception of scheduling cost. Policy makers should consider the possibly increased accident costs when altering the service level at a transfer connection.","The design of optimal service levels for public transport is an important task of decision-makers who oversee transit systems. Because there are significant operational and capital cost requirements associated with operating public transport services, it is important that all the relevant costs and benefits of operating a service are included. Service levels can be influenced in several ways, with the level of frequency being one aspect of importance.====Many public transport systems rely on transfers between different services as well as on transport modes other than public transport, such as walking (O'Sullivan and Morrall, 1996), bicycling (Martens, 2007) and driving (Parkhurst, 2000). Transfers to public transport from other modes require that the users schedule their time appropriately such that they can reach their desired departure on time. However, when there exists uncertainty in the time required to reach the desired departure, or when users experience an unplanned delay, an incentive for engaging in risky behavior (for example, by increasing the traveling speed) can be created because the users are “in a hurry” (Sadia et al., 2018).====An interesting question is whether the service level design of the public transport systems can affect the risk-taking behavior to “catch the bus”. If an increased frequency is provided, as an incentive for lowering risk-taking behavior, with all else remaining equal, it could yield an additional benefit to society. On the other hand, if the increased frequency raises the incentive for engaging in risky behavior, it could yield an additional cost to society. Thus, understanding how the frequency of a transfer service and risk-taking for travelers is linked could be important in designing optimal service levels for public transport. To the best of our knowledge, this aspect has not been accounted for in the literature.====Researchers usually agree that risk-taking behavior, such as a person increasing his/her speed, has a significant influence on the number of accidents (Elvik et al., 2019; Aarts and Van Schagen, 2006). Further, governments and individuals usually view accidents as a phenomenon that carries high social costs. For example, the Swedish road authorities estimate the loss to society from a fatal accident to be 46 million 2014 SEK,==== whereas the Norwegian Public Roads Administration sets the value at 30 million 2016 NOK,==== with significant figures also for non-fatal, but serious accidents. Thus, traffic safety is an important topic that policymakers account for in their decisions on budget allocations (Odeck, 2010), and it is viewed as a growing public health issue (World Health Organization, 2018).====The purpose of this paper is the development of a theoretical model that links car travelers’ incentives for selecting high speeds and the frequency of a transit service. The goal is by no means an attempt to deliver a definitive answer to the question of whether transit frequency could be influence risk-taking behavior. However, we aim to provide some theoretical insights that could be a first step toward understanding the relevant mechanism and possibly providing a direction for empirical research.====The scientific contributions of this paper should be highlighted. The first contribution of the paper is a widened understanding of the impacts that the service frequency could have on the societal costs in the context of transport economics. The literature on the design of optimal frequency levels has treated different variables that impact the total cost. However, it has mostly focused on intentional effects such as the user waiting time and on-board congestion (Jara-Diaz and Gschwender, 2003; Börjesson et al., 2017). Non-intentional effects of changing the frequency have been studied to a lesser extent, perhaps, except for on-road congestion when many buses are present (Tirachini et al., 2014; Tirachini and Hensher, 2011; Börjesson et al., 2018) and network effects (Fielbaum et al., 2020). To increase the understanding of how the optimal frequency may be influenced, it is important to include all relevant aspects, such as safety. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first attempt to discuss the relevance of safety aspects in this context.====The paper also contributes by extending the literature on driver speed selection by studying how chosen speeds are influenced by public transit frequency when making a transfer between modes. A two-stage model is developed, where both departure and speed level are chosen, in contrast to the typical one-stage model applied, that studies only the optimal speed level (see, e.g., Jørgensen and Sandberg-Hanssen, 2019).====To make a final policy recommendation, both the costs and benefits of an altered frequency should be accounted for. For example, reducing the frequency also entails a cost for the existing users which need to be considered. Moreover, one should compare different policies to find the most effective one. There is a large literature on measures that seek to reduce risk-taking in road traffic (see, e.g., Elvik et al., 2004), which may also be effective in reducing the incentive to speed.==== In this paper, we do not seek to develop a complete optimization model which compares the relative merits of different traffic safety policies, but rather investigate if frequency may affect risk-taking in isolation. Such information may be of interest in and of itself, for the following two reasons:====Our main result indicates that increasing the frequency might yield a larger incentive for engaging in risky behavior by selecting a greater speed level when transferring to a public transit service from another mode. However, the marginal effect of increasing frequency is found to differ depending on the initial level of frequency. For low levels of frequency at the outset, it is more likely that increases will raise speeds. From moderate levels of frequency, it is more likely that they will be reduced. The results are also highly dependent upon trip length and driver's relative perception of different cost components.====These concerns are policy-relevant if the drivers do not internalize the full social costs of their accidents (if drivers do not consider the external social cost of accidents, including their passengers', other travelers’ cost or loss to aggregate output of the economy). In the absence of any road-pricing, the drivers will not internalize such costs.==== Consequently, planners should take possibly altered accident cost into consideration when increasing service levels.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 gives an exposition of our model. Section 4 provides a simulation study of the model. Section 5 discusses the results, while section 6 gives the conclusions.",Public transport frequency and risk-taking behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012222000107,13 March 2022,2022,Research Article,18.0

Damaging wildlife strikes events often cause substantial repair costs as well as downtime for the aircraft and passengers directly involved and, in the most severe and rare instances, can cause injury and even loss of life (Dolbeer and Wright, 2008, Thorpe, 2010, Dolbeer et al., 2019). Lower bound estimates of the economic burden of wildlife strikes in the U.S. have relied on aircraft- and flight-specific self-reported cost data in the National Wildlife Strike Database (NWSD), ranging from $54.3 million to $187 million annually (2018 U.S. $) (Dolbeer et al., 2019, Altringer et al., 2021). Taking into account the issue of underreporting, the economic burden of wildlife strikes for the U.S. aviation industry is likely to be 2 to 3 times higher than these lower bound estimates—i.e., $163 million to $561 million annually (2018 U.S. $).====Because commercial aircraft, airlines, and their passengers, however, are part of a highly connected network that is integral to the overall functioning of modern society and the economy (Schafer and Victor, 1997, Song and Yeo, 2017, Ball et al., 2010, Peterson et al., 2013), disruptions that occur to one aircraft, airline, or airport in this network can have a substantial impact throughout (Conti et al., 2013, Fleurquin et al., 2013). Dolbeer et al. (2019) report that among disruptive wildlife strike incidents—damaging wildlife strikes included—the average amount of aircraft downtime is roughly 100 h per strike. Thus, damaging wildlife strike events constitute a disruption that—in the context of the commercial passenger airline industry—are likely to cause considerable departure delays for aircraft and passengers that are only indirectly linked to the event through subsequent connections in the flight schedule and network. Further, since costs reported to the NWSD are flight- and aircraft-specific, the presence of strike-induced spillover departure delays would suggest that previous cost estimates understate the true economic burden of wildlife strikes in the U.S.====In this paper, we identify and quantify the spillover delay effects of damaging wildlife strike events for the U.S. commercial passenger airline industry. We begin by linking 2253 damaging commercial passenger airline strikes in the National Wildlife Strike Database (NWSD) to 1,997,645 flights in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Airline On-Time Statistics Detailed Departure Statistics database. Specifically, we collect flight performance data for each flight scheduled to depart in the 48-h window surrounding each strike event—in the 24 h prior to and 24 h following the damaging wildlife strike event. First, to verify that wildlife strike events have a measurable impact on subsequent flights, we perform an interrupted time series analysis on flight performance in the 10-h window surrounding the damaging wildlife strike–i.e., 5 h prior to and 5 h following the event—and find significant evidence of spillover departure delays among strike-airline flights in the post-strike period. Spillover departure delays are particularly pronounced for same-leg, strike-airline flights at the destination airport in the first 2 h following a wildlife strike event, as one might expect.====We then employ a counterfactual approach to identify strike-induced spillover delay effects in the complete 24-h post-strike period. Similar to the interrupted time series approach, the estimated treatment effects produced by the counterfactual approach indicate that strike-induced spillover delays are most pronounced among strike-airline flights at the destination airport. These estimated treatment effects are robust to control for weather conditions, as well as various sample restrictions. We also observe heterogeneous spillover delay effects depending on whether or not a strike flight’s destination airport is an airline hub. Our baseline estimates suggest that the average damaging wildlife strike generates a minimum of 570 aircraft minutes (9.5 h) and 40,000 passenger minutes (27.8 days) of excess departure delay.====Combining our estimates of strike-induced excess departure delays with per-minute delay costs derived from the Ball et al. (2010) ====, we calculate that the average damaging wildlife strike event generates a minimum of $71,422–$73,914 (2020 U.S. $) in excess departure delay costs—an external cost that is borne by ==== (38.6%–39.9%) via increased operating costs, ==== through the value of lost travel time (42.7%–44.2%), and the ==== through lost productivity (12.6%–16.6%). Using commercial passenger airline strike information provided by the NWSD over the 1990–2019 period, we estimate that strike-induced departure delays generate an average of $25.0 million to $25.9 million (2020 U.S. $) in spillover delay costs each year and increase the average total cost of a damaging wildlife strike in our sample by 18 to 62 percent.====The results of this study have broad implications. First, while other studies have investigated the airport-level delay effects of sudden and severe weather events (Robinson, 1989, Sasse and Hauf, 2003, Hsiao and Hansen, 2006, Borsky and Unterberger, 2019), our study provides a novel investigation of the impact that aircraft incidents and accidents have on subsequent flight performance. Our results indicate that, unlike the airport-level effects of sudden and severe weather events, the delay effects of aircraft incidents and accidents are largely a within-airline phenomenon. Second, our study provides a more complete understanding of the economic burden of wildlife strike events in the context of the commercial passenger airline industry. As mentioned previously, estimates of the economic burden of wildlife strikes have relied on self-reported cost data in the NWSD (Dolbeer et al., 2019, Altringer et al., 2021). These self-reported cost measures fail to capture the spillover delay costs associated with wildlife strike events. Our study is the first attempt to quantify these spillover, or external, costs, showing that they contribute significantly to the overall economic burden of wildlife strikes. Lastly, our results provide a better understanding as to how the costs of wildlife strike events are realized across airports. For instance, wildlife strikes that occur upon flight departure at one airport have a significant impact on subsequent flight performance at the destination airport. Thus, via spillover departure delay effects, the economic burden of wildlife strike events are not specific to the airport at which they occur but, instead, disseminate throughout the network. Such a result has implications for better understanding the nature of wildlife hazard management which is provided at the airport-level while the benefits are likely to be realized throughout the network.====In the following section we outline the relevant literature that motivates our research and empirical strategies employed. In Section 3, we describe our data collection procedures and the sample used in our identification and quantification of the spillover delay effects of damaging wildlife strike events. This section includes a description of passenger enplanement and per-minute delay cost data employed in the final tabulation of our results. The empirical strategies employed to identify and quantify the spillover delay effects of damaging wildlife strike events are presented in Section 4, followed by our results in Section 5. We conclude our study with implications and areas for future research in the final section of the paper.",Spillover delay effects of damaging wildlife strike events at U.S. airports,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201222200003X,8 March 2022,2022,Research Article,19.0

This study tests the sensitivity of the outcomes of equilibrium congestion policies with respect to changes in airport network and demand structures. A major feature is to incorporate substitute destination choices for origin–destination passengers into the analysis of equilibrium airport congestion policies involving slot or ","Air traffic in terms of the number of leisure passengers has generally grown faster than the number of business passengers. For example, from 1996 to 2006, the share of leisure passengers had increased from 59 percent to 70 percent in the UK and from 30 percent to 60 percent in the Norwegian international market (Thelle et al., 2012). Industry observers speculate that the Covid-19 pandemic and the increasing use of online conferencing tools will further decrease the relative importance of business travel by air (Mason, 2020).==== One feature of leisure passengers is that they choose among various destinations for their flight trips. For example, leisure passengers who are originating from Asia may choose to fly to Europe or North America for an annual summer holiday trip. Destination choices are usually highly dependent on the prices, that is, passengers may choose to fly to one destination if the trip is cheap and convenient relative to trips to other destinations.====This study tests the sensitivity of the outcomes of equilibrium congestion policies with respect to changes in airport network and demand structures. A major feature is to incorporate substitute destination choices for origin–destination passengers into the analysis of equilibrium airport congestion policies. Specifically, equilibrium airport behaviours are considered because most airports are controlled by local governments that presumably optimize the local as opposed to global objectives and their individual actions will affect other airports because airports interact in a network. Congestion policies are relevant because passenger numbers will be growing rapidly in the future and outpace the physical capacity growth, leading to an increasing level of airport delays via an increasing ratio of air traffic over the physical airport capacity.==== This is true despite of the devastating effects of the Coronavirus outbreak and the corresponding international lockdowns in 2020, which will slow down the growth of the aviation industry for years (Pearce, 2020, Czerny et al., 2020). Cirium’s 2020 record of global departure performance in 2019 indicates that the average delay time for the top 20 global airports is 50.7 min for around 364,000 delayed flights. Specifically, the highest average delay time is 69 min for around 15,000 delayed flights at CTU, Chengdu, China. The delays are costly and harmful to the economy in the sense that the cost to an airline for an hour of delay ranges from about $1400 to $4500, with the value of passenger time ranging from $35 to $63 per hour (Federal Aviation Administration, 2020a). Altogether, it raises the urgency for governments to deal with airport congestion problems.====There are two main measures to mitigate airport congestion problems. One is quantity-based and involves so-called airport slots where airports impose an upper limit on the number of flight movements per period of time. An airport slot (or simply “slot”) is “a permission given by a coordinator for a planned operation to use the full range of airport infrastructure necessary to arrive or depart at a Level 3 airport on a specific date and time” (International Air Transport Association, 2019a). Airports can utilize the slots to restrict airline access to airports and consequently control congestion effects by ensuring that the scheduled air traffic per time unit does not exceed the “declared airport capacity” per time unit.==== There are around 204 airports using slots worldwide serving around 43 percent of the passengers worldwide (International Air Transport Association, 2019b). Interestingly, only three airports in the US – John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) – currently make use of slots (Federal Aviation Administration, 2020b). Airport runway and terminal use is based on the first-come-first-serve principle at most other US airports including Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), which was the biggest airport in the world in terms of passenger numbers before COVID-19.====The other measure is price-based. Airports may increase airport charges so that desirable levels of passenger demands are reached (Daniel, 1995, Brueckner, 2002, Pels and Verhoef, 2004, Zhang and Zhang, 2006, Basso, 2008, Czerny and Zhang, 2011, Czerny and Zhang, 2014a, Czerny and Zhang, 2014b). By contrast to the quantity-based measure, the proposed price-based measure can hardly be found in practice (Zhang and Czerny, 2012). This is maybe related to the distributional effect of such pricing policies and thus policy makers attach a zero weight to infrastructure profits to avoid higher payments from the airlines and passengers (for example, Czerny and Lang, 2019, Lang and Czerny, forthcoming).====The present study considers an airport network in which origin–destination passengers can choose between two alternative destinations which they consider as imperfect substitutes. The network involves two symmetric congested airports with local passengers (hereafter, local passengers are simply called locals whereas non-local passengers are simply called non-locals) and one uncongested airport without locals, thus, a three-airport network.==== In practice, changes in the congestion policies of one airport are observed to propagate congestion to other airports (Federal Aviation Administration, 2010, Arıkan et al., 2013, Fleurquin et al., 2013), which justifies the consideration of an airport network. Airline markets are assumed to be perfectly competitive in the model and airlines are assumed to serve their locals only. Locals travel with their local airlines and take return flights. They fly to either the other congested airport or alternatively to the uncongested airport. The two congested airports independently and simultaneously choose slot quantities or airport charges in the cases of slot or pricing policies, respectively, to mitigate the congestion problem for the locals. This captures that most airports are under localized rather than centralized government controls. In the case of slot policies, airports do not earn from selling slots. This captures the notion of grandfather rights established by the Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines of the IATA. By contrast, in the case of pricing policies, airports earn positive profits. Efficient rationing is assumed to hold in the case of slot policies in this study in the sense that slots are allocated to passengers with the highest willingness to pay. This implies a conservative assessment of pricing policies because the efficient allocation of slots among airlines cannot be guaranteed in reality (Czerny and Lang, 2019).====This paper considers an airport network involving multiple connected origin–destination airport pairs in which some of the destinations are considered as imperfect substitutes by passengers. The analysis demonstrates that, under such conditions, the presence of substitute destination choices is a necessary condition for equilibrium slot quantities to reach the first-best outcome that maximizes the welfare of all airport regions. From the first-best viewpoint, both locals and non-locals make excessive use of the scarce local airport capacity in the absence of substitute destination choices (Czerny and Lang, 2019). In the presence of substitute destination choices, the local airport has the incentive to reduce the slot quantity because the non-locals are contributing more to the local airport’s congestion than in the absence of substitute destination choices. Therefore, equilibrium slot quantities can possibly achieve the first-best passenger quantities. The present study further shows that equilibrium airport charges will be too high relative to the first-best prices independent of the presence or absence of substitute destination choices.====A change from slot to pricing policies involves a change in the decision variables as well as a change in the airport profits. The latter is true because airports cannot earn from selling slots due to grandfather rights whereas airports can earn in the case of pricing policies. To separate the effect of a change in the decision variables, which is called ====, and the effect of airport profits, which is called ====, on equilibrium passenger numbers, the present study considers slot pricing policies in which prices are the decision variables and airport profits are still zero. The variable effect is calculated by comparing the equilibrium outcomes in the cases of slot policies and slot pricing policies. The distribution effect is calculated by comparing the equilibrium outcomes in the cases of slot pricing policies and pricing policies. The analysis shows that the variable effect is zero if equilibrium slot quantities reach the first-best passenger quantities. Numerical results further indicate that the variable effect is non-positive whereas the distribution effect can be positive or negative.====The studies most closely related to the present study are Czerny and Lang’s (2019) and Lang and Czerny’s (forthcoming). Czerny and Lang (2019) considered a two-airport network without multiple connected origin–destination airport pairs and a three-airport network with multiple connected airport origin–destination pairs but in which destinations were not considered as imperfect substitutes. They showed that the presence of multiple connected origin–destination airport pairs can help focus on unique equilibrium solutions. They further distinguished between the variable effect and distribution effect that are involved in a policy change from slot to pricing policies. The main findings were that in the absence of substitute destination choices, neither slot nor pricing policies could achieve the first-best outcome in a three-airport network.====Lang and Czerny (forthcoming) considered a two-airport network. They did not consider equilibrium congestion policies because in their framework only one congested and active airport was considered. They did not consider substitute destination choices which would require the consideration of at least three airports. In contrast to Czerny and Lang (2019), local welfare-maximizing slot quantities could implement the first-best outcome under certain conditions. Whether the local welfare-maximizing slot policy could lead to the first-best outcome depended on the shares of inframarginal and marginal locals and non-locals. The results provided clear insights on the reasons why equilibrium slot quantities were found to be excessive in the three-airport network considered in Czerny and Lang’s (2019) study in the absence of substitute destination choices. The results will also be used in the present study to develop clear insights on the reasons why equilibrium slot quantities can lead to the first-best outcome in the presence of substitute destination choices. Lang and Czerny (forthcoming) further showed that the local welfare-maximizing airport charge would be too high relative to the first-best price, which is a robust result that also exists in the present study.====Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the two related studies by Czerny and Lang (2019) and Lang and Czerny (forthcoming) as well as the present study. This study’s contribution is to analyse the role of substitute destination choices for the assessment of local welfare-maximizing airport congestion policies. Altogether, the results demonstrate how sensitive the assessment of local welfare-maximizing congestion policies can be because variations in airport networks and demand structures such as the absence or presence of substitute destination choices can drastically change the results.====The present study contributes to various strands of the literature. It contributes to the literature on permit policies in terms of slots versus pricing policies (for example, Basso et al., 2017, Basso and Zhang, 2010, Brenck and Czerny, 2002, Brueckner, 2009; Czerny, 2007; Czerny, 2008, Czerny, 2010; Daniel, 2014; De Palma and Lindsey, 2020) by considering decentralized slot and pricing policies in the context of substitute destination choices with origin–destination passengers. This strand of the literature has largely been inspired by Weitzman’s (1974) seminal study on pricing versus quantities. It contributes to the literature on localized decision makers and the tolling of non-locals (De Borger et al., 2007, De Borger et al., 2005, Fung and Proost, 2017, Mantin, 2012, Czerny et al., 2014, Wan et al., 2016, Wan and Zhang, 2013, Wan et al., 2018). It finally contributes to the growing literature on congestion management in airport networks (Benoot et al., 2013, Lin, 2019, Pels and Verhoef, 2004, Silva et al., 2014, Lin and Zhang, 2017).====The paper is organized as follows. The model will be presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the demand relationships which are crucial for the policy assessment in Section 4. At the end of Section 4, numerical examples are used to first illustrate how the level of substitutability affects the shares of inframarginal and (weighted) marginal locals that ultimately determine whether equilibrium slot policies can lead to first-best outcome, and then the variable and distribution effects.

Built between 1962 and 1974, the freeway connected the southernmost region of the Italian peninsula (Calabria) to the national highway network. According to the original plan, the freeway could have been built along three different routes. The final choice was mostly influenced by powerful politicians who lobbied in favor of the path crossing their constituency (the town of Cosenza). In a differences-in-differences framework, we compare the growth of “inconsequentially” treated municipalities – traversed only because they lie on the route connecting Cosenza – with the one of municipalities on the two discarded paths. Our results suggest that the freeway caused a significant reorganization of both economic activity and population from untreated to treated locations. At the same time, the infrastructure does not seem to have helped the convergence of the overall region.","While the commonsense suggests that transport infrastructures are a driver of growth, the impact of these investments on local development is far from being established.==== The construction of new infrastructures influences not only the level of economic activity but also the distribution of firms and workers across space. For instance, high-speed highways may favor the decentralization of economic activity (Baum-Snow and Turner, 2017), but also disadvantage the most remote locations (Baum-Snow et al., 2019). More in general, the increased production around the new logistic nodes may come at the expenses of areas that become their periphery (Redding and Turner, 2015).====In this paper, we contribute to the literature on the impact of highways on economic activity by studying the long-term economic effects (over four decades) of the A3 freeway in Calabria (Italy). The freeway, which connected Salerno (South of Naples) to Reggio Calabria (on the Tyrrhenian coast in front of Sicily), was mostly built between 1962 and 1974, although part of it was completed only later on. Its construction was a radical change for Calabria, which is a small region at the southernmost point of the Italian peninsula.====To obtain credible estimates of the local effects of the freeway, we exploit the fact that according to the original plan the freeway could have been built along three different routes: on the Tyrrhenian coast, on the Ionic coast, or along the centre of the region (Fig. 1). The last one was chosen because of political pressure by very influential members of parliament elected in the local jurisdiction of Cosenza (see D'Antone, 2008). Because of the physical geography of the area, the three alternatives were the only possible routes. Apart from these three corridors, the region includes mountainous and rugged sites, which are implausible controls as they would have been excluded anyway by the transition to a modern economy between 1951 and 2001. On the contrary, the municipalities around the two discarded alternatives constitute a reasonable control group.====Although the final route was the consequence of political pressure, the main motivation was to force the freeway to pass from Cosenza. The other municipalities on this route benefitted from being located along the only solution that included Cosenza. In a dif-in-dif framework, we compare employment and population growth in these municipalities with the growth in municipalities on the discarded paths. Our identification strategy holds under the parallel trends assumption that treated and control municipalities would have experienced a similar growth in the absence of the infrastructure. Since selection into treatment is driven by the lobbying of politicians from Cosenza, the effect of the selection bias on the treated is differentiated away by excluding Cosenza from the treated group (inconsequential units approach; see Chandra and Thompson, 2000). By the same token, our controls were the concrete alternatives to the route crossing Cosenza. Without the political pressures, they would have had the same chances as the treated of being located along to freeway.====Our investigation has a long-term perspective. We are able to look at what happens to local economic development over four decades from the opening of the freeway. In doing so, we are facilitated by the sluggishness of the modernization of the overall road network in Calabria (Costa and Mauro, 2005), which includes, beyond the freeway, state and provincial roads. With some exceptions, which we inspect in the sensitivity analysis, the network in place around the middle 1970s is still the one operating nowadays.====Importantly, we try to understand the extent to which the freeway caused a simple re-organization of economic activity or net benefits for the overall area. Cursory evidence would suggest that the freeway's contribution was not decisive to the convergence process of the region: in 1961, when construction began, the region's per capita GDP was about 55 percent of the national per capita GDP; when the highway was completed in 1974, that share had risen to 60 percent; in 2001, the year our study stops, the share was 62 percent. To distinguish between reorganization and growth more rigorously, we experiment using different samples of remote controls; that is, units not exposed to the local re-allocation of firms and workers. We select them from other Southern regions, which display pre-trends in economic activity and possibly post-1970s evolutions comparable to those of Calabria. Our results suggest relevant displacement effects in private employment (more intense for tradables than non-tradables) and population. We also fail to find evidence that the freeway helped Calabria to converge towards more developed areas of Italy.====Overall, our main contributions to the current literature are two. First, we provide an applied example of how to combine the logic behind the two most common strategies used to identify the effects of transport infrastructure, i.e. the planned routes and the inconsequential units approached. We use the former to identify a suitable group of control municipalities that are more similar to the treated ones, while we exploit the latter to limit the selection issues. Secondly, we provide evidence about the local effect of investing in infrastructure in a peripheral region, as Calabria is the least developed region in Italy and one of the priority regions for the European Cohesion Policy since its start. It is therefore a suitable case study to understand the role of infrastructures in driving convergence.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss our identification strategy with regards to previous related literature. Section 3 provides the historical accounts referring to the beginning of the 1960s, when it was decided where to locate the Salerno-Reggio Calabria freeway. Section 4 introduces our identification strategy and presents the data. Section 5 describes the results. The final section discusses implications and caveats of our empirical investigation.","A freeway to prosperity?

As an alternative to private cars, carsharing is more economical and environmentally friendly than private cars and is becoming internationally recognized as sustainable transportation. However, the benefits of carsharing in alleviating traffic and environmental problems would only be significant when many travelers switch from private cars to carsharing. Thus, understanding travelers' dynamic selection processes when choosing between carsharing and private cars is important in promoting carsharing. Assuming that travelers' behavior regarding travel mode choice conforms to the principle of maximizing random utility, a logit evolutionary game model based on logit dynamics and ","With urbanization and industrialization, the number of cars worldwide has grown rapidly, especially in some developing countries. In 2015, 1 billion passenger cars existed worldwide, with projections of up to 2.8 billion by 2050 (D'automobiles). Private cars are among the main travel modes and are extremely popular among people worldwide. The comfort and facilities private cars provide cannot be denied; however, the increasing number of private cars has also caused many problems, including vehicle emissions, traffic congestion and parking shortages, which have significantly challenged the environment and transportation. Policies and measures have been implemented to reduce the use of private cars and encourage shifts in travel modes in many countries (Kent, 2014; Rahman et al., 2020).====Public transportation is recognized as an economical and environmentally friendly traditional travel mode. However, it often lacks flexibility and privacy due to time and space constraints. Carsharing represents an alternative to private cars (Katzev, 2003) that combines the characteristics of private and collective traditional transport (Riccardo and Marco, 2018) and has become internationally accepted as a mode of sustainable transportation. The principle of carsharing is simple: Individuals gain the benefits of a private car without the costs and responsibilities of ownership (Shaheen and Cohen, 2013). Members of carsharing organizations pay for short-term access to a shared-vehicle fleet on a per-hour and per-mile/kilometer basis (Martin and Shaheen, 2011). Carsharing allows people to drive and enjoy flexible car travel while avoiding the hassle of owning cars, including purchase, maintenance, insurance, and parking (Burkhardt and Millard-Ball, 2006). Additionally, carsharing could fill gaps caused by limited carrying capacity, timetables, and inflexibility associated with other alternative transportation modes (Kent and Dowling, 2013), and complement existing transportation modes or supplement off-peak public transport services (Firnkorn and Müller, 2011). Carsharing has been documented as a strategy to reduce car ownership and vehicle miles/kilometers traveled in urban areas (Shaheen et al., 2015). Studies have shown that many carsharing members have sold their private cars and some have postponed or abandoned their plans to buy private cars after using carsharing (Klincevicius et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2010). A carsharing vehicle reduces the need for four to 10 private cars in continental Europe, six to 23 cars in North America, and seven to 10 vehicles in Australia (Shaheen and Cohen, 2007). Carsharing has also been demonstrated to enable members to replace some of their driving with alternative travel modes such as public transport, walking, and cycling. This has led to a 30%–70% reduction in annual vehicle miles/kilometers traveled (Martin and Shaheen, 2011; Meijkamp and Theunissen, 1996).====Carsharing originated in Switzerland due to a group of environmentally concerned citizens in the 1980s and was introduced in North America and Asia in the 1990s. Today, carsharing is available in many countries worldwide. In October 2018, carsharing services were operating in 47 countries and six continents, with approximately 32 million members sharing over 198,000 vehicles (Shaheen et al., 2018). However, the rapidly increasing number of carsharing members and vehicles remains small compared to the billions of private cars. Many carsharing organizations struggle to recruit members, and the market penetration and use of carsharing remain low in many countries, although they are increasing (Sprei and Ginnebaugh, 2018). Carsharing has been adopted widely to reduce personal transportation expenses and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of auto use (Shaheen and Cohen, 2013). However, the positive social and environmental impacts of carsharing remains weak because the number of carsharing users is small and vehicle use is low (Nobis, 2006). Thus, it is crucial for policymakers and the operators of carsharing organizations to effectively encourage more travelers to use carsharing rather than private cars.====Many studies have explored the motivations and key reasons for using carsharing services. Three factors contribute to the ongoing carsharing membership growth worldwide: cost savings; the convenience of locations, use, and access; and environmental awareness(Danielis et al., 2016, Oyedele and Simpson, 2018, Shaheen and Cohen, 2013, Genikomsakis et al., 2013).Some studies have also investigated people's motives for using carsharing by constructing human behavioral models from a psychological perspective through theories and models such as the theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance models, the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology (Haldar and Goel, 2019; Kim et al., 2018; Mattia et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2019). These studies offer insights into promoting carsharing use. However, these factors appear insufficient to explain the selection processes and mechanisms that cause people to switch from private cars to carsharing. Transforming the travel mode is, in reality, an issue of travel mode choice, which is generally based on the utility maximization framework of microeconomic theory (Bhat, 2000). The complex interactions of various factors affect how people may use different travel modes (Dias et al., 2017). Only when many car owners choose to use carsharing rather than their own cars can the benefits of carsharing in alleviating traffic problems become significant. Thus, understanding travelers' selection processes and mechanisms for using carsharing and private cars is critical to promoting carsharing use and developing a sustainable transport system. To our knowledge, few studies have attempted to explore the processes by which travelers choose between private cars and carsharing. Therefore, this study attempts to close this gap to provide theoretical and practical guidance for developing of carsharing and sustainable transportation. This research contributes to the current literature on travel mode choice and the sharing economy in the transportation sector. Moreover, the study results provide theoretical guidance to help traffic policymakers and carsharing organizations formulate relevant policies and strategies to guide more travelers to switch from using private cars to carsharing.",Research on travelers’ transportation mode choice between carsharing and private cars based on the logit dynamic evolutionary game model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012221000502,10 December 2021,2021,Research Article,22.0

Although ceiling price is one of the most significant elements in BOT policy given that it has a focal-point effect, it has been rarely examined in prior studies. Subsequently, the study formulates a model of ceiling price under the framework of simple two-route network by integrating the nature of travelers' mode choice with the interaction between stakeholders through the ==== as well as a risk-mitigation approach in the ceiling price decision-making process. The proposed model has unique characteristics that allow the government to protect social welfare while still providing opportunities for private investors to achieve their optimal toll rates. It also provides room to the government for negotiating with private investors while taking into account travelers' benefits and risk identification. The model is applied to a case study in Hanoi, Vietnam; and successfully showed its applicability with empirical evidences. The proposed method highlights planning aspects rather than road users’ aspect, which is expected to contribute to a project preparation stage in BOT projects.","Despite consensus among researchers that price control negatively affects price levels due to its collusive effect (Scherer and Ross, 1990; Schelling, 1960), price control is still preferred in many countries, especially developing nations. From the government viewpoint, introducing a ceiling price, or the establishment of a maximum price, may be useful during war, inflation, and/or monopolization of a certain market, as it prevents producers from charging excessively (for maximizing social benefit). Such disproportionate charges may lead to a disorder in the market where consumers oppose the given price, saying it is extremely high when compared to their payment acceptability.====In infrastructure development, price policies vary across countries with political debates on (de-)regulation (Li et al., 2019). In the context of developing countries, a regulation option recommends that the government uses state-owned companies to provide infrastructure service at socially optimal timing, quality level, and acceptable price. Correspondingly, a deregulation option requires the participation of the private sector in providing services, usually under forms of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Deregulation is expected to not only reduce the budgetary burden of governments but also lower the service price based on the mechanism of market competition. However, there are numerous cases showing contradictory outcomes such as increasing prices (Trebing, 2008). The aforementioned debate reveals the existence of a mixed case of pricing policy, in which the ceiling price policy (acting as a regulation) is applied in the deregulation domain of PPPs.====The build-operate-transfer (BOT) concept was initially introduced in Europe in the eighteenth century, and gained popularity in infrastructure projects in the nineteenth century, based on the idea that private investors have the right to charge users to regain their investments (Chen and Subprasom, 2007). Since then, numerous studies on toll road have been undertaken. The issue of BOT toll road is generally considered under the wider context of road pricing with two well-known schemes, including the first-best-pricing rule (Yang and Huang, 1998) and the second-best pricing rule (Small and Verhoef, 2007; De Borger et al., 2005). In the BOT project context, a large body of the literature focuses on determining the optimal toll charge in relation to roadway capacity and travel demand (Yang and Meng, 2000, 2002; Chen et al., 2003; Chen and Subprasom, 2007; Verhoef, 2007; Feng et al., 2016). Another noteworthy focus was regarding the effect of regulation on price (Tsai and Chu, 2003; Subprasom and Chen, 2007; Feng et al., 2015).====Further notes should be put on the review work of Meng and Lu (2017). In their focus on quantitative analyses of BOT highway franchising, previous studies are categorized into five main aspects including (i) BOT Highway Investment and Benefit Analyses (Mohring and Harwitz, 1962; Tan et al., 2009); (ii) Interactions Between The Government and Private Firms for the BOT Highway Project Contract Establishment (Tan et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018), (iii) Impact Analyses of Highway User Heterogeneity (Arnott and Kraus, 1995; Bichsel, 2001), (iv) Network Perspective for Highway Franchising and Ownership Regime and (Yang et al., 2004; Verhoef et al., 2010) and (v) Risk Analyses of BOT Highway Projects (Nombela and de Rus, 2004; Auriol and Picard, 2013; Niu and Zhang, 2013).====Notably, Meng and Lu (2017) pointed out some important issues that are not addressed enough by the literature. In which, an interesting suggestion is to consider new add-on BOT road in a transportation network, especially in a common situation of the developing countries where BOT roads and stated-own roads co-exist. This research topic is expected to consider the mixed road ownership regimes and/or to derive a revenue-sharing mechanism among the network operators. This study can be considered as an effort to keep up with this “new add-on” issue which is recently of interest of some researchers (Tan, 2012).====It should be noted that most of the previous studies on BOT focused on determining the optimal toll rates rather than the ceiling price. In particular, when investigating the BOT road pricing problem, many researchers assumed regulated price control as a presetting value (Chen and Subprasom, 2007; Subprasom and Chen, 2007), where the determination of the level of ceiling price is ignored. The ceiling price should be examined carefully given that it has a focal-point effect that is characterized as a phenomenon where service prices are gravitated towards a regulated price ceiling. (Engelmann and Müller, 2011; Ma, 2007). This study attempts to close the loopholes by considering the establishment of a ceiling price for BOT road projects, with the help of a simple model that integrates the benefits of related stakeholders.====In addition, although numerous studies considered optimal choice of road capacity, toll rate, profitability, and social welfare gain (Rus and Romero, 2004; Guo and Yang, 2009), most of them consider road capacity as determined-fixed. This does not allow the investors to manage their risk through road capacity adjustment, thus largely depend on bilateral negotiations, for example through revenue guarantee (Qiu and Wang, 2011; Tan and Yang, 2012). It is therefore risky to private investors when acknowledging the problem of traffic demand uncertainty (Chen et al., 2001, 2006) and/or the issue of asymmetric cost information (Auriol and Picard, 2013; Shi et al., 2016). This study contributes to the literature by providing an option for private investors to adjust the BOT road capacity when acknowledging their profit is not optimized due to impacts of travel demand.====Importantly, most of previous studies are designed for developed countries where the practical situation is different from that of developing countries. In particular, some important characteristics such as the familiarity of travelers with non-charged stated-own roads and the low level of income are rarely integrated in models. This study deals with these unique characteristics in developing countries by introducing a concept of toll payment threshold (TPT) that represents the acceptance limit of travelers to pay a toll when using a road.====For simplicity, a traditional two-route problem (Marchand, 1968; De Palma and Lindsey, 2000) is assumed, in which a BOT road runs in parallel with a non-BOT road connecting two locations. The optimal ceiling price is derived from profit maximization of investors, social welfare maximization of the government, and TPT by road users. Additionally, demand uncertainty is treated in a user-based empirical approach rather than the traditional theoretical approach (Kraus, 1982;d’Ouville and McDonald, 1990). The employment of the user-based empirical approach in dealing with demand uncertainty makes this study unique in the literature because it provides options for the government to mitigate risks under different scenarios. The model is applied to an empirical case study of Phap Van – Cau Gie in Hanoi city, Vietnam.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates traveler's route choice behavior, service operator benefit maximization, social welfare evaluation, travelers' toll payment threshold (TPT) measurement, and the ceiling price determination for a BOT road in a two-route network. Section 3 presents an empirical case study to which the model is applied.

We find that improvement in LPI in the poorest countries of the world reduces the overall cost of transport and amount of services required to transport a given product along a given route by a given mode. Importantly, the reduction in modal cost of transport results in modal substitution. We use the framework to explore the consequences of an improvement in low income country logistics performance for GDP and ====.","Over the last decade the use of international air transport has increased sharply due to the increasing demand for ‘just in time’ delivery of intermediate goods and the increasing importance of trade between countries without common borders (Cristea et al., 2013). During the same period the use of global maritime transport has also increased. However, the growth in international air freight has been even higher than the increase in world maritime shipping due to growing sales of high value-to-weight ratio products, increasing income and importance of faster delivery (World Ocean Review, 2010). Hummels (1999) analyzes the cost of air transport starting from the 1950s and shows that it declines by a factor of approximately 12.5. This resulted in 5–7% rise in the volume of global trade and an 11% annual growth in the portion of traded value transported by air.====The increasing demand for more timely international trade, has focused attention on global trade facilitation which encompasses a wide range of activities that improve trading capacities of individual countries. Wilson et al. (2003) define facilitation of trade as the improvement in logistics at both customs and ports of entry as well as the development of more efficient administrative procedures. According to Clark et al. (2004), port efficiency is an important factor in the cost of maritime transport, amounting to 5.25% of the freight value for all sea shipments to and from the United States. Since trade facilitation is integral to the international transportation of merchandise goods, it is very important to understand how improvements in logistics will affect the cost and hence the choice of transport mode, as well as the overall volume of international trade.====A review of the literature reveals that the modal choice impacts of trade facilitation have not been sufficiently analyzed. A number of trade facilitation studies concentrate on trade volume impacts (Brainard,1997; Hummels, 2001; Wilson et al., 2003, 2005; Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004; Djankov et al., 2006; Hoekman and Nicita, 2010; Feenstra and Hong, 2014)), while ignoring the modal choice. Other studies analyze modal choice without considering trade facilitation impacts (de Jong, 2014; de Jong et al., 2017). In this study, we seek to analyze the impact of trade facilitation on both modal choice as well as trade volume. To do so, we employ a modified version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model which we extend to incorporate our new empirical estimates of the impact of trade facilitation on modal choice. The latter are based on trade costs by mode taken from the Latin American trade data available from Hummels et al. (2009), supplemented by the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI), which is the most widely used measure of trade facilitation. These new estimates allow us to examine the impact on modal choice and trade volume of an improvement in LPI by the world's poorest countries which are currently the focus of significant investments in trade facilitation measures.",Impacts of trade facilitation on modal choice and international trade flows,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201222100040X,23 October 2021,2021,Research Article,28.0

It is therefore relevant to estimate the sensitivity of the demand for on-street parking to cost.==== The full cost of parking (the generalised cost of parking) consists of a parking fee and the cost of searching for a vacant parking space (cruising). The cost of cruising is typically unobserved,==== but ignoring it biases the estimate of the demand elasticity because the cost of searching for a vacant parking space depends on the number of cars parked, i.e. the demand for parking (Inci et al., 2017, Zakharenko, 2016). This paper proposes a solution to this problem. We formulate an econometric model with both parking fees and cruising for parking as arguments for the demand elasticity for parking. We show how this demand elasticity can be identified, even in situations where cruising for parking is unobserved, when the model is extended to include spatial interaction between the parking facilities.====The economic literature has shown a growing interest in regulatory parking policies and provides a comprehensive treatment of parking pricing (Inci, 2015). Verhoef et al. (1995) analyse different parking policies as a substitute to road pricing and find that the use of parking fees is superior to physical restrictions on parking space supply. Fosgerau and De Palma (2013) show that workplace parking charging schemes can be used as a substitute for the time-varying toll to reduce urban congestion. Moreover, it is typically argued that parking should be priced at its opportunity cost, just like any other commodity. Arnott et al. (2005) identify a potential triple dividend from optimal parking pricing: reduced cruising for parking, reduced congestion (travel time savings), and the use of parking revenues to lower other taxes (reduced deadweight loss caused by tax distortions). However, in real life parking facilities are often underpriced (Small and Verhoef, 2007). This underpricing leads to cruising for parking, which is a pure loss from a social welfare perspective (Shoup, 2005, Calthrop and Proost, 2006). Arnott and Inci (2006) argue that parking pricing (especially hourly parking fees) has the downside that it can increase congestion by implying shorter parking durations and thus increase traffic congestion by increasing parking turnover. Arnott et al. (2015) examine the optimal level of curbside parking capacity when both urban transport and curbside parking are underpriced and consider the situation where garage parking is an alternative to the curbside.====Our paper adds new insights to the empirical literature that attempts to estimate the price elasticity of parking (see e.g. Feeney, 1989, Concas and Nayak, 2012, Lehner and Peer, 2019). This small but growing literature suggests that the price elasticity of parking demand varies depending on many factors (e.g. local context, time of day, trip purpose, income and competing transport options) and lies in the range between ==== and ====; depending on the specification of parking demand (occupancy, dwell time and volume) as shown in Lehner and Peer (2019). Moreover, several studies estimate the price elasticity of demand for parking ignoring the cost of cruising (see e.g. Kelly and Clinch, 2009, Hensher and King, 2001). There is, however, a rather surprising absence of accurate empirical estimates of the effect of the total cost of parking on the demand for parking. This effect is important, as it is required for rigorous welfare analysis of a parking policy.====In this paper, we propose a new stylised econometric model to identify the elasticity of parking demand to total parking cost, using the usually available data collected by cities (parking occupancy rates and parking fees). We illustrate this model using parking data available for Copenhagen. We show that the effect of the parking fee is always less than the effect of the cost of parking in absolute value. We also show that the effect of total cost of parking can be identified, even if the cost of cruising is unobserved, by extending the econometric model to include the spatial interaction between the parking facilities (streets). Our empirical findings suggest that a significant cruising bias is likely to be present in the parking price elasticity measures in the literature (when interpreted as elasticities to the total parking cost).====The next section introduces an econometric model for the demand for on-street parking; Section 3 presents the empirical illustration, and Section 4 concludes.",A model for estimation of the demand for on-street parking,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012221000368,29 September 2021,2021,Research Article,29.0

Vehicle platooning is anticipated to improve traffic safety performance and increase roadway capacity (Calvert et al., 2019, Axelsson, 2016), thereby boosting the overall efficiency for transportation systems. Meanwhile, vehicles in platoons attain the endogenous economic benefits in two aspects: improved fuel efficiency due to smoother aerodynamic movements (Tsugawa et al., 2016, Lammert et al., 2018) and reduced driving workload due to vehicle automation and assistance (Janssen, 2015). The promising benefits spark research interests in planning, managing, and commercializing of vehicle platooning systems, especially for truck platooning systems (Bhoopalam et al., 2018), as fuel and labor costs occupy 60% of the total operating cost in the trucking industry (Murray and Glidewell, 2019).====When examining the cost-saving mechanisms of vehicle platooning, one can easily find that the leading vehicle plays a key role. First, due to the aerodynamic drag reduction effect when vehicles travel in a platoon, the leading vehicle contributes most to the overall fuel efficiency improvement while experiencing less amount of fuel savings than its followers. The degree of improvement is influenced by vehicle shape and size (Hammache et al., 2002, Levedahl et al., 2010). An experimental study on a three-truck platoon indicates that the following vehicles can achieve an average 10% of energy savings while the leading vehicle achieves less than 1% (McAuliffe et al., 2017). Second, a leading vehicle’s driver undertakes more driving effort than the following vehicles, as fully automated vehicles are not yet advanced enough to be implemented in platoons. Instead, partially automated vehicles equipped with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) are expected to be used widely to facilitate vehicle platooning. With this technology, drivers on the following vehicles only need to conduct lateral control. Longitudinal control, including speed control and distance keeping, is delegated to the leading vehicle’s driver (Shladover et al., 2015). With the increase of vehicle automation level, it can also be envisioned that drivers on the following vehicles can fully rest while the whole platoon is traveling (ACEA, 2018). Compared to fuel savings that largely depend on the engine performance, the benefit from effort reduction is more subjective and thereby is perceived differently by different individuals. This phenomenon is similar to the reduction in the value of travel time when using fully automated vehicles (van den Berg and Verhoef, 2016). Identified reduction factors include but are not limited to travel purposes, the type and duration of on-board activities, whether the vehicle is private or shared, and drivers’ socioeconomic attributes (de Almeida Correia et al., 2019, Molin et al., 2020, Pudāne et al., 2018). Therefore, a platoon operator would intuitively choose the vehicle who brings the most energy savings and benefits on driving-effort reduction to lead the whole platoon. However, as the leading vehicle always benefits the least, drivers are reluctant to be a volunteer leader, if they are not compensated by others.====This underlying conflict triggers the idea of using profit sharing or benefit reallocation mechanisms to facilitate the formation of vehicle platoons. In practice, the mechanisms can be realized by monetary transfers among members in the formed platoon via telecommunications, such as vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. When assuming the individual drivers/vehicles are rational agents, a mechanism is useful only if it aligns with their compatibility in joining platoons. Otherwise, they are likely to switch positions with others or leave the assigned platoons for more significant benefits, making unstable platoons and disturbing traffic flow. The willingness for individuals to join and stay in a given platoon with designated monetary transfers is first delineated in our previous work (Sun and Yin, 2019) and referred to as ====. Moreover, the mechanism is also expected to achieve behavioral stability for a random platoon formation and, more importantly, for the optimum one with the maximum total benefit. In this regard, our previous work first solved a mixed-integer program for a fleet of “platoonable” vehicles to find the optimal platoon formation that maximizes the total benefit. Based on this result, we further applied a fair allocation mechanism to ensure that each vehicle obtains benefits proportional to their contribution to the system.====Our prior work assumes the existence of a central controller and explores a centralized benefit allocation scheme. In this study, we investigate a distributed benefit reallocation mechanism. Compared to the centralized approach, the distributed mechanism is not subject to the central coordination, so that it can be deployed more easily and flexibly, and is more scalable and adaptive to different platooning scenarios. However, the absence of a central controller also implies that vehicles have to perform as rational agents to make all decisions through peer-to-peer coordination. It then has the risk of generating an inefficient outcome because of the incompatible personalized utilities and the information credibility issue of the distributed networks (Jiang et al., 2017). Therefore, our study aims to theoretically address the incompatibility between individuals’ utilities and system efficiency without leveraging a central coordinator, while ensuring the information credibility and mechanism fairness.====Our investigation focuses on single-brand vehicle platooning where vehicles are identical regarding their vehicle model and configuration. It implies that the gained fuel efficiency from platooning is indifferent to the sequence of vehicles. In other words, vehicles contribute the same to the total fuel efficiency, once the number of vehicles and the operational speed are determined. In addition, we assume that a single driver perceives the same driving effort in all following positions, which is always less than that at the leading position. Therefore, a platoon’s total benefit is only determined by the leading vehicle being chosen. Under our mechanism, the leading vehicle will collect payments from its followers, as leading a platoon provides an effort-relief service. The other way around, the followers are the buyers of the service and pay the leader. When agents hold different willingness-to-pay (WTP) for this service, the agent with the minimum WTP is expected to be the leader to maximize the platoon’s total utility. With this feature, an auction mechanism, named ====, is proposed under which the leading vehicle and the monetary transfers are determined through a bidding process, which can be perfectly deployed in the peer-to-peer system.====Auction is the most well-studied mechanism in the literature, and the most commonly-used mechanism in practice. In transportation research, auctions have been widely used in the freight transportation service procurement to improve freight operations (Caplice and Sheffi, 2003, Lafkihi et al., 2019). In recent years, auctions have also been studied for parking management in urban areas, especially for the shared parking platform that utilizes supply from both public parking spaces and private parking lots (Xiao et al., 2018, Xiao and Xu, 2018). One of the fundamental properties required for auctions is ====, meaning that agents maximize their utilities by bidding their values for the good truthfully. The well-known second-price auction, or Vickrey auction, is one of the mechanisms that can ensure dominant strategy incentive compatibility (Vickrey, 1961). Since each agent’s WTP is their private information that is intangible to others, platoon leader auctions that are incentive compatible admit trustworthy information sharing and stable outcomes. The second commonly-seen requirement is ====, meaning that auctions guarantee all that agents can achieve non-negative utility by joining the platoon. Consequently, incentive compatible and individual rational auctions ensure behavioral stability and maximize the total utility from all agents, which we refer to as achieving the ====. On top of these three requirements, we expect platoon leader auctions to be ====, meaning that no external compensation is made to agents nor extra profits are collected from them.====The platoon leader auction is uniquely distinguished to other standard auction formats, as agents here are not clear whether they are the sellers who provides the platooning service, or the buyers who procure the service before the play begins. This is only discovered as a part of the auction outcome. Contrarily, well-studied auctions, including single-unit goods auctions, multi-unit goods auctions, or bilateral trade, clearly divide the agents and their behaviors into the buyer’s side and the seller’s side. Therefore, many well-stated theorems in auction theory cannot be directly applied in this study, leaving us space to fundamentally inspect the existence and the characterizations of the desired auction mechanism. We conduct our analysis mainly in the ==== environment, where the outcome depends only on the revealed bids, instead of any assumptions regarding any agents’ beliefs on their companions’ true WTP. If the desired auctions exist, they admit efficient outcomes for any realizations on agents’ WTP, attaining the first-best solution. Unfortunately, our analysis in Section 3 reveals that there does not exist an ex post mechanism satisfying economic efficiency, incentive compatibility, individual rationality and budget balance at the same time. As a remedy, we propose an alternate mechanism types in Section 4, which employs linear monetary transfer functions regarding agents’ WTP and results in an approximate equilibrium that assures behavioral stability. We then compare it with a posted-price mechanism with a threshold policy, which can be further optimized to achieve the second-best solution, to elaborate its simplicity and effectiveness in real-life implementations.====In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 provides the basic assumptions and the utility functions used in modeling. The non-existence of the desired auctions and its proof are elaborated in Section 3, with an emphasis on the contradiction among incentive compatibility, budget balance, and individual rationality. Section 4 provides the two alternate mechanisms and analyzes the possible equilibrium outcomes in detail. Based on that, the practical implementation of these mechanisms are briefly discussed. Lastly, Section 5 concludes this paper and points out its limitations and future research directions.",An auction mechanism for platoon leader determination in single-brand cooperative vehicle platooning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201222100037X,27 September 2021,2021,Research Article,30.0

The analysis studies the effects of such contracts depending on airport ownership structure. We show that private airports tend to share less concession revenues than public ones eventually leading to lower welfare levels. These results have relevant policy implications when concession revenue sharing contracts are specified in practice.,"A number of changes have occurred in the last decades that have modified market structure and the competition in air transport markets. In particular, the deregulation of the airline market coupled with the privatization process of airports has intensified the competition between airports. This has pushed agents to search for new strategies to achieve a competitive advantage. In addition to revenues from aeronautical charges, concession revenues (coming from non-aeronautical activities) have turned decisive once airports cannot rely on public financing. In fact, ATRS (2018) found that non-aeronautical revenue in major airports reached over 70% of their total revenue. Moreover, ACI (2018) reveals that worldwide the average of concession revenues remained at 39.4% of total revenues. Nevertheless, it is airlines that generate those revenues, which airports earn as a positive externality. Airports and airlines have signed agreements whereby concession revenues are shared, given the complementarity between the demand for aviation services and the demand for concession services. Over time, concession revenue sharing contracts have become increasingly common. For example, Tampa International Airport has been sharing revenue with airlines since 2000. In 2006, it shared 20% of its net revenue with its signatory airlines. The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (2010) is also implementing similar revenue sharing arrangements covering the 2009 to 2013 fiscal years. The revenue remaining after satisfying all requirements is divided between the parties, with 30% allocated to signatory airlines and 70% allocated to the airport authority in the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, and respective shares of 25% and 75% applying in 2011–2013. The signatory airline share is distributed among the airlines based on each airline’s share of enplaned passengers. In 2002, the Frankfurt Airport signed a five-year agreement with Lufthansa and other airlines.====This paper studies the effects of concession revenue sharing contracts in a model of airport–airline pairs that compete in a certain catchment area. Due to the growth in the number of airports around the world, many situations arise where two or more airports compete for attracting the same passengers, that is, they share the same catchment area. Examples of airports sharing catchment areas are London, Paris, Rome and Milan in Europe, or San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Washington, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, and Los Angeles in the US. Then, nowadays passengers face the decision among airport–airline pairs, instead of an airline within a single airport context; for example, a passenger traveling from London to Alicante could fly with either Ryanair from Stansted or with EasyJet from Gatwick. Thus, these contracts serve to align the interests of airports and airlines in order to attract passengers and improve the profit of the vertical chain. Furthermore, revenue sharing alters airline competition, e.g. by providing special treatment to particular carriers, which may raise market power issues.====We present the effects of revenue sharing contracts when airports pursue different objectives. The literature has typically considered private airports that maximize profits. Although the literature suggests that welfare maximization will deliver different results compared to profit maximization, we extend the literature on airport competition by comparing the equilibrium outcomes under two public airports, two private airports and one public-one private airport when revenue sharing contracts are employed. We find that when two airports compete with each other, they can use the sharing proportion to influence competition and increase the number of passengers at the expense of the other competing airport. On the other hand, the level of the sharing proportion is directly related to the aeronautical charge.====The aeronautical charge is linked to the type of regulation existing at each airport which, in general, is chosen by the regulatory institutions of the sector. In practice, we can find different regulatory frameworks and different forms of regulatory constraints such as rate of return, price cap or sliding-scale. The need to regulate airports is due to the increasing privatization of the sector. For example, according to Forsyth et al. (2020), at Belgian, German, Dutch, and Greek airports rate of return regulation applies. On the other hand, airports applying price-cap regulation “include many of the largest European airports, including London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Lisbon, Vienna and the major Italian airports”. In contrast, public airports do not have a regulatory system per se, but they maintain low prices. An example in this sense are the Spanish airports, whose management is centralized by a public company, AENA, which since 2015 has been partially privatized. We show that if the aeronautical charge is high enough, the airport shares all the concession revenues with the airline. In that manner, airlines obtain the whole positive externality they generate.====Furthermore, the comparison of different airport ownership regimes unveils that when airports distribute all their concession revenues with the airlines, that is, the sharing proportion is equal to one we find that the level of traffic, airfares and profits will be the same. This fact shows that with a high enough aeronautical charge, the ownership effect is neutralized. On the other hand, in the case where airports do not share all their concession revenues, which is what happens in practice, it is confirmed that the privatization of airports causes a social welfare reduction. In addition, private airports tend to share less concession revenues than public ones.====In recent years, the vertical relationship between airports and airlines is a matter of increasing attention among scholars (see D’Alfonso and Nastasi, 2014). Basso and Zhang (2007) reviewed the evolution that the vertical relationship of airports and airlines has had in the literature. They differentiate between the traditional approach, in which airlines are taken as price takers, that is, the decisions on the level of traffic fall directly to the airport, and the vertical structure approach, with airports supplying an input to airlines (Basso and Zhang, 2008). In the vertical structure approach, airlines behave strategically, and given the vertical relationship, airports, which are located in the upstream market, can influence the decisions of airlines and the equilibrium in the downstream market. Barbot (2009), in a setting where two vertical structures compete with each other, determined that there are incentives to establish vertical agreements. However, as Barbot and D’Alfonso (2014) states, not every vertical agreement sustains. Later, Barbot (2011) analyzed the effects of three different types of agreements for the case of one airport ans several airlines, and D’Alfonso and Nastasi (2012) make the same analysis, although with two vertical structures competing. Barbot (2011) collects the agreements from Starkie (2009). The types of agreements that are the most common are: (1) the European case, in which companies negotiate rates with the airport, therefore, they end up paying a lower price than the rest of the airlines that do not sign any agreement ; (2) the Australian case, where airlines sign long-term terminal leases and its management; and (3) the case of US, in which airlines pay the airport the variable costs of its facilities plus a part of the fixed costs.====Then, there are incentives for signing vertical agreements between airports and airlines, which is supported by Barbot et al. (2013) who found evidence of vertical collusion in two scenarios, when there is a main national carrier in a small airport, or in the case of low cost carriers in secondary airports. However, there is a trade-off between competition and welfare. Signing vertical agreements solves the problem of double marginalization because of the integration between an upstream and a downstream firm, but in turn, they surface anti-competitive issues in the downstream market. Specifically, this occurs when an airport offers exclusive agreements where only a few airlines benefit, altering the competition between the airlines operating at the airport. Nevertheless, these papers do not consider concession revenue sharing contracts.====Zhang and Zhang (1997) were the first to introduce concession revenue sharing contracts in the literature following a traditional approach. Later, Zhang et al. (2010) and Fu and Zhang (2010) characterized the contract under the vertical structure approach. Fu and Zhang (2010) studied the competitive and welfare implications when an airport offers airlines the option of sharing its concession revenue. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2010) analyzed the degree of revenue sharing depending on the downstream market structure; that is, if the airlines services are substitutes, complements or independent. Furthermore, they also study the case of two competing airports, in which case, upstream competition results in a higher degree of revenue sharing. These papers all assume profit-maximizing airports.====The next section sets out the basic model where two public airports compete and provides some comments about the contract. Section 3 introduces private airports and compares the different scenarios. Finally, we conclude with some remarks and policy recommendations.",The effects of concession revenue sharing contracts in airport competition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012221000381,25 September 2021,2021,Research Article,31.0

This paper studies the role of public transportation in shaping the urban structure. Its main contribution is to propose a tractable model as a tool to study ,"Transportation and commuting are central to the theory of cities and urban structure. Early works from Alonso (1964), Mills (1967), and Muth (1969) developed the starting point of the modern urban economics literature in what is called the monocentric city model. In that model, production takes place at the Central Business District (CBD), where all jobs are located. The core of the model is that residents consume a numeraire good, housing, and must commute. As commuting costs increase with distance to the CBD, the differences in these costs along the city must be balanced by differences in the price of living space and consumption of housing (Brueckner, 1987). For this reason, land and rental prices, as well as population density, should decrease with distance to the CBD, and dwelling size should increase with distance to the CBD. This model has been extended in many directions, for example, to study amenities (Brueckner et al., 1999), local public goods (de Bartolome and Ross, 2003), landscape preferences (Turner, 2005), and the institutional frictions in land markets related to slums (Henderson et al., 2020), among others. See Duranton and Puga (2015) for an extensive review.====Public transport is essential to commuting in many cities around the world. For example, the share of public transport trips is 28% in 25 of the European largest cities, while the share of private car trips was 33% in 2015 (EMTA, 2015).==== The use of public transport is arguably more important in developing countries. The average share of trips made by public transport in 15 of the largest cities in Latin America was 43% in 2009, significantly higher than the share made by car, which was 28% (CAF, 2010). The public transport system’s features and technology affects commuting costs and, thus, following the argument of its central importance, it should change the urban structure.====This paper studies the role of public transport in shaping cities, through a novel use of the monocentric city model. We focus on three crucial aspects of the urban structure: (i) use of public and private transport according to location; (ii) spatial sorting of different income groups, and (iii) how housing price, land price, dwelling sizes, population density, and structural density (floor-to-area ratio) change with distance to the central business district. We show that the model provides significant predictory power regarding several (ir)regularities that are usually observed in cities with high use of public transport. When cities differ in commuting costs components, their structure and use of public transport will be different. For example, the discrete nature of stations in space allows us to obtain the inverted U-shape of public transport usage along the city that has been identified in some metropolis. The main contribution of the paper is, therefore, to propose a tractable model that is a useful tool to address the efficiency and impact of transport policies in the long-run.====The literature about the role of transportation on the urban structure of cities is extensive. As this paper, some contributions have developed modifications of the monocentric city model to study population density and urban sprawl. For instance, Baum-Snow (2007) introduces radial highways into the model, retaining the primary standard results, but suggesting that this transportation infrastructure causes suburbanization. Kim (2012) incorporates vehicle size choice, arguing that as commuting cost per mile increases the city tends to expand, as opposed to the predictions of the standard model. In a later study, Kim (2016) includes negative externalities into his model of vehicle size choice, showing a positive relationship between population density and fuel-efficiency (closely related to vehicle size) when externalities are priced.====Unlike these contributions, our paper allows residents to choose among commuting by car, public transport, or foot. Certainly, there are studies that incorporate other modes of transportation into the standard monocentric city model. For example, Baum-Snow et al. (2005) study the effect of the incorporation of a rail transit line on ridership and modal shifts through making assumptions about the relative speeds of the transportation modes. Other papers have studied the role of public transit on explaining the sorting of residents by income in a city (LeRoy and Sonstelie, 1983, Glaeser et al., 2008, Su and DeSalvo, 2008). In particular, Glaeser et al. (2008) argue that “the primary reason for central city poverty is public transportation”. However, in all these studies, the modeling of public transport is quite simple; indeed, public transport is simply modeled as a car that is slower and less expensive. The consequences of the simplification are that the patterns of car and public transport usage are reduced to a small number of segregated zones where either one or the other mode is dominant. Our modeling of public transportation allows for more complex patterns that are relevant when studying transport taxes, emissions, vehicle-kilometer traveled, among other key outcomes.====More recently, a growing body of studies have developed quantitative urban models to study more comprehensively the implications of public transport improvements (see, e.g., Tsivanidis, 2019; Severen, 2018). For instance, Tsivanidis (2019) develops a model where multiple skill groups of workers have non-homothetic preferences over transit modes and residential locations. By taking into account time savings but also reallocation and general equilibrium effects, this study shows that a large change in the public transit infrastructure (Transmilenio) in Bogota, Colombia benefited high-skilled workers more because time savings did not compensate for price adjustments which hurt low-skilled workers more. As opposed to these quantitative urban models, our approach takes advantage of its micro-modeling feature to allow for more detailed analyses such as studying the effect on housing price changes in smaller areas than a census-tract, or boarding externalities at public transport stations.====On the other hand, the transport economics literature has modeled public transportation in a significantly more detailed way to study its optimal level of service, the efficient pricing scheme, or agglomeration externalities such as crowding and congestion (see, e.g., Hörcher et al., 2020). Furthermore, many studies have investigated the efficiency of policies such as subsidization, bus lanes, car congestion pricing, and combinations thereof in the case of interaction between modes of transportation (for recent studies, see, e.g., Proost and Van Dender, 2008; Parry and Small, 2009; Kutzbach, 2009; David and Foucart, 2014; and Basso and Silva, 2014). Nevertheless, this strand of the literature has adopted a short-run view by assuming that the housing market and location of households is exogenously fixed.==== Our paper contributes to this literature by providing a framework to assess such transportation policies when public transportation and patterns of mode usage and income along the city are interrelated.====Our paper also contributes to the literature on the benefits of better access to transportation to consumers. There is ample empirical evidence that households value improved accessibility, and several studies have estimated the effect of closer proximity to a rail station on prices (e.g., McMillen and McDonald, 2004; Gibbons and Machin, 2005; Billings, 2011; Diao et al., 2017). Other papers have studied the effect of transportation accessibility improvements on employment and population density. For example, using the opening of a rail transit line in France (the Regional Express Rail, henceforth RER) as a natural experiment, Garcia-López et al. (2017a) show an increase in employment and population density in municipalities located close to the network. Mayer and Trevien (2017) also study the RER opening and show a similar effect on employment, no effect on population density, and a rise in the likelihood of high-skilled residents living near a RER station. Motivated by this evidence, Garcia-López et al. (2017b) delve into the effects of rail transit improvements in Paris between 1968 and 2010, and show an increase in employment subcenters formation. Yet, the theory suggests that the average impact may mask significant heterogeneity concerning overall accessibility (or proximity to the CBD). Our theoretical model delivers price elasticities with respect to the distance to the station that change with distance to the CBD depending on structural parameters. Thus, it can shed light on how the effect of closer proximity changes along a transport corridor such as a rail line.====The discrete nature of the stops and the fact that people may walk downstream or upstream to access public transport drives the action and predictory power while remaining a rather simple model.==== The non-monotonic commuting costs induce non-monotonic gradients with peaks in prices (as in Fig. 1), population density, and structural density at stations, where dwelling sizes are smaller. These predictions have been suggested in the literature, for example, by Duranton and Puga (2015), and modeled in the context of complementary public transport modes, where people take buses to train stations but car is not available as an alternative mode (Kilani et al., 2010).====However, it is the combination of detailed modeling of public transport, a simple discrete choice model between car and transit, and income heterogeneity that makes the model stand out. Our model predicts that the use of cars can appear all along the city and not only in long stretches of the city, where that mode dominates without any use of public transport, as currently available models predict. We also show that the presence of public transport can break the ordered sorting from the models without the need to have multiple modes of transportation. Our model with only public transportation and two income-groups has a large amount of mixing at the level of the distance between stops because, as the price gradients are non-monotonic due to the access cost to the stations, price bids can cross multiple times.====Finally, even though it is not the main purpose of the paper, we study the policy of pricing pollution externalities and extending the public transportation network. We compare the untolled city with the resulting equilibrium when the marginal external cost per km is charged, the revenues are distributed among residents and public transport service is extended as long as it has demand. We find that the optimally tolled city is 8% more compact, the modal share of car trips is 15 percentage points lower, and 35% fewer kilometers are driven. The demand for public transportation is larger and 4.5 additional km of transit are provided, which had no demand in the untolled city. We also obtain that the utility achieved by both income groups is lower.====Nevertheless, the difference in rental prices and population density is the prediction where our model significantly differs from previous ones. As our model can have more mixing along the city than traditional models, the changes in prices and density that follow the implementation of a policy have a more significant dispersion. Besides the macro-changes that would be observed in a simpler monocentric model with two zones, it predicts changes due to the presence of stations and changes in the income group. For example, within five kilometers the policy induces changes in household density that are very different over space and can range from an increase of 17% to a decrease of 13%. These results highlight the relevance of the model and the potential it has for future policy analysis.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the monocentric city model with public transport and characterizes the urban structure equilibrium. Section 3 extends the analysis by including the interaction between public and private transport on the urban structure and explores the implications of our model in the sorting of residents by income.

The BRT yields an operating surplus, but road expansion requires deficit financing.","Demand-side and supply-side policies can be proposed to improve the performance of urban transportation systems. Previous studies examined the effectiveness of demand-side instruments for relieving traffic congestion in large cities.==== Congestion tolls, fuel taxes or parking taxes reduce road congestion, but excessively burden lower income consumers who do not sufficiently highly value the time savings from congestion relief. In the long run, supply-side interventions are called for to expand transport infrastructure or to use the existing infrastructure more intensively to accommodate growth and reduce congestion.====Road building directly benefits all consumers who own cars or travel by taxi or minibus and those who rely on buses, but can be expensive. Roads can also induce switching from high-occupancy vehicles of bus and minibus to the lower-occupancy private cars and taxis, causing congestion to rebound somewhat. Advantages of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) are that it enables more intensive use of existing roads directly benefitting the poor, and indirectly those who use cars by reducing congestion.====There are studies that addressed the benefits of BRT in a partial equilibrium setting. With a numerically solved theoretical model, Kutzbach (2009) showed that a toll on car travel combined with reserving some road capacity for BRT shifts the modal share in favor of BRT, reduces car and BRT travel times and increases consumer surplus. Basso et al. (2019) used a queuing model of congestion to show that BRT can decrease both travel times and operator costs, fares remaining unchanged.====In studying social benefits, general equilibrium models should be preferred because transport systems can have significant effects in labor and in real estate markets causing wages, rents, real estate prices and the stock of buildings to change, creating secondary effects on travel behavior. Our model assesses two infrastructure expansion policies actually proposed for Beirut, Lebanon: (i) A BRT system running on special lanes, along with an increased number of regular buses; and (ii) an expansion of suburban highway capacity. Because of data limitations, the model treats only two geographic zones (core and suburbs), but is detailed in its economic structure. The mode choice part of the model follows a conventional approach combining private car, public bus, minibus and taxi and adding BRT as a new mode. Novel aspects of the model are that utility maximizing consumers choose not only among modes of travel as in conventional travel models, but also their location of residence and of work as well as their housing size and the number of non-work trips they make to acquire goods. The demands for goods, in turn, drive production. These joint decisions are responsive not only to travel times and monetary costs but also to wages, rents and product prices. Profit maximizing producers respond to wages, rents and prices by combining labor and floor spaces in buildings to produce output for export and local consumption. Real estate developers react to floor space prices and rents by adjusting the building stocks which, in turn, affect rents and consumer location decisions. Other novel features of the model are that the fares of the privately-operated taxi and minibus services are endogenous and competitively determined; and that the surplus or deficit of the public transport authority that operates the buses and the BRT or expands highways are also endogenous. Tsivanidis (2019) provides a spatially granular general equilibrium analysis of Bogota's TransMilenio BRT system, but does not treat road congestion or real estate conversions. It is a reduced form model designed to uncover TransMilenio's effects using econometrics. Our fully structural model evaluates the effects of prospective projects.====A brief preview of our results is as follows: the BRT proposed for Beirut reduces road congestion by 9 % as measured by the flow to road capacity ratio, improving trip-weighted average road traffic speed by 24 %. The congestion externality is reduced by 18 % and gasoline use by 15 %. The social welfare gain of the BRT proposal is 7.9 % of average income; 2.47 % is due to the reduction of congestion for the other modes and 5.43 % due to the benefits of the BRT as a new mode. The proposed road building increases capacity by 4 %, improving trip-weighted average travel speed and reducing the congestion externality by only 3 %, but also induces rebounds in traffic load and in vehicle miles traveled. The BRT project slightly suburbanizes population and slightly centralizes jobs, while the highway expansion slightly suburbanizes both population and jobs. The BRT raises rents and wages in both the center and the suburban area, but commercial rents in the center increase more than residential rents do, and vice versa in the suburbs. The road expansion project also raises rents but less in percentage terms than the BRT does, and suburban rents increase by slightly more than central rents; while central wages increase more than suburban wages do. By raising wages, the BRT also causes a floor space for labor substitution in production inducing an increase in the conversion of floor space from residential to commercial.====The BRT project improves consumer utility and social welfare and creates a surplus for the public transport authority, which would have additional benefits if invested in the economy. In contrast, the road building increases consumer utilities too but reduces overall social welfare (due to its cost and its smaller positive effect on property values) requiring deficit financing. Deficit financing would require borrowing, e.g. from the World Bank, or diverting funds from other sectors of the economy such as health or education.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model's structure focusing on the modeling of road congestion and choice of mode among private car, privately operated taxi and minibus services and publicly operated bus, all operating on the same road capacity. Section 3 presents the general equilibrium of the transport, labor, production, and real estate markets. Section 4 describes how the model was calibrated from the data.

Tyndall Justin,"University of Hawai'i Economic Research Organization, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa Department of Economics, 2424 Maile Way, Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI, 96822, USA","Received 2 November 2020, Revised 6 July 2021, Accepted 15 July 2021, Available online 26 July 2021, Version of Record 26 July 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecotra.2021.100219,Cited by (9),Traffic fatalities in the US have been rising among ,"Between 2000 and 2019, motor vehicle crashes killed 741,000 people in the US including 100,000 pedestrians.==== Fig. 1 charts the trends in traffic fatalities for both vehicle occupants and pedestrians over the 2000–2019 period. While deaths among motorists have declined over this period, deaths among pedestrians have risen by 30%. Over the same period the consumer market for private vehicles has shifted towards larger vehicles and particularly towards Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs). Larger vehicles may impose a negative externality on pedestrians by making crashes involving pedestrians more lethal. I estimate the effect of large vehicle uptake on the pedestrian fatality rate.====Vehicles on US roads became measurably larger between 2000 and 2019. Fig. 2 plots changes in vehicle characteristics among all vehicles involved in a fatal crash between 2000 and 2019. While in 2000, the typical vehicle weighed 1,745 kg, by 2019 the average vehicle had increased in weight by 10.7% to 1,931 kg (Fig. 2A). Additionally, SUVs increased their prevalence from 13.5% of vehicles to 21.5% (Fig. 2B). Over this same period, a new class of very large vehicles began to enter the consumer market. In 2000 only 2.6% of vehicles involved in fatal crashes weighed more than 2,500 kg, by 2019 the share had increased fivefold to 12.5% (Fig. 2C).==== The increased prevalence of these very large vehicles was mostly attributable to the popularity of a few large SUVs, particularly the Ford Expedition and the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe.====Data for vehicles involved in fatal incidents are more consistently collected in the US compared to vehicle registration data, as will be discussed in Section 2. However, vehicles involved in fatal crashes may not be representative of the overall vehicle fleet. Fig. 3 uses data reported on registered vehicles by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This source suggests an even more rapid shift towards SUVs and away from cars than is observed in crash data. The share of registered vehicles that are SUVs roughly tripled over this period, while the share of vehicles classified as cars fell by a third.====While larger vehicles are designed to protect their drivers and passengers in the event of a crash, less concern is given to the effect on pedestrians. Past research in the safety literature has considered the mechanisms that relate vehicle size to motorist and pedestrian safety. There are two primary mechanisms that could lead large vehicles to generate additional harm when hitting a pedestrian. First, the additional weight means the vehicle will take longer to come to a stop and will strike with more force as compared to a lighter vehicle. Second, large vehicles have higher front ends, affecting the point of impact on a pedestrian. A conventional car is likely to strike a pedestrian in the legs, propelling them over the hood of the vehicle. A vehicle with a higher front end is likely to make first contact with the pedestrian's torso or head, harming vital organs and deflecting their body under the vehicle. In transportation safety literature, pedestrians hit by light trucks (a category including SUVs, pickups and minivans) have been found to suffer greater rates of mortality (Simms and Wood, 2006; Tamura et al., 2008) and higher rates of brain injury (Roudsari et al., 2004) than those hit by cars.====Lefler and Gabler (2004) used US data from the 1990s to estimate that a pedestrian struck by a light truck is two to three times more likely to die than a pedestrian struck by a car. In a meta-analysis of papers concerned with pedestrian fatalities, Desapriya et al. (2010) found that the chance of fatal injury among pedestrians was 50% higher when struck by a light truck compared to a car. I will test for the effect of both vehicle weight and body type on pedestrian fatalities.====Significant past research has examined the effect of vehicle size on road safety. The adoption of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) vehicle emission standards in the US encouraged consumers to purchase lower emission vehicles, which were likely to be smaller. Crandall and Graham (1989) argued that this incentive resulted in higher rates of motorist fatalities due to smaller vehicles providing more limited protection to drivers. The authors pointed out that drivers of smaller vehicles are more vulnerable in crashes than they would be in a larger vehicle and extrapolate this effect across the market. However, this method ignores external safety risks that larger vehicles may impart by increasing the severity of injury to other motorists and to pedestrians. Focusing on a subset of crashes from the 1990s, Toy and Hammitt (2003) estimated the effect of vehicle types on injury severity in the US. Results indicated that SUVs fared better in protecting their driver in the event of a crash, but also inflicted more damage onto the drivers of other vehicles compared to cars. Further analysis of the interaction between light trucks in cars is provided in Gayer (2004), who similarly argued that the driver safety improvements provided by large vehicles may come at the expense of externally imposed risks. Estimates suggested that an increase in light trucks would increase overall traffic fatalities. Van Ommeren et al. (2013) focused on the relative weights of opposing vehicles involved in collisions in the Netherlands, estimating that a 500 kg increase in one car's weight increased the risk of a fatality by 70%. Ahmad and Greene (2005) revisited the analysis of Crandall and Graham (1989) specifically, finding little evidence that CAFE led to higher road fatalities in aggregate.====White (2004) attempts to directly estimate the marginal effect of drivers switching from smaller to larger vehicles in the US during 1995–2001. The assessment showed that for every driver whose life was saved on account of being in a larger vehicle, 4.3 fatalities were created among other road users, including motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. The paper also points out the inability of the legal system to provide incentives for drivers to internalize external safety risks, as drivers are typically only held responsible in cases of driver negligence rather than being held responsible for total damages inflicted.====Anderson (2008) examined cross state variation in light truck prevalence and traffic fatalities spanning the 1981–2004 period in the US. The author found that states with higher rates of light truck use had higher rates of traffic fatalities and that the increase in fatalities was primarily due to an increase in deaths among drivers and pedestrians who were struck by a light truck rather than a smaller vehicle. Anderson and Auffhammer (2014) quantified the safety externality of large vehicles, arguing the US vehicle fleet is inefficiently large and the externality could be corrected through gasoline taxes. Li (2012) also attempted to quantify the externality of light trucks, estimating the implied road safety externality of a light truck over its lifetime to be $2,400.====While there are several past studies linking vehicle size and safety, the current study is unique in a number of respects. First, I contribute an analysis covering a much more recent period in the US. The characteristics of the vehicle fleet have changed substantially during the 2010s. Second, I focus on the effect of vehicle size on pedestrian fatalities in particular. The sharp increase in pedestrian fatalities in the US is a recent phenomenon that has not been noted or studied in the economics literature. Third, I provide a new and novel data source by combining vehicle weight data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with crash level data and vehicle registration data that allows for analysis at the metropolitan level. Fourth, while prior studies have focused on vehicle weight, I focus on differences in vehicle body types, estimating unique effects for different varieties of light trucks.====The relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian fatalities is one element of overall road safety. Significant economic research has been undertaken to investigate other causes of traffic fatalities such as vehicle speed (Ang et al., 2020; Van Benthem, 2015), road congestion (Green et al., 2016) alcohol consumption (Baughman et al., 2001; Green et al., 2014; Hansen, 2015; Jackson and Owens, 2011; Levitt and Porter, 2001; Ruhm, 1996), public policy and regulation (Basili and Belloc, 2020; Borsati et al., 2019; Bourgeon and Picard, 2007; Carpenter and Stehr, 2008; KaracaMandic and Ridgeway, 2010; Peltzman, 1975), electronic distractions (Blattenberger et al., 2013; Oviedo-Trespalacios, 2018) and the driver's state of mind (Giulietti et al., 2020). The current study is focused specifically on the effect of vehicle characteristics on road fatalities, with a particular focus on pedestrian effects.====The paper will proceed as follows.

The marginal cost of public funds (MCF) is derived for fuel ==== and public transport subsidies. The model is applied to Santiago, Chile. If MCFs are computed only taking economic efficiency into account, a revenue neutral reform within the transport sector suggests increasing the car cost and reducing the bus fare in peak periods, and reducing the car cost and increasing the bus fare in off-peak periods. However, including ","Public transport subsidies can be justified on economic and social grounds. When an increase in public transport demand is met by an increase in the frequency of service, the waiting time and scheduling delay of passengers is reduced, yielding economics of scale in public transport provision when user costs are considered at par with operator costs in pricing analysis. This is the first best argument for subsidising public transport (Mohring, 1972; Turvey and Mohring, 1975). The so-called second best argument to subsidise public transport arises from the need to reduce the unpriced part of externalities associated to car driving (Sherman, 1971; Glaister, 1974), including congestion, pollution and traffic crashes. In this setting, the underpricing of car driving is the argument in the core of the economic models proposed to analyse policies that discourage car driving, including not only public transport subsidies, but also road pricing and fuel taxation, particularly in developed nations or advanced economies (Glaister and Lewis, 1978; De Borger and Wouters, 1998; Parry and Small, 2005; Proost and Van Dender, 2008; Coria and Zhang, 2017). Several reviews on the topics of road pricing and public transport subsidies, including implementation issues, have been published (Lindsey, 2006; Tsekeris and Voβ, 2010; de Palma and Lindsey, 2011; Tirachini and Hensher, 2012; Lehe, 2019).====Unlike the situation of advanced economies, simple economic efficiency concerns are not necessarily a strong justification to subsidise public transport or to apply marginal cost pricing in developing countries. Usually there is a need to address other concerns such as extreme income inequality, scarcity of public funds and the coexistence of formal and informal markets in the economy. As a result, public transport subsidies are the exception rather than the rule in the developing world. For example, in Latin America only a few cities such as Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Santiago, Mexico City and Sao Paulo have formal bus and/or metro fare subsidies (Basso and Silva, 2014) while in the vast majority of regions public transport providers receive no public subsidies, simply because the policy priorities in developing countries may differ sharply from those in developed nations. Severe budget constraints could make subsidies to public transport difficult to justify for decision makers, especially if more urgent issues such as sewage and public health are more pressing (Gakenheimer, 1999). On the other hand, when funds are available, it is common for cities in developing countries to justify transport reforms on social, environmental and safety grounds, rather than on economic efficiency grounds (Serebrisky et al., 2009).====Within the transport sector there are also special characteristics of developing countries that matter for the analysis of transport taxation and subsidies, such as a very high market share of public transport, which in several cases is met by low quality informal transport providers that might actually contribute to increasing (rather than relieving) congestion, air pollution and traffic crashes. In this context, it is not even clear if public transport is underpriced or overpriced (Serebrisky et al., 2009; Parry and Timilsina, 2010). Another characteristic is the simultaneous presence of tolled roads and low-quality backyard roads or other substitutes that are not priced. When also income distribution concerns play a role, this will lead to deviations from the traditional second best pricing (Diaz and Proost, 2014). Regarding taxation, the average rate of fuel taxes is generally lower in developing countries than in developed countries (Bacon, 2001). Exceptions include India, which has increased the fuel tax several times in recent years. Also noteworthy is the so-called “green tax” to the purchase of new cars established in 2014 in Chile, which depends on the emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and fuel consumption rates (García Bernal, 2018).====The economies of developing countries are usually characterised by the dual existence of informal and formal sectors (Newbery and Stern, 1987; Burgess and Stern, 1993; Auriol and Warlters, 2005). While on average the informal sector accounts for 12 percent of the Gross National Product (GNP) in developed OECD countries and 20–25 percent of the GNP in “transition” economies (former Soviet Union and Middle and Eastern Europe), it increases to 35–40 percent of the GNP in developing countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa (Gërxhani, 2004), where it is usually harder to collect and administer information, calculate taxes and enforce payment. The size of the informal sector in the developing world in part explains the lack of funds for transport investments and subsidies, as labour and transactions in the informal sector are hard or impossible to tax. An inefficient tax collection system poses a constraint for ambitious tax reforms, making a marginal change of an existing stable tax to be much easier to implement in these situations (Newbery and Stern, 1987). In a context in which an important part of the economy is untaxed, it is necessary to pay special attention to the interaction between transport taxes and the broader tax system.====In partial equilibrium models that account for the transport sector only when determining optimal road pricing and public transport fares, distortions in the rest of the economy are either ignored or partially included by introducing an exogenously defined marginal cost of public funds (MCF), that measures the welfare loss for society in raising additional revenue through distortionary taxes (Browning, 1976). For example, Proost and Van Dender (2008) find that road prices and public transport fares in Brussels and London increase in the presence of costly public funds, because of the benefits of generating revenue to be used elsewhere in the economy. Along the same lines, Parry and Small (2009) suggest that the MCF decreases but does not eliminate optimal second best public transport subsidies. However, Basso and Silva (2014) have shown that costly public funds might have different effects on optimal public transport subsidies in developing and developed countries. They find that in London subsidising public transport is justified in all scenarios, whereas in Santiago de Chile, without congestion pricing, optimal bus fare subsidy amounts to about 55 percent of the operational cost, but if an optimal congestion price is in place, optimal subsidy might be reduced to zero due to the welfare loss introduced by the MCF, which is not matched by the economics of scale effect on optimal (first best) public transport subsidies mainly due to the lower value of time in Santiago as compared to London. This result is an indication of the relevance of general equilibrium models when analysing transport pricing in the developing world.====In this paper, a transport taxation reform model for developing countries is formulated. This transport taxation reform takes a general equilibrium approach and uses a public finance budget constraint that includes transport taxes as well as non-transport taxes. This is relevant as the ultimate efficiency and redistribution effects of any transport tax or subsidy depends on the other tax instruments that might be changed to balance the public budget. Such approach is a better way to deal with income distribution and economic efficiency than a partial equilibrium model of transport pricing. Our paper differs also from the large literature on double dividend (surveyed in Goulder, 1995), in which one debates the proposal to increase an externality tax (a corrective and therefore non-distortive tax) in order to be able to reduce the labour tax (a distortive tax). We take into account distributional concerns as well as an incomplete tax system. We start with the tax reform model of Mayeres and Proost (2001), which we extend in two ways. First, by explicitly considering the existence of formal and informal sectors in the labour market, and second, by including multiple externalities within the transport sector.====We derive new expressions for the marginal cost of public funds (MCF), defined as the marginal cost in terms of social welfare of raising an additional unit of government revenue via a tax on a specific good or service. When comparing two tax instruments, this marginal tax approach would suggest that increasing the tax on the good with the lowest MCF and decreasing the tax on the good with the largest MCF is welfare improving. We derive the MCF for peak and off-peak car travel, peak and off-peak public transport travel and for income. Expressions for MCFs are functions of labour supply and taxes, income elasticities of consumption of different goods, price elasticities (own and cross) of demand for car travel, public transport use and consumption of other goods, the sensitivity of travel time to demand and prices of the different transport modes, and the degree of income inequality aversion in the society. Therefore, we are able to analyse how income distribution concerns influence the welfare effect of each tax or subsidy instrument.====The model is illustrated for Santiago, the capital city of Chile. This application required an extensive data collection effort for the correct calculation of MCFs in our framework, including data from the transport sector, the labour market, and the budget shares of different income groups. Multiple data sources need to be combined for the application of our model. Uncertainty is inherent to several input parameters, therefore we perform a Monte Carlo simulation for the computation of MCFs. The simulation shows how sensitive the estimation of MCFs is to different considerations regarding the inclusion of traffic externalities and distributional concerns. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 the analytical model is developed and solved. In Section 3 we compile the input parameters for the simulation, whereas in Section 4 results are presented and analysed for several relevant scenarios.

The concept of ‘time inconsistency’ goes back to the seminal research of Strotz (1955), who was the first to realize that for any discount function other than the exponential function a person's preferences are time-inconsistent. Since then, economists have discovered time-inconsistent preferences in many different contexts, including financial decision making, health, and effort provision.====Many of these studies find evidence that individuals tend to make choices that their long-run selves regret such as the grabbing immediate rewards while avoiding immediate costs (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). Such preference structures that (in trade-offs between two future time instances) attach a higher relative weight to the earlier instance the closer it gets, are usually referred to as present-biased (see overview by O'Donoghue and Rabin (2015)). Present-biased preferences can be explained by various psychological models, such as an over-pursuit of immediate gratification (e.g. Gul and Pesendorfer, 2001), impulsive choice (e.g. O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999), optimistic beliefs (e.g. Breig et al., 2020), and (opportunity) costs of time being more salient in the present (e.g. Fischer, 2001). All these psychological models are in line with present time being deemed more valuable than future time. Some are also consistent with the notion that present time is deemed more valuable than past time (e.g., salience of opportunity costs of time).====As already suggested by Brownstone and Small (2005), time inconsistency may also explain the frequently found divergence between valuations based on stated preference (SP) and revealed preference (RP) data,==== which is usually attributed to the hypothetical character of SP surveys, and hence often referred to as “hypothetical bias”.==== As an illustration, they use the example of individuals ending up taking toll lanes in real life due to running late, while in a hypothetical scenario they would opt for the standard (non-toll) lane. In turn, this causes the SP-based VOT to be lower than the corresponding RP-based VOT, as the lower propensity to pay for the toll in the SP setting translates to a higher cost coefficient, which drives down the corresponding value of time. The frequent finding that SP estimates tend to be lower than RP estimates (e.g. Ghosh, 2001; Hensher, 2001; Brownstone and Small, 2005; Small et al., 2005; Isacsson, 2007) is thus consistent with the existence of present-biased preferences.====In this paper, we estimate the willingness to accept a past, an imminent, and a future waiting time in a lab setup, where the underlying choice between receiving a monetary incentive and facing waiting time can be purely hypothetical or have real-life consequences.==== This setup allows us to draw conclusions on whether the valuations depend on the timing of the measurement (relative to when the waiting occurs), and if they depend on whether the underlying choice is incentivized (i.e. it has real consequences) or purely hypothetical. The only possibility to derive the valuations in the same way in advance, just before, and after the waiting time is to do so based on hypothetical questions, as the elicitation of the past waiting time cannot be incentivized. We therefore use the incentivized valuations mainly to test the validity of our hypothetical measures. We elicit the value of (waiting) time using multiple price lists. All valuations are in terms of willingness to accept, and the real-life waiting time that is traded against money in the incentivized setting is part of a pre-scheduled lab session, such that individuals choosing against waiting can leave the lab session earlier than anticipated.====Consistent with Krčál et al. (2019), who employ a lab setting similar to the one used for this paper and show that the main driver of hypothetical biases are scheduling constraints (which tend to be ignored in the hypothetical setting), we do not find any differences between the hypothetical and incentivized valuation of time. We therefore conclude that our hypothetical valuations are unbiased. Instead, we find support for the time-inconsistency hypothesis of Brownstone and Small (2005): participants of our experiment value present (waiting) time significantly higher than future and past (waiting) time. The ratio between the value of waiting time elicited 2 weeks in advance and just before the wait is about 2/3, while the ratio between the value elicited 2 weeks after and just before the wait is about 4/5. These results thus reflect time-inconsistent and, more specifically, present-biased preferences.====Our findings have potentially important implications for hypothetical biases in the value of time elicitation. They provide an indication that one reason why we usually observe RP-based valuations of time exceeding SP-based valuations may be because RP experiments/surveys usually concern time periods (e.g., trips) that are close in time to the experiment/survey, whereas SP experiments/surveys often refer to more abstract and/or distant time periods. More specifically, SP experiments often have an abstract, general framing that does not refer to a specific time instance, or, on the contrary, a very specific framing citing a reference point (e.g. Batley et al., 2019). The latter approach, which usually involves attribute values being pivoted around the reference trip, has become increasingly popular due to its feature of rendering the choice situations more realistic and potentially less prone to hypothetical bias (e.g. Hensher, 2010). Due to the specificity of the reference situation (for instance, in terms of mode choice, trip duration, or trip purpose), the most recent occurrence of the reference situation (e.g., a trip with specific characteristics) may have taken place some time ago, leading to a significant time gap between the trip and the measurement of the preferences that correspond to that trip. Exceptions to this are SP studies that only use reference trips that take place on the same day as the SP survey (Börjesson and Eliasson, 2014), or that recruit participants during a trip which is then used as reference trip (Kouwenhoven et al., 2014).====The paper contributes to the large body of literature on time valuation in transport. Most studies rely on SP data, with the potential presence of hypothetical biases being a major downside to the use of this data source. Time inconsistency has been suggested as an explanation for hypothetical biases, but so far little research has been conducted. One exception is Peer et al. (2014), who do not find evidence for time inconsistency, but this might be due to other confounding factors that drive their SP and RP estimates apart. Our results question the common use of retrospective reference points in SP surveys, and hence add to the recently emerging criticism of their usage: Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018) found that adding a reference point does not reduce the hypothetical bias; Peer and Börjesson (2018) show that reference points may not be stable, and the derived preferences may thus not correspond to long-term stable preferences required for welfare analysis; similarly, Hess et al. (2020) argue that reference points may induce short-run re-scheduling and loss-aversion.====We also contribute to the literature on time (in)consistency. Our approach of measuring time preferences, which is based on individuals' willingness to trade money against time spent on undesirable tasks (here: waiting), is consistent with the state-of-the-art of eliciting time preferences (Carvalho et al., 2016; Augenblick et al., 2015; Kölle and Wenner, 2018; Augenblick and Rabin, 2018). Unlike most of these studies that elicit the value of real effort we measure the value of (waiting) time. While existing studies typically analyze the value of real effort at two different moments in time, we keep the moment of waiting constant, and vary the timing of the elicitation. As a result, we reduce potentially confounding effects, in particular related to respondents’ time constraints varying over time.====Our result that participants are less willing to wait now than they state they would be in two weeks are qualitatively similar to existing research on time-inconsistent preferences. For instance, Augenblick and Rabin (2018) find that participants want to complete 86% fewer tasks when the tasks are imminent versus when they are one week away. Furthermore, in a similar study as ours, Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018) find that the (SP-based) value of time is lower when an imprecise future situation (“later”) is referred to rather than the “here and now”. Compared to our paper, however, they adopt a more narrow experimental design: they only elicit an RP value for the “here and now” situation, and rely on the SP value for the “later” scenario. Moreover, they do not elicit the valuation ahead of the waiting time (to be spent on completing a task), and the waiting time amounts to only 15 min, as compared to 60 min in our study.====Unlike experiments that aim at eliciting time preferences, contingent valuation experiments on items other than time usually find that incentivized valuations are lower than hypothetical valuations (see for instance the meta-analyses by List and Gallet (2001); Little et al. (2004); Murphy et al. (2005a); Penn and Hu (2018)). This difference may be driven by the fact that unlike other items, time cannot be saved, and consumed in the future. Additional time can only be consumed on the spot, making it most valuable in present time. This may shed light on why hypothetical biases in time valuation often have a different sign than valuations of other items. The paper therefore also contributes to developing a more general theory on the presence of hypothetical biases, the necessity of which has been emphasized by Murphy et al. (2005b), Mitani and Flores (2010), and Loomis (2011).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides information on the experimental design.

The assumption is that the time spent in the traffic can be represented by a monetary value and hence introduction of monetary compensations can lead to a more efficient organization of the transportation system. In our model, heterogeneous travelers differently assess the value of their time spent in congestion, hence it is presumably viable to reduce traffic in the most congested streets by introducing a bidding mechanism that will allow the participants who have a lower monetary ","Over the last several decades, a strengthening trend can be observed in modern societies where an increasing number of people migrate from the country towards large cities in search of better paid occupation and higher quality of life. This tendency leads to a number of new urban management issues which local authorities must take into consideration. One of these issues is the occurrence of traffic congestion during rush hour times.====It is a natural tendency in cities that most of the commercial and business areas are located in the city center, while the majority of residential and living zones are placed on the outskirts. Naturally, this results in the emergence of an intense one-direction flow of commuters driving towards the city center early in the morning and coming back from work later in the evening.====Due to a limited road capacity and an increasing demand for fast relocation capability, the competition for lane occupation has been increasing. Access to public streets is usually without barriers and scarcely regulated. Thus, space rationing is for the most part based on a simple rule: ====. In these conditions, commuters have no incentive to choose any route other than the shortest path to their destination point. This, in turn, results in an excessive demand for road space over the available capacity and hence an emergence of congestion in bottle-neck lanes. Extended time spent commuting to work, equally for all participants of road traffic and regardless of their value of time, will most likely lead to an ineffective distribution of resources such as road capacity and spare time.====The issues of sub-optimal road space rationing and street overcrowding during peak hours are often of concern to both local authorities and researchers working on the economics of transportation and traffic modeling. In practice, the approach most commonly used to solve these kinds of problems is simple tolling of selected streets at particular hours of the day. Much research has been conducted and a number of solutions have been proposed regarding how to determine the optimal charges and best sets of roads to be tolled—for further information see e.g. (Vasirani and Ossowski, 2014), or (Lindsey and Verhoef, 2000).====Although imposing fixed charges on certain roads may seem like a fairly straightforward solution, it nonetheless lacks broader flexibility, as it involves undertaking high-level political decisions which usually require a lot of time in order to get approved. Furthermore, there is always a risk that the tolls will neither be optimal nor improve traffic to the expected extent. In addition, these decisions may negatively affect the public perception of authorities, since imposing additional taxes or charges is usually not very popular among local constituencies. On the other hand, taxes collected via road tolling systems can later be used for the purposes of local community and infrastructural investments such as the construction of new interchanges, the enhancement of road capacities, and the maintenance of existing streets or subsidies for alternative means of transport—for more information on tax influence see, for example, (Abuselidze, 2012).====Internet of Things (IoT) creates new possibilities in terms of introducing more dynamic and modern forms of road pricing and traffic control. The idea of real-time communication between traffic participants and road infrastructure, i.e., Vehicle to Infrastructure (IV2) communication, has been already considered as a way to reduce traffic congestion—e.g., by syncing vehicle transit with semaphores to create fast-travel corridors through a city (Ren et al., 2013) or by ahead reservation of lane space.====However, instead of focusing on searching for optimal tolls or improving infrastructure performance, in this article we consider the possibility of developing a system which would aim to improve the position of each participant without interfering with the local infrastructure itself. This can be achieved by assuming that commuters have their own preferences about the value of time spent in congestion. Therefore, some of them may be willing to pay to be able to travel faster than they would normally do, while other drivers may agree to choose longer paths in exchange for some monetary benefits.====In our reference scenario (i.e., where no extra incentives are included), since agents have no incentive to cooperate, we may assume that the entire system converges to Nash Equilibrium (NE) (Nash, 1951). This means that no single agent is willing to change its taken route, since it would entail worsening their utility. However, reaching Nash Equilibrium does not necessarily mean simultaneously achieving Pareto efficiency (for example, as in the classic ==== (Aumann, 1959)). Thus, we are trying to answer the question of whether it is possible to find better (in terms of Pareto) allocation of money and time for the commuters by using external incentives such as mutual payments, while taking advantage of capabilities of modern vehicles equipped with direct communication protocols and embedded software systems or mobile applications. The proposed algorithm can be applied to optimize commuter flow between alternative routes as well as between private and public transportation systems. We develop this model using a static flow congestion model (Verhoef, 1999). Note that the flow-based approach simplifies the complexity of the congestion mechanism (compared to a queuing based approach). However, since we focus on the auction design, this seems to be a reasonable approach.",Optimization of the cost of urban traffic through an online bidding platform for commuters,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012221000137,March 2021,2021,Research Article,37.0

As the existing theories that consider the household deals with time allocation but not with time values, we propose an integration of some elements of both theories, generating a model with a collective view from which the VoL can be obtained. We argue theoretically that this model yields larger VoL and contains elements that should diminish the possible gap in VoL between the workers. The improved model is applied using Chilean data verifying its theoretical properties at various levels and correcting counterintuitive results obtained with the individual model.","Following the analysis of DeSerpa (1971) and Oort (1969), Jara-Díaz and Guevara (2003), showed that the willingness to pay to reduce travel time or SVTTS (subjective value of travel time savings) usually obtained from travel choice models, hides two components: the value of reallocating the time liberated to another activity (that is, the value of time as a resource or value of leisure) and the value of time assigned to travel or VTAT (which reflects the conditions of the trip and the possible discomfort that it causes). Disentangling these two components is necessary to make a correct analysis of the impacts of a change in the transport system and to guide the way investments in passenger transport should be made whenever a conflict between speed and comfort arises (Jara-Diaz, 2020).====Advancements in the microeconomic theory of time use during this century have made it possible to formulate and estimate the value of leisure (VoL) of those individuals represented in travel choice models, which permits the calculation of both components. Although the evolution of travel choice models yields increasingly reliable estimates of SVTTS, there is still a wide space for improvements in the estimation of the VoL in order to obtain the VTAT. As models to estimate VoL have been conceived and applied looking at individuals only, in this paper we want to improve the theory behind those time use models from which the VoL can be obtained by changing the view on observed behavior from the individual to the household, and to verify these improvements empirically.====Although Becker (1965) established a microeconomic framework where time use was integrated into consumer theory in a formal way. The fact that his model lacked time at work as an argument in utility induced a single value of time for all activities considered by Becker (consumption, work, and leisure), and this was the wage rate. As explained in the next section, this rather myopic approach was enriched by DeSerpa (1971), who justified rigorously a series of different values of time and their relationships. It was this much richer framework the one that served to link SVTTS - as extracted from travel choice models - with the VoL, as suggested by Truong and Hensher (1985) and corrected by Bates (1987). The VoL, however, remained hidden behind SVTTS until Jara-Díaz and Guevara (2003) managed to establish the theoretical basis for its empirical estimation, which was first fully applied in Jara-Díaz et al. (2008) using data from various cities and countries, and has been enriched with the simultaneous estimation with travel choice models in Munizaga et al. (2008) and Jokubauskaite et al. (2019).====All these advances have been made under an individual approach, such that the extensive applied work has required either the consideration of single-worker households or some assumptions regarding the distribution of expenses within multi-worker households. In this article, we examine the possible influence that the individual-unitary approach taken so far might have on the value of leisure in the case of two-worker households. We depart from this approach by integrating elements from the household economic theory which are used to build a theoretical framework that expands the scope of the calculation of the value of leisure. This makes it possible to estimate VoL for the first time considering consumption and time externalities at a household level. Most importantly, theoretical properties that can be tested empirically are found; they relate to the marginal utilities of both income and leisure, to the VoL, and to the differences between workers regarding these values.====To illustrate this, we create a weekly time use database of two-worker (of a different gender) Chilean households, built from the Chilean National Time Use Survey (NTUS; INE , 2015). The household time-use model yields empirical results that are consistent with the theoretical findings regarding marginal utilities, VoL, and gender differences which are shown to diminish with the new household model for the high income segment.====In Section 2 we present a synthesis of microeconomic time use models, reviewing those individual-based theoretical models that allow estimating empirically the values of leisure and/or work, as well as household models. In Section 3 we present the microeconomic formulation of a household time use model, analyzing its properties and the resulting theoretical values of time, and we obtain a system of equations that can be estimated econometrically. In Section 4 we apply the theoretical model experimentally, verifying the theoretical improvements when compared against parameters and time values obtained from the individual model of Jara-Díaz and Guerra (2003) applied to the same sample of workers. In Section 5 we summarize the approach, the main conclusions, and the new avenues for further research.",A new look at the value of leisure in two-worker households,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012220301295,9 December 2020,2020,Research Article,41.0

We adapt the Brueckner and Franco (2018) analytical model for Western European cities by adding agglomeration externalities, public transport congestion and underground parking. Workers can choose to locate in the city centre or in the suburbs. Commuting to the city centre requires either commuting by car and parking or public transport. Two policies to address inefficiencies of employer-paid parking are compared: employee-paid parking and a workplace parking levy. It is shown how employee-paid parking generates additional ====, while a workplace parking levy may have opposite effects. The numerical illustration for ==== indicates that the welfare effects of workplace parking policies in a second-best setting are dominated by agglomeration effects. These are three times larger than the welfare changes in the transport and land use markets.","Employer-paid or highly subsidised parking is a very common practice (Inci, 2015; Small and Verhoef, 2007). In Barcelona, for example, 45% of car trips to work use an employer-provided parking space, which is free for employees in 81% of the cases (ATM, 2015). In non-urban or less densely populated areas, the proportion of employer-provided parking may be much higher. Van Ommeren and Wentink (2012) report that in the Netherlands, 80% of car commuters use employer-provided parking, while, as per Shoup (2005a), 95% of car commuters in the US park free at work. In the US, costs of employer-provided parking represent around 1% of the GDP (Shoup, 2005a).====In this context, a key question is why employers provide their employees with such parking benefits, which are rarely offered to those using other transport modes. This is mainly due to two policy distortions (Evangelinos et al., 2018; Shoup, 2005a; Van Ommeren and Wentink, 2012). First, employer-paid parking is generally exempt from fringe benefit taxation, while wages and most perks are subject to income taxation. Hence, wage increases to compensate the loss of the free parking benefit would be more costly for the firm as it should also incorporate the income tax at marginal rates. This provides incentives to employers not to charge parking costs to their employees. Second, land use regulations may impose minimum parking requirements on office buildings. This generally leads to an excessive supply of parking, i.e. the marginal value of parking is below its resource costs (Cutter and Franco, 2012). Even if these regulations may be reviewed,==== most of the supply of workplace parking in different sectors is still determined by such parking requirements.====Employer-paid parking leads to different types of economic inefficiencies. First there is the distortion in modal choice: car use is made cheaper than it really is. Thus, providing free or low-cost parking to employees clearly exacerbates the problem of urban traffic externalities, such as congestion, air pollution, accidents and noise. Second, too much land and capital resources are dedicated to employer-provided parking (Shoup, 2005b). Van Ommeren and Wentink (2012) use data in the Netherlands to show that exemption from fringe benefit taxation and minimum parking requirements, similar to those applied in the US, would induce, welfare losses of about 10% and 18%, respectively, of parking resource costs.====This paper studies two policy responses to employer-paid parking: a switch to employee-paid parking by increasing the cost of parking perceived by commuters and a workplace parking levy, whereby employers are charged for the number of parking spaces they provide to their employees.====The analysis of these policies requires a general equilibrium approach where workers can choose residential and workplace locations, mode of transport and type of parking. Employers and land developers can choose where to produce and where to develop housing.====In urban general equilibrium modelling, there are several traditions (Proost, Thisse, 2019). One is the use of computable land use models (Anas and Liu, 2007), more recently there is the quantitative spatial economics tradition (Desmet, Rossie-Hansberg, 2013). These two model approaches do not allow an analytical solution and miss the detail of the parking market. We will use the third tradition known as the analytical mono-centric model tradition that allows a simplified representation of land used for parking.====Our research builds upon the stylised model of Brueckner and Franco (2018). They use a ‘two regions’ urban model with road and public transport modes and with employers in the central business district providing surface parking. Our model picks up some of their suggestions. First and foremost, we include agglomeration economies by allowing workers to choose between work in the city centre where agglomeration economies are at work and the suburbs where average product is constant. Second, while Brueckner and Franco (2018) focus mainly on surface parking, our model assumes that off-street parking facilities in the city centre are built underground, which is more representative of dense, European-style cities. Third, to capture the potential parking spillover, we consider on-street parking in residential areas as an alternative to employer-provided parking. Fourth, we introduce crowding discomfort in public transport. The introduction of congestible public transport makes the model more realistic: non-congestible public transport sets an unrealistic upper-bound on the commuting cost (the public transport cost). Our commuting cost is convex in the total number of commuters. Fifth, besides the analysis of a switch to employer-paid parking, we include a workplace parking levy as a second-best pricing instrument for urban traffic externalities.====We illustrate our model with a numerical example for the metropolitan area of Barcelona. This aims to quantify the relative importance of the different effects (i.e. agglomeration economies, land use, transport and parking) in a second-best setting. As one of the densest urban areas in Europe,==== Barcelona is an illustrative example of a compact city with underground parking facilities. Moreover, since 45% of car trips to work use an employer-provided parking space and only 19% of employees pay for parking (ATM, 2015), current workplace parking policies in Barcelona are associated to persistent congestion and air pollution issues, while no road tolling scheme has been implemented as of yet. As such, the metropolitan area of Barcelona is an appropriate context for the analysis of a second-best solution to urban traffic externalities based on workplace parking policies.====Compared to Brueckner and Franco (2018), our model illustration allows us to derive two additional insights on the effects of workplace parking policies. Most importantly, we find that, as we introduce agglomeration economies, a switch to employee-paid parking promotes employment in the city centre and increases average productivity. In our numerical analysis for Barcelona we find that the agglomeration benefits are three times as large as the effects on the transport and land use markets.====Second, while in Brueckner and Franco (2018) the reduced suburbanisation effect of employee-paid parking is only attributed to the availability of surface parking at the workplace, we show that, in cities with underground parking facilities, employee-paid parking also reduces urban sprawl when spillover parking to residential areas is limited. Important to note is that our driver for the increase in number of central residents is a higher generalised cost of commuting (road congestion combined with congestion in public transport) caused by employee-paid parking rather than the generation of more land available for housing in the centre due to the reconversion of surface parking to residential use, as concluded in Brueckner and Franco (2018).====Our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 describes our stylised basic model and its main assumptions. Section 4 derives the social optimum and Section 5 sets the first-best benchmark based on the equilibrium conditions for the parking, transport, labour and housing markets. Section 6 uses comparative statics to analyse the effects of workplace parking policies on travel behaviour, agglomeration economies and residential location. Section 7 deals with the second-best setting of a workplace parking levy when other policy instruments are restricted. Section 8 presents the numerical illustration for the city of Barcelona. Finally, Section 9 concludes.",Workplace parking policies in an agglomeration: An illustration for Barcelona,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012220301301,22 December 2020,2020,Research Article,42.0

In this article, we apply the correspondence test method to the purchase of a used car in order to measure the extent of discrimination in this market according to the ethnic origin, gender, place of residence and age of the applicant. We constructed six profiles of fictitious individuals, perfectly similar except for their age, gender, origin indicated by the consonance of their surname and first name or place of residence. Between January and May 2015, we used these fictitious profiles to respond to 489 used car sales ads located in Ile-de- France. Statistical analysis of the responses to these tests reveals the existence of discrimination according to gender and place of residence. The analysis shows that information based discrimination prevails on the second-hand car market rather than taste based discriminations.","Access to a car conditions access to employment and, more generally, the economic and social integration of people. Recruiters value having a driver's licence or having an individual means of transport. Therefore, the ability to commute daily into space play a major role in the school-to-work transition. It can affect access to training as well as access to employment. This effect is underlined by the job search literature where low mobility complicates the job search process and decreases the chances of leaving unemployment. Low mobility lengthens the distance between the place of residence and the workplace and is equivalent to a strengthening of the ‘spatial mismatch’ in the labour market (Kain, 1968). From the perspective of the worker, low mobility leads to longer and costly job search (Rogers, 1997; Immergluk 1998; Wasmer and Zenou, 2002). From the firm perspective, employers tend to prefer a mobile employee because he/she will be able to exert a level of greater effort at his work (Zenou, 2002). A low mobile worker in his travels runs the risk of tardiness or absenteeism and might generally be less flexible in his/her scheduling (van Ommeren et al., 2011).====These theoretical mechanisms have been confirmed by several empirical studies, which emphasized that the most vulnerable groups are the most penalized by the high cost of public and private transports. Having the use of a car can increase both the chances of being employed and the quality of the job measured by the number of hours worked or the pay level (Raphael and Rice, 2002) and salaries (Gurley and Bruce, 2005). This effect seems to be particularly marked for the people furthest from employment, especially young people furthest from employment and training as well as minimum income recipients (Ong 2002; Blumenberg and Hess, 2003; Le Gallo et al., 2018). Conversely, lack of access to public transport and to private vehicles deteriorates the situation on the labour market, especially for those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods (Kawabata, 2003; Ong and Miller, 2005).====However, access to effective mobility presupposes that holders of a driving licence are able to acquire a new or second-hand vehicle. This possibility does not exist for all socio-demographic groups. The most vulnerable groups who are usually discriminated against in the labour market may encounter barriers related to their individual characteristics (age, gender, ethnic origin or place of residence) when seeking to acquire a new or used vehicle. If we consider, for example, the residents of deprived neighbourhoods in France, the proportion of households without a car varies from 29 to 41 per cent depending on the size of the urban unit, compared with 12–21 per cent in the rest of the urban area. For these particular groups, discrimination in access to individual means of transport can constitute a powerful barrier to mobility which may limit their economic and social integration more strongly than for other groups.====Experimental evidence of discrimination has already been given for access to individual means of transport. Discrimination based on gender and skin colour has been highlighted in the process of negotiating the purchase of a new car in the United States in Chicago (Ayres and Siegelman, 1995). Discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion has also been highlighted through an approach combining a correspondence test and a post-phone survey in Israel (Zussman, 2013). Another correspondence test in Germany reveals substantial discrimination by ethnicity and gender in the carpooling market (Carol and al., 2019).====In this article, we look at discrimination in the used car market. The market for""Lemons"" is one of the most quoted articles in economics where George Akerloff presents the concept of information asymmetry that plays a central role in contemporary microeconomics (Akerlof, 1970). In the case of used cars, the asymmetry of information relates both to the quality of the offer (quality of the car for sale, for which an advertisement gives little verifiable information at low cost) and on the quality of the demand (ability of the buyer to negotiate the price, to identify technical malfunctions of the car if there are any and solvency, characteristics not observable when making contact).====In the absence of information on the buyer who contacts him, the seller may be encouraged to use the few information available to him, for example the demographic group of the buyer, to attribute to this individual what he knows or what he thinks he knows about the average characteristics and their dispersion in this demographic group. So the seller hopes to be able to make the best possible transaction. Vendors are thus exposed to information-based discrimination, as initially theorized by Arrow (1973) and Phelps (1972). They may also be exposed to discrimination through preferences, theorized by Becker (1957). This market is therefore a very interesting area to study supplier discrimination in the marketplace.====We want to measure and identify these sources of discrimination. To achieve this, we have adopted a multi-criteria protocol. Our goal is to measure discrimination on the basis of age, and among young people, discrimination on the basis of gender, origin and reputation of place of residence (living in a deprived neighborhood) in the used car market with a correspondence test method. We therefore constructed six profiles of fictitious individuals, perfectly similar except for their age, their gender, their origin indicated by the consonance of their surname and first name or their place of residence. Between January and May 2015, these six profiles of fictitious individuals responded almost simultaneously to 489 used car sales ads located in Paris region. The study consists of statistically evaluating the responses to these tests.====Our results highlight the existence of discrimination in the second-hand car market. A young man of French origin mentioning a neutral place of residence is significantly more likely to obtain a non-negative response than his counterfactual residing in a deprived neighborhood, and to a lesser extent than the young woman of French origin. We show that these results are sensitive to compositional effects. More than the price of the vehicle, it seems that it is the type of vehicle and the characteristics of the seller that influence the chances of obtaining a non-negative answer. This type of discrimination is consistent with the predictions of the statistical discrimination model (Aigner and Cain, 1977; Ewens et al., 2014).====In the first section, we present an overview of the theoretical and empirical literature on discrimination in the market place.

We show that commuters sort themselves both temporally and spatially according to their ,"Peak-period traffic congestion has long been a serious problem and an important policy issue for many cities. Congestion pricing is the widely known tool to alleviate traffic congestion, but it is rarely implemented mainly because of the concern about its distributional effects. Pricing might make some commuters worse off since it reduces travel time but increases monetary costs.====The literature on traffic congestion has been devoted to examining the distributional impacts of peak-load pricing and to proposing a measure that generates a Pareto improvement (e.g., Vickrey, 1973; Cohen, 1987; Arnott et al., 1994; van den Berg and Verhoef, 2011a, b, 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Hall, 2018). The standard approach is to analyze the bottleneck model with heterogeneous commuters, implying that commuters are assumed ==== Since it is well recognized that alleviating traffic congestion changes the spatial distribution of residents in the long-run, we can say that the literature focuses on the short-run effects of congestion pricing.====Traditional models of urban spatial structure, which are based on the monocentric city model (Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1967; Muth, 1969), have succeeded in predicting the empirically observed patterns of residential location based on the trade-off between land rent and commuting costs. These traditional models, however, mostly describe traffic congestion by using ==== congestion models, in which congestion at a location depends only on the total traffic demand (i.e., the total number of commuters passing a location), regardless of the time-of-use pattern (e.g., Kanemoto, 1980; Wheaton, 1998; Anas et al., 1998). This indicates that these models do not capture ==== traffic congestion that takes the form of queuing at a bottleneck.====Several studies have incorporated a spatial dimension into the bottleneck model by embedding the dynamic bottleneck congestion into a simple monocentric city model (Arnott, 1998; Gubins and Verhoef, 2014; Takayama and Kuwahara, 2017; Fosgerau et al., 2018; Fosgerau and Kim, 2019). Their models, however, consider homogeneous commuters, thereby being inapplicable to examining the long-run distributional impacts of peak-load pricing. The only exception is Takayama and Kuwahara (2017), who incorporate heterogeneity in commuters' income, value of time, and schedule delay costs (i.e., flexibility). They demonstrate that congestion pricing helps rich commuters but hurts poor commuters. This result, however, essentially depends on the assumption of quasi-linear preferences since this assumption makes the income elasticity of the demand for land equal to zero, which is inconsistent with empirical evidence (Wheaton, 1977; Glaeser et al., 2008). In other words, they suppose that the expenditure on land is the same across all commuters regardless of their income levels and does not change even if a congestion toll is imposed. This means that their model ignores the effects of peak-period congestion and congestion pricing on commuters’ land use pattern. Therefore, the long-run distributional effects of peak-load pricing have yet to be clarified.====This study develops a model of trip timing and residential location choices of heterogeneous commuters that resolves the limitations of the literature discussed above. We consider a closed monocentric city with a bottleneck located at the entrance to the CBD as in Gubins and Verhoef (2014) and Fosgerau et al. (2018) and employ a utility function that allows the income elasticity of the demand for land to be positive. We show that commuters sort themselves both temporally and spatially depending not only on their income and value of time, but also on their flexibility. We also find that cities with more flexible commuters are less dense, i.e., cities expand outward as commuters become more flexible.====This study then investigates the long-run effects of optimal peak-load pricing.==== We show that congestion pricing changes commuting costs, thereby altering commuters’ lot sizes and spatial distribution. In addition, even if congestion pricing generates a Pareto improvement in the short-run (i.e., if commuters do not relocate), it does not necessarily lead to a Pareto improvement in the long-run. This occurs for the following reasons: improvements in commuting cost increase the lot size of commuters residing near the CBD; this causes the city to expand outward; the spatial expansion of the city increases commuting distance of commuters residing farther from the CBD. To demonstrate concretely the distributional effects of pricing, we analyze the model for two cases wherein richer commuters are either more flexible or less flexible. This analysis clarifies that (a) rich commuters reside farther from the CBD in the former and closer to the CBD in the latter; (b) congestion pricing makes cities denser and more compact in the former, whereas it causes cities to become less dense and to expand spatially in the latter; and (c) in both cases, pricing helps rich commuters but hurts poor commuters.====We further reveal that although the bottleneck capacity expansion generates a Pareto improvement in the short-run, it can lead to an unbalanced distribution of benefits among commuters in the long-run: commuters residing closer to the CBD gain and commuters residing farther from the CBD lose. This occurs because decreasing commuting costs causes the city to spatially expand, thereby increasing commuting distance of commuters residing farther from the CBD. Thus, the capacity expansion financed by the revenue from congestion pricing could be progressive when rich commuters are flexible, while regressive when rich commuters are inflexible.====This study proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents a model in which heterogeneous commuters choose their departure times from home and residential locations in a monocentric city. Sections 3 Equilibrium without optimal congestion pricing, 4 Optimal peak-load pricing characterize equilibria without and with optimal congestion pricing, respectively.

To illustrate, we present a model of travel in an isotropic downtown where people choose among not traveling, a low-occupancy mode called ‘‘Alone’’ and a high-occupancy mode called ‘‘Pool.’’ Pool trips detour to pick up and drop off passengers en route, so congestion delays them more than Alone trips. Consequently, multiple equilibria can arise even in ‘‘light congestion,’’ and small toll increases can have dramatic impacts by eliminating equilibria.","Walters (1961) introduced a canonical tool of transportation economics: the ‘‘static’’ traffic model. Under the assumption that conditions do not change==== over time, a static model considers the interactions of traveler behavior and traffic congestion on some road facility. The road facility may be a uniform highway or a network of streets, but in either case the analysis can generally be summarized in a diagram such as Fig. 1. A measure of vehicle flow spans the horizontal axis. The vertical axis shows a measure of unit travel time—the inverse of speed—or else some monotonic transformation of unit travel time such as the total travel time of a journey through the facility or a money-denominated travel ‘‘cost.’’====In this space, a ‘‘supply curve,’’ ====, shows the locus of points consistent with traffic physics. ==== can be thought of as having two parts. The lower part (highlighted in blue in Fig. 1) reflects a regime of ==== wherein flow and unit travel time rise together. The appropriate shape of the upper part of ==== depends on the topology of the road facility being modeled. When the facility is a uniform highway, a consensus has arisen that ==== ought to be drawn with the vertical segment drawn as a dashed line in Fig. 1 (Mun, 1994; Verhoef, 1999, 2005). States on the dashed segment reflect the presence of a queue at the highway's upstream entrance, which consumes time but does not impede traffic flow.====When the facility is a downtown zone, ==== is drawn with the backward-bending segment (drawn as a solid line in Fig. 1) to reflect a regime of ====, wherein vehicle flow falls as unit travel time rises, to reflect the presence of intersection queues that both consume time and impede flow. Note the use of a single unit travel time requires that traffic must be fairly evenly distributed around the zone, and so models that make this assumption (e.g., Arnott and Inci (2010) and Lehe (2017)) have been called ‘‘isotropic.’’ The justification for the isotropic assumption lies in the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) (or ‘‘Network’’ Fundamental Diagram (NFD)) theory of traffic flow, which posits that, since drivers avoid pockets of congestion, a sufficiently homogeneous group of streets will show a tight relationship among measures of density, flow and unit travel time (Mahmassani et al., 1984; Daganzo, 2007; Geroliminis and Daganzo, 2008).====Whatever the setting, a ‘‘demand curve,’’ ====, shows the vehicle flow consistent with travelers' demands at each unit travel time. Traditionally, ==== falls monotonically with unit travel time, because people want to drive more when their trips take less time. ==== and ==== meet at the model's equilibria. Because ==== falls, there can be only one equilibrium in light congestion, where ==== is rising, although for isotropic models there may be multiple equilibria in hypercongestion (Small and Chu, 2003).====The hypothesis of this paper is that the demand curve, ====, can plausibly ‘‘bend backwards.’’ That is, counterintuitively, the vehicle flow demanded can rise as traffic speeds fall. We call this phenomenon ====—the demand-side twin of hypercongestion. While similar in result to the special case of a ‘‘Giffen Good’’ (Jensen and Miller, 2008), where an increase in the money price of an inferior good raises its consumption by restricting consumers' purchasing power, the mechanics behind hyperdemand are different. The kindling for hyperdemand exists whenever people not only choose whether to travel but also can choose among vehicular modes with different occupancies. In this case, though worsening congestion dissuades some people from traveling at all, if it also moves enough people to switch from high-to low-occupancy modes, then the vehicle flow demanded can rise with the unit travel time. This logic depends on the distinction between the demand for travel and the vehicle flow ==== that demand.====Just as importantly, the logic also depends on there being a good reason why a rise in unit travel time (fall in speeds) makes people switch from high-to low-occupancy modes. This paper presents an isotropic model which finds such a reason in recent developments on city streets. In 2014, Uber and Lyft introduced ==== services, and other firms (e.g., Via, DiDi) have since joined the market. Whereas traditional carpools are informal, often unrenumerated, arrangements among commuters with nearby origins and destinations, the new ridesplit services essentially join unrelated for-hire trips together using mobile phone apps. While a passenger is en route, the vehicle may detour to pick up other passengers whose trips traverse a similar route—even if the origins and destinations of the several passengers' trips are not especially proximate. The paper considers a downtown network where ridesplitting is prevalent and hyperdemand arises in the following way: Because of detours, a ‘‘Pool’’ trip is physically longer than the same trip would be on a low-occupancy, direct alternative called ‘‘Alone.’’ Hence a rise in unit travel time disadvantages Pool relative to Alone and thereby induces the requisite mode-switching.====Section 2 gives the model's traffic physics. Section 3 describes demand and derives the conditions for hyperdemand. Section 4 characterizes possible equilibria and demonstrates, formally and via simulation, that hyperdemand can beget multiple equilibria in light congestion. Section 5 considers congestion tolls, showing a toll increase can effect sudden changes in traffic by annihilating some of those equilibria. Section 6 concludes with ideas for how to extend hyperdemand to other settings and other topics for further research.

The motivation for the study originated from the fact that the public invests heavily in small-scale projects when market failures occur. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on the impact of these investments because of data unavailability and their small marginal contribution at a more aggregated level. Using Difference-in-Differences that exploit staggered implementation of small-port operations, we found that the opening of small ports increased the night light intensity, a measure that captures local economic activity, by 1.8 per cent. Although the benefits reach beyond the sub-district where the port is situated, it takes more than two years to deliver its relatively small impact, and it might be not cost-effective.","The seaport system plays a vital role in shaping regional economic development. The presence of seaports enables firms to access broader markets or inputs, promotes inter-island trade and inter-regional integration (Lakshmanan, 2011), and improves the opportunity for human capital investment (Banerjee et al., 2012). Unfortunately, despite an emphasis on the large-scale seaport shaping the local economic activity, very little is known about how small-scale local ports contribute to the local economy.==== This seems reasonable as small-scale ports mostly work to complement the nation's port system trade (Monios et al., 2019; Notteboom and Rodrigue, 2005) that provide a limited contribution to the local economy. The presence of small ports is likely to be more important for countries that are endowed with vast sea areas, the effect, therefore, might be not negligible.====There is no theoretical consensus on the effect of transportation improvement and the spatial distribution on the local economic activities. Since better transportation infrastructure generates lower transportation costs, firms gain from the improved access to output and input markets (Holl, 2016). Firms capture the benefits of increasing returns and promoting market integration due to the increased market size, and in turn, the levels of competition rise (Banerjee et al., 2012). Intense competition can have a positive impact on the local economy, assuming that local firms maintain or increase their competitive position by reducing production costs. However, new transportation infrastructure may also generate a higher gap between less-developed and more-developed regions (Behrens et al., 2007; Fujita and Mori, 1996; Puga, 2002). If the local firms in less-developed regions are inefficient, the new transportation infrastructure may promote the demand for cheaper imported goods; hence reduces the demand for local goods. Consequently, the less-developed regions will suffer from a decrease in local economic activity. Taken together, transportation investment can both increase and decrease the local economic activities.====This present study investigates whether small-scale transport infrastructure investment, such as local feeder port has an impact on local economic activities as measured by the night light intensity. We used Indonesia, one of the most archipelagic countries in the world, whose government has launched multi-year small feeder-port projects to improve sea connectivity among small islands in Indonesia. It is a part of a larger project of improving inter-island connectivity over the last decade. This study argued that in an archipelagic country like Indonesia, small ports may increase the local economic development, beyond serving as a supporting system for larger international ports. We expected to obtain a positive relationship since the importance of ports is likely to be higher in the archipelagic region than in a landlocked region where more goods and people enter and exit through ports (Tovar et al., 2015) than through land or air infrastructure.====Recent empirical evidence suggests a positive relationship between port infrastructure and regional economic development, but evidence on the effect of small-port investments on local economic development remains scant. Moreover, recent studies have mostly focused on the welfare effects of large ports and neglected the contribution of small ports, assuming its zero marginal contribution to the total seaborne trade (Bottasso et al., 2014; Yudhistira and Sofiyandi, 2018). Small ports mostly serve local economies (Monios, 2017), or as feeders for larger ports in a nation's port system. Therefore, recent literature on small ports is mainly focused on small ports' relative advantages, their dependency on larger ports, and their challenges (de Langen, 1998; Feng and Notteboom, 2013; McCalla et al., 2005; Monios, 2017; Monios et al., 2019; Tovar et al., 2015). Park and Seo (2016) is an exception: they showed that small ports had only a limited impact on the regional economic growth in South Korea. Limited economic development data for lower administrative levels also proves that providing the causal inference of the small-port effect remains challenging.====The gradual introduction of the new small ports in Indonesia has enabled the identification of the impact of the small ports on the night light intensity using the Difference-in-Difference (DiD) model with staggered implementation. Our identification then relied on the assumption that the exposed sub-districts with a new small port opening are comparable to the other sub-districts that received new small ports in the subsequent periods. This approach is suitable for obtaining a causal effect in transportation policies that are implemented in various timings (Conti et al., 2019; Nehiba, 2018). The panel dataset structure also allowed to control for the time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity that determines the decision of small-port development to minimize potential bias.====We found that in an archipelagic country like Indonesia, the presence of small ports was positively associated with higher night light intensity by 1.8 per cent. The result was robust across a series of robustness checks and passed the parallel-trend assumptions and placebo tests. While a small port also benefits beyond its sub-district, it may take more than two years to deliver its relatively low impact, and the costs outweigh the benefits.====Our study contributes to the literature in three aspects. First, it is the first study, that we are aware of, providing empirical evidence concerning the effect of small ports on the local economy using a more appropriate identification strategy. Most recent studies have only shown the role of small ports in the port system. Although several studies have reported the impacts of ports on the regional economy at a more aggregated level, such as a country or municipality, they could not evaluate the presence of small ports. In addition, those studies used a less transparent identification strategy that was unable to provide credible estimates. Our results suggest that a new small-port operation is associated with higher local economic activity, measured as night light intensity at the sub-district level.====This paper also contributes by providing a non-traditional measure, night light intensity, to evaluate the effect of transportation infrastructure on economic outcomes at the sub-districts level, where traditional data, such as GDP is unavailable. The intensity of night-time lights indicates the use of lights outdoor or even indoor. The main idea is that most of the good consumption in the evening needs lights. Therefore, consumption and many investment activities increase the usage of lights per person, as income rises (Henderson et al., 2012). Night light intensity, as a micro-satellite data, offers potential promises, such as the availability to provide historical data, broad geographic coverage, and its granularity (Baylis, P., Kroll, G., & Madon, 2016). We showed that the estimates were reliable and relatively robust across the selected observation period.====Last, we analysed Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago country, to enrich the literature that mainly focused on developing country cases. Our work extended Yudhistira and Sofiyandi's (2018) work that found a positive association between access to large ports and regional development at the municipality level in Indonesia. We found that despite serving as a supporting system of the large ports by design, the presence of small local ports, favourably promotes local economic development which is inadvertently predominantly in rural areas.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the small-port expansion policy in Indonesia, followed by the discussion of our identification strategy in Section 3. Section 4 elaborates the data source. Section 5 analyses the effect of small-port operations on the local economy measured by night light intensity, and the final section concludes.",Does small-scale port investment affect local economic activity?

This paper finds strong evidence that subways affect people's choice of travel modes. Specifically, every new subway line put into operation annually diverts about 4.1 percent of bus passengers, which is equivalent to saving at least 10 bus lines. Furthermore, subways supplement the existing bus systems, but do not have a crowding-out effect on the number of buses or the length of bus lines. The opening of subways reduces the number of taxis and cars on the road.","In 2017, China's urbanization rate reached 58.52 percent, and the urban population exceeded 800 million people. This rapid expansion of the urban population has increased pressure on traffic flows in urban areas. Although increased ownership of private vehicles has helped to facilitate travel in China in recent years (Li et al., 2020), more cars on the road leads to increased traffic congestion and air pollution, which have costly consequences (Bertrand, 1978; Duranton and Turner, 2011; Shen et al., 2016). A feasible way to solve this problem is greater investment in public transportation facilities (Vickrey, 1969; Parry and Small, 2009). At present, many cities in rapidly developing countries like China have invested in rail transit==== to improve city transportation systems while reducing pollution (Huang et al., 2017). In this paper, we study the effect of subways on urban passenger transport modes.====This topic belongs to the literature on travel mode choice, which can be divided into three categories: studies that focus on the choice between public transport and private transport, those that focus on the choice between different forms of public transport, and those that focus on the choice between forms of private transport. The first two are closely related to the topic of this paper. Hass-Klau and Crampton (2005) show that the level of car ownership per family along light rail lines is lower than the level of car ownership elsewhere. A case study in Chile explored the impact of the built environment on car ownership (Zegras, 2010). The results show that households living within 500 m of the subway station have a lower car ownership rate. Huang et al. (2016) carried out an investigation in Guangzhou, China. They discover that the increased availability of the metro reduces car ownership when controlling for the impact of population and other aspects of the built environment. Huang et al. (2017) expanded the category of private transport vehicles by analyzing the impact of subways on the ownership of cars, bikes, e-bikes, and motorcycles in Xi'an. They find that subways and bikes complement each other, but subways replace e-bikes and motorcycles. Previous studies have reached inconsistent conclusions concerning the relationship between public transport and car ownership. For example, a study conducted by Pan et al. (2013) in Shanghai, China, find that the negative impact of rail transit on car ownership is only temporary. Shen et al. (2016) show that although proximity to a subway station can increase the probability of people preferring the subway as a means of transit, it does not affect car ownership. In addition to the competitive (or complementary) relationship between public and private transport, there are also competitive (or complementary) relationships between different public transport modes. Senior (2009) studied the impact of light rail on people's travel patterns using household data from the U.S. between the 1990 to 1993 and 1991 to 2001 periods. The results show that in the short term, people take buses less frequently when the bus routes are along light rail lines than when the routes are not along light rail lines. Using UK census data, Lee and Senior (2013) discover that an increase in light rail passengers is mainly due to a decline in bus passengers rather than in car passengers. Based on survey data at the individual level in Beijing, Wu and Hong (2017) find that the opening of a new subway significantly reduces the probability of people taking the bus. However, using data from individual daily trip survey in Beijing, Xie (2012) shows that rail transit increases automobile usage but has little impact on bus usage.====From the preceding literature review, we can see that there are at least three deficiencies in the literature. First, it only explores whether subways have an impact on bus passengers, and does not analyze whether subways crowd out buses, in addition to crowding out car ownership. Furthermore, most studies of the choice of transportation mode use individual-level data, which are affected by individual preferences, place of residence, and other factors. Another problem is that the observation period of most studies is very short, usually three years or less. For example, Zegras (2010) used data for 2001, Xie (2012) used data for the 2007–2009 period, and Huang et al. (2017) used data for 2014. According to Pan et al. (2013), the influence of subways on travel choices has both short-term and long-term effects; a short longitudinal sample period cannot capture long-term effects. Another problem is that existing research focuses on the effect of only one or a small number of subways; an example is Huang et al. (2017). In this paper, we try to solve these problems.====To identify the effect of subways on urban passenger transport modes, we use the natural experiment of subway openings across China. Urban passenger transport modes may change before and after the expansion of a city's subway system, and there are differences in travel modes of cities with and without subways. Under these conditions, we can use the difference-in-differences (DID) method to identify the effect of new subways. For the control group, we use cities that had an approved subway development plan, but had not constructed or put into operation a subway before 2015. This sample satisfies the DID requirement for a common trend between the treatment and control groups. In addition, approval to build a subway is not distributed randomly: Document No.81 [2003]==== clearly lists the specific economic conditions that cities must meet before building subway lines. Our model controls for these conditions, making building subway lines effectively exogenous.====Xie (2012) used the DID method to study the effect of subways on travel modes. However, Xie (2012) used individual-level data, which may be subject to self-selection bias. Someone who lives near a subway station may prefer to use public transportation (Yang et al., 2018).====We estimate the DID model using data from 43 cities for the 1994 to 2015 period. The results show that opening subways reduces the number of bus passengers. Specifically, the number of bus passengers decreases by 4.1 percent with each additional subway line. However, the opening of a subway does not reduce the number of buses or the length of bus lines. These results show that a subway opening reduces pressure on the bus system but does not replace it. We also find that the opening of subways leads to a decline in the number of taxis and cars. This result indicates that along with the many other benefits that a subway provides a city, they are vital to urban development, at least in developing countries like China.====Our research contributes to the literature on the choice of travel modes in three ways.====First, we not only explore whether the opening of subways affects the number of bus passengers, but also analyze whether it reduces the number of buses, the length of bus lines, the number of taxis, and the number of cars, which expands the scope of research objects in this field. In addition, because it is based on city-level data, our estimation avoids the selection bias caused by the use of individual data.====Second, using an extended longitudinal sample period, we examine the effect of subway networks on other urban travel modes. The time span of our data is 22 years, which is helpful for identifying the long-term impacts of subways on travel modes. In addition, from the perspective of accessibility, compared with a single subway, a subway network consisting of multiple subways has a greater impact on people's travel choices, so we must pay attention to the effect of subway networks. We use the number and length of subway lines to measure the subway network of a city, then we estimate its impact on other travel modes.====Third, our paper provides evidence from China, a developing country that is facing monumental challenges in the field of urban transportation, even as it is in the process of constructing unprecedented numbers of subways. According to data from the China Urban Rail Transit Association,====by the end of 2016, China's urban rail transit construction investment reached RMB¥384.7 billion, and the length of rail transit under construction reached 5636.5 km. China's large-scale investment in subway construction provides an excellent natural experiment for identifying the impact of subways on travel choice. In recent years, some researchers have begun to explore the impact of China's subways on travel choice. However, these studies mainly use the case analysis method, only examine the impact of subway openings in a single city, and focus on a few large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou (Xie, 2012; Huang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Wu and Hong, 2017). These special cases cannot reflect the reality of large-scale subway construction in China, and they make it difficult to generalize these papers' conclusions. In contrast, the sample in our paper includes all cities in China that have subways in operation or a subway development plan.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the background of subway development in China. It also introduces our data sources and descriptive statistics. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy. Section 4 discusses the empirical results. Section 5 presents a robustness check of the empirical results.

Both approaches describe the renewal process in intuitively similar ways but have several methodological distinctions. Using Swedish data for the 1999–2016 period, results suggest the median marginal costs per gross ton-km from corner solution and survival models are SEK 0.0066 and SEK 0.0031, respectively. Since several European countries use information about marginal costs as a basis for track user charges, the choice of estimation method is obviously important. Our conclusion is that the corner solution model is more appropriate in this case, as this method considers the impact traffic has both on the probability of renewal and on the size of the renewal cost. The survival approach does not consider the latter as part of the estimations, which is problematic when we have systematic cost variations due to traffic and infrastructure characteristics.","The vertical separation between rail infrastructure management and train operations in Europe during the 1990s generated a need to set track access charges. The rules for these charges are laid down by The Single European Railway Area (SERA) Directive (2012/34/EU), which concerns the management of railway infrastructure and transport activities of railway undertakings in EU's Member States. The Directive establishes that charges for access to infrastructure facilities shall be set at the cost that is directly incurred as a result of operating the train service (Article 31.3), and is based on economic theory that advocates marginal cost pricing for an efficient use of assets. Hence, the marginal cost of infrastructure use needs to be estimated, including both maintenance and renewal costs.====Starting with Johansson and Nilsson (2004), there is now a series of econometric analyses of how railway traffic affects the costs for day-to-day infrastructure maintenance (Andersson, 2008; Link et al., 2008; Wheat and Smith, 2008; Wheat et al., 2009; Odolinski and Nilsson, 2017). This literature has generated estimates of cost elasticities for traffic (which are used to calculate marginal costs) that are relatively stable, both within countries as data accumulates over time and between countries (Nash, 2018).====Assets must at some point of time be replaced as costs for maintenance increase with age and use, including the increased risk for technical failures affecting traffic. This is part of any cost minimizing strategy for infrastructure services and a basis of life cycle asset management in general, where a renewal marks the end of an asset's life cycle. Moreover, replacements of infrastructure assets are costly: Renewal of the Swedish railway infrastructure (defined as major replacements, excluding upgrading) accounted for about SEK 2.4 billion==== in 2016, which is about 25 per cent of the total maintenance and renewal expenditure at SEK 10 billion – a share that has been around 20 to 30 per cent during the 1999–2016 period. Grimes and Barkan (2006) report even higher shares of renewal expenditures (around 20 to 60 per cent) for US railroads in 1978–2002, and Walker et al. (2015) report shares around 40 per cent for the Swiss railway network during 2003–2012.====There are relatively few empirical papers that address railway renewal from the marginal cost perspective, despite its large share of the railway infrastructure managers’ expenditures. One reason may be that renewals on a specific part of the railway is a rare feature, often performed with around 30 years in-between,==== which implies that a long time series is required to capture how changes in traffic affect renewal costs. One solution has been to add renewal to maintenance costs when estimating the marginal cost of rail infrastructure use (see Andersson, 2006; Tervonen and Pekkarinen, 2007; Marti et al., 2009; Wheat and Smith, 2009). But these models do not provide direct estimates on renewal cost elasticities, and any inference on such elasticities are therefore uncertain. Andersson et al. (2012) and Andersson et al. (2016) are however two studies that have access to a long time series and provide estimates of the marginal cost for track renewals using disaggregate data. These papers use different modelling approaches: a corner solution model and a parametric survival model.==== The papers establish a significant difference between the corner solution and survival models in that marginal cost estimates were SEK 0.009 and 0.002 per gross ton-km, respectively.====The purpose of this paper is to consider the qualities of these modelling approaches and – using information about infrastructure renewals in Sweden from 1999 to 2016 – estimate the marginal costs using the respective models. This makes it possible to recommend the best method or indeed to establish that either approach can be used for the measurement of marginal costs. The choice of method is policy relevant considering the difference in marginal cost levels and since several European countries use econometric information about marginal costs for charging track users.====In the literature, the two modelling approaches are linked via censored regression models. For example, a textbook treatment of the survival model usually describes issues with censored data (missing information on time to an event) which is common in any duration analysis (see Kiefer (1988) for an accessible description). The corner solution model is also connected to censored regression models as the econometric techniques are similar (cf. Tobit regression and section 2.1 below) but is applied to a different situation which formally does not concern censored data. The reason is that the individuals/agents are solving an optimization problem with a corner solution that provides a lower bound which is (often) a zero value and a higher bound that is a continuous (observable) variable that can take any positive value (Wooldridge, 2002). The focus of the corner solution model is thus on the various outcomes of an event, while the survival approach focuses on the time to event.====In our case, we are interested in both. That is, we want to analyze the time to (or risk of) multiple kinds of events that is represented by a continuous variable taking positive values. To the authors’ knowledge, the differences and similarities between these two modelling approaches has not been investigated empirically in the context of infrastructure cost analysis. We thus consider the present paper to contribute to the existing literature by spelling out the similarities and differences in their application to infrastructure costing. Indeed, the impact of covariates on time-to-event, as well as on the cost of these events, is relevant for infrastructure assets in general and not only railways. For example, models for road deterioration due to traffic and costs of resurfacing have been used to analyze pricing and investment policies, often building on the seminal work by Small et al. (1989). See Bruzelius (2004) for a survey of the different methods used to measure the (marginal) cost of road use.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Previous theoretical literature has addressed these decisions for hub-and-spoke models, but it has done so under the assumption of equal demand in all markets served by the network.==== ==== This simplification, though unrealistic, is still able to explain real world effects, suggesting that the analytical results apply even for networks where demands are similar, though not exactly equal. A more realistic hub-and-spoke network would serve markets with greatly varying demands, and in such a setting, the previous model may not reflect the choices made by airlines.==== ====For example, Swiss Air carries traffic between Munich (MUC, population 1,460,000), and Malpensa Airport in Milan (MXP, population 1,350,000) through its hub in Zurich (ZRH). The markets between Zurich and each of the endpoint cities may be comparable in sizes, making the available hub-and-spoke models appropriate. However, Swiss Air also connects Munich and Geneva (GVA, population 500,000) through Zurich. Noting the considerable difference in populations between Munich and Geneva, it is clear that travel demand differs enormously between the MUC-ZRH and ZRH-GVA markets. It is then unreasonable to rely on a symmetric hub-and-spoke model that assumes flight frequencies on these spoke routes are equal.====The current paper builds on the structure presented in previous literature. Brueckner (2004) provides analysis of a monopoly airline serving a three-city hub-and-spoke network.==== ==== Demands across markets are assumed to be equal, and a symmetric equilibrium is analyzed, with equal fares and flight frequencies on the two spokes. Brueckner and Flores-Fillol (2020) (hereafter BFF) added to the literature by studying a situation where two airlines separately serve the spokes of a three-city network, providing two-airline connecting service between the spoke endpoints.==== ==== The paper compares outcomes in the case where the airlines are alliance partners to the case where they are nonaligned. In contrast to the current model, all cities in the network have the same size. The allied solution is comparable to the Brueckner (2004) monopoly solution, as the two airlines must set the fare and flight frequencies jointly, essentially making the same choices as a single airline.====Without an alliance, each airline in BFF’s model makes fare and scheduling decisions independently of the other (the airlines set subfares for their portion of the connecting trip).==== ==== The possibility of different frequencies on the two spokes means that passengers may incur a layover, which in turn means that layover cost must be considered in the model.==== ==== BFF considered two different scenarios: a case where passengers have a high cost of layover time and one where layover cost is zero.==== ==== While the network symmetry in BFF’s model leads to identical frequencies in equilibrium, the asymmetry in the current model again means that spoke frequencies must be allowed to differ and that they will do so in equilibrium. Hence the need to consider layovers and their cost is present here, just as in BFF’s analysis.====The present paper thus adds to the literature by relaxing the assumption of equal demands across markets within a network. One city is allowed to be more populous than the other two, increasing demand in two of the three markets and creating an asymmetry in the network. Like BFF, the model is analyzed in the two layover-cost cases. Both the high and zero-cost cases lead to a higher flight frequency on the spoke with higher demand. The paper presents comparative-static analysis of the equilibrium in the high and zero-cost cases, showing how frequencies, fares, and traffic levels vary with the model parameters. Comparison of outcomes between the two layover cases, however, requires numerical analysis. Comparing the high and zero-cost cases, flight frequencies on the two spokes differ by less in the high-cost case than in the zero-cost case. In particular, switching from the zero-cost to the high-cost case raises the flight frequency on the low-demand spoke while lowering the flight frequency on the high-demand spoke. This result shows that the airline seeks to accommodate its passengers’ scheduling preferences by providing more back-to-back flights in the high-cost case, which allows more opportunities for passengers to eliminate layovers.====Section 2 of this paper describes the structure of the model, Section 3 discusses the results from the high and zero-cost-layover cases, and Section 4 compares the outcomes between the two cases.

We consider a vertically differentiated product model where airlines have different operating cost and different generalized prices so they compete in ticket prices and frequencies. Thus, more frequency allows airlines to increase ticket prices without losing demand. In this context, we show that the incumbent may increase the frequency offered in order to deter the ==== carrier entry. We show that if the airport capacity is low enough the ==== carrier entry can be easily blocked or deterred. However, if the airport capacity is sufficiently high, the ==== carrier entry must be accommodated. Regulators should take these results into account in order to promote competition among airlines.","Low-cost (====) carriers have acquired a significant market share in the last decades and it seems that it will continue growing in the future, changing the whole air transport market (Dobruszkes, 2006, 2013). They carried 3.5 billion passengers on 34 million schedule departures in 2015, and in 2030 these figures probably will be double.==== Moreover, they accounted for 24% of all aircraft seats in 2011, and they had a 36% market share in Europe, 30% in North America and 19% in Asia/pacific (Graham, 2013). Moreover, full-service (====) carriers have been affected for this new model of airline business==== and the competition between these two types of airlines is commonly observed.==== carriers and ==== carriers differ in their quality and their costs, and thus, in the ticket prices charged to passengers. ==== carriers can deliver 80% of the service quality with approximately 50% of the cost of ==== carriers (Franke, 2004). Thus, several authors argue that ==== and ==== carriers compete in differentiated products (see, for example, Gillen and Morrison, 2003; Barbot, 2004, 2006; 2008; Fu et al., 2011; or Hazledine, 2011).==== carriers and ==== carriers not only differ in their quality and fare but they also differ in their frequency. ==== carriers usually offer more frequent flights than ==== carriers (Gillen and Morrison, 2003) and for this reason passengers can select a flight departure time that is closer to their preferred one. Passengers will be better off the smaller the difference between the real and the preferred departure time, and this difference is the so-called schedule delay.==== There are some papers in the literature that consider airlines that compete in fare and frequency (see, for example, Yetiskul et al., 2005; Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2007; or Yetiskul and Kanafani, 2010). However, none of these papers consider competition in fares and frequency between airlines that offer flights with different qualities.====The contribution of this paper to the academic literature is twofold: On the one hand, it develops a theoretical model of entry deterrence and vertical differentiated products which is specific to the air transport market. In the air transport market, consumers take their travel decisions taking into account not only the quality and price of the product (as in most traditional industrial organization models) but also the time required to make the trip, which includes not only access, egress and in-vehicle time, but also the schedule delay cost. The higher the frequency, the lower the schedule delay cost. Thus, the frequency can be considered as an additional quality component to be used by airlines and this fact considerably affects the well-known results of traditional industrial organization models of vertical differentiation and entry deterrence. Our theoretical model provides a specific air transport competition model that might be used by regulators to assess the social welfare improvement of any policy aiming at increasing the competition in the air transport market (such as the investment in airports' capacity). On the other hand, this paper allows to theoretically justify some of the empirical results obtained in the academic literature when analysing ==== and ==== carriers’ competition or the kind of airports from which ==== carriers usually operate.====In this paper, we consider a vertically differentiated product model as the one used by Shaked and Sutton (1982). However, we depart from Shaked-Sutton's model in the following. On the one hand, contrary to Shaked and Sutton (1982), we assume non-linear cost functions for airlines, capturing the economies from operating larger aircraft (Brueckner, 2004; Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2007). Moreover, we assume that ==== carriers have lower operating costs per flight than ==== carriers. On the other hand, we assume that passengers' demand depends on airlines' generalized price, which is defined as the sum of the ticket price and the value of the total time spent by the consumer, which includes access, egress, in-vehicle time, and the schedule delay cost. Given the schedule delay cost, frequency can be considered as an additional quality component and increase airlines' vertical differentiation.====We consider a market with a ==== carrier (the incumbent) and a ==== carrier (the potential entrant) that may enter the market. If the ==== carrier enters the market, airlines compete in ticket prices and frequency with vertically differentiated products. In this context, we show that the incumbent may increase the frequency offered in order to deter the ==== carrier entry.====Spence (1977) is one of the early contributions to the literature that links excess capacity with entry deterrence. He argues that “entry is deterred in an industry when existing firms have enough capacity to make a new entrant unprofitable and that this capacity need not be fully utilized in the absence of entry.” Dixit (1980) shows that an incumbent decides whether to accommodate entry or to deter it through excess capacity.====In this paper, we also consider a model in which the incumbent (the ==== carrier) decides whether to accommodate or deter the ==== carrier's entry. However, there are substantial differences with traditional entry deterrence models. Firstly, in our model the higher the frequency, the lower passengers' generalized price. Thus, more frequency allows airlines to increase ticket prices without losing demand. Therefore, when the incumbent increases the frequency, there are two consequences: on the one hand, it affects ==== carrier's incentives to enter the market and, on the other hand, it reduces passengers' generalized price which may be compensated with higher ticket prices. Thus, frequency is used not only to deter entry but also to increase airlines' vertical differentiation and passengers' willingness to pay. Secondly, contrary to traditional entry deterrence models, we do not need to assume any fixed cost of entry for the ==== carrier. We have to highlight that fixed cost of entry is a common assumption in the entry deterrence literature. In this paper, we show that even if we do not consider such a fixed entry cost, entry can be blocked or deterred.====We have to take into account that ==== carries usually serve regional or secondary airport instead of major airport. However, Dobruszkes et al. (2017) pointed out the change of this strategy for some ==== carriers. This paper tries to find some theoretical justification for the ==== carriers’ selection of airports. We show that if the airport capacity is low enough the ==== carrier entry can be blocked (the ==== carrier chooses the frequency that maximizes its profits as a monopolist and the ==== carrier cannot enter the market). Moreover, we show that the ==== carrier optimally deters the ==== carrier entry (the ==== carrier modifies its frequency in order to make the ==== carrier's profits lower than or equal to zero) for intermediate values of the airport capacity. Finally, if the airport capacity is high enough, the ==== carrier entry cannot be blocked or deterred and, thus, it must be accommodated. In order to promote competition between ==== and ==== carriers, regulators should take these results into account and force airports with capacity constraints to expand capacity.====Previous research on entry deterrence in the air transport market is mostly devoted to analyse the role of fare as an entry deterrence strategy (see, for example, Windle and Dresner, 1995, 1999; Goolsbee and Syverson, 2008; Huse and Oliveira, 2012; Gayle and Wu, 2013; Tan, 2016; Aydemir, 2012 or Varella et al., 2017), or the effects on hub and spoke networks (see, for example, Oum et al., 1995) and code share alliances (see, for example, Lin, 2005, 2008). However, few papers analyse the effects of capacity/frequency on entry deterrence. One exception is Morrison (2004) that highlights that capacity expansion by an incumbent airline may represent a credible threat for potential entrants since some fixed inputs need not be permanently assigned to a particular city pair. Another exception is Sheng et al. (2019) that argues that, under a grandfather rights slot policy, airlines may intentionally operate excessive flights.====Empirical evidence of the use of frequency as an entry deterrence strategy in air transport markets is still scarce. Goolsbee and Syverson (2008) find weak evidence to support that the incumbents expand capacity as an entry deterrence strategy in air transport markets. Ng et al. (1999) interview 36 service firms to explore their practices of capacity usage. Their study shows that 25 per cent of service firms interviewed expand their capacity to deter entrants. Among them, they find an airline that expanded the capacity on certain routes to ensure that other carriers do not enter the market. The results of this paper that relate the use of frequency as an entry deterrence strategy and the level of airport capacity may explain the divergences between the findings of Goolsbee and Syverson (2008) and Ng et al. (1999).====Special attention deserves Ciliberto and Williams (2010), who show that airlines can use “operating practices limiting access to airport facilities” as potential barriers to entry in the United States (US) airline industry, explaining high airline fares. Concretely, airlines need gates to provide service (and also ticket counter, baggage check-in rooms, etc.), that are regulated by long term exclusive contracts between airlines and airports. These practices are barriers to entry because new entrants usually have to pay sublease fees in order to obtain access, and the author find this variable a crucial determinant of price premium.====Recently, Sancho-Esper and Mas-Ruiz (2016) analyse empirically how the incumbent response is (taking a starting point in the classic behavioural strategies in investment decisions) in the Spanish air transport market (route level). Also, they take into account the type of entrant and airport capacity restrictions. They find that, under airport capacity restrictions, established carriers accommodate more the entry of ==== carriers than the entry of regional or national carriers. In contrast, without restrictions, there is a greater cost retaliation by the incumbent to the entry of ==== carriers than the others’ entry. The product differentiation model predicts these effects. Ciliberto and Zhang (2017) uses a longitudinal dataset from United States airline industry and they found that firms make investments to deter entry. Bettini et al. (2018) studies (also empirically), for a major incumbent airline and multiple airports region, the capacity response when that airline faces the entry of a new ==== carrier. They found that the incumbent pre-emptively increased their flight frequencies on the threatened airport-pairs, i.e., to deter the entry of the ==== carrier (that “march” from a secondary airport toward an existing primary airport).====In short, entry deterrence is an important issue in industrial organization, and there is empirical evidence in airline industry, so we have developed a theoretical model that can explain the relationship between it and capacity. In this paper, we find through this theoretical model that an incumbent airline may use frequency as an entry deterrence strategy against a ==== carrier, and it is closely related with the level of airport capacity.====Furthermore, we have to highlight that the European regulation of slots is based on the so-called “Grandfather rights”, that is, the rights of the incumbent airlines. Because of it, if an airline uses a slot in the previous season, it will be entitled to continue using it in the next period.==== After this, the remaining are grouped into a “slot pool”, where new entrants have booked up to 50%. The rest are allocated to incumbents for free. This procedure implies the minimization of (flight) changes from season to season (Sheng et al., 2019).====With this regulation, an airline could use the frequency as an entry deterrence strategy and the potential competitor cannot do anything to avoid it. Similar conclusion could be obtained from US legislation. As pointed by Ciliberto and Williams (2010), airlines require enplaning/deplaning gates to provide service at an airport, and entry deterrence is equivalent to carriers expanding their use of scarce airport gates.==== In short, this paper focus in cases where an airline is able to limit the access of an airport (through slots rights, gates or even any item regulated by long term exclusive contracts between airlines and airports).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we explain the main assumptions of the model. Section 3 analyses the competition in prices with vertically differentiated products. In Section 4 we describe how the ==== carrier decides whether to enter or not the market. Section 5 analyses the ==== carrier optimal choice of frequency in order to deter or accommodate the ==== carrier entry.

This paper explores whether routes governed by this policy have lower fares and higher service quality and load factors compared to those governed by BASAs, as would be expected in a liberalized air transport market. By analyzing traffic flows over 14 years between 28 EU countries and 27 external partners on 4 continents with which the EU has varying degrees of liberalization, we find that the external policy leads to 6% - 23% reduction in fares. Lower fares in turn spurred a 27% increase in demand and led to higher levels of capacity utilization.","In the last few decades, the European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of market liberalization in international air transport. After successfully deregulating its domestic market in the 1990s, it started exporting its open market policies in 2005 to its neighbors and key strategic partners through comprehensive liberalization packages. Following the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2002, which overruled its member countries’ Bilateral Air Services Agreements (BASAs), the EU has been negotiating Air Services Agreements (ASAs) as a block with third countries and regional blocks within the framework of its external aviation policy (European Commission 2005, 2016). This approach was pioneering in the sense that individual countries handed over the economic regulation of their international air market to a regional body. The EU example also ushered in the era of a potential multilateral approach for achieving global air transport market liberalization.====The time for evaluation of this policy in a comprehensive manner is ripe, as enough time has elapsed since the road map for the policy was set in 2005. This paper examines the economic effects of the EU's external aviation policy with third countries. Focusing on 27 countries with which the EU has an Air Services Agreement (ASA) of varying degrees of liberalization, we assess changes in demand, fare and capacity utilization. We argue that the external policy plays an important role in bringing the benefits of competitive market forces to travelers.====As pointed out by Borenstein and Rose (2014), the airline industry has been a prime example of how unrestricted markets achieve efficient production and allocation of outputs, and on the role of government intervention in improving efficiency. The liberalization of air transport has also been instrumental in lowering costs for freight transport by facilitating global supply chains, as evidenced by the rise of air cargo's modal share, especially for transporting high value goods (Hummels and Schaur, 2013; Micco and Serebrisky, 2006). It has also been shown that competitive air transport markets result in efficiency gains for airlines (Fethi et al., 2000), and increased employment in both the aviation sector and other travel dependent sectors such as the high-tech industry and tourism (Button and Taylor, 2000).====The last few years saw a renewed interest in the issue of air transport liberalization from two different perspectives. On one hand, a number of recent studies provided new evaluations of the major liberalization initiatives in the US, EU (Burghouwt and de Wit, 2015), Africa (Abate, 2016; InterVISTAS, 2014), Northeast Asia (Adler et al., 2014), and the Middle East (Cristea et al., 2015; Adler and Mantin, 2015). At a more global level, using a sample of 184 countries, Piermartini and Rousová (2013) find that liberalization has brought up to a 10% increase in air passenger flows. The literature provides a wide array of empirical evidence that deregulation/liberalization leads to traffic growth by removing constraints on pricing, market entry, flight frequency and network formation (see Fu et al., 2010 and Borenstein and Rose, 2014 for comprehensive reviews). The interest in liberalization also comes from studies aimed at analyzing future market developments. A long-term forecast of global air transport demand in a recent OECD study crucially depends on the extent to which the world progresses in terms of liberalization (Benezech et al., 2016). These studies not only confirm the beneficial effects of liberalization but also quantify the welfare effects of what could be achieved by pursuing a more liberal policy in the future.====On the other hand, the renewed interest in liberalization comes from the fear of “destructive competition” (Borenstein and Rose, 2014) or “heightened competition” (ICAO, 2013) as more and more markets open up. This fear is fueled by the aggressive expansion of Gulf airlines (Dresner et al., 2015), the emergence of long-haul inter-continental flights by Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) (De Poret et al., 2015) and the dominance of global airline alliances (OECD, 2014). These developments have resulted in policy uncertainty in major aviation markets such as the EU and the US, to the extent of endangering liberalization efforts.====Despite the above concerns, the literature consistently shows that the fortunes of the air transport industry are largely determined by its cost structure, demand and fuel price fluctuations, and infrastructure bottlenecks, contrary to the “destructive competition” arguments (Borenstein and Rose, 2014). European major carriers are usually shown to have a higher cost base (especially labor) compared to their rivals. Some argue that this high cost base, not liberalization, is making Europe lag other regions in terms of connectivity and airline profitability, to the extent of being by-passed as a global hub (CAPA, 2016; CAPA, 2014). Thanks to deregulation, the expansion of LCCs has stimulated cost cuts throughout the whole aviation industry which has led to significant reductions in fare (Brueckner et al., 2013). The benefits of market forces in the confines of the EU are well documented (Burghouwt and de Wit, 2015). What remains to be seen is whether the EU and its partners could benefit from a more liberal aviation policy, which is the subject of this paper.====This paper presents an econometric approach to measure the impact of the EU external aviation policy. While most studies in the literature address single country or regional markets, here we analyze liberalization in international markets, specifically all bilateral markets between the 28 EU member states and 27 external partners. A first research question that we explore is whether the signature of an international agreement between the EU and an external partner has an impact on passenger traffic between each EU member state and the external partner. A second research question addresses the dynamics of the impact and quantifies the impact of international agreements on fares, demand and flight frequency.====The empirical model in this paper is based on the proposition that the liberalization of international air transport markets mainly affects supply side variables such as fare, frequency and capacity utilization. Open markets allow airlines to offer more flight options at competitive fares that maximize their profit. By increasing competition between airlines, liberalization reduces fares. Lower fares stimulate higher demand. In turn, higher demand is translated into higher load factors, larger and more efficient planes and frequent flights. The empirical models in this paper allow us to analyze whether these hypotheses hold in the context of the EU's external aviation policy, which was adopted for the purpose of achieving more economic benefits from liberalization.====We use two complementary datasets for the analysis. Data from EUROSTAT cover aggregate annual bilateral flows for all country combinations and allow us to evaluate the overall impact on the number of passengers depending on the type of international agreement. Data from Sabre were used to refine the model and account for fares, flight frequencies and true passenger origins and destinations. The Sabre data correspond to two different months for each year available, which allows the seasonality aspects to be taken also into account. Two different approaches for modelling were used: a gravity model is applied for the estimation of the impact on demand at aggregate level using EUROSTAT data; and a two-stage-least-squares model is applied for modelling fare evolution and capacity utilization using the Sabre data.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the policy context for our study. Section 3 presents the empirical framework, followed by a description of the data in Section 4.

The technical elements behind this are explained by using a new three-dimensional concept called directness, encompassing number of transfers, number of stops and passenger route lengths. This is first exemplified in a simple ad-hoc network, and then applied to examine the structural changes that occur in the design of transit lines in a fairly general representation of a city. We show that directness increases whenever lines structure changes as a response to larger demand volumes - increasing ==== decreases within the demand range where the new line structure is maintained, just as in the one line model. The possibility of deciding the line structure introduces directness as a new source of economies of scale which are finally exhausted after full directness is achieved.","Cost functions and economies of scale are economic concepts that are quite relevant for the normative analysis within production theory, including industry structure and optimal pricing policies. Behind cost functions lies the technical process of conversion of inputs into outputs, such that cost functions can capture scale economies (a technical property indeed). In public transport, the main technical elements are frequencies, vehicle sizes and the organization of lines in space. In this paper we aim at understanding the relations behind the third design element and scale economies in public transport.====The provision of public transport services exhibits various technical characteristics that have been shown to affect its degree of scale economies. First of all, the so-called Mohring effect, where an increase in patronage makes optimal frequency larger and waiting times lower. Mohring (1972) found the frequency of the service to be proportional to the square root of the demand when only this effect is modeled in an isolated public transport line. In addition to this waiting time effect, as demand increases the system can also be adapted by incorporating new lines, thus reducing another component of users’ cost, namely the walking time. This has been modeled for a bus feeder system by Hurdle (1973), in a rectangular area by Kocur and Hendrickson (1982) for a single period, by Chang and Schonfeld (1991) for multiple periods, and by Small (2004), who analyzed the impact of road pricing on public transport. All of them obtain a cube root formula for both the optimal frequency of each line and for the optimal number of routes.====A third variable that can be adapted according to the demand level is the size of the vehicle, which also increases with patronage. As operators' cost per passenger diminish with vehicle size (due to fixed costs per vehicle), this is also a source of scale economies. However, when vehicles size increases the time spent at each stop also increases because more passengers board to, and alight from, each single vehicle, thereby increasing cycle time - which affects operators' cost as a larger fleet is needed - and users’ in-vehicle time. Both effects reduce the degree of scale economies. Including these effects in his model of an isolated public transport line, Jansson (1980) obtained a modified square root formula for optimal frequency. In all models the adjustment of frequency and vehicle size generates scale economies that, nevertheless, diminish as flow increases.====An important element of design that responds in a discrete way to increases in flow is lines structure, i.e. the way in which vehicles serve a number of routes in order to move a given set of flows (product). Such a structure can be optimized together with fleet and vehicle sizes, admitting many possible arrangements in space, with public transport lines organized as, for example, cyclical, hub-and-spoke, feeder-trunk or direct services. As flows grow these arrangements might evolve in a way that should be studied specifically; understanding the evolution of design including lines structure and analyzing its impact on total costs and scale economies is the main objective of the paper. Considering operators' costs only, Basso and Jara-Díaz (2006b) study the difference in the analysis of scale economies when lines structures are fixed or a variable to be optimized. Kraus (2008) formulates the problem including users and operators’ costs over a cost minimizing network, which in public transport would imply that users choose system optimal routes rather than individually optimal ones. In this paper we analyze scale economies looking at the evolution of lines structure design as total flow grows considering total costs and recognizing that users choose individually optimal routes. The main conclusions are that changes in lines structure induce scale economies at the particular value of total flow where this change occurs; that the technical elements behind this are the reduction of stops, transfers and route lengths; and that vehicle sizes and frequencies grow as well, as in single line models.====The paper is organized as follows. In the remainder of this Section we summarize the various ways in which scale has been studied in transport. Section 2 contains a discussion of what it means to introduce lines structure in scale analysis, showing that the degree of scale economies (====) - the ratio between average and marginal cost - increases discretely whenever lines structure changes as a response to a continuous proportional increase in flows. In Section 3 we use a simple network to illustrate this property and to introduce the multi-dimensional concept of directness that helps describing the evolution of lines structure as flows grow. This concept is used to present, in Section 4, a more general case that rests on a parametric description of a city; most importantly, the technical elements that help explaining the change in lines structure as patronage grows are presented in detail. Section 5 concludes, emphasizing the role of directness in scale economies analysis of public transport systems.====Although transport processes usually involve many inputs and outputs, the engineering technology has been usually formulated using aggregates, where product was described using single scalar measures as ton or passenger-miles until mid-eighties, and by means of a vector of a very small dimension thereafter, including flows related variables, service quality variables and network description variables. The compact description of output prompted two definitions in the literature around the analysis of scale economies, both referring to proportional expansions of output: returns to density (called RTD) and returns to scale with variable network size (called RTS). The former considered a proportional expansion of outputs keeping network size fixed, while the latter considered a simultaneous expansion of both flows and the network by the same proportion (Caves et al., 1984, Keaton, 1990). However, using aggregate output descriptions blurs the technical relations with inputs and has some unpleasant consequences in the analysis of economies of scale in transport activities.====Behind any compact description of transport output lays the true output of any transport firm: a vector of origin-destination (OD) flows of different things during different periods (Jara-Díaz, 1982a). In very simple transport systems the analytical derivation of the technical relations between inputs and flows - the production function – can be done, such that the corresponding cost functions can be obtained analytically as well.==== This approach proved very useful to show that the use of aggregates introduced ambiguity in the economic analysis in transport because, for example, the same amount of passenger-miles could require very different types and amounts of inputs depending on how this passenger-miles are distributed in space. Most importantly, scale economies should be studied holding the origin-destination system constant, as introducing new OD pairs means introducing new products, which would require the analysis of economies of scope; this means that “economies of scale with variable network size” is actually an ill-defined concept, as shown by Basso and Jara-Díaz (2006a) while “economies of density” is better suited to the definition of economies of scale.==== A corollary from this story is that more attention has to be paid to the transport production process itself in order to fully understand scale economies. This is the main objective of this paper.",Beyond the Mohring effect: Scale economies induced by transit lines structures design,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012219300085,19 March 2020,2020,Research Article,52.0

There is tentative evidence that commuting costs, that add to fixed costs of workdays,==== ==== affect daily working hours (Gutiérrez-i-Puigarnau and van Ommeren, 2010, Gimenez-Nadal et al., 2016), but evidence concerning the impact on workdays is inconclusive (Gutiérrez-i-Puigarnau and van Ommeren, 2010, Van Ommeren and Gutiérrez-i Puigarnau, 2011). Rather limited is research on workday elasticities (Dechter, 2013). Against this background, researchers feel free in modeling labor supply even if policies considered affect the costs of workdays. They assume that labor supply is constant (Anas and Rhee, 2007),==== ==== is the residual of a time endowment net of travel time (Brueckner, 2005)==== ==== or is a decision variable wherethe endogenous margin is either working hours==== ==== (Parry and Small, 2005)==== ==== or workdays (Verhoef, 2005).==== ====Given this variety, there is a surprising lack of knowledge of how policy evaluation is affected by labor supply modeling (LSM).==== ==== As we argue below, this is a reason for concern. We explore this issue and ask whether policy evaluation is robust against the modeling of leisure demand and supply of workdays and working hours.====But why should modeling those margins be important considering that labor supply elasticities are small for some groups of workers?==== ==== The answer is that there are many groups whose number of workdays (workweeks) per year is variable since they decide on participation, parental leave, sabbaticals, overtime, part-time or use worktime accounts.==== ==== With this in mind, we expect to find a systematic influence of LSM since pricing instruments such as fuel taxes, miles taxes, congestion tolls, cordon tolls, parking fees etc. affect the workday costs but not those of daily working hours. If workdays are not explicitly modeled in such cases substitution effects between the margins are neglected. Take a LSM with endogenous workdays decision as an example. In this case the variation of workdays adds a complementarity between labor supply and traveling that weakens the power of transport taxes to act as an indirect tax on leisure. This effect is absent in a LSM with fixed workdays but endogenous daily working hours. Further differences among the LSMs result from the time perspective. Modeling fixed or residual labor supply implies a short-term perspective though many studies making these assumptions look at the long term (e.g., relocation, spatial patterns in general).====Our research strategy is as follows: We, first, introduce the LSMs, focusing on two margins: daily working hours and annual workdays.==== ==== We distinguish the case that working hours are endogenous but workdays are fixed (the workhours approach, WH), that there is a workday choice but working hours are exogenous (the workdays approach, WD), and the case of a hybrid model (HY) – which has never been applied to policy evaluation – where workers decide on both working hours and workdays (based on Hanoch, 1976, Oi, 1976, Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980). In each case, we model leisure as either homogeneous or inhomogeneous across types of day. Subsequently, we implement different margins of labor supply in the well-known approach provided by Parry and Small (2005) used to derive and calculate optimal fuel and miles taxes. This allows us to derive the impact of labor supply margins on the components of the (second-best) optimal taxes. We apply Monte Carlo simulations to explore how the transportation levies depend on the elasticities of the different margins of labor supply and how they interact with other parameters.====Our main findings are: First, the magnitude of the fuel/miles tax and the Ramsey component as well as the sign of the latter depend on the choice of the specific labor supply model. Our results reveal that the optimal US and UK fuel (miles) taxes may vary up to 19% and 15% (45% and 36%), respectively, and the Ramsey component up to 73% and 130% (74% and 126%), respectively. The Ramsey term shrinks if workdays are endogenous and shrinks the more the higher the compensated elasticity of labor supply with respect to workdays is. For both taxes, the Ramsey component may even change its sign. Second, we show that the endogenous working hours model provides an upper limit while the endogenous working day approach gives the lower limit of the optimal tax and the corresponding Ramsey tax components.====Our results offer a strategy for the choice of LSM. In general, we suggest that both WH and WD should be applied whenever a policy asymmetrically affects the fixed costs of the margins because these span the interval of results. This strategy is useful as a shortcut given the missing knowledge on detailed elasticities which prevents researchers from choosing a proper hybrid model.====The paper is organized as follows. First, we introduce the LSMs and derive the value of times for each LSM. Next, we apply the Parry and Small approach (PS, henceforth) to calculate optimal fuel and miles taxes for different LSMs. Eventually, we finish with some conclusions.",The role of labor-supply margins in shaping optimal transport taxes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012218301424,12 March 2020,2020,Research Article,53.0

These mergers have shaped it into an oligopolistic industry consisting of only the “big four” airlines: American, Delta, United, and Southwest; plus budget or low-cost carriers (LCCs), such as Frontier and Spirit. Although these mergers have been investigated and approved by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the effects of consolidation on competition and prices continue to attract public debate. Previous studies have extensively examined whether prices have changed following these mergers, but they have focused entirely on changes in average airfares (Borenstein, 1990, Luo, 2014, Jain, 2015, Hüschelrath and Müller, 2015, Carlton et al., 2016). Given the complexity of the airline industry in which different types of firms (legacy carriers and LCCs) face various groups of customers (business and leisure passengers), research evaluating average airfares alone may not sufficiently reveal the full range of price effects.====For instance, in a market consisting of both business and leisure travelers, firms face the tradeoff of raising prices to generate more profits from the business passengers or reducing prices to gain more market share of the leisure travelers. Additionally, it is possible there are two other categories of passengers: brand-loyal customers and price-sensitive customers. When one firm decreases airfares to poach price-sensitive customers, its rivals may lower airfares to compete or increase their airfares to focus on brand-loyal consumers as their customer share goes up. Such industry intricacy plays an essential role in investigating firms’ pricing strategies.====To address this issue, I examine how different types of firms respond to the United-Continental (UA-CO) merger in different kinds of markets with varying combinations of consumer groups. Specifically, I investigate the pricing and capacity strategies of merging firms and their rivals on city-pair routes primarily consisting of price-sensitive leisure travelers and on routes more likely to have both price-insensitive business passengers and leisure consumers. Following Gerardi and Shapiro (2009), I focus on leisure routes that include cities whose economy heavily relies on accommodation earnings and big-city routes connecting two large cities that attract both business and leisure travelers. Besides those two types of routes, since both United and Continental operate through hub-and-spoke networks, I also investigate hub routes with one or both endpoint airports as hubs==== ==== for merging firms. In such settings, the market power effects and the efficiency gains from a merger may be different since firms’ pricing decisions respond to the elasticities of consumers. In addition, it is important to examine the responses of legacy carriers and LCCs separately because of their differences in, for example, business models and pricing strategies. Therefore, I decompose the firms into three types: merging firms, legacy rivals, and LCC rivals. Moreover, unlike previous studies, I examine the evolution of prices before and after the merger, rather than merely comparing average prices during the pre- and post-periods.====Consistent with Carlton et al. (2016), the regression on market-level average fares reveals no anti-competitive merger effects. However, this average masks considerable variation in price responses across firms and consumer groups. The merger creates higher price markups of merging firms on hub routes, and generates an “umbrella” effect as well, from which legacy rivals rather than LCC rivals can benefit, and legacy rivals increase fares significantly. This hub premium is not yet reinforced by reducing supply, such as number of seats and flights. On the contrary, the deal between UA and CO causes capacity concentration on hub routes, similar to a phenomenon uncovered by Bilotkach et al. (2013).====On the other hand, the merging firms and their legacy rivals adjust their prices significantly in anticipation of the approval of the merger, but the LCC rivals do not significantly change fares. More specifically, the merging firms increase prices significantly for business travelers but not for leisure passengers on big-city routes, and reduce fares for leisure travelers on legacy-dominated leisure routes which have a much small market share of LCCs. Their legacy rivals increase fares significantly on legacy-dominated leisure routes but not on big-city routes. The analyses on capacity indicate that merging firms and rivals have different reasons for adjusting prices. Merging firms appear to expand capacity to lower prices on leisure routes and reduce capacity on big-city routes to enhance their market-power. Thus, this assets redeployment produces a spillover into leisure markets from their effort to push toward an anti-competitive outcome in big-city markets. Confronting aggressive pricing strategy of merging firms in leisure markets, legacy rivals accommodate by cutting capacity to raise prices. In addition, merging firms mainly target the customer base of legacy rivals in either big-city markets or leisure markets, partially because there exists smaller difference in consumer base between merging firms and legacy rivals than between merging firms and LCC rivals. Therefore, without head-on competition, LCC rivals could manage not to consider the pricing and quantity decisions of merging firms.====To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically investigate how firms responding to a merger set prices for consumer groups with differing levels of price sensitivity. For example, when the market consists of distinct customer segments, i.e., the brand-loyal segment and price-sensitive segment, a change in competition induced by a merger may lead firms to adjust the degree to which they target different groups. Specifically, on leisure routes, the findings suggest that the merging firms target the price-sensitive consumers by reducing prices, while their rivals respond by increasing airfares to take advantage of their brand-loyal passengers. This reveals a critical displacement effect. Although the effect is studied in both theoretical (Perloff and Salop, 1985, Klemperer, 1987a, Rosenthal, 1980, Hollander, 1987) and empirical (Frank and Salkever, 1997, Morrison, 2001, Tan, 2016) entry models, it is not explored in merger research.====This paper builds on the extensive literature documenting how firms respond to mergers in the airline industry. Existing research examines mergers occurring in the 1980s after deregulation. These studies largely find increased price effects. Borenstein (1990) investigated two fairly similar mergers: Northwest’s merger with Republic Airlines, and Trans World Airline’s merger with Ozark Airlines; reporting that the average route price change from 1985 to 1987 for the Northwest-Republic merger was a 9.5% increase relative to industry averages compared to no increase in price for the TWA-Ozark merger. Kim and Singal (1993) examined 14 airline mergers from 1985 to 1988, finding that fares of both merging firms and rivals increased by 11%–12% during the merger announcement period, relative to routes involving no merging firms for similar distances. However, during the merger completion period, the fares for merging firms and rivals decreased by 9% and 5%, respectively. In later research, Kwoka and Shumilkina (2010) demonstrated that the effects of the USAir and Piedmont merger on prices from 1987 to 1989 on routes that one merged carrier served and the other was a potential entrant were approximately half of the price effects on routes with both merging parties present.====Of the research focused on recent legacy airline mergers, however, their findings seem to be much more inconclusive. Some studies have found that merging firms increase fares slightly on routes where both merging parties competed before the merger (Jain, 2015, Hüschelrath and Müller, 2015), while a case study of the Delta-Northwest airline merger by Luo (2014) concluded that fares did not change on nonstop routes but increased by 2.3% on connecting routes. In addition, through combined analysis of three legacy mergers (Delta-Northwest, United-Continental, and American-US Airways), Carlton et al. (2016) found no significant adverse effect on route or market fares. One critical reason for inconsistent findings in these previous studies may be the failure to consider the complexity of the airline industry, such as different consumer groups and market types.====The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the data, route types, and variable construction. Section 3 presents the empirical model and expected results of the merger.

We analyze the allocative efficiency of a TPS for a congestible facility such as an airport, a road, a recreational area, or a museum that experiences supply and demand shocks. The number of permits issued cannot depend on the state. We compare the efficiency of a TPS and a congestion fee when the level of the fee is similarly constrained to be the same across states. When demand and cost curves are linear, a fee outperforms a TPS for several combinations of additive and/or multiplicative demand and cost shocks. More generally, the ranking depends on the nature and magnitude of demand and cost shocks, the elasticity of the cost function, and whether or not the permit requirement always binds. A TPS tends to perform well when first-best usage levels are similar across states. Analogously, a fee is relatively efficient if first-best fees are similar across states.","Many types of facilities are prone to congestion including roads, airports, seaports, and recreational areas. The estimated costs of congestion delays to consumers, firms, and the overall economy are large.==== The standard prescription in economics to internalize congestion externalities is a congestion toll or fee. The idea was first proposed for roads by Pigou (1920), and there is now an extensive literature on road-congestion pricing (see Tsekeris and Voβ (2008), de Palma and Lindsey (2011), and Santos and Verhoef (2011) for reviews). Marginal-cost pricing of airport congestion was explored by Carlin and Park (1970), and a large body of work on airport congestion fees has developed (see Gillen et al., 2016). Crowding at recreational areas has also been a recurring concern — both at remote areas where solitude is valued highly (e.g., Cicchetti and Smith, 1973; Smith and Krutilla, 1974) and at popular destinations where visitors get in each other's way (Manning, 1999).====Advances in information technology have reduced the costs of imposing congestion-based fees and informing users about fee schedules. However, congestion fees are unpopular. There has been longstanding public and political opposition to road tolls (Jaensirisak et al., 2005) and airport congestion fees (Levine, 2008).==== In general, fees are also unpopular at recreational areas (Watson and Herath, 1999; Anderson and Freimund, 2004).====In the case of road pricing it is often argued that toll revenues must be dedicated to local transportation to overcome opposition to tolls (Jaensirisak et al., 2005). Yet, if revenues are dedicated to expanding roads or improving public transportation, years may pass after tolling begins before drivers experience any benefits. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: investments are needed to make tolling acceptable, but revenues from tolls are needed to fund the investments. Moreover, the public may fear project delays and cost overruns, or even that projects will be cancelled — perhaps due to a change of government.====Quantity-based tools are an alternative to fees for controlling congestion, pollution and other externalities, and they are widely used. Road travel is rationed by license plate restrictions (Gu et al., 2017), perimeter control (Menelaou et al., 2017), traffic calming (De Borger and Proost, 2013), and other measures (Victoria Transport Policy Institute, 2014). Slot controls are used at airports (Gillen et al., 2016), and quotas are imposed on access to recreational areas (Scrogin, 2005). Quantity controls are generally less efficient than price instruments because they fail to allocate usage to agents who value it the most. However, efficiency can be improved if agents are granted usage rights and allowed to trade them. Slot trading has occurred at US airports since 1986, and in 2008 the European Commission developed guidelines for airport slot trading.====There is now growing interest in the use of Tradable Permit Schemes (TPS) to control road traffic congestion.==== With a TPS, motorists must acquire a permit to make a trip, traverse a road link, or enter a restricted area — depending on how the TPS is set up. By limiting the number of permits issued, the amount of travel and the resulting congestion can be controlled. Unlike with tolls, if permits are distributed free, drivers in aggregate do not incur an additional net monetary cost to travel. Thus, permits may be able to avoid two common objections to road pricing: that it constitutes double taxation (i.e., taxpayers pay for road construction, and again to use the roads), and that it entails paying for something that was previously free. TPS are often viewed as more equitable, too. It is often claimed that tolling is vertically inequitable because lower-income individuals are willing to pay less for quicker and more reliable trips. This concern is muted with a TPS if permits are given out without charge. Moreover, lower-income individuals and households tend to travel less by car, and hence can earn income by selling excess permits. TPS have the further advantage that motorists gain immediately, rather than having to wait until any promised road or public transport improvements are completed. We further discuss the potential acceptability and equity merits of TPS in the conclusions.====With a few exceptions noted in Section 2, uncertainty has not been considered in weighing the relative merits of congestion fees and quantity controls for congestion management. However, as Weitzman (1974) and others have shown for activities such as pollution control where consumers do not directly bear the costs of market failure, price and quantity regulation are not equivalent if regulatory instruments cannot be adapted to prevailing demand and cost conditions. This has been a factor in the debate about whether a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade scheme is better for controlling greenhouse gas emissions when the rate of climate change and the costs of adaptation and abatement are uncertain. Uncertainty is also relevant for transportation, recreation, and other congestible facilities where demand fluctuates, and capacity or other cost shocks occur. However, the analytics of congestible facilities differ from other goods and services because congestion provides negative feedback to users that limits the size of the deadweight loss due to overusage.====This paper has two main goals. One is to explore the operation of a TPS for congestible facilities when demand and supply conditions are variable, and the quantity of permits issued must be the same regardless of the state. The second is to compare the allocative efficiency of a TPS and a congestion fee when the level of the fee is similarly constrained to be independent of the state. In our model, agents are risk neutral and learn the state before deciding whether to use a facility. Predictable (e.g., seasonal) and unpredictable fluctuations in demand and supply are thus analytically equivalent, and can be treated within a unified framework. We assume that agents are identical other than for their willingness to pay, and consequently we do not compare the welfare-distributional effects of a TPS and a congestion fee. As noted above, a TPS may have a significant advantage over a fee in terms of equity and public acceptability. By ignoring equity, our comparison is arguably biased against TPS. Nevertheless, we find that a TPS can outperform a fee in efficiency under certain plausible conditions.====Our main results are as follows. Similar to Weitzman (1974), we find that a TPS performs well when first-best usage levels are similar across states. Analogously, a fee does well if first-best fees are similar across states. Yet, when we apply Weitzman's assumptions to our model, the results differ sharply. Weitzman showed that with linear demand and cost curves, and additive shocks, quantity control dominates price control if the marginal social cost curve is steeper than the demand curve, and vice versa. By contrast, we show that a fee outperforms a TPS regardless of the slopes of the curves as long as the permit constraint always binds (i.e., the number of permits issued is less than the unregulated level of usage so that permits trade at a positive price). A fee also outperforms a TPS if, in addition to additive shocks, there are multiplicative demand shocks.====These clear-cut results appear to militate against the use of a TPS as an alternative to a congestion fee. Yet, on further exploration, we identify several plausible circumstances in which a TPS can be superior. First, under Weitzman's (1974) assumptions a TPS can be more efficient if the permit constraint does not bind in every state. This happens if demand is sufficiently low, and/or usage costs sufficiently high, that the unregulated equilibrium level of usage is less than the number of permits allows.==== Total usage with a TPS can therefore depend on the state, and this gives a TPS some flexibility in regulating usage. A fixed fee lacks this malleability because users pay the same amount regardless of demand and supply conditions. Second, we show that a TPS can outperform a fee if congestion grows with usage at an increasing rate. If so, it is important to prevent usage from overloading capacity. A permit constraint does this more reliably than a fee. Third, we extend consideration to externalities other than congestion such as pollution, noise, and infrastructure damage. When these additional externalities are present, regulating the amount of usage becomes all-the-more important, and quantity control using a TPS is again favoured over a fee.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the basic results derived by Weitzman (1974) and others on prices versus quantities under uncertainty when, unlike with congestion, consumers do not directly bear the costs of market failure. Section 2 then summarizes what little has been written about congestible facilities. Section 3 presents the model, and describes how a tradable permit system operates. It explains how a TPS can support the first-best optimum when demand and capacity are stationary, and it establishes the equivalence between a TPS and a congestion fee. Section 4 introduces variability in demand and costs, and derives the second-best fixed fee and fixed permit supply. The case of linear demand and cost functions considered by Weitzman (1974) is taken up in Section 5. Section 6 extends consideration to nonlinear functions. A combined fee and TPS scheme is briefly examined in Section 7. Extensions of the model are investigated in Section 8.

Jansson showed that crew costs were by far the largest cost item of local bus companies in Sweden, accounting for 42% of the total operator cost, followed by bus capital costs, which represented 21% of the total costs (Jansson, 1980). The large role of driver wages within the cost structure of urban bus transport does not seem to have changed much over the years. Depending on bus type, driver cost accounts for between 40 and 70 per cent of total bus operator cost in Singapore (Ongel et al., 2019) and Australia (own calculation based on ATC, 2006). In Japan, driver salaries account for 53% and 70% of total operating costs of buses and taxis, respectively (Abe, 2019). In developing countries, where wages are relatively lower, driver cost is less significant but still sizeable, e.g., around 1/3 of total bus operator cost in Santiago de Chile (Librium, 2013). Therefore, it is expected that vehicle automation, where deployment is possible, could have profound impacts on the public transport industry and service in the next decades.====In this context, automated vehicles have the potential to eliminate one of the main elements that cause economies of scale in public transport: drivers’ wages. The cost advantage of placing many travellers in large vehicles, such as buses or trams, will be reduced; thus, shared mobility services with smaller vehicles are expected to play a larger role in a future of highly or fully automated vehicles. Some empirical estimations of the dramatic effects of automation on reducing the costs of motorised shared mobility have been made. For example, in Zurich automation is estimated to reduce the cost of taxi trips by 85% (Bösch et al., 2018) and in Singapore, total operator costs of an electric 6-m long shuttle bus are reduced by 70% if automated, as compared to its human-driven equivalent (Ongel et al., 2019). More conservative estimations are provided by Wadud (2017) for the United Kingdom, who, after assuming that with automation a 40% of current driver costs will still be needed, estimates cost savings of 30% for the taxi industry and between 15% and 23% for the truck industry.====Given the large initial cost of the technology to provide full automation capabilities to vehicles, automation is expected to be firstly adopted in ride-hailing, shared mobility and commercial services, rather than for individual ownership and use (Wadud, 2017, Sterling, 2018). This issue has several key implications for the future of mobility, as current research shows that the energy consumption and environmental effects of the future deployment of automated vehicles crucially depend on whether the use of automated vehicles will be individual or mostly shared (Wadud et al., 2016).====Pilot programmes with small scale public transport services have been operating in the past 3–4 years in the form of automated shuttle buses in several countries, such as Switzerland, France, The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland (for a review, see Ainsalu et al., 2018). The first full size 12-m automated buses are scheduled to start trials in 2019 in Singapore==== and 2020 in Sweden==== and Scotland,==== in all cases being electric vehicles. Parallel to the progress of pilots with automated vehicles for shared use, there is a current debate among experts and researchers on whether fully automated vehicles will ever operate at acceptable levels in urban environments (Kyriakidis et al., 2019). Presently, there is a larger consensus that highly automated vehicles will be able to operate under certain conditions, such as segregated roads and low-speed environments (Kyriakidis et al., 2019).====Beyond operating cost savings, automation is expected to impact public transport in various ways. Several automation technologies will be introduced in public transport services, such as collision avoidance, lane-keeping, bus platooning, bus precision docking (i.e., having a narrow and stable gap between the vehicle and the platform at bus stops), cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and automated emergency braking (Lazarus et al., 2018, Lutin, 2018). The expected benefits of such innovations include a reduction of collisions, injuries and liability costs, improved services for people with reduced mobility and an increase in transport capacity, especially in dedicated infrastructure, such as bus lanes and segregated corridors (Lazarus et al., 2018). Lutin (2018) predicts a great reduction in cost and improvement in service in the US paratransit industry, which caters for persons with reduced mobility, due to automation, even though a fully automated service for mobility-impaired passengers poses further challenges as, e.g., robotic assistance will be required for boarding and alighting.====Three works closely related to the current paper are Abe, 2019, Zhang et al., 2019 and Fielbaum (2019). In Abe (2019), the total cost savings due to automation are estimated for the taxi, bus and rail industry in Japan, including operator cost and travel time for users. The author assumes a waiting time, which is exogenously set and is used for both human-driven and automated vehicles; therefore, the effect of automation on optimal supply levels for a public transport service (e.g., service frequency) is not considered. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2019) optimise a fleet of fully-automated and semi-automated buses on a hub-and-branch network. By semi-automated buses, the authors consider vehicles forming connected platoons in which only the leading bus has a driver. Bus frequency and size are optimised to minimise total operator plus user cost. Results show that automated services have a larger optimal bus frequency and a smaller vehicle size if the cost savings due to automation compensate for any reduction in speed from automated vehicles. Cost savings of semi-automated vehicles are less prominent than those of fully automated vehicles. Zhang et al. (2019) assume that the linear relationship between bus size and operator cost found by Jansson (1980) still holds with automated vehicles and their numerical application uses data from diesel buses from the previous decade (2000s) in Australia. Finally, Fielbaum (2019) optimise a network composed of a trunk system and feeder lines, in which different configurations of truck systems are compared, following Fielbaum et al. (2016). The author adapts the cost data of automated vehicles estimated in Bösch et al. (2018) to the case of Santiago and finds that automated vehicles provide more “direct” lines, with fewer transfers than human-driven public transport, due to the saving in operator costs. In Fielbaum (2019), only the case of full driving cost saving due to automation and the same running time of automated and human-driven vehicles is considered.====We see that the current understanding of the economics of automated public transport is limited in a number of ways. None of the previous authors analyses the effects of vehicle automation on optimal pricing and subsidy decisions of public transport provision. In this paper, the effect of automation on public mobility services is addressed with a supply optimisation model that takes into account both user and operator costs (Mohring, 1972). Thus, we extend earlier cost models for automated vehicles that focus on operator costs only (e.g., Stephens et al., 2016, Bösch et al., 2018, Ongel et al., 2019), with the inclusion of users’ costs in the form of waiting and in-vehicle times. We go beyond the works of Fielbaum (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019) by analysing the effects of vehicle automation, not only on optimal vehicle size and service frequency but also on optimal fare and subsidy. The degree of scale economies with and without automation is also calculated. Unlike Zhang et al. (2019), we use updated data from the operation of electric vehicles, given that all current public transport pilots of automated vehicles utilise electric vehicles and this is the technology expected to prevail (over internal combustion motor vehicles) at least in the near future.====Unlike Fielbaum (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019), we make our own estimation of capital and operating costs of automated and human-driven vehicles from scratch (see Appendix), which proves to be relevant as we are able to numerically assess if assumptions made by previous authors, concerning the effect of automation on the marginal cost of increasing vehicle size, hold. We analyse alternative scenarios of deployment of automated vehicles, considering the cases in which not all driving costs are saved due to automation, and that running speed of automated vehicles might be lower than that of human-driven vehicles, due to safety concerns in cities (Zhang et al., 2019 also analyse this case). Furthermore, this is the first article to compare the effect of automation on the optimal design of a public transport service in developed and developing countries – for which Germany and Chile are chosen for illustration – specifically concerning differences in drivers' salaries and values of time. We are able to show that, given a reasonable set of assumptions on operating and capital costs of human-driven and automated electric vehicles, Jansson's linear relationship between vehicle capacity and cost (Jansson, 1980) holds with human-driven and automated electric vehicles, for a range of vehicle types from cars to articulated buses.====We focus on fixed-route services. The service frequency (i.e., the inverse of the headway between vehicles) and the vehicle size are optimised to minimise total costs. Therefore, the choice of vehicle types, such that standard car, van, minibus and standard bus, is endogenous in the model, which is solved for increasing levels of demand. We also determine the effects of automation on the optimal (first best) fare, subsidy and on the degree of economies of scale of public transport provision. The increased capital cost of vehicles due to automation will be accounted for together with the reduction in operating cost due to automation. Sensitivity analyses on key parameters are performed to understand the main determinants of optimal shared or public transport supply levels.====In terms of results, the contributions of this paper are the following. It is shown that automation will increase the demand threshold that justifies the adoption of bigger vehicles, and that the size of the effect of automation on reducing vehicle size and increasing frequency depends on the country where automation is applied and on the final conditions regarding cost savings and running speed with automated vehicles. Second, combinations of running speed and cost saving with automation, that determine if there is an effect of automation on optimal frequency and vehicle size, are numerically established, which serve as a frontier for observable automation effects on supply outputs. Third, the relative cost saving due to automation is larger in Germany than in Chile, but in both countries, large savings are expected if full automation eventually materialises. Scenarios in which not all driving cost are saved and running speeds of automated vehicles are low can significantly reduce expected cost gains. Fourth, we show analytically and numerically that the reduction in vehicle operating cost due to automation benefits two parties: (i) operators, through a reduction of operator costs and (ii) public transport users, through a reduction on waiting times and on the fare to be paid for the service. Moreover, there is a reduction in the optimal subsidy per trip to be allocated to the public transport system. The size of these savings in some cases is straightforwardly estimated and in others depends on the parameters of the problem. Automation reduces the degree of economies of scale in public transport. Numerically, we find that for automation to have a noticeable effect on reducing optimal fares, a fraction larger than 50% of the current driving cost must be saved.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises current research on cost effects of vehicle automation and the use of electric vehicles for public transport. In Section 3, the supply optimisation model is presented, together with the derivation of optimal price and subsidy rules, which are used as a base to theoretically analyse the effect of automation on optimal supply and pricing outputs. Section 4 presents the estimation of relevant cost and operation parameters for the cities of Munich in Germany and Santiago in Chile, and the effect of automation on operator cost parameters is assessed. The full optimisation model is solved and applied in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.","The economics of automated public transport: Effects on operator cost, travel time, fare and subsidy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012219300802,23 December 2019,2019,Research Article,56.0

The aim of this paper is to present a combined use of two counterfactual techniques (RDD and DiD) to quantify the impact of Italian car scrappage schemes of 2007–2009 on the deregistration of cars. The empirical assessment of the policy effectiveness is made possible by a discontinuity in the age of cars that were eligible for the subsidy. In the ==== model we also introduce a variable on ‘product innovation’ in the car market as a factor that determines scrappage timing. Results, based on detailed information on the car fleet and the deregistration of cars in Italy, suggest no impact for the 2007 and 2008 schemes and a large impact for the 2009 scheme, which was based on rather high incentives. Results are robust to both counterfactual approaches and to different tests.","Public policy schemes aimed at stimulating the renewal of the car fleet (e.g. scrappage schemes) are generally motivated by environmental concerns about air pollution and GHG emissions of driving cars. According to Air Emissions Accounts (Eurostat, EU28, year 2016), private transportation contributes to as much as 11% of total greenhouse gas emissions and ozone precursors emissions. In this framework, the set of public subsidies offered by scrappage schemes may be seen as Pigouvian subsidies aimed at reducing negative environmental externalities. For countries where the car production is primarily domestic, however, these schemes have been often used as a way to support the domestic economy in situations characterized by stagnant demand (Aldred and Tepe, 2011).====Research literature addressed the schemes implemented in different countries by adopting different research and analytical aims. An extensive review of the studies until the end of the 2000s is presented in Van Wee et al. (2011), with a main focus on the environmental effects but considering also overall welfare effects, cost-benefit balances, and cost-effectiveness results emerging from studies. They conclude that: “====” (page 567). Other contributions include: Brand et al. (2013) on the UK experience, which put scrappage schemes in the framework of other policy measures; Cantos-Sanchez et al. (2018) on the Spanish experience; Antweiler and Gulati (2015) on the British Columbia SCRAT-IT scheme; Lenski et al. (2013) on the environmental and economic benefits of the ‘Cash for clunkers’ programme; Kagawa et al. (2013) on the environmental effects of the Japanese scrappage scheme.====However, not all the studies adopt a true counterfactual approach, which is instead needed to measure the pure effect of the scrappage scheme in a framework of co-causation and confounding factors. A good counterfactual, and then a policy effectiveness analysis, is the basis for quantifying the welfare effects, including environmental effects, due to the scheme alone.====A counterfactual analysis to assess scrappage schemes is presented in Grigolon et al. (2016), who use a difference-in-differences approach and find that the scrapping schemes contributed to stabilizing total car sales in Europe during the crisis of 2009, by preventing a total car sales reduction of about 30% and contributing to reducing polluting emissions. In this vein, Hoekstra et al. (2017), by means of a regression discontinuity design, show that more than half of the funds of the 2009 'Cash for Clunkers' programme in the U.S. was given to households that would have purchased the vehicle anyway. Li et al. (2013) address the same ‘Cash for clunkers’ programme by applying a DiD on monthly sales of new vehicles by model from 2007 to 2009 using the U.S. market as the treatment group and the Canadian market as the control group. Kaul et al. (2016) propose a ‘simple difference design’ by “====” (page 1102). A counterfactual strategy not employing formal statistical techniques has been adopted by Garrone (2004) to study the emissions effects of the Italian scrapping scheme of 1997–1998.====In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of scrappage schemes introduced by the Italian government in 2007, 2008 and 2009 on the number of deregistered cars. The main aim of the paper is to quantify the effectiveness of the schemes by means of a robust counterfactual analysis, i.e. what would have been the number of scrapped cars without the scheme. To this end, we employ, on the same dataset, two different techniques: Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Difference-in-Difference (DiD). The first allows us to assess the effectiveness of the scheme by exploiting the discontinuity between two quadratic fits, before and after the car age eligibility threshold in the different schemes, as the local average treatment effect. In the second approach, the observed discontinuity in the age of deregistered cars is compared to the past trends of deregistrations by age and region, taken as counterfactual in a panel data framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply RDD and DiD to the Italian scrapping schemes.====In addition to various control variables, we introduce in the DiD model also a variable on ‘product innovation’ in the car market, as proxied by the flow of new models put on the market in Italy in the years of analysis. This variable can account for the fact that a high rate of product innovation can push, by itself, to accelerate car scrapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that includes an indicator of product innovation in studying the effectiveness of car scrapping schemes.====The results show that the most effective scheme has been the one implemented in 2009, which was based on a high level of incentives. According to the DiD model, a bit less than half of cars scrapped in Italy under the 2009 incentive schemes has been scrapped as an effect of the scheme alone. The results on the effectiveness of the 2009 scheme emerges as significant from both RDD and DiD models, although with a different estimated magnitude, and it is confirmed by different robustness checks. In general, the results suggest that the combined use of different counterfactual techniques can improve the reliability of the quantified effects.====Being our main scope and focus a good counterfactual-based measure of effectiveness, we perform neither a welfare analysis nor a specific analysis of the environmental effects of schemes implemented in Italy in 2007–2009. However, in the conclusions we propose arguments on the need to reframe the environmental assessments of car scrappage schemes by taking into consideration not only the energy-emission pressures, which has been so far the main focus of the research literature, but also the waste and recycling implications of the scrappage schemes, which has been so far largely neglected in the relevant literature, with very few exceptions. The latter effects do represent the policy and analytical perspective of the Circular Economy.",Effectiveness of car scrappage schemes: Counterfactual-based evidence on the Italian experience,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201221930005X,13 December 2019,2019,Research Article,57.0

Airlines compete on both price and non-prices variables, where connecting passengers have asymmetric valuations of flight frequencies in different legs. Changes in landing fees trigger airlines reactions on flight frequencies and airfares, whose sign depends on the weight attached to flight frequencies. Thus, an increase in the spoke landing fee leads to more international flights under low valuations of frequencies at spoke airports. Simulation exercises show that profit-maximizing aeronautical charges only at the spoke airport are preferable to those either only at the hub airport or at both airports. Welfare losses are lower when airports are granted to a unique infrastructure manager rather than to independent ones. When frequencies in the hub are highly valued, profit-maximizing charges only at the spoke airport will likely induce a welfare increase.","The efficiency and performance of the air transport industry are certainly shaped by the interactions that appear in a vertically structured industry, with airports in the upstream and airlines in the downstream markets. Policy reforms affecting airport management will lead to changes in aeronautical charges which in turn will affect the intensity of airline competition with regard to both price and non-price variables. The characterization of markets as an air transport network introduces new relationships among the agents that makes competition more complex. In particular, when connecting passengers have asymmetric valuations of the frequencies airlines provide at different legs in the network. Taking these elements into account, this paper examines the effects of several airport management regimes on passenger traffic, airline prices and frequencies. Our analysis provides a useful framework for informed policy analysis in today's air transport industry.====The air transport industry has recurrently witnessed policies affecting aeronautical charges, the most common being changes in airport ownership, which definitely involve charges that depart from non-profit objectives. The evolution of airport ownership and governance has been significant over the last decades, ranging from government owned/operated to full or partial private for-profit structures (see Gillen, 2011).==== Leaving aside the effects on airport operating costs, some policy relevant questions arise. What is the effect of different landing fees on fares and number of flights? How do they affect airport and airline profits, and passenger surplus? Assuming the government opts for implementing changes in airport management, should it embrace all airports in a network or only some of them?====The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of several airport management regimes on the market outcomes and on competition among airlines. Changes in airport ownership affect landing fees which, in turn, trigger airline reactions on flight frequencies and airfares. To undertake the analysis, we consider the simplest airport network with one hub and two spokes. Two airports, a spoke airport (A) and the hub airport (H) are located in a country and the hub connects the network with an airport elsewhere (B). This entails two routes, one domestic and one international operated by different airlines. Domestic or local flights are served by a domestic airline whereas international flights are operated by two different airlines in order to capture that the intensity of competition is different. Airlines are providing services to three types of passengers; two of them just traveling along one of the routes and the third type consisting of passengers that travel from A to B and so using the two routes. For the latter, the so-called connecting passengers, both the departing conditions in the spoke and in the hub airports matter for their purchasing decisions. In the model, the number of flights affects the utility of passengers who are willing to pay more when there are more flights in a route; that is, the number of flights is an indicator of service quality. It is precisely the existence of connecting passengers that makes competition among airlines no longer to be fragmented by routes. As a result, when one airline in one particular route is taking decisions on airfares and flight frequencies, the rival airlines are expected to respond strategically. In fact, all decision variables are linked up so that a policy decision with a local or regional origin that affects an airport with a spoke role in the airport network is finally having implications that affect the whole airport network and the downstream airline industry.====Although the aforementioned questions are recognized to be fundamental in the evaluation of alternative regimes for airport management, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been addressed in a formal model. Because air travel involves different travel segments for connecting passengers, the decisions taken by air carriers become particularly important provided the asymmetric passenger preferences about flight frequencies, which may be biased toward either one or the other airport in the network. Our analysis throws some relevant contributions. First, when the departing conditions of the two airports are similarly valued, an increase in the landing fee per flight of the spoke airport leads to a decrease in the number of local flights and triggers a response by the international airlines in the same manner.==== Since the number of flights is directly related with the willingness to pay we can find that an increase in the landing fees will reduce airfares. Second, the analysis also unveils some unexpected results, which are driven by the fact that large enough asymmetric valuation of flight frequencies changes the strategic relationship between frequency choices made by airlines. We find that an increase in the spoke landing fee leads to more international flights under very low valuations of flight frequencies at the spoke airport. These relations and responses in turn affect airport and airline profit, as well as passenger surplus. These complex interactions should not be disregarded in taking sound policy measures that affect airport and airline relationships.====These results are confirmed empirically by calibrating the model with actual data from two networks, Malaga-Madrid-Paris and Valencia-Madrid-London for 2007. Then numerical simulations allow us to complete the formal analysis and evaluate five different airport management regimes. These regimes follow from the combination of two alternative airport managing rules, one based on marginal-cost pricing and another one which follows from profit maximization. Comparisons are drawn against the marginal-cost pricing scenario where airports set charges equal to their marginal flight costs, which here ensures cost recovery.==== The main policy conclusions are the following. In case of allowing profit maximizing landing fees to only one domestic airport, it is preferable that the spoke airport implements this policy. Besides, such policy can generate welfare increases under some particular conditions. When both domestic airports follow a profit maximizing policy, it is better to have one infrastructure manager rather than two independent ones.",A three-stage competition game in an air transport network under asymmetric valuation of flight frequencies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012218301114,26 November 2019,2019,Research Article,58.0

Cited only a few times, it is largely unknown to the transportation research community. In oral discussions in the early 1990's, Vickrey frequently referred to empirical estimates he had obtained using the method described in the manuscript. He likely intended to polish the manuscript, including these empirical estimates, and then to publish it, but did not because of his death in 1996. Judging the manuscript to merit publication for reasons explained below, we have co-edited it for publication submission to this journal.====An ODE (ordinary differential equation) model of traffic congestion has two essential elements. The first is the conservation of vehicles within an area, in differential form:====where ==== is the traffic density in the area (in terms of the number of vehicles either per unit area or per lane-mile), ==== the rate of change of traffic density in the area, ==== the inflow of traffic into the area, and ==== the outflow of traffic from the area, all at time ====. The second is an equation relating the outflow rate to the density of traffic in the area:====Combining the two equations gives====which is an ordinary differential equation.====The major contribution of Vickrey's manuscript is to prove that ====, where ==== is the mean trip distance and ==== is the network-level velocity-density relation at time ====, under the three premises that: (a) “a maze of congested streets is treated as an undifferentiated movement area”, (b) “speed is a function of the density of cars in the area”, and (c) at each point in time, trip distances follow a negative exponential distribution. Substituting this result into (iii) gives====Vickrey (1994) coined the term “bathtub models” to describe the class of models satisfying (iv).====To put the manuscript's contribution into perspective, we briefly review relevant literature:====It therefore seems appropriate to refer to models in which eq. (iv) holds exactly as “Vickrey bathtub models”, and to models that employ premises (a) and (b) but assume some other distribution of trip lengths as “generalized bathtub models"".====In addition to deriving the bathtub model in Section I, the manuscript makes highly original contributions in the other three sections: Section II proposes a set of local adjustment mechanisms for travelers’ choice behaviors related to departure times as well as suppressed and induced demands; Section III presents a backward method to estimate the time-varying marginal social costs of travel, as well as the corresponding optimal congestion tolls; and Section IV develops a semi-analytic approach to solve the bathtub model.====With the four sections together, this manuscript presents a complete modeling and solution framework of time-varying marginal cost pricing for a road network. The framework is iterative in nature: from the observed traffic patterns in a city, including the number of vehicles and the exit flows at different times, eq. ==== in Section I can be used to estimate the original entry rates, which serve as the initial condition; given the entry rates at each iteration, the time-varying number of running cars are calculated by following the semi-analytical method in Section IV; then the time-varying marginal social costs and the corresponding congestion tolls are estimated using the backward method described in Section III; and the rates of entry at the next iteration can be updated by following Section II's local adjustment mechanisms. Once the iterative procedure converges to an equilibrium, the computed congestion tolls are optimal. Even though the last two sections employ the quadratic flow-density relation, the corresponding methods can readily be extended to other network fundamental diagrams.====The manuscript demonstrates not only Vickrey's superlative intuition in traffic flow (Section I) and travel behavior modeling (Section II) but also his technical prowess (Sections III & IV). Even though it was written almost three decades ago, the manuscript is an exemplary theoretical study on congestion pricing, with the highest level of completeness and originality. We believe that the overall modeling framework as well as the models and methods in the four sections can be extended to formulate and solve the congestion pricing problem for many other dynamic traffic systems.====We have corrected some typos in the text and completed and corrected some equations.

The paper covers a long sample period, which runs from 1997 to 2016, and it supplements the usual USDOT fare data with confidential fare data reported by the foreign alliance partners of US carriers. The empirical results for connecting service match earlier findings, with alliances charging lower fares than nonaligned carriers. In contrast to almost all previous studies, the gateway-to-gateway results imply that, in the latter part of the sample period, granting antitrust immunity to two previously nonaligned carriers is equivalent to removing a competitor, with a consequent increase in fares. However, a simulation based on the results shows that this anticompetitive effect is more than offset by gains to connecting passengers, making alliances beneficial on balance.","Starting with the formation of the Northwest-KLM alliance in 1993, international airline alliances have come to dominate the provision of air travel between the US and other countries. Alliances represent the airlines’ way of providing seamless international travel (like that on a single carrier) in the face of prohibitions on cross-border airline mergers. Currently, three large international alliances exist: the Star alliance, built around the original partnership of United and Lufthansa; the Skyteam alliance, built around the Delta-Air France/KLM partnership; and the oneworld alliance, built around the partnership of American and British Airways. Within the alliances, particular groups of carriers enjoy antitrust immunity (ATI), which allows them to coordinate pricing and scheduling decisions. In many cases, ATI has been replaced by a fuller degree of cooperation through joint-venture (JV) arrangements, under which revenues on particular routes are pooled and shared. JV agreements are typically required to be “metal-neutral”, which makes the partners indifferent as to which carrier transports a given passenger (achieved by splitting revenue from a passenger regardless of which carrier is used). Under a JV, carriers are incentivized to behave as a single airline on the relevant routes.====Table A.1 in the appendix shows, for each alliance (including those that no longer exist), the groups of carriers within it that were granted ATI as well as the groups operating JVs. Table A.2 shows the dates at which individual carriers joined (and perhaps exited) alliances, and Tables A.3 and A.4 show the start (and possibly end) dates for ATI and JV status for individual carriers (all this information was provided to us by the DOT).====International alliances make interline trips (which involve multiple carriers) more convenient than traditional interline travel on nonaligned carriers, helping to achieve the goal of seamless travel. Greater convenience is achieved through schedule coordination by the alliance partners to shorten layovers, gate proximity at connecting airports, reciprocal lounge access, and a single check-in at which the passenger receives all boarding passes, benefits made possible by carrier cooperation under ATI or a JV agreement.====Alliances also affect fares for international travel, impacts that can be understood by referring to the network diagram in Fig. 1. Travel between endpoints W or X in the US and Z or Y in a foreign country requires using both airline 1 (the US carrier) and airline 2 (the foreign carrier), with a connection at either H (the US hub and international gateway) or K (the foreign gateway). Economic theory predicts that the fare for this interline trip is cheaper when the two airlines are alliance partners than when they are nonaligned. Because each airline takes its partner's interests into account, the alliance reduces “double marginalization,” an excessive markup over cost that each nonaligned carrier would apply for its portion of the interline fare, ignoring the negative impact on the other carrier (namely, lower traffic on its part of the trip due to a higher overall fare). Full integration of the carriers, as under a JV, should completely eliminate double marginalization, while it may be only partially eliminated with less integration, as under ATI, leading to a smaller fare reduction relative to the nonaligned case.====Despite lower alliance fares for interline travel, passengers whose trip is from one gateway city to the other, using just a single airline rather than two, may face a higher fare under the alliance. The ability to cooperate in fare-setting may lead the alliance partners, who provide overlapping service between the H and K gateways, to raise the fare in the HK market in anticompetitive fashion. The alliance would restrict seats for HK passengers at the same time that it expands seats for interline passengers flowing across the gateway route, whose volume rises in response to the lower fare they face.====These potential fare effects, which were analyzed theoretically by Brueckner (2001), have generated a sizable empirical literature.==== The purpose of the present study is to extend this literature by analyzing the price effects of alliances over a longer time period than most previous studies, and by using a new data source to supplement the DOT fare data used in previous work. We study the effects of alliances on both gateway-to-gateway (HK) fares and on connecting fares over the 1997–2016 period, using empirical specifications familiar from some earlier studies. We supplement the usual DB1B international fare data from the DOT's Origin and Destination Survey (a 10% sample of tickets with at least one US-carrier route segment) with confidential DB1B-style data provided to the DOT, starting in 1997, by foreign carriers having an ATI or JV partnership with a US airline. While foreign-carrier trips to a US endpoint that lack a US carrier segment are unobservable in the DB1B data, this supplemental data source allows such trips to be included in an international fare study. Even though the availability of the foreign-carrier data is beneficial, it is by no means essential in carrying out this kind of study.====The first empirical study testing the hypotheses drawn from Fig. 1 is by Brueckner and Whalen (2000). Because of the limitations of the 1997 DB1B data used in the study, they measured airline cooperation on interline itineraries by an “alliance” dummy variable indicating whether the two carriers had a codesharing agreement. The results showed that fares for alliance itineraries were 25% lower than fares for interline itineraries on nonaligned carriers. In addition, the results showed the absence of any anticompetitive alliance fare effects on gateway-to-gateway (hereafter “GTG”) routes. In a follow-up study using more detailed DB1B data from 2000, Brueckner (2003) relied on three measures of increasingly integrated airline cooperation on interline trips: codesharing, alliance membership, and ATI, each of which was associated with a successive fare discount relative to nonaligned itineraries. Relative to these itineraries, codesharing reduced fares by 7%, alliance membership by an additional 4% and antitrust immunity by a further 16%, for a total fare reduction of 27% from the presence of all three types of cooperation (i.e., immunized codeshare service between alliance partners).====A limitation of both of these studies was the use of cross-section data from a single quarter, a drawback remedied by the panel-data study of Whalen (2007). Using DB1B data from the 1990–2000 period, Whalen's preferred model specification showed a 9% codesharing discount relative to nonaligned itineraries and a further 18% discount from ATI, for the same 27% total discount found by Brueckner (2003). The panel approach was also used by Willig, Israel and Keating (2010) in an unpublished study, which relied on DB1B data from the 2005–2008 period. Their results, which focused on U.S.-transatlantic city-pairs, again showed interline fare discounts from codesharing and ATI relative to nonaligned fares.====Brueckner et al. (2011) focused on connecting fares (interline and online) using a longer DB1B panel data set covering the 1998–2009 period, and their results showed somewhat smaller interline fare effects than most previous work. The combination of codesharing, alliance membership, and ATI yielded a fare reduction of 11% relative to fares for nonaligned itineraries worldwide, although the reduction was a larger 16% for transatlantic travel. The authors conjectured that this smaller discount might reflect reductions in nonaligned interline fares themselves in attempt to limit traffic losses to alliances, a reduction that would narrow the alliance discount. Aside from Brueckner and Whalen (2000), none of these studies offered results on GTG fares.====Gillespie and Richard (2012), who used panel data for the period 2005–2010, focused on economy fares for U.S.-transatlantic travel, studying both connecting and gateway-to-gateway fares. In contrast to previous studies, the authors used individual fares rather than aggregating up to an average fare for each itinerary, and their results showed much smaller negative effects of airline cooperation on interline fares than previous studies. Alliance membership without ATI reduced interline fares by only about 1% relative to nonaligned fares, and the addition of ATI yielded at most an extra 1.8% reduction, for a total of about 3%. The study's gateway-to-gateway results showed the existence of an anticompetitive alliance effect. In particular, while adding a nonaligned carrier to a GTG route reduced fares, adding to the route an ATI partner of an existing carrier had no fare effect, showing that the two carriers do not compete.====In an unpublished paper, Brueckner et al. (2016) used fare data provided by Air New Zealand to study the effects of JV agreements on ANZ's connecting fares. The use of ANZ internal data allowed the study to control for ticket characteristics not observed in the DB1B, such as the advance-purchase interval and the duration of the traveler's stay. The results showed that JV interline fares were lower than ANZ's fares with nonaligned carriers, and that pricing on such trips was indistinguishable from online (single-carrier) pricing, confirming that ANZ and its JV partners set fares like a single airline.====The most recent study in this tradition is Calzaretta et al. (2017), which used DB1B data to focus on both connecting and GTG fare effects in a long 1998–2016 panel like the one in the present paper. As in Brueckner et al. (2016), their results show that airline cooperation reduces interline fares and that JV trips again yielded the same reduction below nonaligned interline fares as did online trips (8%). However, like Brueckner and Whalen (2000), the study found no anticompetitive alliance effect on GTG routes.====In an earlier GTG study that did not rely on transaction-based fare data, Wan et al. (2009) used posted GTG fares for U.S. transatlantic routes collected from the website of Expedia, the online travel agency. Instead of counting competitors, they measured competition on GTG alliance routes using the Herfindahl (HHI) index, and the findings showed no HHI effect on fares, consistent with the results of Brueckner and Whalen (2000) and Calzaretta et al. (2017).====This finding is repeated in studies by Gayle and Brown (2014) and Gayle and Xie (2019) that again use a different methodology, in this case a structural econometric approach.==== Using models that capture both the demand and cost effects of alliances as well as potential collusion in fare setting between overlapping alliance partners, these papers find no evidence of this phenomenon.====The present study uses the approach of Brueckner et al. (2011) to analyze alliance fare effects for connecting trips, and it uses the approach of Brueckner and Whalen (2000) to analyze fare effects in gateway-to-gateway markets, employing a regression model very similar to that of the earlier study in both cases. While the methodology is thus familiar, the paper differs from most of the literature by using data from a long 1997–2016 panel and by combining confidential foreign-carrier data provided to us by the DOT with data from the usual DB1B source. Relative to Calzaretta et al. (2017), who use a similarly long panel and a similar methodology, the paper's methodological contribution is reliance on the confidential supplementary data, which has never been used before in an international fare study.====Like all past studies, the paper finds evidence of fare reductions from alliance cooperation on connecting itineraries, with magnitudes that match those found in the most recent papers. The striking difference between the present results and those of almost all previous studies is our finding of anticompetitive fare effects from overlapping ATI and JV service on GTG routes, a consequence of the carriers acting as if they are a single carrier in setting fares. These effects are confined to the later part of the sample period. This finding emerges for only the second time in the literature, and it is due to a regression specification that allows anticompetitive effects to change across the sample period. By constraining these effects to be constant across their sample period, Calzaretta et al. (2017) were unable to uncover the late-period effect identified in the paper.====The results thus show that fare benefits to connecting passengers are accompanied by losses to GTG passengers on overlapping routes. The existence of these two opposing effects then raises a crucial question: are the fare impacts of alliances beneficial or harmful to passengers on balance? A major contribution of the paper is to answer this question through a simulation exercise based on the estimated models. The results show that the gains to connecting passengers more than offset the losses to GTG passengers, making alliances beneficial on balance, a conclusion that validates decades of favorable DOT policy toward alliances. Note that this exercise, which has no counterpart in previous empirical studies, is the empirical equivalent to the calculations carried out by Brueckner (2001) in the context of a theoretical model, which generally showed the same conclusion. It also should be noted that, as in all previous studies, our quantification of alliance benefits pertains only to pricing, with the convenience gains from alliances (one-stop check, gate proximity at connecting points, improvements in service frequency, etc.) not considered. Consideration of these additional benefits would further tip the balance in favor of alliances.====The plan of the paper is as follows. Sections 2 Connecting-market data and variables, 3 Connecting-market results present the data and the regression results for connecting trips, while sections 4 Summary, 5 Gateway-to-gateway data and variables present the data and regression results for GTG trips. Section 6 presents the simulation exercise, and section 7 offers conclusions.",Pricing by international airline alliances: A retrospective study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201221930084X,22 October 2019,2019,Research Article,64.0

We found that a 10% increase in Safety Tutor coverage led to an average reduction in total accidents of 3.9%, whereas there is no evidence of a significant causal effect of Safety Tutor in reducing fatal accidents.","Speeding has been recognized as one of the major causes of road accidents, and the relationship between speed and crash risk has been extensively investigated (Aarts and Van Schagen, 2006; Hauer, 2009; Yannis et al., 2013). Thus, in an attempt to reduce speeding across road networks, most road agencies have adopted a variety of policies to improve safety such as camera-based speed enforcement systems.====Several studies have confirmed the positive effect of fixed and mobile speed cameras on vehicle accident reduction on both rural roads and highways (Goldenbeld and van Schagen, 2005; Jones et al., 2008). However, the cameras’ contribution has been shown to be limited to the immediate vicinity of the enforcement activity, achieving speed reduction on only a short section (Champness et al., 2005; De Pauw et al., 2014b). In addition, speed variation between vehicles (due to speed-check cameras) has been demonstrated to increase the risk of an accident because sudden braking may disrupt homogenized traffic flow and reduce headway distances between vehicles (Cirillo, 1968; Lave, 1985). Hence, since there is evidence that many drivers regard speeding as normal and socially acceptable (Fleiter et al., 2010; Veisten et al., 2013; Tscharaktschiew, 2016), the need emerged for an innovative speed management system that balances safety with the efficiency of vehicle flows on the road network (Wegman and Goldenbeld, 2006).====This relatively new technology, called an average speed enforcement system, is able to determine the average speed of vehicles over a long section by dividing the certified and known distance between two camera sites by the time the vehicle takes to travel between those two sites, thereby encouraging speed compliance over a greater distance and eliminating the need for police officers at the scene. Moreover, it provides a nearly perfect probability of catching drivers when speeding (Aarts et al., 2009; Montella et al., 2011). Initially operated in trial form in 1997 in the Netherlands, this system has achieved promising results, resulting in its increased popularity in several highly motorized countries.====In Italy, an average speed enforcement system, named Safety Tutor, was developed by the major highway concession company, ==== (====), and the Italian traffic police in 2004 to improve safety on high-speed roads. Starting from 23 December 2005, it was progressively deployed along the Italian tolled motorway network, and by 2017, more than 3100 km (considering both carriageways) were monitored by the system through 333 sites. However, although promoters of Safety Tutor credited it with a sharp decrease in accident and mortality rates, after more than 10 years of operation, relatively little is known about the efficiency of this system. Over this period, previous studies have focused on its impact in preventing highway accidents only on specific motorway sectors with unique road and congestion features; furthermore, they have considered only total accidents as the main outcome of interest.====Thus, we seek to fill these gaps by empirically testing in a quasi-experimental setting the extent to which Safety Tutor led to a reduction in both total and fatal accidents on Italian highways during the period of 2001–2017. The novelties of this article lie, first, in its application of a counterfactual analysis using a unique panel dataset that allows us to control for many unobservable confounding factors and to exploit heterogeneous accident data within all tolled motorway sectors==== through a generalized difference-in-differences estimation; second, in its adoption of an instrumental variable strategy to address potential endogeneity issues.====Indeed, the decisions on where to locate the Safety Tutor sites were likely driven by the outcomes of interest, as they may have been first activated along those motorway sectors characterized by higher accident and mortality rates (Falsi, 2009). To deal with this issue, a recent strand of literature has proposed the use of historical instruments to identify the parameter (Baum-Snow, 2007; Duranton and Turner, 2012; Percoco, 2015). Similarly, by exploiting the fact that Italy adopted a concession model regime==== to manage its highway network, we utilize as an instrument the network of motorway sectors managed by ==== and its controlled concessionaires (named ====) that had been established approximately 50 years before the development of this average speed enforcement system. In particular, we use a dummy variable indicating whether a motorway sector has been a member of ==== from 2005 onwards (i.e., when the technology was available) as an instrument to predict Safety Tutor adoption and identify its impact in reducing highway accidents. In Section 3.2, we will discuss extensively the rationale behind the choice of the instrument as well as possible threats to its validity.====Our findings reveal that a 10% increase in Safety Tutor coverage led to an average reduction in total accidents of 3.9%, whereas there is no evidence of a significant causal effect of Safety Tutor in reducing fatal accidents. Possible reasons for this are that a general amelioration of vehicle safety systems and motorway paving, as well as a plausible improvement in the quality of health care, rather than the benefits arising from the adoption of Safety Tutor, had the greatest influence in preventing fatal accidents. Our evidence is corroborated by a set of robustness checks that deviate from baseline models, including an investigation of the timing of the effect and placebo regressions.====Finally, considering that on 10 April 2018 the Court of Appeals of Rome established that patent rights related to the Safety Tutor technology belonged to another company (====), ==== was forced to turn off all the devices in anticipation of their replacement with a similar technology. Therefore, because accident prevention is a major goal of transport institutions and road agencies (as foreseen by the ==== programme (International Transport Forum, 2016)), our study ultimately seeks to provide further evidence that highway concession companies can use to assess the utility of adopting average speed enforcement systems to improve drivers’ safety.====The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the Safety Tutor technology and we review the literature. In Section 3, we explain our empirical strategies, while in Section 4, we present data and descriptive statistics. In Section 5, we present our results, followed, in Section 6, by our robustness checks.

Numerous studies have been undertaken to elicit the VOT from hypothetical or actual choice situations, resulting in stated preference (SP) and revealed preference (RP) data, respectively. Insightful meta-studies on the valuation of (travel) time can for instance be found in Abrantes and Wardman (2011) (for Great Britain) and Shires and De Jong (2009). Results of recent national VOT studies are discussed in Axhausen et al. (2014) (Germany), Börjesson and Eliasson (2014) (Sweden), Kouwenhoven et al. (2014) (Netherlands), and Batley et al. (2019) (Great Britain).====Existing research on the VOT reveals systematic differences in the value of time with respect to transport modes, trip purposes, socio-economic characteristics, short-run vs. long-run decision time frame (e.g. Wardman, 2004, Peer et al., 2015). Also the underlying data source (SP vs. RP data) seems to affect the value of time significantly (e.g. Ghosh, 2001, Hensher, 2001, Brownstone and Small, 2005, Small et al., 2005, Isacsson, 2007, Peer et al., 2014, Hultkrantz and Savsin, 2018): most studies find that the value elicited from SP data is substantially lower than the value elicited from RP studies. This gap is usually referred to as hypothetical bias.====This study aims at investigating whether hypothetical biases in the value of time disappear if RP and SP choice settings are identical and only differ according to whether the choices have real-life consequences in terms of monetary incentives and unexpected waiting times (RP) or not (SP). We use this controlled environment to test existing hypotheses related to the origin of hypothetical biases. Unlike the recent study by Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018), which has a similar scope, we focus on unexpected waiting times that are long enough to interfere with scheduling constraints (15–90 min); in the experiments conducted by Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018), the unexpected waiting time (to be spent on completing a task) was only 15 min. We will show that this difference matters, as scheduling constraints play a crucial role for the formation of hypothetical biases in the valuation of time.====SP data generally have the advantage over RP data that their design is being fully controlled by the analyst, implying that the definition of alternatives and their attributes is unambiguous, and that collinearity between attribute levels can be avoided. This is not always the case for RP data, where the attribute levels may be correlated (affecting estimation accuracy negatively), and the definition of the choice set and attribute levels may not be unambiguous. For instance, Peer et al. (2013) show that the VOT may be structurally biased depending on the assumptions made concerning travel time expectations.==== ====While SP data are typically easier and less costly to collect, and can capture non-existent alternatives, they are at risk of yielding biased estimates, due to persons acting differently in hypothetical choice settings compared to actual, real-life settings. This divergence has been shown in a wide number of contexts, but seems to be especially persistent in the context of the valuation of public goods (often based on contingent valuation methods), where valuations elicited in hypothetical settings tend to be substantially higher than the corresponding valuations elicited in real-life settings (see for instance the meta-analyses by List and Gallet, 2001, Little et al., 2004, Murphy et al., 2005a, Penn and Hu, 2018).====Several reasons have been brought forward as an explanation for the existence of hypothetical biases. The most obvious one is the lack of real consequences in hypothetical choice settings (Murphy and Stevens, 2004). Such absence of consequentiality may lead to a gap between people’s intention (SP) and behavior (RP) (Ajzen and Fishbein, 2000). Recent papers that investigate neural processes that can be associated with decision-making support the notion that there are differences between choices with real vs. hypothetical consequences in terms of the brain areas being active (Kang et al., 2011, Camerer and Mobbs, 2017). A possible explanation for these differences is that individuals try to minimize cognitive effort exerted on tasks (e.g. Walton et al., 2006, Kool et al., 2010, Shenhav et al., 2017), since cognitive effort is costly and has an opportunity cost (Kurzban et al., 2013, Westbrook and Braver, 2015). In hypothetical choice settings, the costs of not exerting any effort are (close to) zero, as there are no real-life consequences of the decisions taken.====Besides the absence of real consequences, also strategic answering has been brought forward as a potential reason for hypothetical biases, in particular when the choices concern the provision of public goods (e.g. Carson and Groves, 2007). Uncertainty regarding the choice (and hence the value of the underlying good) may play a role as well (Champ and Bishop, 2001). The same is true for complicated choice task designs (e.g. Boxall et al., 2009, Regier et al., 2014). These latter three reasons (i.e., strategic answers, uncertainty and complicated choice tasks) are, however, likely to play only a minor role in the context of VOT elicitation: first, since VOT estimates are usually not derived for a specific project (e.g., infrastructure investment), but for generic usage (often as input to cost-benefit guidelines), participants of SP surveys generally do not know what their time valuations will be used for (hence strongly reducing the incentive for strategic answers); second, the trade-off between time and money should be fairly familiar to most persons, as related decisions are present in a variety of contexts (choosing between transport modes, choosing the number of working hours, etc.); finally, the choice tasks designed for VOT elicitation tend to be fairly simple, as they usually include a limited number of attributes that are familiar to the respondents.====Various studies have argued that hypothetical biases are (more) likely to occur if the hypothetical setting diverges strongly from real-life choice situations that are familiar to respondents (e.g. List and Gallet, 2001, Hensher, 2010, Schläpfer and Fischhoff, 2012). In a stated choice context, this holds for both the framing of the SP experiment and its design in terms of alternatives and attributes. Regarding the design of SP experiments, attribute values pivoted around the respondents’ real-life reference situation have been suggested as a way to reduce hypothetical biases, and have been implemented in numerous applications (Hensher, 2010, Li et al., 2018). However, the above-mentioned recent study by Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018), which also concerns VOT elicitation, provides some evidence that ‘referencing’ to a specific situation may have little influence on the hypothetical bias, and may actually acerbate it: they find no hypothetical bias to be present if the decision between a 15-minute task and a monetary reward concerns the present moment (which hence assumes the role of a reference point), but (indirectly) find evidence for a hypothetical bias to exist if the trade-off concerns a later (not precisely defined) point in time. Moreover, as shown by Boxall et al. (2009), respondents may have a tendency to choose the alternative that represents the status-quo, in particular when the choice task is somewhat complicated.====Other strategies to reduce hypothetical biases include making respondents aware of hypothetical biases (“cheap talk”) and urge them to respond truthfully (Cummings and Taylor, 1999, Loomis et al., 1996, Murphy et al., 2005b, Loomis, 2014). Also approaches for ex-post corrections of hypothetical biases have been suggested, often based on the certainty indicated by the respondent (“certainty correction”) regarding his/her choice (Beck et al., 2016, Blumenschein et al., 1998, Regier et al., 2014).====In the context of the valuation of time, more specific factors may play a role and lead to the result that SP-based values tend to be lower than RP-based values (unlike in most studies that aim at eliciting valuations for public goods, see the above-mentioned meta-analyses by List and Gallet (2001), Little et al. (2004), Murphy et al. (2005a) and Penn and Hu (2018)). Several possible reasons for the divergence between SP and RP estimates have been brought forward. First, travel time misperceptions may be a possible cause: Brownstone and Small (2005) argue that if travel times are perceived as longer than they actually are, persons will react to travel times in an SP setting as if they were overstated, in turn leading to SP-based VOT estimates that are biased downwards. This hypothesis was tested in Peer et al. (2014) but could not be confirmed. Second, it is plausible that people display time inconsistencies in their actual behavior, but do not account for such errors when answering hypothetical surveys (Brownstone and Small, 2005). For instance, in real life, people might tend to start their morning commute later than planned and therefore choose toll lanes more often than implied by their SP responses, which reflect their ex-ante plans rather than the morning reality. This behavior would result to comparatively lower SP-based VOTs. A further hypothesis is that in hypothetical settings, respondents do not take into account their scheduling restrictions to the same extent they would do in real life (or more generally “disregard alternative time use”, see Hultkrantz and Savsin (2018)), due to the lack of real consequences. As a result the SP-based VOT is lower than the RP-based VOT, since the former does not fully account for scheduling constraints.====In our study we can exclude that travel time misperceptions or time inconsistencies play a role in explaining any hypothetical bias. Also the choice task design was identical between the SP and the RP setting, and participants had no evident reason for answering strategically, or more generally, not revealing their truthful preferences. The only difference between the SP and the RP setting was that only the latter had real consequences. Following the terminology of Carson et al. (2014) and Johnston et al. (2017), we can therefore classify the RP treatment as incentive-compatible and consequential, whereas the SP treatment is purely hypothetical.====More than 300 Czech university students participated in our study. They were randomly assigned to either the SP or the RP treatment. Each participant had to fill multiple price lists (MPLs), consisting of 80 choice situations, in which (s)he had to decide between going home directly after the scheduled end of the experimental session and no reward, or waiting after the end of the experimental session and earning a specified monetary compensation. For some MPLs, the duration of the unexpected waiting time was certain, whereas for others it was uncertain. Due to the trade-off between waiting time and a monetary reward, in all MPLs, both budget and scheduling constraints were relevant constraints.====For participants in the incentivized (RP) treatment, one of the 80 choices was randomly selected and if the participant had chosen to wait, the student had to remain in the lab for the specified time and received the stated compensation at the end. In the hypothetical (SP) treatment, students were informed that none of the choices will have a real-life consequence for them, so they will be free to leave the lab directly after the experimental session and receive no monetary compensation. We further provided a fixed compensation for participating in the experiment to a sub-group of participants in the SP treatment in order to test whether this encourages participants to invest more cognitive effort in filling in the choice tasks truthfully, potentially reducing hypothetical biases. The participants’ choices in the MPLs allow us to elicit their value attached to unexpected waiting time, or more precisely their willingness-to-accept the unexpected waiting time.====We find that hypothetical biases are present even in this controlled setting. In line with most earlier studies comparing SP- and RP-based VOT estimates, participants attach a higher value to (waiting) time in the RP setting than in the SP setting. The bias is larger for participants who have scheduling restrictions, presumably because thinking about rescheduling takes up mental resources, which participants are only willing to invest if real-life consequences occur. This explanation is supported by the hypothetical bias being less strong for participants (with scheduling restrictions) who perform better in an incentivized speed coding test, and therefore are expected to have a higher cognitive ability. This implies that the hypothetical bias found in our data is mainly driven by people who would need to make important changes to their plans, if they had to wait in the lab after the experiment, but who also seem to be less able or willing to think about the consequences of these changes in a hypothetical setting. The bias does not diminish if the participants receive a fixed compensation for participating in the study.====Our study makes multiple contributions. It adds evidence on the reasons why SP- and RP-based VOT estimates diverge. Unlike in most earlier studies that compare SP- and RP-based data, the controlled lab setting allows us to identify and test specific hypotheses related to the origin of the hypothetical bias. Our findings add also to other fields in which stated preference data (or contingent valuation data) are used to elicit willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept values (in particular, environmental economics), and which so far have paid fairly little attention to the role of cognitive effort and ability. Multiple studies have emphasized the need for a more general theory on the formation of hypothetical biases (e.g. Murphy et al., 2005b, Mitani and Flores, 2010), to which this paper may contribute. Our paper also adds to the expanding body of literature at the intersection of lab experiments and choice modeling (e.g. Carlsson, 2010, Fayyaz et al., 2018), as well as to the still limited literature that shows how constraints in mental processes may lead to biases in valuations (e.g. Koster et al., 2015).====Our results also have strong policy implications as the VOT is a commonly used parameter in transport models and appraisals. If it is afflicted by hypothetical biases, also the outcomes of these models and appraisals are likely to be biased. The values elicited in this study can probably best be compared to the value attached to an unexpected public transport delay, the duration of which may be known or unknown, depending on whether the duration was certain or uncertain in the MPL. Based on existing studies on the value of time (summarized for instance by Wardman, 2004, Abrantes and Wardman, 2011), we expect the value attached to an unexpected delay to be substantially higher than the value attached to changes in planned travel time, and the value attached to an unexpected delay of unknown duration to be higher than one of known duration.====As we rely on a sample of Czech students, our main focus is not on the absolute size of the elicited VOT estimates and the hypothetical bias, both of which cannot be regarded as representative of the wider population. However, we expect the identified mechanisms in terms of the presence and determinants of the hypothetical bias in the VOT to generalize to the wider population. This assumption is supported by the recent meta-analysis on hypothetical biases by Penn and Hu (2018), which does not find any effect of a student sample on the magnitude of the hypothetical bias.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the experimental design, data sources and experimental procedures. Section 3 provides an overview of the sample characteristics and descriptives on the value of time elicited from the multiple price lists. Section 4 discusses the models and results.

Thus, the traffic gains of non-stop flights may be concentrated in rich city-pairs with a high proportion of passengers sensitive to time costs.====In this paper, we estimate a model that quantifies the impact of long-haul non-stop flights on traffic flows in inter-city markets, using data that account for the true origin and destination of passengers. Hence, our bilateral air traffic data include non-stop and connecting traffic. In particular, we analyze whether long-haul non-stop flights may have a positive and significant effect on traffic flows in a context where indirect connectivity is high.====A second goal in our analysis is to examine whether the impact of non-stop flights on traffic is associated to the income levels of the destination. If the impact of non-stop flights on traffic can be mainly explained by the reduction in time costs, then such impact could be only relevant for high-income destinations. This would suggest a certain limitation to the positive economic impact of long-haul non-stop flights as they would be only relevant where income levels are already high.====Long-haul non-stop flights between city pairs have traditionally been operated by network airlines through their major hub airports. ==== However, several factors have led to an increase in the provision of long-haul flights from airports other than the main hubs. Congestion at the main hubs is associated with lower quality levels in the form of delays and cancellations (Brueckner, 2002; Mayer and Sinai, 2003). Passengers may have a higher preference for direct flights than they had in the past (Berry and Jia, 2010). New aircraft models like the Airbus A350 or the Boeing 787 Dreamliner may allow for the provision of long-haul flights in thin routes. Finally, in Europe changes in the airline market, such as the arrival of low-cost carriers (e.g. Norwegian) in the long-haul market, or the increasing presence of airlines from North America and Asia benefit non-hub airports.====These trends may imply that cities with mid-sized airports benefit from globalization through their increased connectivity with the rest of the world. Having said this, such cities are generally well connected by means of frequent flights (and usually low fares) to the major hub airports. Thus, they may benefit from global connections through major hub airports as well.====We take advantage of the recent shift in the supply of non-stop flights from European cities with mid-sized airports to analyze the causal relationship between long-haul non-stop flights and total passenger flows. To this end, we use quarterly data on air traffic from European cities to large urban areas across the rest of the world for the period 2010–2016.====A major econometric challenge in this analysis is the potential endogeneity bias of the variable for the number of non-stop flights. To deal with this issue we apply a matching procedure to compare comparable routes so that we built a sample with city-pairs with and without non-stop flights similar in terms of the covariates and traffic levels in the baseline period. Furthermore, we include city-pairs fixed effects in the estimation to control for differences between city-pairs due to unobservable factors that are time invariant and time fixed effects to control for unobserved shocks that are common to all city-pairs.====Finally, we use an instrumental variables approach to overcome the possible bias due to heterogeneity that is unobservable and changing over time. In this regard, the instruments that seem to correct the expected upward bias are based on lags of the potentially endogenous explanatory variable.====Various studies have undertaken empirical analyses concerning the economic impact of air traffic. The traditional approach is to examine the causal relationship between an aggregated indicator of airport size and measures of urban or regional economic performance, such as, employment, income or number of firms. Here, we can mention some studies using samples of urban areas in the United States (Bilotkach, 2015; Blonigen and Cristea, 2015; Brueckner, 2003; Cristea and Danila, 2017; Green, 2007; Lakew and Bilotkach, 2018; Sheard, 2014; Sheard, in press), European regions (Albalate and Fageda, 2016; Bel and Fageda, 2008), or individual European countries, like Italy (Percoco, 2010; Cattaneo et al., 2016). A major shortcoming of these studies is that the economic effect of air services is related primarily to enhanced connections to specific destinations. Indeed, air transportation may have different economic effects on the host urban area or region. An expanding airport might increase numbers of employees, directly or indirectly. Additionally, air traffic can facilitate face-to-face contact, thus enhancing the delivery of tradable services, increasing tourism and knowledge flows and improving attractiveness for business investment. These latter effects can be captured most appropriately by referring to bilateral air traffic data.====Accordingly, we reviewed a number of recent studies using bilateral air traffic data that are more pertinent to this paper. Giroud (2013) uses data from the United States' manufacturing sector to show that new airline routes bring about an increase in investments within firms and an increase in a plant's total factor productivity, while Hovhannisyan and Keller (2015) report a significant positive impact of international business travel from the United States on patenting rates. Fageda (2017), using data on traffic from Barcelona to the rest of the world, shows that the availability of non-stop flights offered at a sufficient frequency increases the amount of foreign direct investment. Finally, Alderighi and Gaggero (2017) show that air transport services positively affect the export business of Italian manufacturers.====Previous studies using bilateral air traffic data analyze the causal relationship between a given measure of the economic links between cities (investments, trade, patenting rates) and the supply of non-stop flights. Furthermore, previous studies focus on the United States or on an individual European country or urban area. Note also that studies using international air travel data are based on country level information.====We use the available data on the total number of passengers for inter-city links, including those passengers that made one stop to reach their final destination. In this regard, city-pair data of investments, trade, employment, patents and so on is not available for a sample that includes cities of different countries. This explains that all studies about the impact of air transportation on some of these specific measures of economic links between cities are made for one single country. For a sample that include cities from several countries, bilateral air traffic –including connecting traffic-is the best available proxy of such economic links.====Indeed, we focus on intercontinental inter-city markets where aviation is the only feasible means to connect these cities, and connecting flights are viable substitutes for non-stop flights. Hence, we can use these data to arrive at a global measure of the economic and social links between the considered cities, including: i) business trips, ii) trips for leisure or visiting friends and relatives, which account for tourism and immigration flows, and iii) the trade of high value products, in relation to their weight, as they are usually transported on commercial passenger flights.====We find that even modest increases of the number of long-haul non-stop flights may lead to significant traffic gains. Thus, the availability of long-haul non-stop flights imply not only a redistribution of traffic from connecting to non-stop traffic, but it also generate new traffic. This result holds for a sample of city-pairs with high levels of indirect connectivity.====However, we also find that the impact of more long-haul non-stop flights on total traffic flows is only clearly relevant when the destination city is located in a high-income country where the proportion of passengers sensitive to time costs should be higher. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the traffic gains of long-haul non-stop flights are due to a reduction in time costs. This is a novel result in relation to previous literature about the economic impact on non-stop flights as we investigate the differential effect that they may have in destinations with different levels of income.====Results of our analysis complement those obtained by Bilotkach (2015) and Cristea and Danila (2017). These two studies, using data at the airport/city level in the United States obtain evidence of a strong economic impact derived from a greater availability of non-stop flights. Our analysis suggests a certain limitation to the positive economic impact of non-stop flights as they are only relevant where income levels are already relatively high.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we explain the empirical equation that we estimate and discuss some econometric issues that we must address. Then, we detail the sample used and provide relevant information about the data used in the empirical analysis. In the following two sections, we show the results of the econometric estimates. First, we examine the impact of long-haul non-stop flights on traffic flows. Second, we examine the differential impact of long-haul non-stop flights according to the income levels of the destination. The last section is devoted to our concluding remarks.","Globalization, long-haul flights and inter-city connections",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012218300522,21 August 2019,2019,Research Article,67.0

We find that, at a given point in time, the fare increases with the number of sold seats. This result largely explains, why the lowest available fare increases as the departure date approaches. No evidence is found in favor of intertemporal price discrimination, probably because of low consumer-heterogeneity throughout the entire booking period that characterizes the long-distance bus market.","A long-distance bus service is a public transport service that carries people by bus between cities. The buses that are used generally make a single stop at one location in (or nearby) a city and travel non-stop over longer distances. For this reason, ==== bus service is also used as a synonym of ==== bus service.====In Europe the long-distance bus service sector has grown steadily during the recent years. One of the prominent European countries in this industry is Germany (Dürr and Hüschelrath, 2017). It is not a coincidence that Flixbus, the current market leader of long-distance bus service in Europe, was founded in Germany in 2011.====Following the market liberalization in January 2013, the German long-distance bus service sector showed an exponential growth in traffic.==== The fast establishment of long-distance bus services in the market of passenger transportation is achieved by providing customers with low-cost travel options in a dispersed network of destinations. After a vibrant introduction phase characterized by tough pricing, fierce competition, mergers and acquisitions, the lead of the market is taken by Flixbus, whose market share in Germany is 95% in 2018 (Statista, 2019b).====From its very beginning, Flixbus rests on the increasing capabilities of digital business models. This is reflected by its web-based selling strategy in which customers book their bus journeys with their mobile phone application or on the company's web page. In this framework, Flixbus can instantaneously track the evolution of sales and can adjust fares over time. Bus travelers may therefore face different prices for the same journey depending on the day of their booking and the utilization of available seat capacity.====The reason for such possible price difference is a profit-maximizing strategy referred to as Revenue Management (RM). Such strategy was first implemented in the airline industry and it is now also adopted by railways, cruise lines, hotel firms, rental car firms, and also by long-distance bus service providers.====The airline RM literature suggests that during the booking period two effects could be in place: the ==== and the ==== (Alderighi et al., 2015). The ==== occurs when, at a given point in time, fares have a stepwise distribution over seats (Dana, 1999a). This means that the first seat on sale is cheaper, or at most equally priced, relative to the second seat on sale, which is cheaper, or at most equally priced, relative to the third seat on sale, and so on. If the capacity effect is in place, we observe an increasing pattern of the lowest available fare as we approach the departure date because the bus fills up day by day and only high-fare tickets remain on sale at the end of the booking period.====The ==== instead is driven by the time dimension and is captured by the day of the booking. The fare variation as the departure date approaches is explained with: ==== the seat's decreasing option value, which pushes the fare down in order to spur the sale of the seat that otherwise run the risk to remain unsold (Alderighi et al., 2017); ==== the price discrimination strategy, which pushes the fare up, especially in the proximity to departure, in order to extract higher surplus from price-insensitive late bookers (Gaggero, 2010). This latter effect is also known as ‘intertemporal price discrimination’ (Gaggero and Piga, 2011).====In this work we investigate the existence of the above described effects in the long-distance bus market using primary fare data from Flixbus on selected one-way bus journeys taking place in one week of September 2017. Fares are collected daily, from 28 days until 1 day before departure, so that it is possible to observe their variation as the departure date approaches.====We apply panel fixed-effects techniques and correct for both endogeneity and sample selection. We find significant evidence in favor of the capacity effect, which largely explains the fare increase as the departure date approaches. This effect is, to some extent, mitigated by the seat's decreasing option value that comes into play during the last week before departure. No evidence is found in favor of intertemporal price discrimination, probably because of the very small number of price-insensitive late booking passengers in the long-distance bus market.====This paper continues as follows.

There are a number of such cases in the real world: bridges and tunnels crossing borders between cities, regions or countries; ports and airports serving users from the areas without those facilities, etc. This paper considers the following scheme for the joint provision of transportation infrastructure: two regions jointly establish an operator for the infrastructure who is responsible for collecting the user charges. The two regions make financial contributions to cover the costs of the infrastructure investment, and the revenue from user charges is distributed according to the share of contribution. Similar practices are found in the real world. For example, the United States and Canada jointly established the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission to finance, construct, and operate the Rainbow Bridge. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is a joint venture between two states to build, operate, and maintain transportation infrastructure throughout the region.==== Other than transportation, there are many voluntary arrangements of cooperation by local governments for public services (e.g., water supply, education, police, and waste), and joint ventures for regional development (e.g., site development for industrial parks).==== Our scheme is applicable to various types of infrastructure that involves user charges.====We examine the performance of joint provision using a simple two-region model in which the transportation demand depends on the capacity and the user charges (e.g., road tolls) of the infrastructure. The government of each region chooses the amount of contribution that maximizes its regional welfare. The sum of the contributions by two regions is spent on investment, thereby determines the capacity of the infrastructure. We consider two cases: first, the infrastructure use is non-rival; second, the infrastructure is congestible. In the non-rival case, a standard result is that the optimal user charge is zero. However, setting a positive level of user charge improves welfare since it encourages contributions from the two governments. We further show that joint provision leads to under- or over-investment in capacity if the revenue is smaller (or greater) than the cost of investment. In the case of congestible infrastructure, joint provision attains the first-best optimum when the operator sets the user charge such that the toll revenue just covers the cost of investment. This is an extension of the well-known self-financing theorem by Mohring and Harwitz (1962). Unlike the original setting in which a single government chooses the capacity based on a benefit-cost criterion, we obtain the result when the capacity is determined by non-cooperative contributions from multiple governments. In this sense, our study is closely related to Brueckner (2015) and De Borger and Proost (2016) .====The structure of the problem addressed in this paper is similar to that in the literature on voluntary provision of public goods (Bergstrom et al. (1986)); Cornes and Sandler (1996); Andreoni (1998); and Batina and Ihori (2005)). Unlike public goods, transportation infrastructures collect user charges, such as road tolls. If users are not charged for the use of infrastructure, our formula for determining the capacity of the infrastructure is equivalent to the formula for voluntary provision of public goods, leading to under-provision. There have been several proposals to induce efficient voluntary provision of public goods (e.g., Falkinger (1996), Morgan (2000), and Zubrickas (2014)). The present paper introduces charging users and using the revenue to reward the contribution of each region.==== We show that user charging gives an incentive to increase the amount of voluntary contribution and results in greater welfare in the case of non-rivalry. Furthermore, if the infrastructure is congestible, joint provision can attain the optimal level of capacity through voluntary contributions.====There is a large body of literature on the pricing and capacity choice of transportation infrastructure in the system of multiple governments (e.g., the review by De Borger and Proost (2012)). Bond (2006) shows that independent decision-making by governments leads to under-investment of infrastructure, and examines the effects of trade liberalization on the incentive to invest. Mun and Nakagawa (2010) consider cross-border transportation infrastructure that consists of two links, each of which is constructed and operated by the government of its territory. They evaluate the effects of alternative pricing and investment policies for the infrastructure on the economic welfare of the two regions. Recently, Xiao et al. (2016), and Verhoef (2017) discuss similar problems to ours in that small number of agents contribute to capacity investment.==== Xiao et al. consider the situation that competing airlines contribute to capacity investments and share airport revenues. Although the model in Xiao et al. incorporates demand uncertainty, the contribution share is treated as an exogenously given parameter. Verhoef (2017) is more closely related to ours in that the amount of contributions is endogenous and the self-financing of optimal capacity result is obtained. His result is strong in that self-financing holds in broader situations in which capacity cost does not exhibit constant returns. Note that government subsidy is required to attain efficiency and self-financing in Verhoef's model. By contrast, the scheme proposed in this paper does not require intervention from a higher level of government, which is particularly useful in the case of international infrastructure for which higher level government does not exist, as in the example of Niagara Falls Bridge. No earlier study deals with the decision whether to participate in the joint provision of transportation infrastructure.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model setting and describes the problem to be considered. In Sections 3 Joint provision of non-rival infrastructure, 4 Congestible infrastructure, we examine the outcome of joint provision for non-rival and congestible cases, respectively.

Using a detailed trip-level data, we estimate extra ","Economists have long understood that traffic congestion is a source of market failure and therefore a social problem. The traditional framework for analyzing the inefficiency cost of traffic congestion is based on Pigou (1920).==== Despite the success of the conceptual Pigouvian framework, empirical estimates of its inefficiency cost are relatively rare. An empirical estimation of the Pigouvian inefficiency cost is challenging, since it requires identification of both the demand and the cost (supply) functions of travel that are hard to empirically conceptualize.====The Pigouvian congestion model itself has also a theoretical drawback, in that it does not treat commuters' trip timing decisions endogenously. A result of this omission is the ==== nature of traffic congestion, which is an oversimplification of the real-world's ==== traffic congestion. The alternative bottleneck model of Vickrey (1969), later formalized in Arnott et al. (1990, 1993), treats the trip timing decision endogenously and has now become the workhorse model for analysis of traffic congestion involving dynamics. The main goal of this paper is to empirically measure the inefficiency cost from traffic congestion defined in the bottleneck model using the sample of commute trips from the workers in the US.====The main insight from the bottleneck model is that for any commute trip, extra travel time over and above ==== free-flow time, which the model calls “queuing time” (or congestion delay), is purely social loss and thus constitutes the society's welfare loss. Using a detailed trip-level dataset of commuters in the US, this paper therefore estimates the queuing time per each average commute trip. From our empirical framework, the estimated average queuing time is the average treatment effect of trip timing choice (involving queuing or no queuing) on travel time. By multiplying our queuing time estimate by the value of time and the number of all commute trips in the US, we can then compute the social cost of congestion.====An identification issue arises because each commute trip's ==== free-flow travel time is not directly observable. For this, we exploit other key result of the model: that a different commuter on the same commute route who alternatively arrived earliest in the morning meets no queue, so her travel time is the free-flow time corresponding to the route. Our econometric model is therefore specified to estimate the expected difference in travel time by binary arrival timing choice, i.e., arrival at a peak time with queuing vs. arrival at an earlier timing with no queuing, conditional on that the commuters under comparison effectively traveled an identical route.====Our key identifying assumption is that travel time of an individual who arrives at a particular timing is determined solely by the characteristics of the route traveled, especially its physical distance, which allows us to focus on conditioning on the route traveled in our estimation. Our basic identifying strategy is to include the direct route characteristic, trip distance, as well as extensive proxy variables for relevant route characteristics and person characteristics related to the choice of commute route in our empirical specification. We then address the potential omitted variable bias concern by alternatively estimating a household-fixed model, which exploits multiple observations on commute trips within household, and employing the instrumental variable estimation strategy.====Our main estimation result indicates that morning commuters who arrived at work at a peak time (between 6:15 and 11:00) traveled on average for about 2 min longer than the other commuters on the same route who alternatively arrived earlier than 6:15. As expected, the queuing time tends to be longer (shorter) for the morning commutes with an arrival time closer to (farther from) the peak time, say 9:00. From the sample of evening commutes, we find that the expected queuing time for each evening commute is about 1.9 min, implying that the average daily queuing time is about 3.9 min, which is about 8% of the sample mean of daily commute time. While this individual inefficiency cost may sound small, aggregation over all workers yields a huge social cost. With some appropriate assumptions, the annual social cost of congestion from all commute trips in the US is computed to be about 29 billion dollars.====We also examine the variation of congestion by city. Specifically, we construct the congestion ranking of large metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) based on our city-specific estimates for the mean queuing time. We then explore the determinants of traffic congestion. We find that residents in a city with a smaller road stock per capita do experience a longer queuing time on average than those in a city with a larger per capita road stock, and that the level of congestion is higher in the city where the demand for vehicle travels is overall higher.====This paper also provides a quantification of a practically implementable congestion toll policy. The optimal policy in the bottleneck model is imposition of a time-varying congestion toll. The model predicts that the optimal toll would eliminate all the queues by inducing reschedule of departures, which would then recover all the welfare loss estimated in this paper. This paper makes a meaningful start toward an empirical quantification of such toll by estimating the queuing time profile, specifically the expected queuing time as a function of arrival time, for each group of commuters in a same city and a same trip distance.====The empirical literature on the cost of congestion usually estimates the relationship between the inverse of travel speed (i.e., trip cost) and the traffic density, which in the Pigouvian framework is the cost (supply) function of travel, using traffic data on particular road segments (e.g., Walters, 1961; Dewees, 1979; Fosgerau and Small, 2012). The main estimand in these studies is the marginal external congestion cost that is then used to gauge the Pigouvian congestion toll. A more recent paper by Li et al. (2018) estimates the cost function of travel for an entire city, Beijing, using a larger number of road segments in the city. Since traffic density is endogenous, they use a driving restriction policy as an exogenous variation (instrument) for traffic density. A limitation of these studies is that since the demand function of travel is not explicitly estimated, either computation of the Pigouvian deadweight loss is missing or computation of it relies on their assumption on the demand function. Moreover, traffic data used in these studies do not fully capture the traveler's congestion delays that occur over her whole travel route.====Other studies use trip-level datasets for estimation of the congestion cost. For example, Couture et al. (2018) estimate the speed-distance relationship that holds at the trip level and then construct each city's speed index, which allow them to identify the city-level supply function of travel. However, their Pigouvian deadweight loss is computed still without an explicitly estimated demand function. Akbar and Duranton (2017) is the first study that explicitly estimates the demand function of travel as well as the supply function of travel. They use a counterfactual travel data generated from Google Maps as well as a survey data on actual trips, which together allow them to identify the demand function of travel in a single city, Bogota, Columbia.====Rather than using the Pigouvian framework, which is common in these earlier studies, this paper uses arguably a more detailed microeconomic model of Vickrey (1969) to empirically estimate the social cost of congestion. We do not need to estimate the demand function of travel that is empirically challenging, nor the marginal external congestion cost, although our estimation still allows us to indirectly quantify the marginal external congestion cost. Our approach is to directly estimate the inefficiency cost for each commute trip, which is more intuitive and practically more feasible. Our method can be applied to estimation of the inefficiency cost of congestion measured at route, city, and country levels.====Our paper also adds to the empirical literature on the bottleneck model. Small (1982) estimates a discrete choice model of trip timing decisions to estimate the key scheduling preference parameters for particular commuters with a common official work-start time. Hall (2018a) extends Small's work by explicitly estimating the distribution of heterogeneous preference parameters and simulating the welfare effect of congestion tolling. Kreindler (2017) uses a more detailed dataset collected from a new smartphone app and implements a randomized experiment of toll charges to identify the preference parameters and calculate the welfare effect of tolling. Rather than aiming at uncovering the scheduling parameters using a structural framework, this paper employs a reduced-form econometric approach to directly estimate the inefficiency cost of congestion defined in the bottleneck model. This paper therefore adds to the growing broad empirical literature on the cost of traffic congestion (e.g., Sabir et al., 2011; Anderson and Davis, 2018; Bento et al., 2017; Molnar and Mangrum, 2017).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our conceptual and the empirical framework. Section 3 explains our dataset. Section 4 reports our estimation results. In Section 5, we investigate the variation in congestion and the determinants of congestion. In Section 6, we quantify the optimal congestion toll.

The effect of incentive intensity is estimated, showing that the power of incentive schemes improve performance as measured by the number of infrastructure failures. In addition, we show that the structure of the performance incentive schemes has resulted in a reallocation of effort from failures not causing train delays to failures causing train delays, with a substantial increase in the former type of failures. This signals a deteriorating asset condition, which highlights the need to consider the long-term effects of this incentive structure. Overall, this work shows that the design of the incentive structures has a large impact on the performance of maintenance, and that the estimated effects are important to consider when assessing contract designs within this field.","Government agencies often procure goods and services instead of producing it in-house. This procurement accounts for a significant part of national economies, with estimates at 12 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in OECD countries (OECD, 2017). Cutting costs and improving quality are frequently stated goals when introducing competitive tendering and contracting of services previously offered by a state-owned monopoly. However, careful contract design is required in order to achieve the goals of such reform, with appropriate specification and monitoring of quality along with incentive schemes to deal with moral hazard and adverse selection. Whether or not different contract designs have the desired effects needs to be tested empirically, both for policy reasons and to assess if theoretic arguments for certain designs are valid in the current case.====This paper contributes to this line of research by studying the incentive structures in railway maintenance contracts in Sweden, and their impact on the frequency of infrastructure failures. More specifically, the purpose with this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the effect of incentive intensity on the frequency of failures as well as the effect of tilted performance incentive schemes, where the latter differentiate between failures causing train delays and failures not causing train delays.====Sweden chose to gradually expose its maintenance of railways to competitive tendering in 2002. One objective of the transfer from in-house to tendered production of rail maintenance was to provide scope for innovation (Banverket, 2000). To do so, firms (contractors) are given degrees of freedom by the contracts: most of the maintenance contracts are said to be outcome or performance based,==== meaning that the contractor is not told exactly which (or the level of) activities that are to be carried out. A fixed payment is received by the contractor who needs to meet a set of requirements with respect to the quality of maintenance. The purpose is to give the contractor an incentive to develop the maintenance production. We are therefore in a second-best situation where the client (the IM) can (and has in this case chosen to) observe the outcome rather than prescribing the input. This can, however, create a moral hazard situation as the contractor's actions may not be optimal for the client. In addition, the contractor can obtain a higher rent when information about its efficiency (technology) is not known to the client, which is the problem of adverse selection. This asymmetry in information means that the client has to make a trade-off between inducing effort (via fixed price contracts) and extracting rent from the contractor (via cost-plus contracts); the power of the incentive scheme is a central parameter in this trade-off (Laffont and Tirole, 1986).====The maintenance contracts in Sweden have an incentive scheme with a varying power, which comes in the form of different reimbursement rules for the contractors with respect to infrastructure failures. In short, the fixed payment for the (expected number of) activities required when an infrastructure failure occurs is not completely fixed due to the reimbursement rule. Depending on the level used for this rule, the contractors are either reimbursed for a large share of the cost of rectifying a failure, or they need to cover most of their expenses from the fixed payment (this is further described in section 2). Importantly, differences in this reimbursement rule imply varying incentives to prevent infrastructure failures from occurring. When designing the future maintenance contracts, it is useful to know whether this incentive scheme has an effect or not, and if there is an effect: What is the impact of a change in the power of the incentive scheme?====The fixed payment to the contractors is also connected to a performance incentive scheme, in which the contractor receives an award and/or penalty for its performance. Here we can note that a contractor will make a trade-off between different tasks within a project if these are rewarded differently and the tasks are substitutes; see for example the seminal paper by Holmström and Milgrom (1991). Indeed, the performance incentive schemes in the maintenance contracts in Sweden are tilted, which can affect the attention to different tasks and consequently the outcome of the project. Considering that train delays are costly to society, this tilted structure of the performance incentive scheme is expected. However, one needs to ask whether it is has the desired effect or not, and what are the costs and benefits of the effect? Estimating the performance scheme's impact on the number of train delaying failures viz-à-viz other failures (not causing train delays) is a first important step in this analysis.====The theoretic work on contracts and information asymmetry in the principal-agent framework is extensive (for textbook treatments, see for example Laffont and Tirole, 1993, Laffont and Martimort, 2002 and Salanié, 2005). Wunsch (1994) is an early example of an empirical study on contract design within the field of procurement and regulation, where menus of linear contracts are calibrated for transit firms. Gagnepain and Ivaldi (2002) study the regulatory schemes for French urban transport and compare these to the optimal policies, while Roy and Yvrande-Billon (2007) use the same study object (in a different time period) to estimate differences in technical efficiency between regulatory schemes and fixed-price and cost-plus contracts. Other examples within the transport field are the study by Dalen and Gómez-Lobo (2003) - showing that high-powered incentive schemes reduce operating costs for bus companies in Norway - and the study by Piacenza (2006) with similar results for Italian public transport.====To the author's knowledge, an econometric test of the effect of incentive intensity has not been made in the field of rail infrastructure management. Nonetheless, Vickerman (2004) provides an exploration of incentives in transport infrastructure maintenance, and a case study on incentives in rail maintenance contracts is made by Stenbeck (2008). Moreover, studies on the power of incentive schemes in procurement and regulation usually compare different types of contracts (for example fixed-price contracts compared to cost-plus contracts). We can however make use of the variation in the incentive intensity in the cost-reimbursement contracts that are used for railway maintenance services in Sweden. This enables an estimation of the effect of incentive intensity within the same contract type.====There is a wide literature on the effects of performance payments; see for example Lazear and Oyer (2013) for a review of theories and empirical findings on incentives and performance (among other topics) in personnel economics.==== A recent study on procurement and performance incentives is made by Lewis and Bajari (2014), showing that penalties induced effort in high-way construction contracts (with welfare improvements and low contractor costs according to simulations). Our study adds to this literature by estimating the effects of performance incentives in rail infrastructure management, focusing on the reallocation of efforts from one type of failure to another.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the main ingredients of the railway maintenance contracts, and the related research questions of the paper. A description of the data is provided in section 3. The models to be estimated and the estimation method are presented in section 4. The results are presented in section 5, followed by a discussion of our findings in section 6.

Outcomes are compared to a surplus-maximizing level of public good provision. We show that both co-financing and lobbying raise the amount of public good provided. Co-financing and lobbying are substitutes. Co-financing (or co-financing combined with lobbying) raises the provision of the public good to a higher level than lobbying alone. Co-financing can thus reduce rent-seeking. Finally, we show that under uncertainty about district type (high or low benefit), co-financing combined with lobbying can be used to find and retain a separating equilibrium.","Co-financing can have many meanings. Co-financing of transport infrastructure projects by private or local actors has been suggested as a possible remedy for the unreliability of the cost-benefit analyses (CBA) that usually precede such projects. According to this view, co-financing private actors have an incentive to make a more reliable CBA and their willingness to co-finance can therefore add to information about a project's profitability and possibly stop the building of essentially unprofitable or risky projects (Flyvbjerg, 2009). Private co-financing has also been mentioned as a possible way of augmenting limited government budgets (Roll and Verbeke, 1998; de Bettignies and Ross, 2009).====An alternative interpretation of co-financing is the possibility to augment local financing with central governmental funds. This can function either through matching grants, where the central government matches the local government's outlays in some proportion (Kirschke et al., 2006; Feld and Schaltegger, 2005),==== or on an informal level, through the flypaper effect (Hamilton, 1983; Hines and Thaler, 1995; Inman, 2016; Leduc and Wilson, 2017; Becker, 1996). The flypaper effect results when a dollar of exogenous grants-in-aid leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income (Inman, 2016).====In Sweden, which serves as a background for this paper, co-financing has come to signify a third type, namely ==== co-financing, principally by local governments, of public good provision that is traditionally the preserve of the central government. This form of co-financing differs from those discussed in the literature in that 1) it is the ==== government that co-finances the central one and not vice versa, and 2) it formalizes, through written contracts, something of the flypaper impact, i.e., that central government funds are augmented with local funding, so that a dollar of central government spending adds up to more.====The aim of the present paper is to build a formalized model of voluntary co-financing to better understand the mechanisms behind how it influences central government decision making, especially compared to more traditional lobbying. The background to the paper are three empirical studies into how transport infrastructure projects are chosen to be included in National Transport Infrastructure Plans in Sweden, namely Jussila Hammes (2013, 2015) and Jussila Hammes and Nilsson (2016). All three studies show that co-financing influences positively the probability of an object being included in the Plan, or the amount of infrastructure investment funds going to a given municipality. Jussila Hammes (2013) and Jussila Hammes and Nilsson (2016) moreover include measures of industry lobbying in the model. While the former finds some support for this having increased the probability of a project being included in the Plan, the latter finds no such effect. None of the papers includes a formalized model of how co-financing increases a project's probability of inclusion in the plan, or the investment volume in the municipalities, however. Instead, they conjecture that the mechanism works through the municipalities' use of co-financing as a means for lobbying the central government, which makes the ultimate decision. The contribution of this paper is to separate the lobbying effect from the co-financing effect, and in doing so to understand the rationale behind the co-financing process and its impacts better.====Of particular interest to the present paper is how voluntary co-financing relates to lobbying, i.e., can co-financing substitute lobbying or enhance the impact of lobbying. For instance, both Jussila Hammes (2013) and Jussila Hammes and Nilsson (2016) assume that co-financing and lobbying are mutually reinforcing; the municipalities co-finance and industry lobbies. In the present paper, we do not include industry in the model but assume that a municipality can choose either to co-finance or lobby, or both. Testing this proposition empirically would be very difficult because of paucity of data about municipality lobbying (for some examples of how Swedish regions work to influence central government decision-making, see the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (2018)). The question can be studied theoretically, however. We show, among other things, that both lobbying and co-financing raise the supply of the public good, but that co-financing tends to raise it more than lobbying alone. Co-financing can therefore reduce rent-seeking. Finally, we extend the model to include information asymmetries, which offer one explanation for how co-financing and lobbying can work together to ascertain a socially optimal outcome of public good provision.====Over the period 2010–2013, the central government of Sweden received 4.1 billion SEK from local governments in co-financing of national transport infrastructure projects.==== The planned co-financing in 2013 and thereafter was 9.4 billion SEK in total. These funds originated from the National Transport Infrastructure Plan for 2010–2021. Twenty-nine percent of the co-financing went to investments in roads, 19% to roads and railroads, 50% to railroads only, and 2% to sea lanes. (Swedish Agency for Public Management, 2014). Anecdotal evidence indicates that co-financing of the same type as used in Sweden was also used in the financing of the recent extension of the metro line in Helsinki, Finland, i.e., the project was decided upon at the central government level, and the central government provided most of the investment funds, but the municipalities involved co-financed the project. Recently, the main use of co-financing in Sweden has occurred within the National Negotiation on Housing and Infrastructure, which aims both at ensuring the construction of a high-speed rail link between the three major Swedish cities, and increasing construction of housing and public transportation infrastructure.====The paper is organized as follows: In the next section we set up the basic model. In Section 3 we study the incentives districts have to co-finance and lobby the central government, studying first a district's incentives to lobby and to co-finance separately, and then solving for the political equilibrium. We end Section 3 with a discussion about the effects of utility spill-overs between the districts and of how a central government budget constraint influences the provision of the public good in the presence of co-financing and lobbying. In Section 4, we turn to the question of the impact of asymmetric information. The final section discusses the results and concludes the paper.",Local government co-financing of the central government's transport infrastructure investment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221201221830056X,2 April 2019,2019,Research Article,72.0

We apply an accessibility index derived from a multi-modal transport model. This is a more accurate measure of agglomeration than those previously used and also necessary for understanding how governments can impact agglomeration, and thereby productivity, by transport investments. We regress temporal changes in wages on temporal changes in agglomeration by applying a ","Many countries spend substantial public resources on road and rail investments. A recurrent argument used by those favoring spending on transport infrastructure is its positive effects on agglomeration and productivity. There is also a growing number of empirical studies identifying agglomeration effects on productivity (for reviews, see Combes and Gobillon (2015), Melo et al. (2013), Melo et al. (2009), and Rosenthal and Strange (2008)). However, these studies do not in general explicitly consider the transport system and are therefore less helpful in advising governments on how to impact agglomeration by transport system improvements. This paper contributes to the literature by estimating to what extent the Government increased agglomeration by transport system improvements, and the resulting effect on productivity, in mid-Sweden including the greater Stockholm metropolitan area in the period 1995–2006.====The vast majority of studies on the returns to agglomeration use density measures based on distance, and only a few use simple measures based on travel time.==== However, as pointed out by Glaeser and Kahn (2004), it is not agglomeration per se that generates benefits. It is the number of jobs that can be reached within a given travel time that is relevant for the generation of agglomeration benefits. Glaeser and Kahn further point out that agglomeration advantages seem to be as large in sprawling cities like Silicon Valley as in the denser downtowns like Detroit, which is not surprising given that it is the travel time with any mode of transport that should be relevant for the returns to agglomeration. Clearly, when travel time is entered into measures of agglomeration, the transport system plays a key role. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by measuring agglomeration more accurately than previous studies. Our measure takes into account travel times and pecuniary travel cost for all travel modes and the traveler's preferences for different modes and travel time components. These are derived from a multi-modal transport model. Our accessibility index also takes employment into account, such that it measures the effective labor market density. This is essential not only for measuring agglomeration accurately, but also for analyzing the impact on agglomeration and productivity of transport system improvements.====Graham and van Dender (2011) argue that measures of agglomeration based on travel times would impose endogeneity problems because locations with higher economic activity tend to be congested. However, one contribution of this study is that our accessibility measure controls for such endogeneity: our measure of agglomeration is constructed such that it only picks up changes in travel times resulting from transport system improvements and not changes in congestion levels arising from changes in job and population densities.====We use data on travel time changes arising from small and large transport system improvements for all modes, combined with employee-establishment-linked micro data, including wage earnings and other socio-economic characteristics, for two points in time, 1995 and 2006. Like Gibbons et al. (2017) and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), our data includes detailed geographic information on economic activity for all workers, including the coordinates of the place of residence and the place of employment (establishment). Hence, our measure of agglomeration accounts for the local spatial dimension of the agglomeration, following for example Rosenthal and Strange (2003) and Desmet and Fafchamps (2005), as suggested by Holl (2011, p. 20). We regress temporal changes in wage earnings on temporal changes in agglomeration defined as accessibility. We use wage earnings to measure productivity.==== The estimator controls for time-invariant individual fixed effects (following, e.g., Glaeser and Mare (2001) and thereby takes care of most of the endogeneity, including spatial sorting of workers.====We deal with possible time-varying unobserved variables and remaining endogeneity by using an instrument based on changes in agglomeration over time arising from the transport system improvements only. Clearly, changes in employment levels are endogenous to wage changes. However, and as discussed in Section 3.3, there are strong reasons to believe that transport system improvements are exogenous. Our instrumental variable (IV) is thus based on temporal changes rather than on historical levels, e.g. population density or total population (Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Combes et al., 2008; Matano and Naticchioni, 2012; Mion, 2004; Mion and Naticchioni, 2005; Rice et al., 2006), geography such as the total land area (Ciccone, 2002; Ciccone and Hall, 1996; Combes et al., 2008; Hanson, 2005; Mion, 2004; Mion and Naticchioni, 2005; Redding and Venables, 2004; Rice et al., 2006)) or geology (Combes et al., 2010; Di Addario and Patacchini, 2008; Håkansson and Isacsson, 2018; Rosenthal and Strange, 2008, 2004).==== Graham and van Dender (2011) conclude that the literature in general gives little support for the validity of level instruments based on history and geology. Combes et al. (2011) note that level instruments based on history, geology or geography are weak when estimating the returns to agglomeration within one metropolitan area, which is the purpose of this paper, as opposed to most of the previous studies working on the metropolitan scale (examples are Foster and Stehrer (2009), Brülhart and Mathys (2008), Marrocu et al. (2013), Wheeler (2006), and Yankow (2006)).====Our identification strategy resembles the one applied by Gibbons et al. (2017), using changes in the free-flow car travel times to identify the causal effect on productivity. Like Gibbons et al. we assume that the local changes in accessibility induced by transport improvements are exogenous. However, as opposed to Gibbons et al., we focus on all modes, and the traveler's actual preferences for these, and not only free-flow travel times by car. We still control for temporal changes in congestion level that could induce endogeneity. Taking all modes into account is key, since most travelers in many dense areas are in fact using public transport and since the free-flow car travel time is often far from the true car travel time facing the travelers. Furthermore, we use information on individuals' wage earnings and wages as the outcome variable rather than plant level information on productivity and other measures of plant performance. Our study also differs from Gibbons et al. in that we use the temporal changes in the transport system as an instrumental variable.====The contribution of this paper to the existing literature is two-fold. First, we compute the changes in accessibility arising from small and large transport improvements by all modes and the traveler's preferences for these. Moreover, we take into account that accessibility changes over time for two reasons: because the spatial distribution of jobs changes and because transport system improvements reduce travel times by all modes. Second, we use an instrumental variable based on the temporal changes in accessibility arising from transport improvements only. Furthermore, we show that it may not be sufficient to control for pre-treatment levels of employment in the construction of the instrument, since these may be correlated with temporal changes in the error term of the wage earnings equation.====There are several recent studies estimating the effect of transport infrastructure in China and India. Analyzing Chinese cities from 1990 to 2010, Baum-Snow et al. (2017) show that infrastructure investments have had a substantial impact on the urban form and on some types of economic activities. Faber (2014) shows that China's National Trunk Highway System has led to a reduction in GDP growth for counties in the periphery, left outside of the system. Donaldson (forthcoming) finds that India's vast railroad network enhanced trade and welfare in the regions accessing the railroad network, but harmed those without access. However, like many metropolitan areas in the west, the Stockholm region has a more mature and well-developed transport system, in relation to its population, than most metropolitan areas in China and India have. We therefore expect the impact of transport system improvements to be smaller in our study than in the studies from China and India.====Even if the literature on agglomeration advantages focuses on the proximity between jobs, Eliasson and Fosgerau (2019) point out that also lowering the generalized commuting costs can increase wage earnings due to agglomeration advantages (higher job matching quality) and increases in labor supply. Because of the high relevance for transport cost-benefit analysis (CBA), we estimate the impact on wage earnings of lower commuting costs. We therefore apply two measures of agglomeration: the first pertains to proximity between jobs and the second pertains to proximity between workers and jobs.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe our measures of agglomeration. In section 3, we present the empirical models and outline some of the identification problems and how we have tackled them.

Overall, the estimation results suggest that slot restrictions limit the effect of competition on airfare.","This paper investigates the impact of slot restriction as a determinant of scarcity rent, (i.e., markup on fares resulting from airport capacity shortages). Scarcity rent can arise at capacity-constrained airports when airport charges (e.g., landing fees) are lower than the market clearing price at which the level of demand would be in balance with the airport capacity that is available. In reality, it is widely believed that many congested airports charge carriers less than the market clearing price, and many carriers are taking advantage of this situation. Indeed, it is assumed that carriers often maintain their fares at the highest level the market will bear and make excess profits by exploiting the scarce airport slots (Starkie, 1998; Burghouwt et al., 2017). The scarcity rent is, therefore, transferred to carriers, not to passengers.====The effect of entry barriers, including airport slots, on scarcity rent has been studied extensively (Abramowitz and Brown, 1993; Borenstein, 1989; Ciliberto and Williams, 2010; Dresner et al., 2002; Evans and Kessides, 1993; Gayle and Wu, 2013; Morrison, 2001; Peteraf and Reed, 1994; Snider and Williams, 2015; Van Dender, 2007). However, no previous study has explicitly examined the effects of slot restrictions on airfare. Indeed, most previous studies that ran reduced-form fare regressions used slot-controlled airport dummies to identify the presence and magnitude of scarcity rents at slot-restricted airports. Unfortunately, this approach could not fully differentiate slot-specific effects from unobserved airport-fixed effects on airfares because slot restrictions remained in effect at slot-restricted airports during all of the periods that these studies covered. This paper estimates the specific effects of slot restrictions on airfare by taking advantage of an exogenous regulatory change (i.e., the removal of slots at Newark Airport in October 2016).====I use a difference-in-differences strategy with and without propensity score matching or weighting methods to estimate the impact of the elimination of slot restrictions at Newark Airport on airfare. The data are carrier-route-level quarterly unbalanced panel data that are constructed from the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) data provided by the US Department of Transportation (US DOT) for the period between the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017, which includes three quarters before and after the slot removal at Newark Airport. The treatment group is comprised of routes to or from Newark Airport, and the control group consists of routes to or from the two other New York-area airports—John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia—both of which were slot-controlled during the analysis period.====The base estimation results suggest that the average fare on routes to or from Newark Airport decreased by about 2.5–2.6% in comparison to the average fare on routes to or from the two other slot-controlled New York airports after the elimination of slot controls at Newark Airport. The estimation results from the modified model suggest that the key driver lowering fares on routes to or from Newark Airport after the slot elimination was carriers other than the dominant carrier at Newark Airport. Also, the results of estimation from a quantile regression approach suggest that the dominant carrier, United Airlines, may have been able to take advantage of its dominant position at Newark Airport and charge a premium ticket price on relatively low-fare routes even after the slot removal. More specifically, the estimates from subsamples suggest that facing competitive threats from other carriers, United Airlines has been employing a mixed strategy: (i) making price cuts to undercut aggressive price reductions by other carriers on competitive routes, but simultaneously (ii) charging a premium ticket price on relatively short-distance and low-fare routes and (iii) taking advantage of a lower price elasticity of air travel demand among passengers in comparatively higher income localities irrespective of route distance.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the results of previous studies. Section 3 provides some background on slot restrictions at US airports, especially those in the New York area. Section 4 describes the estimation models, methods, and data that were used. Section 5 reports the estimation results and robustness checks, followed by a discussion in Section 6. Section 7 concludes with some policy implications of the analysis.

For example, in his seminal work on renegotiations Guasch (2004) found that incoming administrations tend to renegotiate the contracts signed by previous administrations to adjust policy priorities and avoid political costs (e.g. increasing tolls). More recently, Aguirre (Aguirre et al., 2015) found that Peruvian transport PPPs are renegotiated with higher frequency during election years. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the incentives that prompt governments to renegotiate PPPs in equilibrium. We show that a basic feature of the political cycle—the current government may be replaced by a different administration—, the long horizon of PPP contracts, which span several administrations, and the off-balance sheet treatment of PPPs combine to endogenously produce PPP renegotiations as an equilibrium outcome. Somewhat surprisingly, the current government (referred to as ‘incumbent’ in what follows) wants to bring forward infrastructure spending even when it does not affect the probability of reelection.====It is important to understand what drives renegotiations because in the last three decades PPPs have spread to become an accepted means to procure public infrastructure. For example, in Europe PPP investment rose from almost zero in 1990 to almost €30 bn in 2006 (before falling by one third in the aftermath of the financial crisis; see (Engel et al., 2014b)). Similarly, in low and middle income countries, PPP investments rose from less than $20 bn p.a. in the early 1990s to between $50 bn and $90 bn p.a. in recent years (see (Engel et al., 2014b)). As Engel et al. (2014a) show, nearly three quarters of PPP investment is spent in transport infrastructure— mostly highways, but also bridges, tunnels, railways, airports, and seaports.====The promise of PPPs is that private firms will deliver better transport infrastructure faster and at lower cost than conventional provision. It is claimed that these efficiency gains stem from bundling the design, financing, construction and operation of transportation projects in long-term contracts.==== With bundling, concessionaires optimize intertemporally over several decades to minimize life-cycle costs.==== Indeed, in a recent paper, Valero (2015) shows that the ability of governments to pre commit to a long-term contract is necessary to ensure the realization of the efficiency gains that PPPs promise. In addition, when quality of service is contractible, as is the case of highways, a PPP will lead to better maintenance. Nevertheless, it is well known that PPPs tend to be routinely renegotiated and that renegotiations may dilute the incentives that prompt concessionaires to deliver better performance.====Of course, occasional contractual adjustments are to be expected in any 20 or 30 year contract, as demand, network configuration and standards of service change.,==== However, renegotiations of PPP contracts are very frequent and many occur even before projects are completed. An early and influential study by Guasch (2004), which examined over a thousand Latin American concessions, found that over 30% of contracts were renegotiated (54.4% in the case of roads), often favoring the private party.==== Similarly, below we examine 59 highway PPPs in Colombia, Peru and Chile and find more than 500 renegotiations. The data shows that on average, 9.5 percent of the initial investment was renegotiated in Colombia every year, 3.6 percent in Peru, and 1.3 percent in Chile.==== This suggests that renegotiations are not accidents, but an equilibrium outcome of the incentive structure in place.====In this paper we study the incentive structure that delivers protracted renegotiations. Our model builds from three well-known facts. One is that administrations are routinely replaced. Second, standard accounting conventions allow governments to keep most PPP investments agreed in renegotiations off-balance sheet. Last, concessionaires finance a PPP project under a long term contract that spans several administrations.====We show that these three facts interact to produce renegotiations in equilibrium. First, the possibility of being replaced increases the effective discount rate of the incumbent (see Alesina and Tabellini (1990)). Therefore, an incumbent values the future less than the social planner and wants to anticipate spending. Second, because fiscal accounting rules keep PPPs off balance sheet, the incumbent can renegotiate the PPP contract to increase current infrastructure spending. Last, the concessionaire is willing to renegotiate the contract because he is backed by a long-term contract which is binding on future administrations.====The mechanism we describe works independently from the way a PPP is funded. If the concessionaire receives availability payments (as is the case, for example, with many highways in Europe), renegotiated payments will be borne by future administrations and constrain their ability to spend. If, on the other hand, the infrastructure is funded with tolls, future governments will forego revenues (see Engel et al. (2013)). Whatever the funding source, the incumbent can exchange resources that would have been available to future administrations for current infrastructure spending by the concessionaire. In essence, therefore, in a renegotiation the concessionaire lends to the incumbent in exchange for payments by future administrations. The incumbent's commitment is credible because the concessionaire has a long-term contract with the government, not only with the incumbent administration.====Our model has four additional observable implications that are consistent with observed facts. First, under competitive bidding, firms bid below costs, in the expectation of renegotiating the contract (a behavior sometimes labeled “lowballing”). A common interpretation is that firms overbid because they are victims of the Winner's Curse.==== However, Athias and Nunez, 2008, Athias and Nunez, 2009 and Athias et al. (2015) show that the “curse” is larger under weaker institutional frameworks, where it is easier to renegotiate contracts. Our equilibrium analysis is consistent with this empirical regularity, and suggests that lowballing is an endogenous means to compete for ex post rents obtained in renegotiations.====Second, our model suggests that renegotiations will occur early in the concession contract, both because concessionaires want to renegotiate their low bids and because the incumbent wants to bring forward infrastructure spending. Indeed, in the data we examine the average time between the award of a concession and the first renegotiation was 0.9 years in Colombia, 1.4 years in Peru and 2.7 years in Chile, and more than 45% of the amounts were renegotiated during construction. Third, and related, in actual renegotiations, concessionaires get paid more for the original project and are often asked to add investments. Last, a large part of the renegotiated amounts are disbursed by future administrations. Indeed, we find that in Colombia, Peru and Chile at least 60 percent of the renegotiated amount will be disbursed by future administrations.====Our model has implications that are useful to design transport PPP contracts and programs. One is that ex ante limits on PPP spending are ineffective to prevent the incumbent from bringing forward infrastructure spending, because incumbents can use renegotiations to elude them. Indeed, to make the point, in our model we assume that initial spending in PPPs must undergo the same scrutiny as regular government spending. Despite this extreme and rather unrealistic assumption, renegotiations are sufficient to elude ex ante spending limits.====Similarly, forcing competitive bidding for additional investments agreed in the renegotiation, a practice that some countries have adopted, might be desirable in and of itself, but is ineffective to stem the ability of the government to shift costs onto future administrations via renegotiations. Indeed, our analysis shows that when concessionaires compete ex ante for the PPP contract, any reduction in the ex post rent of the concessionaire wrought by competition only reduces lowballing in the ex-ante auction, but does not reduce the incumbent's total infrastructure spending.====Perhaps more important, our analysis shows that poor accounting is a weakness of PPPs relative to conventional infrastructure provision. Compared with PPPs, conventional provision is less vulnerable to incumbents brining forward infrastructure spending because transport infrastructure projects that are financed with budget appropriations must pass through the standard budgetary process. Moreover, to spend more in a project the incumbent must either reassign funds or go through the budgetary process. And in any case, the scope for an intertemporal transfer is more limited, because the contractual relationship between the builder and the government ends once the project is built.====At the same time, bringing forward spending is not inherent to PPPs, but an equilibrium outcome enabled by poor fiscal accounting. Indeed, conventional provision would have no advantage if PPP investments and all its associated obligations, including renegotiations, would be counted as current investment in the fiscal budget and subject to the same oversight as other budgetary items. For example, in the early 1980s the UK introduced the so-called Ryrie rules, which did exactly that (only to abandon them a decade later when the Maastricht agreements limited public investment).====We contribute to an extensive literature of renegotiation in PPP contracts. As we have already said, the first comprehensive empirical study of renegotiations of PPPs is Guasch (2004), who analyzed more than 1.000 concession contracts in Latin America and established several stylized facts. Several theoretical and empirical papers followed. Guasch et al. (2006) and Guasch and Straub (2006) developed a theory of the determinants of renegotiations. Guasch et al. (2007) and later Bitrán et al. (2013) applied the theory empirically to quantify the determinants of government-led renegotiations in Latin America. Guasch et al. (2008) empirically studied renegotiations in transport and water in Latin America.==== We complement this literature by explaining why and how renegotiations emerge in equilibrium and by exploring several additional observable implications of this mechanics.====Our model stresses the importance of the political cycle in PPPs and shows that incumbent administrations want to spend even more and inefficiently if new infrastructure increases their probability of reelection. Indeed, as we already said, Aguirre (Aguirre et al., 2015) found that Peruvian transport PPPs are renegotiated with higher frequency during election years. But we go beyond elections by showing that the mere fact that incumbent administrations exit power with positive probability and discount the future at higher rates than society is sufficient to prompt them to renegotiate and bring forward spending in infrastructure. Therefore, incumbent administrations will use renegotiations to bring forward infrastructure spending even if doing so does not increase the probability of reelection. Indeed, this is consistent with the models of government-led renegotiation where incumbent administrations also renegotiate in the aftermath of the election that brought them to power in Guasch et al. (2006), Guasch and Straub (2006) and Guasch et al. (2007).====Our paper is also related to the literature on the fiscal impact of PPPs and government spending limits. On the theoretical side, Maskin and Tirole (2008) study a model where a public official selects projects developed and operated by private contractors. The official's choice among projects is biased by ideology or pandering to special interests and spending limits moderate the inclination of the official to understate the cost of his pet projects. In our model, by contrast, the government uses PPP renegotiations to elude the spending limits normally imposed by the fiscal budget. In addition, on the policy side, we contribute to the literature that discusses how PPPs should be accounted for in the fiscal budget (see Hemming and Staff (2008) and Irwin (2007)). We add to this literature by showing that renegotiations in PPPs are an equilibrium outcome, allowed by the fact that PPP renegotiations are excluded from the fiscal budget.==== While there is still no agreement on whether and how to count PPPs in the fiscal budget (see, for example, Heald (1997), Grimsey and Lewis (2002) and Donaguhue (2002), our conclusion is that renegotiated amounts should be counted as government investment.====Last, we also contribute and complement the literature that studies the drivers of renegotiations in PPPs. Engel et al. (2003) and Athias and Saussier (2010) study the tradeoff between commitment and flexibility, while Brux (2010) shows that renegotiations increase value when parties value their long-term relationships. Guasch and Straub (2009) analyze the link between corruption and renegotiations and Estache et al. (2009) show that multidimensional auctions are renegotiated more often.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical model and obtains the main results. Section 3 discusses the implications for fiscal accounting. Section 4 describes the evidence arising from a database of renegotiations of PPPs in Chile, Colombia and Peru which was compiled by Bitrán et al. (2013).

The interplay between two government policies, installation of sensors and ==== parking, is studied. When parking is congested and the uniform price is optimal, installation of sensors raises the price, increases turnover of parking. If price discrimination is considered, sensored parking should be cheaper than non-sensored. To achieve optimal search of vacant parking, it is sufficient to equip only a fraction of parking with sensors. Underpriced parking may dampen the sensor installation incentive, relative to the incentive to build extra parking. Nevertheless, in absolute terms the sensor installation incentive is substantial even with free parking.","Parking occupancy sensors (sensors henceforth) are small devices built into the surface of automobile parking bays. Their function is to detect the presence of a vehicle in that bay and to live-feed the information, wirelessly, to the motorists searching for parking. Such information makes the search for parking more directed and thereby decreases the search time, pollution, accidents, and traffic.====The sensor technology, however, is not free. For example, San Francisco's SFPark, a project that deployed over 5000 sensors throughout the city center, required about $330 for each sensor to be installed. Barcelona's Urbiotica cost was between $200 and $400 per sensor to install (Ross (2011)). Management of sensors is difficult, too. Because sensors identify automobiles from the magnetic field of the latter, the signal supplied by the sensors may be noisy in the presence of other magnetic fields. Multiple agencies serving the streets must be instructed about proper handling of the sensors; SFPark reports some sensors being paved over by uninformed contractors. Because most sensors are wireless, periodic battery replacement is necessary. Overall, SFPark estimates the running cost to be $10 per sensor per month.==== It is therefore important to understand the economics of parking sensor installation, which is the primary focus of this paper.====Specifically, the paper analyzes the interplay between two government policies: installation of parking sensors and pricing parking. While the latter problem has been extensively discussed in many studies, it has always focused either on homogenous supply of parking (as in Glazer and Niskanen (1992); Arnott and Inci (2010); Zakharenko (2016)) or on exogenous heterogeneity of parking supply (Anderson and de Palma (2004); Kobus et al. (2013); Inci and Lindsey (2015)). Because installation of sensors is a government choice, sensor technology creates an endogenous heterogeneity of parking supply. The goal of this paper is to understand how such heterogeneity affects optimal pricing, especially in the presence of heterogenous demand for parking, and how the decision to install sensors itself is optimally affected by pricing. This paper shows that the mutual dependence of the two government policies can be substantial.====To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study of economic aspects of parking occupancy sensors.====Methodologically, this paper develops a theoretical dynamic model of demand for and supply of parking that allows heterogeneity of motorists with respect to their desired duration of parking and their value of a parking session. The model incorporates a costly search for a vacant parking space that may or may not be assisted by occupancy sensors. Throughout most of the paper, motorists decide whether to search for parking endogenously; their decision is affected by the difficulty of search and by the monetary cost of parking. The resulting equilibrium can be managed by the government by means of price regulation, installation of additional parking sensors, and providing more parking space.====Several major questions are answered. Section 3 studies how installation of sensors affects the optimal (uniform) price for parking. Section 4 analyzes what can be gained by price discrimination. Section 5 shows that only a fraction of all parking bays should be equipped with sensors. Section 6 studies how the price for parking affects the economic incentives to install sensors – in absolute terms and relative to the incentives to expand parking space.",The economics of parking occupancy sensors,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212012218301072,March 2019,2019,Research Article,77.0

This paper finds that passengers are compensated with a fare that is $42.74-$47.60 cheaper per hour of layover time. Of the three dominant legacy carriers, United passengers are found to be compensated at an even higher rate of $61.89 per hour.","The U.S. airline industry is presently dominated by American, Delta, Southwest, and United. In 2015, these four airlines accounted for 80% of all domestic U.S. passenger traffic.==== Three of these carriers, American, Delta, and United, have organized their flight operations into extensive hub-and-spoke networks.==== These networks typically require passengers originating and concluding travel in non-hub cities to board a connecting flight at a hub on the way to the final destination. An example of the hub-and-spoke network involves a passenger traveling from Orange County, CA (SNA) to Reagan National (DCA) in Washington, DC.==== Currently, there are no direct options on any carrier from SNA to DCA. Therefore, a passenger must incur a layover when making this trip. This required layover will often occur in one of the carrier's respective hub cities. For instance, a passenger flying American is likely to incur a layover in Dallas (DFW) or Chicago (ORD), two of American's major hubs. Similarly, a passenger flying Delta is likely to incur a layover in Atlanta (ATL), Salt Lake City (SLC), or Minneapolis (MSP), three of Delta's hubs.====From the passenger perspective, layovers are negative drains on utility as the addition to total travel time relative to a nonstop itinerary is a cost incurred by the passenger. Passengers generally do not wish to sit in an airport for an extended period of time waiting for connecting flights. In some city-pair markets where multiple routing options are available to transport passengers from origin to destination, a prospective passenger may be faced with the choice of purchasing an expensive nonstop itinerary or a cheaper one requiring a layover. The difference in fare between nonstop and connecting itineraries indicates that a flight's price is partially a function of total layover time, with flights expected to decrease in price as the amount of layover time increases.====From the carrier perspective, there exists a trade-off between providing convenient flight connections for passengers and reducing airport congestion. By narrowing the gap between flights, a carrier reduces a connecting passenger's layover time. However, narrowing the flight gap has the adverse effect of increasing airport congestion (see Brueckner and Lin (2016)).====Taking both the passenger and carrier perspectives into account, it is clear that layover time is a major component that factors into a prospective passenger's purchase decision and an airline's flight scheduling decision. This paper provides insight into these decisions by providing empirical estimates on the value of layover time in the U.S. airline industry.====One approach to estimate the value of layover time is to obtain data on actual consumer purchases and estimate a multinomial logit (MNL) or multinomial probit model where the ratio of coefficients on the fare and total layover time covariates would provide the appropriate “willingness to pay” measure per minute of layover time. Using a MNL and 1983 data for five randomly selected city-pair markets, Morrison and Winston (1989) finds a value of air travel time of $34 an hour. Reflecting the disutility of waiting for connecting flights, the authors find an even higher value of layover time at $74 an hour. In addition to providing an updated estimate of the average value of layover time, this paper improves upon the Morrison and Winston (1989) study by exploring heterogeneity in the valuations of layover time.==== Specifically, this paper presents estimates that are airline-specific as well as estimates that differ by purchase date to reflect differences in the valuations of layover time by passenger type.====Instead of relying on consumer purchase data in conjunction with a MNL model, this paper employs an alternative strategy by constructing a dataset using posted fare and itinerary information from Google flights. With these data, a hedonic regression is estimated where fare is regressed on a vector of flight characteristics, including the total amount of layover time. The estimated hedonic model has two key advantages over the standard MNL model. Foremost, the hedonic model does not require the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption to hold. Most importantly however, the model in this paper does not have an error term that takes the standard logit form. As discussed in Ackerberg and Rysman (2005), the inflexibility of standard logit errors may lead to biased estimates of price elasticities and other parameters of interest such as substitution patterns and welfare effects.==== However, a disadvantage of the hedonic approach employed in this paper is the use of posted fare rather than actual consumer purchase data.====After collecting data for a period of three weeks for the top 50 domestic U.S. routes where passengers are required to incur a layover (no nonstop option is available), this paper finds that passengers are compensated with a fare that is approximately $42.74-$47.60 cheaper per hour of layover time. When estimating values for each of the three dominant legacy carriers, United passengers are found to be compensated at an even higher rate of $61.89 per hour.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the previous literature concerning layover time. Section 3 describes the fare and itinerary data collected for the empirical analysis. Section 4 outlines the hedonic regression model while Section 5 discusses regression results. Section 6 uses the estimates presented in Section 5 to evaluate the trade-off between convenient flight connections and airport congestion in a hypothetical scenario applying to Chicago's O'Hare airport. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",Are passengers compensated for incurring an airport layover?
