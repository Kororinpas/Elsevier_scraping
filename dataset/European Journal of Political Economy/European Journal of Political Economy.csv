Our analysis relies on a unique dataset including budgetary figures (both planned and realized) for all Italian municipalities, and exploits a national reform which introduced a limit on realized capital expenditures only for municipalities above a given population threshold (5000 residents). One possible interpretation of our results is that by exploiting the imperfect knowledge of voters, policymakers benefit from promising overly ambitious investment plans. The introduction of some form of capital-expenditure limit makes these promises less credible, and helps to bring spending plans in line with reality. Furthermore, we find that capital revenues are also overestimated, and that the forecast accuracy of these revenues improves due to the reform. This is in line with our political-economy interpretation: as there is less room to inflate expenditures, politicians also have fewer incentives to indulge in window-dressing on the revenue side.","Reliable public budgets are crucial to anchor economic agents' expectations and to keep policy-makers accountable. Unfortunately, politicians do not have strong incentives to adopt the most transparent accounting practices. First, it is often argued that voters overestimate the effects of public spending and underestimate the cost of financing it through taxation and/or deficits – the so-called “fiscal illusion” phenomenon.==== Second, as emphasized by Beetsma et al. (2009), “====”: cheating is usually discovered only later on, when chances are that the public attention has shifted to other policy issues, and/or the politician responsible for the budget is no more in place. Under these two conditions, policy-makers have an incentive to “plan to cheat”.==== That is, they promise an amount of expenditures higher than what they will actually deliver, because this allows them to cater to the demands of the various groups of voters, and at the same time they present overoptimistic revenue forecasts, in order to preserve the appearance of fiscal discipline. Once the extra revenues hoped for by the government fail to materialize, budgeted investment expenditures are downsized or abandoned altogether.====In this context, caps on realized spending can contribute to more realistic ex ante spending plans. Indeed, politicians have less room to credibly inflate planned expenditures, once there is a legal ceiling in place. Furthermore, introducing the ceiling makes the opportunity cost of each public project more salient for voters. Ultimately, over-optimistic spending plans have a smaller political pay-off.====In this paper, we provide evidence in favour of this theoretical intuition, exploiting a unique dataset including the ex-ante budget plans as well as ex-post budget outcomes of all the about 8000 Italian municipalities. We study the effects of the introduction in 2005 of a rule that constrains capital expenditures in municipalities with more than 5000 residents. Capital expenditures are well-suited to test our political economy hypothesis, because they are more flexible than current expenditures, which include mostly pre-determined items (for example employees compensation or interest payments), and because of their high symbolic appeal for the voters (Drazen and Eslava, 2010). The ongoing provision of basic public services often goes unnoticed (unless in case of major mismanagements) and is taken almost for granted by most citizens. On the contrary, investment projects are not perceived by the electorate as business-====-usual, are often “sold” politically as a mean to change radically for the better the life of a community, and are ultimately a crucial determinant of local government's popularity.====Our analysis shows that the municipalities subject to the new capital-spending rule significantly reduced their over-optimism in expenditure projections: planned capital expenditures decreased more than actual ones, in line with our a priori. Furthermore, in the new regime revenue projections are also more accurate (less over-optimistic).====While the literature on the effectiveness of fiscal rules on actual budgetary outcomes is large,==== research on their impact on budget execution has been scant, notwithstanding the practical importance of the issue. Beetsma et al. (2009), Von Hagen (2010) and Giuriato et al. (2016) find that implementation errors are smaller in countries that adopt numerical fiscal rules. Pina and Venes (2011) find similar results, albeit only if numerical expenditure rules are in place. All four papers consider a small panel of European countries. Similar conclusions are drawn by Frankel (2011), which studies a slightly larger panel of countries (33).====To our knowledge, there are very few papers that – like ours – exploit within-country data to analyse the relationship between the stringency of fiscal rules and budgetary projection errors. In particular, Luechinger and Schaltegger (2013) and Chatigny (2015) look at the twenty-six Swiss Cantons over a period of approximately twenty years and find evidence that the introduction of budgetary rules improves accuracy of official forecasts. Both papers use standard panel data techniques, as opposed to our quasi-experimental approach; the fact that Canton-level rules were introduced in a staggered way allows them to control for year- and Canton-fixed effects. Leaving technical identification issues aside (as we will discuss below, the introduction of a fiscal rule and its degree of stringency might be both endogenous), the political-economy mechanism behind the results of the Swiss papers does not apply to the Italian municipalities' case. Fiscal forecasts in Swiss cantons are provided by the Canton's finance minister, which is politically independent and more fiscally conservative than the rest of the Government. This is why, according to both papers, finance ministers purposely introduce a pessimistic bias in deficit forecasts in order to discourage overspending by other Ministries. With the introduction of a fiscal rule, this behaviour becomes less useful, therefore forecast accuracy increases. In Italian municipalities, instead, the mayor's cabinet is more cohesive, and the official in charge of the budget is aligned with the interests of the mayor and of its political majority (Monacelli et al., 2016).====At a late stage of our research, we learned of the paper by Picchio and Santolini (2020). While their data and methodology are similar to ours, they analyse two different reforms, which occurred in 2001 and 2002, respectively.==== Differently from them, we study a policy change that is specifically about capital expenditures. On top of this, our paper is intended not just as a treatment evaluation study but it is framed in – and guided by – the theoretical literature, our aim being to corroborate the “planning to cheat” hypothesis (we discuss below – see especially Section 5.3 – why this theory appears to be the best candidate to rationalize all our results). Our paper also tries to make a further step, as we try to derive from our finding policy implications that are potentially relevant for public investment policies, both in general and in the current European Union context (we elaborate on this in the concluding Section). That said, our empirical results and those of the rigorous study by Picchio and Santolini (2020) are clearly complementary and reinforce each other.====Using within-country data has several advantages. First, we are able to increase manifold the sample size with respect to cross-country studies. Second, we reduce significantly the need to control for institutional differences. Third, when it comes to the explanatory variables, measurement error is reduced: cross-country fiscal rules indices, including the one provided by the European Union and used by some of the above-mentioned studies, require comparing different institutional set-ups, which unavoidably implies some judgemental choice.====Finally, and most importantly, using within-country data addresses the well-known issue of the endogeneity of the rules (Poterba, 1997). For example, the cross-country papers mentioned above either did not explicitly address the issue or adopted an instrumental variables approach, whereas our set up is such that one can plausibly consider the introduction of the new budget rule as an exogenous treatment. Our set up also provides us with a natural control group, the municipalities with less than 5000 residents, which works as a benchmark to assess the causal impact of the reform and allows us to apply quasi-experimental microeconometric techniques.====Our paper also contributes to the literature on the political and institutional determinants of official budgetary forecast errors. While we focus on the effect of fiscal rules, previous papers have highlighted the importance of the electoral cycle (Boylan, 2008; Bohn and Veiga, 2020), partisanship (Bischoff and Gohout, 2010; Chatagny, 2015; Jochimsen and Lehmann, 2017), fiscal autonomy (Boukari and Veiga, 2018), political fragmentation (Goeminne et al., 2008), independent forecasting agencies (Buettner and Kauder, 2010; Beetsma et al., 2013). These contributions can indeed be framed within the broad literature on fiscal transparency, defined as the degree of “comprehensiveness, clarity, ====, timeliness, and relevance of public reporting on the past, present and ==== state of public finances” (IMF; italics added).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the institutional set-up; Section 3 describes the empirical strategy and Section 4 the data we used; in Section 5 we present and discuss our results; Section 6 concludes.",Fiscal rules and the reliability of public investment plans: Evidence from local governments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000599,Available online 12 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

However, per-pupil expenditures vary significantly across cantons. The question quickly arises whether “more is always better”. Switzerland lends itself to this analysis because spending authority lies with the cantons and thus provides a good setting for a within-country analysis. We use a new comprehensive dataset to measure educational quality and mobility at the individual level. Our analysis shows that higher cantonal spending does not increase educational quality or mobility. The allocation of education spending seems to be more important than its mere amount. For example, our study suggests a better linguistic integration of foreign-speaking students.","“There is only one thing in the long run more expensive than education: no education.” This quote from John F. Kennedy stresses the importance of education for a country's economy. Numerous studies show that a good education system is essential for economic growth (Chen and Feng, 1996; Hanushek and Woessmann, 2008) and reduces inequality in the long run (Glomm and Ravikumar, 2003).====At the same time, Baumol's cost disease has been observed for OECD countries' education sectors: Not only did the total educational expenditures increase but also the expenditures per student (Wolff et al., 2014). The latter even increased by more than 36% on average in OECD countries between 2000 and 2009 (Nicoletti and Rabe, 2017). In Switzerland, per-pupil spending on compulsory education increased by more than 50% in real terms over the last 20 years. Annual education spending per primary school student relative to GDP per capita in Switzerland lies significantly above the OECD average (SKBF, 2018). Moreover, per-pupil expenditures vary significantly across cantons. For this reason, questions about the quality of education move into focus. Performance comparisons such as PISA or TIMSS are conducted at regular intervals on an international and national level.====A lot of studies analyzing the relationship between education spending and education quality focus on cross-country comparisons using PISA results at the international level (Gundlach et al., 2001; Konsortium PISA. ch, 2019; Yang and Lee, 2022). Within-country analyses are sparser and often focus on the USA (e.g., Candelaria and Shores, 2019; Jackson and Mackevicius, 2021) or more rarely on the UK (e.g., Steele et al., 2007).====However, more within-country evidence - including from smaller countries - would be important to ensure comparability of schooling systems and other circumstances such as the labor market (Gundlach et al., 2001). Switzerland offers the ideal setting for such an analysis, as the competence for compulsory school lies at the sub-federal (cantonal) level.====Therefore, we investigate the relationship between financial endowments in compulsory school and the pupils' performance across Swiss cantons. Specifically, we analyze whether higher cantonal education spending increases the individual pupils’ performance.====Furthermore, we investigate whether higher cantonal education spending is associated with higher intergenerational educational mobility==== across cantons. Previous studies have examined effect heterogeneities as a function of parental background (e.g., Jackson et al., 2016; Yang and Lee, 2022). Opposed to these existing studies, we use a particular measure of student performance that is essential for the equality of educational opportunities. We determine for each child whether it has achieved the nationally defined basic competencies. These tests were developed specifically for the Swiss school system. The basic competencies are crucial for further educational and professional careers. We analyze whether higher educational expenditures increase the probability of achieving the basic competencies for children stemming from lower-educated households. Hence, we investigate whether higher educational spending contributes to an increase in social mobility.====Given this background, we examine how cantonal education expenditures affect education quality and intergenerational educational mobility. We use a new comprehensive dataset based on the nationwide review of basic competencies in the area of languages at the individual level. Furthermore, we use administrative data for the cantonal expenditures on compulsory education. To address potential endogeneity problems, we instrument the cantonal educational expenditures by the vote share of left-wing political parties or the use of mandatory financial referenda, respectively.====We show that additional educational expenditures have no impact on pupils' performance. Moreover, additional education spending has no statistically significant impact on intergenerational educational mobility. The allocation of education spending seems to be more important than its mere amount. Our study stresses the importance of continuous quality controls to prevent education expenditures from increasing according to Baumol's cost disease without enhancing the quality of education. For example, our study suggests improved linguistic integration of foreign-speaking children as an important starting point for targeting education spending policies.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we summarize the current state of research. We describe the underlying dataset and the empirical strategy in Sections 3 Data, 4 Empirical approach. In Section 5, we present the central results of the analysis.

We find that higher expected wages lead to the selection of more educated council members and executives, but do not result into better educated mayors. Low-wage councils tend to elect mayors with almost two years more schooling than the median councillor, but this this difference vanishes in high-wage councils. We rationalize this finding in a model where better educated councillors shy away from better-paid but full-time positions (such as mayor) and prefer less-paid but part-time positions (executives) that allow them to devote more time to work while in office. An analysis by politicians’ occupation and retirement status supports this explanation. Our findings thus highlight that the effects of monetary incentives are not invariant across different institutional settings, especially when the election systems include a parliamentary stage.","This paper analyses the interplay between indirect election systems and monetary incentives and how this affects the selection of local politicians. Higher wages for leading positions are typically found to attract better candidates when the election system is direct, i.e., when the voters directly cast ballots for the persons or political party that they desire to see elected (Gagliarducci and Nannicini, 2013). However, in a system where the voters elect a body that in turn elects the officeholder, whether higher wages translate into better-educated leaders is more debatable.====To address this question, we investigate the impact of a remuneration policy on the relative quality of the elected leader within the body, that is, the quality gap between the leader and those who elected her.==== We study a large sample of Italian municipalities between 1985 and 1990, when the remuneration for local administrators was based on a step-function of the municipality population. We leverage this feature to implement a regression-discontinuity analysis around the 5000 inhabitants threshold – where mayor’s wage increases by almost 30% – to evaluate the causal effect of higher remuneration on the characteristics of the elected councillors and the (council-elected) mayor and executives. To account for the presence of a confounding treatment around the same population threshold – the electoral rule also changes from a majoritarian to a proportional representation system for municipalities above 5000 inhabitants – we limit our sample to ==== municipalities, where the leading party is expected to win the majority of the votes (albeit still with a significant degree of uncertainty). By doing so, we make sure that the probability that a party achieves a self-sufficient majority (i.e., that it obtains the majority of seats in the council, and thus can form a single-party government) is similar below and above the threshold, regardless of whether seats are allocated under a majoritarian or proportional rule.====We provide three main findings. Consistent with the existing literature on the selection of local politicians, we find that (i) higher expected wages result in more educated members of the local council (＋0.8 year of schooling on average) and in (ii) better educated executives (＋0.6 years of schooling). However, (iii) higher expected wages do not result in better educated mayors: while mayors in control (low-wage) councils are almost 2 years more educated than the median councillor and the median executive, this difference nearly vanishes in high-wage councils.====To rationalize this counterintuitive finding, we adapt and extend the model by Gagliarducci et al. (2010). The proposed mechanism is based on a key assumption: moonlighting (i.e. the possibility to work and earn outside income in the private sector while in office) is easier for executives rather than for mayors. We show that under some plausible conditions, better educated councillors shy away from better paid but full-time positions (mayors), rather opting for less-paid but more flexible positions (executives) which allow them to enjoy an income outside their public office. We provide evidence for this mechanism by exploiting the heterogeneity in the possibility of “moonlighting” associated to different occupations. We find that appointed councillors and executives are more likely to be employed in occupations that allow them to moonlight – for instance, self-employed professionals such as lawyers and engineers. Conversely, mayors are more likely to be retired (often with a degree), and thus their outside income does not depend on the time spent in political activities.====Our study suggests that the effects of monetary incentives can vary across institutional settings. Comparing our results to those of Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) – who perform a similar regression-discontinuity strategy to identify the effect of wage bonuses on political selection ==== – leads to opposite conclusions. The authors find that candidate mayors in high-wage municipalities are positively selected, and that this result in ==== educated mayors. However, in the framework studied by Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013), mayors were directly elected by citizens and executives were appointed by the mayor, even from outside the council. Conversely, in our context the executives, as well as the mayor, are elected within and by the council. These institutional differences are key to explain the discrepancy in the two results, and why we find that elected mayors are on average ==== than average in high-pay municipalities. In this perspective, our findings highlight that the parliamentary stage of the election process can undo the positive selection effect of monetary incentives. We believe that this result has important implications, as parliamentary forms of government are still widespread in many countries.====
      ====More generally, our results are related to the literature on political selection and its implication on general well-being. Good policies are also the result of good politicians, both at the national ( Besley et al. (2011); Jones and Olken (2005) among others) and the local level ( Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) and Meyersson (2014) among others). The thriving literature on topics related to political selection seems, therefore, highly motivated.==== One question that received more attention is whether we can “buy” better politicians. However, the evidence on whether higher rewards from office improve politicians’ quality remains inconclusive. On one hand, some recent works support a positive causal relationship between the wage and quality (commonly proxied with educational attainment and previous occupations) of elected local politicians. Besides the above-cited Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) (for Italian municipalities), these works include Dal Bó et al. (2013) (for Mexican municipalities), Ferraz and Finan (2009) (for Brazilian municipalities), and Dal Bó et al. (2017) (for Sweden municipalities). On the other hand, other works focusing on politicians at the national or supranational level find no significant evidence of a positive causal relationship between pay and quality (as in Kotakorpi and Poutvaara (2011) and Hoffman and Lyons (2015), focusing respectively on Finnish and U.S. legislators) or even suggest that such a relationship is negative (as in Fisman et al. (2015) and Braendle (2015), both focusing on members of the European Parliament).====We also relate to other recent works dealing with the impacts of electoral rules. Gulino (2021) also uses micro-level data on Italian municipal elections to evaluate how the change from majority to proportional rule at the 5000 threshold affects the probability of re-election of mayors.==== Hessami (2018) exploits a quasi-experiment at the level of German municipalities to study the effect of the selection rule for mayors on their policy choices, finding that directly elected mayors attract significantly more grants in election years while there is no cycle for council-elected mayors. Finally, Enikolopov (2014) focuses on U.S. local government to study the difference between directly elected vs. council-appointed mayors on politically motivated targeted redistribution finding that appointed bureaucrats are less likely to use targeted redistribution than elected politicians and that this difference is, at least in part, driven by the difference in their career concerns.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the institutional setting. Section 3 presents the data and the identification strategy. Section 4 is devoted to the description of the main results while Section 5 discusses the possible mechanisms.

I find strong deterrence and incumbency effects among both men and women, but no evidence of a significant gender heterogeneity. Men are 14.9 to 16.6 percentage points less likely to re-enter politics after an electoral loss, while women are 11.8 to 14.3 percentage points less likely to do so. Moreover, incumbent male candidates are 5.8 percentage points more likely to win the next election, while female candidates are 5.6 percentage points more likely to win again. The findings have important implications for program and ==== at the municipal and provincial levels, and assist in the understanding of the roles played by political and electoral institutions in shaping elections’ outcomes.","As of January 2020, women constituted only 36% of elected members in local deliberative bodies (UN Women, 2021). Empirical evidence shows that female representation among elected officials matters for different reasons. For instance, Duflo (2012) argues that there is a relationship between economic development and women’s political participation. Female leadership increases adolescents’ aspirations and educational outcomes of teenage girls in India (Beaman et al., 2012). It also results in policies that better align with women’s preferences (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), and increases the share of women candidates running in the next election (Bhalotra et al., 2017). Further, women’s political participation improves economic performance (Bhalotra et al., 2018) and reduces corruption (Dollar et al., 2001). Specifically at the local level, female representation leads to increased positive performance of other female council candidates in the same and neighboring municipalities (Baskaran and Hessami, 2018), as well as increased participation of female candidates in national elections in subsequent electoral cycles (Brown et al., 2022). It also contributes to reducing the stigma around work-family conciliation by encouraging more frequent discussions on childcare during council meetings in Bavaria, and it fosters an environment where female councillors feel like they can speak up more often (Hessami and Baskaran, 2019). Hessami and da Fonseca (2020) provide a very comprehensive literature review on the substantive effects of female political representation on public policy.====These results suggest that understanding the causes of low female representation in politics would have important implications for various spheres of society. Existing literature offers potential explanations: gender gaps in political ambitions and access to campaign funding, voter bias against women, differential expectations for male and female candidates, institutional barriers (i.e., proportional vs. majoritarian electoral systems), as well as political parties’ treatment and recruitment of candidates (Lawless and Fox, 2013, Pearson and McGhee, 2013, Burrell, 1992, Beaman et al., 2009, Carter, 1956, Bauer, 2020, Profeta and Woodhouse, 2022). A healthy relationship and family life may prove incompatible with public office: Fiva and King (2022) present evidence that women experience significant child penalties (their probability of winning a seat in a subsequent election falls almost twice as much than men’s) and find that women who retire do so due to preferences or perceived gender norms, while Folke and Rickne (2020) show that being elected to a mayoral or parliamentarian position increases the probability of divorce among women, but not among men. Previous research also finds a significant gender gap in violence suffered by high-profile Swedish politicians, with female mayors experiencing far more violence than any other politician (Håkansson, 2021). Murray (2014) argues that the over-representation of male politicians limits the effective representation of men and women and can have a detrimental effect on the quality of the representation. In contrast, Muyters et al. (2022) find that politicians career duration depends on their electoral performance, but that effect is only significant for men. Beaman et al. (2012) find that the gender gap in aspirations and educational attainment starts shrinking only during the second electoral mandate held by a woman, suggesting that cultivating a persevering spirit among women candidates is an important consideration.====In this paper, I study two determinants of Canadian municipal election outcomes: incumbency and persistence. I investigate the difference in the size of the male and female candidates’ incumbency advantage and examine the magnitude of the differential attrition between men and women after an electoral loss by exploiting a close elections regression discontinuity design. Findings in the existing literature are mixed in this regard: some evidence from the United States points to the absence of a gender gap in candidates’ response to an electoral loss, while a separate study of the United States and results from France and Germany indicate some level of a gendered re-contesting gap (incumbents and non-incumbents). Using data from the Canadian Municipal Elections Database (CMED), which contains complete municipal election results between 1867–2021 for nearly 2,000 municipalities across Canada, I find significant positive effects on subsequent political participation and success among incumbent candidates and significant negative effects on subsequent re-entry into politics after an electoral loss. More specifically, among men, candidates who barely win (near winners) are estimated to be 6.8 percentage points more likely to re-enter in the next election, and 5.8 percentage points more likely to win the next election, compared to candidates who barely lost (near losers). After a loss, near losers are estimated to be 14.9 to 16.6 percentage points less likely to re-enter politics compared to near winners. Smaller magnitudes are found among women: near winners are estimated to be 6.9 percentage points more likely to re-enter in the next election and 5.6 percentage points more likely win the next election than near losers; while the latter are 11.8 to 14.3 percentage points less likely to re-enter politics compared to near winners. However, further analysis allows me to conclude that there is no significant heterogeneity in male and female candidates for any of the outcomes of interest—consistent with results from Baskaran and Hessami (2022), Bernhard and de Benedictis-Kessner (2021) and Peveri and Sangnier (2021). The advantage of this empirical design lies in the possible uncertainty of the final vote count. Lee (2008) argues that within a small margin of victory, it is plausible that there is at least some random chance element to the vote share—nearly randomizing the outcome (win or loss) of an election and the identity of those close winners and losers. As such, I can identify the causal effect of winning (losing) a race, relative to losing (winning), on downstream outcomes. Analyzing persistence and incumbency advantage separately allows me to observe cross-gender differences in re-contesting decisions from both sides of the same coin, and for different horizons in time. In the first analysis, re-entry is defined as a candidate’s participation in the immediate next election, whereas it is defined as whether a candidate will run again in any election within the next two available opportunities in the second analysis. Any differences between the short- and medium-term impact of electoral outcomes on subsequent political participation could have implications for how policy to stimulate and encourage female participation is developed.====Previous literature has documented significant gender differences in such behavior in various competitive settings.==== In the political arena, one strand of literature focuses on exploring whether differences in political persistence of men and women after an electoral attempt is a potential determinant of eventual office-holding and political representation. Cipullo (2021) finds that female candidates are less likely to be elected to the U.S House of Representatives and less likely to become mayor in Italian cities than their males colleagues. Baskaran and Hessami (2022), using data from local council elections in Hesse, show that women are less likely to re-contest than men in the next election, with a gender gap of 5 percentage points, and attribute it to an incompatibility between family obligations and local politics. Bernhard and de Benedictis-Kessner (2021) find no significant difference in the probability of candidates to quit U.S. state and local politics after they narrowly lost an election. Contrastingly, Wasserman (2021) explores differences in the persistence of politicians in local office in California and finds a significant gender differential of 10 percentage points. Wasserman discusses potential mechanisms that may explain why the magnitude of the effect would be different for women than it is for men: gender differences in the cost or benefit of running again. It is not expected that the benefit of holding office again differs because winning candidates have the same job description, but she considers three types of costs: campaigning costs, opportunity costs and psychic costs. Casas-Arce and Saiz (2015) argue that if fundraising opportunities or political networks operate differently for women relative to men after an electoral loss, then female candidates could suffer an additional financial or time cost associated with running again. Further, if women who lose have a more attractive outside option relative to men who lose, then these gender differences could explain women’s withdrawal from politics. Finally, psychic costs manifest themselves through a well-documented fact that women are more likely to opt out of competitive settings after a loss, as mentioned above.====Another strand of literature centers around incumbency advantage, which is a pillar of political science models. When the vast majority of incumbents are men, female candidates can be at a disadvantage because they must challenge and win against male candidates to hold office (Schwindt-Bayer, 2005). Kendall and Rekkas (2012) provide evidence of incumbency advantage in the Canadian parliament, on the basis of increased vote shares and probability of winning. At the local level, Lucas (2021) focuses on four Canadian cities (Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Winnipeg) and finds that the unconditional incumbency advantage is very large—an elected official is 30 percentage points more likely to run in and win the next election than runners-up in the initial election. The unconditional incumbency effect is defined as the effect of incumbency unconditional on running, as opposed a conditional measure, which introduces a potential bias created by focusing only on those who choose to run. I employ the former metric. Outside of Canada, Baskaran et al. (2022) find that male candidates’ incumbency advantage is significantly smaller than that enjoyed by female candidates when uncertainty is high. Lippmann (2023) shows that the incumbency advantage does not seem to prevent female candidates to access mayoral positions in France.====With respect to the gender gap, Brown et al. (2019) find that female state politicians in the US have a higher probability of re-running for the same seat in the subsequent election compared to male politicians, which in turns generates high incumbency rates for them. Smrek (2020) finds no significant differences in the incumbency advantages by male and female legislators in the Czech Republic. Sevi (2022) examines whether there are gender differences in the incumbency advantage. Using different outcomes of interest in Canadian federal politics such as probability of running again, probability of winning in the next election, and vote share, she documents a positive effect on the probability of running again, but no significant effects on the probability of winning again and candidates’ vote shares in the next election. Further, she finds no statistically significant difference in the effects for male and female candidates, suggesting that women are equally likely to persist as men. Sevi notes that opposing strands of literature could explain either outcome. From one perspective, a theoretical model that only incorporates voter discrimination will predict that women win at a lower rate than men (Ashworth et al., 2020). On the other hand, if anticipated voter bias led women to self-select out of politics, then only the most qualified female candidates actually participate in electoral races (Anzia and Berry, 2011), leading to no difference in incumbency advantage between men and women. A final closely related paper is by Peveri and Sangnier (2021), who study differences across genders in the re-contesting decisions of candidates in the 2008 and 2014 municipal elections in French cities. They show that female candidates are slightly less likely to re-contest than their male counterparts, but find no significant difference in the subsequent electoral success enjoyed by male and female incumbent candidates.====To my knowledge, this would be the first empirical analysis of a gendered incumbency effect and of female candidates’ response to an electoral loss at the municipal level in Canada. The main contribution of this paper is to deliver a new result on an issue about which the existing literature currently presents contrasting pieces of evidence. Canadian municipal elections offer a unique setting to examine the political situation of women: relatively high electoral turnover, the use of a ward system in most municipalities, the relative absence of political parties at the local level (in contrast to their influence in the United States and Germany, for example), smaller size of Canadian cities relative to those in other countries (Tolley, 2011). It differs specifically from the United States in that political recruitment processes are different, which provides less incentive for legislators to use local public offices as a launch-pad to higher office (Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 1966). Two factors would suggest that the magnitude of deterrence effects would be different in Canada. Women’s organizations are most active in larger cities and can assist in mobilization efforts in a greater capacity and women who seek municipal office in larger cities will face more competition from men –a bigger city implies a bigger budget, which is in turn associated with more power and prestige (Gidengil and Vengroff, 1997). Further, women’s professional opportunities vary across political parties (Sanbonmatsu, 2002) which, conversely, suggests that the magnitude of deterrence and incumbency effects would be smaller in the Canadian context. I further introduce a number of extensions where I explore the effects analyzed in this paper across different districts’ characteristics and elections’ institutional context.====The extensive coverage offered by the dataset allows me to explore heterogeneity across provinces within Canada. Municipalities in Canada share a number of characteristics, while also enjoying some distinctive features. With the exception of the Vancouver region in British Columbia, Quebec is the only province where official municipal political parties (MPP) are existent (Chiasson and Mévellec, 2014). Mévellec and Tremblay (2013) argue that there is still a lot to learn about the effects of MPP’s being authorized. Bherer and Breux (2011) argue that political parties introduce candidates that offer better representation of their constituencies (by encouraging women and candidates from ethnic communities). In one study of territorial legislatures, White (2013) observes that women make up a higher proportion of MPs in settings with political parties than those without. Consequently, their involvement in political life may alter the relevance of campaigning costs for women in Québec, relative to other provinces and has the potential to explain heterogeneous variation in women across Canada. Further, Gidengil and Vengroff (1997) note that the role of women in politics underwent significant changes towards the end of the last century. The presence of strong women’s groups and programs to promote equity are the most notable factors. The women’s movement in Quebec is unlike the rest of Canada. Organized almost entirely in French, contrary to the rest of English Canada, its agenda focuses primarily on provincial institutional reform, whereas the Anglo-Canadian movement operates primarily at the national level (Maillé, 2015). The closer proximity between the municipal and provincial levels of government favors greater involvement of the latter into local affairs. For instance, in 1999, the Quebec provincial government implemented the program ====, whose aim is to increase the number of women in decision-making positions and at the center of local and regional places of power (Tremblay, 2014). As such, I expect women in Quebec to experience lesser deterrence effects and greater incumbency advantage. Consistent with this view, Muriaas et al. (2022) find that top-down gendered electoral financing initiatives are indeed successful in improving gender balance in legislatures.",Gender differences in politician persistence and incumbency advantage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000484,26 May 2023,2023,Research Article,3.0
"Hefeker Carsten,Neugart Michael","University of Siegen, 57068 Siegen, Germany,CESifo, Germany,Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64289 Darmstadt, Germany","Received 27 December 2022, Revised 18 April 2023, Accepted 21 April 2023, Available online 3 May 2023, Version of Record 7 June 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2023.102401,Cited by (0),"We analyze the consequences of political polarization between domestic policymakers for international policy coordination or delegation to a common agency. Coordination is preferred under political polarization if it allows to constrain the policy of policymakers with different policy targets, while delegation allows to determine policies in the future by selecting the appropriate agent. Policymakers have different preferences concerning international coordination and which form it should take. These differences are increasing in political polarization. They agree on delegation if election outcomes are close to being random.","Concerns have been raised that growing political polarization may undermine international policy coordination or even challenge the international order more generally (Dustmann et al., 2017, Frieden, 2021). However, while it is obviously more difficult to cooperate with people who are not committed to the established political consensus to seek common solutions to international problems, it makes it at the same time more attractive as international cooperation can serve to avoid more extreme policies being implemented. International agreements like NATO, the GATT and WTO, the Bretton Woods systems or the European Union have also been created with the intention to tie countries into a binding international commitment that would constrain domestic policy space (Eichengreen, 2019, Gardner, 1980, Ikenberry, 1992). Furthermore, by entering international agreements current domestic office-holders can, at least to some degree, constrain future domestic policymakers’ more radical policies by forcing them to cooperate with other, hopefully more moderate, foreign policymakers. Arrangements that mandate international agreement can, therefore, serve to avoid domestic policy from becoming too radical from a domestic as well as from an international perspective. Thus, growing political polarization at home, while potentially making international cooperation more difficult, should also make it more desirable.====To consider such trade-offs in more detail, we develop a model that asks how the incentive to agree on coordinated policies with foreign policymakers depends on political polarization at the national level. The policymakers in each country distinguish themselves through their policy targets where the ambitious type has a higher policy target and generally prefers to do “more” rather than “less”. While the incentive to coordinate, given by policy spillovers, applies to both these policymakers, we show that there are systematic differences concerning the incentive to coordinate. Policymakers who have more ambitious policy targets are more likely to coordinate whereas more conservative types are less interested in coordination. The incentive to coordinate, moreover, depends on who the respective foreign partner is.====International cooperation is often based on case-by-case decision but it can also take a more institutionalized form in international agreements or organizations. This not only allows to ensure the continuous internalization of spillovers but can become a mechanism to indirectly ensure that future domestic policymakers run less extreme policy than they otherwise may do because they are forced to cooperate with foreign partners. Motives for entering such continuous agreements also depend on the type of policymaker, and the policymakers’ expectation which type of policymaker will be in charge at home and abroad in the future. Lastly, we also consider the case where cooperation takes the form of current officeholders delegating policy implementation to an independent agent, such as an international organization or bureaucracy. Incumbents, by determining the characteristics of “their” agent, can lock in certain policies even if they leave office. We therefore distinguish two forms of cooperation: coordination of policies by governments and delegation to an independent agent and discuss which type of cooperation will be preferred by incumbent policymakers.====One example for the possible applications of our model is the international coordination of monetary or fiscal policies, where national policymakers may have different policy targets with respect to output or employment, and left-leaning governments pursue more expansive policies than conservative ones. As the policy target is not only affected by national monetary or fiscal policy but also, positively or negatively, by policy measures abroad, countries have an obvious incentive to cooperate. Cooperation and coordination can be on a case-by-case basis, such as among the G20 countries in response to the Global Financial Crisis or take a more institutionalized form as in the European Union, for which the Growth and Stability Pact or the NextGenerationEU fund would be examples. By entering the European Union, policymakers can ensure that certain policy areas will continuously be coordinated and that also potential successors in office will be bound by the principle of coordination with other foreign policymakers. They can even go one step further and delegate policy to an independent agent such as the European Central Bank.====Environmental policy serves as a second example. Countries and individual policymakers systematically differ with their concern for the environment as evidenced, for example, in the different positions of Nordic countries and developing nations or between Green parties and more conservative ones. There are obvious positive or negative spillover effects of national polices to other countries which give rise to attempts of cooperation. This cooperation may be relatively loose as in the Kyoto-protocol but countries may also be able to agree on binding national carbon dioxide reductions as in the European Union or at one point delegate policies to a common agency.====Our analysis helps to explain the different forms and intensities of cooperation in different areas by relating them back to political polarization between and within countries as well as to electoral uncertainty. Not only does the degree of polarization matter but probable election outcomes influence the choice for a particular regime of cooperation or non-cooperation as well. Whether countries want to coordinate policies is not only driven by the strength of externalities but also by benefits or costs from having to cooperate with a policymaker who has different policy goals. Political polarization between policymakers and electoral uncertainty about future incumbents will, therefore, be decisive for the choice that governments make. Delegation is preferred by all policymakers if electoral outcomes are close to random, and incentives to delegate increase with polarization. Thus, increasing political polarization increases the importance of regime choice for policymakers and they are more likely to disagree on whether there should be cooperation and what form it should take the more predictable election outcomes become. Policymakers with better election chances are less likely to prefer delegation. Moreover, the type of policymaker influences the regime choice. Policymakers with more ambitious policy targets have a higher incentive to cooperate because they place a higher value on internalizing positive spillovers; more conservative types instead fear that cooperation leads to an overly expansive policy, in particular when having to coordinate with an ambitious foreign policymaker. Coordination with a foreign policymaker of one’s own type is preferred by both types of policymakers but they disagree on the desirability of cooperation depending on the combination of domestic and foreign policymakers.====We combine several aspects of the existing literature in our analysis. First, we build on the large literature on international cooperation in general (Congleton, 2020, Dai et al., 2017, Hefeker and Neugart, 2018) and particular in areas such as environmental policy (Barrett, 2007), fiscal and monetary policy (Frankel, 2015, Keen and Konrad, 2013, Ostry and Ghosh, 2016), or trade policy (Grossman, 2016, Maggi, 2014). Our contribution most closely relates to a literature that builds on domestic conflicts and their impact on cooperation (De Vries et al., 2021, Frieden, 2021, Schneider and Urpelainen, 2014). First, the reason for the break-down of international cooperation can be that policymakers with different objectives alternate in office and thus undermine or revoke commitments made by earlier incumbents (Blum and Potrafke, 2020, Conconi and Sahuguet, 2009, Dobson, 1991, Putnam and Bayne, 1984). Another reason for collapse of cooperation can be that public sentiments change and that therefore earlier agreements can no longer be maintained (Autor et al., 2020, Harms and Schwab, 2020, Rodrik, 2021). We go beyond this existing literature by connecting election probabilities with the incentive to cooperate not only case-by-case but with entering a binding commitment to cooperate also in the future. In particular, in our setting polarized national policymakers strategically trade off the merits of internalizing spillovers with the payoffs of binding future governments at home and abroad by cooperation. Moreover, we compare different forms of institutionalized cooperation including delegation, which has not been done before in this context. Hence, we also tie in with the literature on delegation where governments have to consider the relative benefits of either deciding themselves or delegating to an independent agent, such as courts or central banks (Alesina and Tabellini, 2007, Eggertsson and Le Borgne, 2010, Maskin and Tirole, 2004, Schultz, 1999). In our contribution, the possibility to constrain the policy space of successors plays a crucial role in the decision of countries to cooperate, and in the decision of countries to delegate rather than to coordinate policies. While the “tying the hands” of one’s successor argument is a standard political economy argument (Drazen, 2000, Persson and Svensson, 1989), delegation to international bodies is usually not connected to domestic political polarization as we do here.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the model, and Section 3 analyzes the policy choices for the case of no cooperation and coordination. Section 4 explores the incentives to coordinate, and Section 5 analyzes the choices between committing to coordinate policies and non-cooperation, and delegation and coordination of policies.

To approach this question, I focus on geography, namely the extent to which an empire abutted a sea. Seas could have allowed for greater opportunities for integration as well as trade with external polities. I consider historical empires from antiquity until 1922 and examine whether those empires with larger coastlines relative to their areas endured longer. Using various estimation methodologies and instrumenting for the length of the coastline, I find support that empires that were more connected to seas lasted longer. Further analysis suggests that the potential for seaways to lead to greater integration provides a stronger explanation than the potential for seas to provide a defensive barrier.","The question of “why Rome fell” has enticed historians for centuries. Edward Gibbon and Henri Pirenne are only two of the numerous scholars tackling this issue. Others such as Turchin (2003, 2006) have considered empires more generally and have tried to find common explanations for imperial decline. This paper takes a different perspective. Why did some empires persist for centuries whereas others fade quickly?====This paper considers one explanation, namely that greater access to the sea provided advantages promoting longevity. Such access could have led to greater economic and political integration, both internally and with outside polities. The focus on geography in determining long-run outcomes is congruent with Diamond (1997) who sees geography as benefitting Eurasian societies (relative to New World ones) due to an ‘East-West’ axis and the prevalence of animals that could be domesticated to become richer and more powerful than those in other regions. Turchin (2009) find that empires more often spread along an east-west (versus a north-south) axis since climate varied less along lines of latitude. Acemoglu et al. (2001) use settler mortality primarily driven by the disease environment in European colonies centuries ago to explain income differences in these former colonies today. Brückner and Ciccone (2011) use rainfall as an exogenous shock in examining to what extent income shocks can drive democratization, at least in poor, agricultural economies. More relevant to this paper, Schmitt (1943) cites Byzantium's long coastline as a key factor in its perseverance.====Pursuing this inquiry is important for at least two reasons. First and more specifically, several studies (see below) find that access to the sea (relative to being landlocked) provides benefits to modern economies. This examination looking at empires from centuries ago can better determine to what extent such adjacency was important historically when political structures, economies, and technologies greatly differed from today's counterparts. Second and more generally, many researchers forward conjectures as to what factors contributed to a particular empire's success and persistence. Perhaps such factors generalize. A finding that adjacency to the sea – and, geography, more broadly – generalizes would support examining more inclusive studies of empires such as in Turchin (2003) and Chase-Dunn and Hall (1997).====Of course, I do not want to overextend my inferences, either. My focus on empire duration implies nothing about empire formation and growth. Doyle (1986) discusses the growth of empires, attributing them to the dispositions within the core and the periphery as well as the relative strength between the two. I do not argue that empires beginning near the sea initially grew faster or expanded farther. The analysis takes as given the existence of a large territorial state and examines if access to seas contributed to its subsequent longevity. To take Rome as an example, interconnectedness by water could have provided the Romans an asset in maintaining their empire, but it does not explain why Rome succeeded over other Italian cities. Second, the relative advantages of waterways to transport goods and people and to convey information diminished as inventions such as the railway and telegraph lowered travel times over land. The presence of seaways to promote integration is likely less important today. Third, I do not claim that access to the sea was the only factor in promoting longevity. Governing institutions were also important, especially following the death of a charismatic leader. Burbank and Cooper (2010) provide a survey of important empires, demonstrating how the core through cultural or social inclusion could maintain durability.====Finally, the focus on adjacency to the sea does not put forth a new theory or perspective. Many have described historical advantages of water transport. The presence of strong links between the core and periphery of an empire appears to be a straightforward factor for cohesion. The potential for trade to create wealth that can then strengthen a polity is also not a new view. Therefore, instead of considering a new view this paper examines whether the benefits of adjacency to the sea provided meaningful benefits whose advantages are detectable given the myriad of other factors – both exogenous shocks and structural characteristics – in contributing to longevity.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview as to why seas could promote imperial longevity through integration. Section 3 describes the data and empirical specification. Section 4 discusses results. Section 5 considers an alternative reason why seas could have been beneficial for imperial longevity, namely by providing a defensive barrier against invaders. Section 6 offers conclusions.",On the duration of empires,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000447,25 April 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

Large emigration of high-skilled emigrants can lead to changes in the distribution of political preferences, which affect voting outcomes. Using administrative migration and voting data, we show that emigration from Poland following its accession to the European Union in 2004 caused an increase in vote shares for right-wing parties, while decreasing the vote share for left-wing parties due to emigrants’ missing left-leaning votes. To account for endogenous migration patterns, we construct an innovative instrument that measures the distance to the closest open EU border. Our results highlight that emigration enhances stayers’ trust in right-wing governments and increases stayers’ voting for parties with pro-European positions. Exploiting a change in voting rules over time allows to disentangle different mechanisms. These results have important implications for the design of voting policies.","Migration is a global phenomenon that is continuously increasing and has reached 281 million people or 3.6 percent of the world’s population (UN DESA, 2020). Migration flows are highly asymmetric and certain countries, including China, India, and many Central and Eastern European countries, experience large outflows. There is a substantial economic literature focusing on the effects of emigration on origin countries, mostly focusing on brain drain versus brain gain concerns and remittances. Political effects, especially the effects on voting in origin countries, have received less attention. High emigration rates can, however, have a substantial impact on election results in the origin country if emigrants are a selected group and are less likely to cast their votes from abroad.====For governments facing a close race for reelection, the votes from abroad can be decisive.==== Many governments have therefore started to run election campaigns in countries that have a large diaspora (Kernalegenn and van Heute, 2020, Burgess, 2020), two examples being the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan campaigning in Germany and the Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador visiting major U.S. cities. Depending on the political preferences of the diaspora, governments can also strategically choose specific registration and voting procedures to facilitate or complicate voting from abroad. For instance, there exists anecdotal evidence from the Polish diaspora that the recent government has changed voting procedures and modes that regulate voting from abroad to make it more difficult, as the diaspora is more likely to vote for the opposition. The goal of this paper is to causally analyse the role of emigration on election outcomes in the country of origin.====The case of Poland is an interesting setting to study the effects of emigration on election results in the origin-country. Especially after the accession to the European Union (EU) and the subsequent introduction of free labour mobility to other EU countries, Poland has experienced large emigration rates, resulting in 4.8 million Polish citizens currently living abroad (12.5 percent of the total population according to UN DESA (2020)). This is not surprising, given the huge wage differentials within the EU. Polish citizens living abroad are much less likely to participate in elections in Poland. Across different destinations and years, the turnout of Polish citizens abroad in elections in Poland is rarely larger than 10 percent, as opposed to an average of 50 percent of Polish citizens in Poland. Factors like desire for political participation, moral values, future plans, time and effort costs, and attention to politics can explain the low turnout of nonresident eligible citizens in voting back home (Szulecki et al., 2021). In addition, Polish citizens residing abroad vote very differently in Poland. They are a selected group of citizens, distinct in education and age, and they also differ in political preferences (Berlinschi and Harutyunyan, 2019). Emigration thus changes the structure of the population remaining in the country of origin, which has important consequences for voting there.====This paper asks the following research question: What are the causal effects of emigration on origin-country election outcomes? In particular, does the selected emigration of high-skilled labour migrants lead to changes in the distribution of political preferences in a democratic origin country? The different election outcomes we focus on are: vote share for the right-wing and left-wing parties, for pro-European parties, as well as incumbents. We use detailed administrative emigration data and merge it with official election results of all elections between 2001 and 2019 at the county level in Poland. To account for endogeneity, for instance resulting from unobserved economic conditions, we instrument emigration from Poland with distance to the closest EU border and add time variation by exploiting the gradual opening of different EU destination labour markets. The gradual opening of EU labour markets is important for two reasons. First, it is this opening that has led to the large emigration of Poland and to the strong selection patterns of Polish emigrants. Due to this large emigration wave, we have missing parts in the distribution of political preference in Poland, which affect voting outcomes. Second, this gradual opening allows us to construct an instrument for emigration allowing us a causal impact evaluation. Our first stage results show that the distance to the closest open EU border (instrument) is a strong predictor of emigration, both when we measure distance in kilometres and when we use travel time. We argue that our instrument is exogenous because a county’s distance to a specific border is pre-determined and we consider it very unlikely that individual counties within Poland were able to influence the labour market opening decisions of destination countries. Our results consistently show that larger emigration rates increase the vote share for the right-wing party (Law and Justice PiS, Civic Platform PO or earlier existing right-wing parties and coalitions), while decreasing the vote share for left-wing parties in Poland. This is consistent with a change in the structure of the remaining population which is older and less educated after the emigration of the young and well educated Poles. These findings hold both when using an Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) and when relying on the instrumental variable (IV) approach. In general, the effects of emigration on voters’ preferences are stronger using an IV approach.====As an alternative outcome, we show that stayers’ trust in Polish right-wing governments also increases in counties and periods affected by large emigration. This analysis is implemented with the Life in Transition Survey, conducted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank in 2006, 2010, and 2016 in Poland. It provides information on values and attitudes for Polish citizens at the county-level and shows that Polish counties with above-average emigration numbers have more trust in right-wing parties in Poland due to the selective emigration of those that are more left-leaning.====In addition, we analyse voting for parties with pro-European positions and voting for the incumbent in Poland. We find that emigration increases voting for parties with pro-European positions. Given that emigrants are more likely to be pro-European, one could have expected that those left-behind are less likely to vote pro-European. There are several potential explanations for this counter-intuitive result, including increased incentives and intentions to migrate in the future, reduced labour market competition, and remittances. Furthermore, we do not find any robust or significant effects for vote shares for the incumbent parties in Poland.====There are different reasons why emigration affects voting outcomes in the country of origin. The central hypothesis of this paper is that emigration results in a selected group of voters being absent. If Polish emigrants are more likely to vote for a specific type of party and are less likely to vote from abroad, then this party is missing votes due to emigration. In addition, emigration can have effects on the economy which result in different voting patterns. Dustmann et al. (2015) reveal that wages in Poland increased as a result of increasing emigration and Giesing and Laurentsyeva (2017) show that emigration led to a decline in total factor productivity in new EU member states. Furthermore, emigrants interact with their family and friends back home and remit money, knowledge and social norms to their origin. Fackler et al. (2020), for instance, find that emigration increases knowledge transfer and thus innovation in the home country. Rapoport et al. (2021) show that migrants disseminate cultural values and norms from destination to origin countries. Paarlberg (2017) highlights the role of having family members abroad for political activism. All of the above mentioned reasons can have different implications for voting. The fact that our estimates are particularly large in the earlier time period, when voting by post was not possible, provides suggestive evidence that missing votes are a crucial channel.====We provide a number of robustness checks to emphasise that the findings are not driven by inherent differences between counties and that the instrument is valid. The results are robust to including county-level controls such as the number of unemployed, GDP per capita, average incomes, the industry, age or education structure, as well as time and region fixed effects and their interaction. Moreover, our findings remain robust to using alternative specifications of the instrument and applying a matching technique to compare only similar counties. In addition, we use an alternative party classification system to show that results do not depend on a specific classification system.====The most closely related paper is by Anelli and Peri (2017). Similar to us, they find evidence for the so-called “exit effect”, i.e., the departure of liberal-minded voters decreases their influence on politics at home (Hirschman, 1993). Anelli and Peri (2017) show that emigration from Italy in the aftermath of the financial crisis hindered political change as local elected officials were less likely to be young, college-educated, and female.==== To the best of our knowledge, this is the only other paper that analyses the causal effects of emigration on election outcomes for a democratic origin country. In contrast to us, their main outcomes of interest are characteristics of local elected politicians. We instead focus on national parliamentary election outcomes in the home country and use a different instrumental variable. In addition, the emigrants in our context are not fleeing from a recession and are therefore differently self-selected.====There is a larger economic literature that analyses the effects of emigration on democratisation in the home country.==== This literature typically highlights the existence of political remittances, i.e., the spillover of political norms and values that emigrants to democratic countries transfer to their network in the home country. Cross-country comparisons (Spilimbergo, 2009, Docquier et al., 2016) show that emigration can promote democracy and improve political quality at the origin for a large set of countries. Mercier (2016) studies the migration experience of political leaders across different countries between 1960 and 2004 and concludes that leaders who studied abroad and come to power in autocratic settings have a positive influence on democratic development in their home country. This strand of research is complemented by specific country studies that focus on the precise mechanism that links emigration to democracy. Barsbai et al. (2017) illustrate that Moldovan emigrants to democratic countries had political norm spillovers to their network and inspired them to vote for a democratic party. Pfutze (2012) shows that the larger the proportion of migrant households in Mexican municipalities, the larger the vote share for the opposition party in 2000–2002. Karadja and Prawitz (2019) analyse historical Swedish data and find that the mass emigration to the U.S. in the nineteenth century increased labour movement membership, strike participation and voting for left-wing parties. Batista and Vicente (2011) and Chauvet and Mercier (2014) study the effects of return migrants and show that return migrants promote political accountability in Cape Verde and political participation in Mali, respectively.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document an increase in right-wing voting in the home country resulting from emigration. Populist right-wing parties are on the rise all over Europe and we contribute by providing a new determinant that can explain their increasing importance.==== Second, we look at a developed and democratic EU member state. The results from most of the previous literature are based on non-democratic countries and highlight progress in democratisation. In a country that is already democratic, one would expect different results. We contribute by showing that the effect between emigration and democratisation is non-existent for a developed country such as Poland. Third, we show a causal effect based on an instrumental variable strategy that has not been used before in this literature. We thus contribute by strengthening the causal interpretation of the effect.====The paper has important implications beyond elections in Poland. Several other Central and Eastern European countries that have joined the EU since 2004 are experiencing similar emigration rates and a rise in right-wing governments.==== The paper also has implications for the creation of fair voting policies in the context of globalisation. As migration is increasing, so is the number of citizens that are casting their vote from abroad. The voting procedures and modes for citizens residing abroad vary over time and by country of origin but in general, voting from abroad is more costly in terms of effort and time. In many cases, one needs to travel to the closest embassy or consulate, which might be several hours away. Voting by mail from abroad has only recently been introduced in most countries. In addition, one typically needs to pre-register, which is an additional administrative burden. These difficulties lead to very low voter turnout rates of migrants, effectively disenfranchising parts of the population (Peltoniemi, 2016). Governments should therefore ensure that citizens with foreign residence can cast their vote in an easy way. Voting by mail and increasing the locations where one can cast a vote are simple measures. One has to keep in mind, however, that the incumbent does not always have incentives to facilitate voting from abroad. Typically, incumbents know if citizens residing abroad are voting in their favour or not and can thus strategically facilitate or hinder the voting process abroad (Hutcheson and Arrighi, 2015, Wellman, 2021, Umpierrez de Reguero et al., 2021).====This paper is structured as follows.

To derive plausibly causal estimates, I exploit the quasi-experimental setting in Germany, by which refugees are allocated to different counties by state authorities without being able to choose their locations themselves. This study finds that higher shares of refugees in a county increased migrants’ attachment to their home countries, while not affecting their perceived belonging to Germany. Further analyses uncover strong heterogeneities with respect to country of origin and suggest that concerns about xenophobia, experiences of discrimination, and the consumption of foreign media contributed to these effects. Lastly, I find that changes in ethnic identity coincide with the political polarization of migrants.","In the last decades, immigration has increasingly become a politically salient and hotly discussed topic in many Western countries. Not only has it galvanized voters in the 2016 US presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum, but it has also fueled populist movements in virtually all European countries (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). One of the most impactful events in recent times was the European Refugee Crisis (ERC) in 2015. It polarized the political landscape in many European countries, with concern about the safety and welfare of refugees on one side and fear and worry about them on the other (Hangartner et al., 2018, Rodrik, 2020). These dynamics were particularly pronounced in Germany, where over the span of only a few months close to a million asylum seekers arrived. At first, many Germans were accommodating, with a broad spectrum of society helping to provide immediate aid and support for the incoming. Yet over time, critical voices grew louder, leading to vocal anti-immigrant movements and culminating in far-right ==== (AfD) entering into the ==== (German national parliament) in 2017 (Arzheimer and Berning, 2019).====While public and scientific discourse was often mainly focused on either the integration of refugees or the concerns of the German population (Gehrsitz and Ungerer, 2017, Aksoy et al., 2020), little attention has been paid to the reaction of migrants already living in Germany. Yet, migrants are an important and growing group in Germany, who may be distinctly affected by the newly arrived refugees, as they compete for the similar jobs and resources in society. Moreover, many European countries still struggle to integrate parts of their immigrant community, resulting in far worse labor market outcomes for migrants compared to natives (e.g., Dustmann et al., 2013). While researchers have studied which factors affect migrant integration, increased attention has been paid to the importance of identity in recent years, and more specifically, the effects of ethnic identity==== (e.g., Battu and Zenou, 2010, Casey and Dustmann, 2010, Manning and Roy, 2010). Adding to this literature, this study examines the effects the 2015 ERC had on already resident migrants, looking at how it affected their attachment to Germany and their original home country, respectively.====Theoretically, this study builds on a social psychological framework called intergroup threat theory (Stephan et al., 2008, Stephan et al., 2015), which states that members of ingroups can perceive threats from outgroups and may change their behavior accordingly. In the context of the ERC, migrants may perceive threats from two groups: either from refugees themselves or from natives, who in response to refugee inflows engage in xenophobic or discriminatory behavior against all migrants. Such threats can be realistic (affecting the ingroup’s resources or welfare) or symbolic (affecting self-image, values and belief systems). Among other consequences, Stephan et al. (2015) argue that perceiving threats against the group can lead ingroup members to increase their group cohesion, which in the case of this study would translate to increased home country attachment.====To test this theory, I examine the 2015 European Refugee Crisis, which offers a quasi-natural experiment in the form of an arguably exogenous migration shock. Starting on 5 September 2015, Germany allowed refugees stuck in other European countries to cross its border, leading to a sudden and very strong increase of asylum seekers in Germany of approximately 890,000 refugees until the end of 2015 (BAMF, 2016b). After arrival, refugees were unable to choose their locations themselves, but were placed by the authorities to individual states, counties, and municipalities. The distribution to different states (====) followed a pre-determined quota called the “Königstein Key” (====), which is based on state population and tax revenue (Stips and Kis-Katos, 2020). Within states, refugees were placed to counties according to rules set by each state. For example, nine of 16 states allocated refugees according to the population size of counties, while others had fixed and previously agreed upon quotas (Geis and Orth, 2016). Importantly, residents in neighborhoods, where refugee reception facilities were established, had no influence on the allocation of asylum seekers. This was particularly true for migrants, who – by virtue of being a minority in society and oftentimes ineligible to vote – have little voice in these decisions.====In this study, I exploit the plausibly exogenous variation that arose from the placement of asylum seekers during the ERC, an approach which has previously been used in studies like Tomberg et al. (2021) and Torres (2022). Thereby, I am interested in how the inflow of a large outgroup, the refugees, affected the ethnic identity of resident migrants, which in the context of this study is the ingroup. In other words, I ask: How did the change in the local refugee share impact migrants’ attachment to Germany and their connection to their or their parents’ home country? To arrive at arguably causal estimates, I employ a variant of a difference-in-differences approach, regressing the two mentioned measures of ethnic identity on an interaction of the change in refugees over population per county (====) between 2014 and 2015.====In my estimations, I use individual-level data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative longitudinal household survey, that provides time-varying information on migrants’ identity measures. Due to its panel structure, it allows me to include individual fixed effects, which capture any time-constant differences across individuals. Attachment to Germany is measured through the question, to what extent migrants feel German, while the other outcome is captured by asking how connected migrants feel to their own or their parents’ home country. For the main explanatory variable, I use administrative end-of-year data on the recipients of asylum seekers’ benefits per county, which reflect actual refugee inflows very well.====To argue that the ERC offers an arguably exogenous migration shock requires the explanatory variable to be unaffected by the outcomes of interest and any confounding factor in the error term. There are three potential threats to the identification. First, migrants’ identification with their home or host country itself could affect placement more or less directly. Testing whether my outcome variables influenced the placement of refugees directly, I find no effect of migrants’ ethnic identity on refugee allocation. Second, refugees could be placed where immigrants generally integrate faster socially and economically. If better integrated migrants identify more with Germany and less with their home country, this could bias results. Nevertheless, I show that the placement of refugees per county was independent of a host of integration outcomes of migrants, including social, economic, and demographic measures. Lastly, there could be other confounding factors that are not controlled for in my main estimation equation. To assess this possibility, I include a myriad of further controls into my regression.====Overall, I find that increases in refugee concentration led to an increase in migrants’ attachment to their home countries, while having no significant impact on their identification with Germany, on aggregate. Results imply that a mean increase in counties’ asylum seeker share of .77 percentage points increased the number of respondents identifying strongly or very strongly with their home country by 2.18 percentage points. Using an event-study analysis, I can also show that there does not appear to be a pre-trend, suggesting that respondents in counties with higher inflows were not on a different trajectory than respondents in other counties.====My results are robust to a range of different specifications and possible objections, most importantly the regression method, scaling of the dependent variable, the exclusion of outliers, and sample selection, but also omitted variable bias, clustering of standard errors, and different specifications of the treatment variable.====In further analyses, I find substantial heterogeneities in these effects along migrants’ country of origin. On one side, migrants from Eastern European countries, particularly those who are not ethnic Germans (====), became significantly less attached to Germany and more attached to their home countries the more asylum seekers were placed in their county. On the other side, I observe opposite (albeit insignificant) effects for Western migrants, who increased their attachment to Germany while decreasing the connection to their home countries. Lastly, migrants from Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa (TMENA) became less attached to Germany, with no change in their home country attachment in response to the treatment.====In this study, I argue that these results indicate that migrants perceived a threat from refugee placement, which differed between migrant groups. Examining the underlying causes of migrants’ threat perceptions, I find that migrants’ concerns about crime, job security, and immigration did not increase in counties that housed more asylum seekers. Rather, I identify two potential factors: First, worries about xenophobia increased in areas with more refugees and treatment effects only appear for migrants who had previous experiences of discrimination. Both indicate that migrants may have perceived an indirect threat from refugee placement, not coming from refugees but as a potential backlash from natives. Second, I find that only immigrants, who consumed foreign-language media, experienced significant treatment effects. On one side, Eastern European media, including social media (Sablina, 2021), was often much more critical of Germany’s handling and more hostile towards refugees than Western media (Georgiou and Zaborowski, 2017). This likely contributed to migrants feeling directly threatened by refugees. Media from TMENA countries, on the other side, was more empathetic towards refugees but often invoked narratives of state control (Sert and Danış, 2021). This likely stood in contrast with experiences of viewers in Germany, who may have feared that the German government would be unable to protect them from xenophobia and discrimination.====In a last extension, I check whether the ERC also had an impact on other outcomes that could be associated with migrants’ ethnic identity, as a number of studies have stressed its importance on the labor market (e.g., Battu and Zenou, 2010), in school (e.g., Baysu et al., 2011) but also in shaping political preferences and voting behavior (Teney et al., 2010, Baysu and Swyngedouw, 2020, Mayer et al., 2023). While the placement of refugees does not appear to have already affected labor market and educational outcomes of migrants, it seems to have had an impact on political preferences. For once, migrants became more interested in politics in areas with higher relative inflows. Moreover, preferences for political parties increased in response to the treatment, too, with Western migrants leaning more strongly towards moderately left-wing parties, while Eastern European and TMENA migrants increasingly preferred the far-right AfD and the socialist ==== (The Left), respectively, indicating some kind of political polarization. This shift in preferences would be in line with each migrant group’s threat perception: Eastern European migrants particularly felt threatened by refugees themselves, which motivated some to favor the anti-refugee party. TMENA migrants felt more threatened by xenophobic actions from natives, therefore some started supporting a party more vocally opposed to anti-Muslim xenophobia.====This study contributes, first, to the evolving literature on identity (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Shayo, 2009) and, more specifically, ethnic identification in economics (Constant and Zimmermann, 2008, Georgiadis and Manning, 2013, Bisin et al., 2016). While group identification and measures of belonging have already been studied intensively in sociology and social psychology (Berry, 1997, Ellemers et al., 2002), economists have more recently become interested in this topic. Although there are some extant studies that descriptively investigate the determinants of ethnic identity (e.g., Dustmann, 1996, Manning and Roy, 2010), we know only little about the causal factors determining why some migrants identify more or less with their home and host countries. This study tries to at least partly ameliorate that by exploiting the quasi-random setting of the ERC in Germany, examining whether the large-scale refugee inflows causally affected the ethnic identity of existing migrants in the short term. Second, this study adds to the literature on ethnic identity and the assimilation of migrants. Although its exact effects often depend on the specific circumstances, previous studies have found that ethnic identity affects labor market outcomes, with some finding evidence that host country identification relates positively to labor market outcomes (e.g., Nekby and Rödin, 2010, Piracha et al., 2021), while the opposite is the case for home country attachment (e.g., Battu and Zenou, 2010, Bisin et al., 2011, Monscheuer, 2020).==== Furthermore, it is transmitted across generations (Casey and Dustmann, 2010), affecting second-generation educational, social, and labor market outcomes (Schüller, 2015, Monscheuer, 2020). As refugee inflows of the ERC impacted the ethnic identity of migrants, this may in extension influence labor market outcomes and overall assimilation in the long run. Third, my study adds to existing studies that exploit the dispersal policy of asylum seekers in Germany more generally (Glitz, 2012, Jaschke et al., 2022), and more specifically for the case of the ERC,==== being one of the first to focus on the effects on already resident immigrants.==== Fourthly, my study adds to the literature on the interactions between different minority groups in society. While some studies have looked at potentials of inter-group solidarity (Glasford and Calcagno, 2012), others have focused on sources of tension, particularly between African Americans and immigrant groups in the US (Gay, 2006, Fouka et al., 2022), but also different minority groups in Europe (Hindriks et al., 2014, Leidig, 2019). Lastly, my findings also contribute to the literature on the determinants of immigrants’ and other minorities’ political preferences (e.g., Dancygier and Saunders, 2006, Abrajano and Singh, 2009, Bergh and Bjørklund, 2011), including the literature on migrant groups preferring right-wing and far-right parties (Wüst, 2004, Hansen and Olsen, 2020).====The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows. In Section 2, I lay out some theoretical considerations motivated by intergroup threat theory, followed up by an overview of the ERC and the institutional background in Germany in Section 3. I then describe the data used, introduce my methodological approach and provide evidence for the exogeneity of my empirical strategy (Section 4). Section 5 presents my main results and shows that the are robust to a number of possible objections. In this section, I also examine the roles of several migrant concerns, past experiences of discrimination, and media consumption, and look at whether further outcomes were affected by the ERC. In the final section, I conclude my study.",Belonging or estrangement—The European Refugee Crisis and its effects on immigrant identity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000381,17 April 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

The contests rewarded regional economic success. The probability of promotion increased with regional infrastructure investment but we find negative returns from infrastructure. We find feedback between corruption and investment in infrastructure. There was moral hazard – successful local government leaders who were promoted to higher level positions in the government and Party hierarchical structure left behind regional local governments mired in debt or bankruptcy because of debt financing of infrastructure investment that was used to win the center-orchestrated contests. Our study makes a contribution to contest theory by providing an empirical study for rent-seeking contests.,"We study center-orchestrated regional economic-success contests in China. The winners of the contests among local and regional governments were promoted to higher level positions within the governmental hierarchy. We focus on infrastructure investment as a major instrument for economic growth for winning the contests for promotion. The probability of officials being promoted increased with infrastructure investment in their locality but we find negative returns to regional infrastructure investment, indicating inefficiency through overinvestment. We also find a feedback relation between infrastructure investment and corruption, with increased infrastructure investment providing more opportunities for benefit for officials through returns from corruption and corruption increasing infrastructure investment.====The contests for promotion were therefore counterproductive. Pro-growth public policy with counterproductive incentives resulted in wasteful investment. Corruption, which has been endemic within the government bureaucracies in China (Kahana and Liu, 2010; Chen and Liu, 2015; Aidt et al., 2020) was encouraged. Importantly, there was moral hazard. Regional and local officials borrowed on behalf of regional and local governments to increase infrastructure investment, resulting in unsustainable debt, and, in many cases that we document, there was regional or local government bankruptcy. The officials who won the contests moved on to different locations and to greater personal benefits from higher levels of the governmental hierarchy.====Most basically, rent-seeking incentives contests were created. Tullock (1967) observed that there was a social cost of contestability of rents. The theory of contests has described how rents are contested (Congleton et al., 2008a; Konrad, 2009; Corchón and Serena, 2018; Hillman and Long, 2019). There have been applications of the theory (Congleton et al., 2008b). The literature has, however, lacked study of actual contests. Hillman (2023) proposed that, with the contests described in contest theory unobservable, the existence of contests can be inferred from observed rents and successful rent seekers that are “footprints in the sand” for the unobserved contests that have taken place. The “footprints” are quite explicit in our study, which shows the means by which rents were contested (infrastructure investment), the rents (promotion in the governmental or Party hierarchy), and we observe the successful rent seekers who won promotion in the contests. We do not observe social loss in the actual contests through the time and effort of rent seekers as described in the contest models. We do observe social loss of contestability of rents through excessive infrastructure investment and through local debt and bankruptcies that have been the consequences of moral hazard.====Contest theory includes models of contest design whereby a contest designer orchestrates a contest to maximize “effort” of contest participants (on orchestration of contests, see Gradstein and Konrad, 1999). We show that the contests orchestrated by the central government in China departed from the model of contest design in that the contest designers created counterproductive incentives. Excessive “effort” resulted in negative-yielding overinvestment and through moral hazard resulted in financial difficulties for local and regional governments whose borrowing financed infrastructure for the benefit of officials’ promotion prospects.",Pro-growth inefficiency: Rents and moral hazard in infrastructure contests in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000411,Available online 15 April 2023,2023,Research Article,8.0

We use logistic regression models to associate three groups of specific factors with a greater or lesser probability of compliance with the rule: the ,"In recent decades, fiscal policy rules have gained popularity as a tool to enhance fiscal discipline and credibility. In 1995, only 23 countries had such rules, with 15 belonging to the European Union. As of 2021, the number of countries with at least one fiscal rule had increased to 105 (see Davoodi et al. (2022a)). This trend is also apparent in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), where only one country implemented a fiscal rule in 2000. By 2022, approximately half of the countries in the region had at least one fiscal rule in force.====Despite the widespread adoption of fiscal rules, the focus has been mainly on how the presence of a fiscal rule achieves fiscal discipline and reduces deficit and debt biases. While a fiscal rule can promote fiscal discipline and reduce deficit and debt biases, it is not guaranteed that public finances will follow this path. As more data about compliance with implemented rules is available, it is possible to identify the diverse effects on the fiscal balances of having ==== complying with a fiscal rule. Understanding what it takes to comply with an implemented fiscal rule is a first step to strengthening the analysis of the role of fiscal rules in improving fiscal balances.====In this paper, we focus on numerical compliance with the rules, and analyze which factors increase compliance and can lead to more efficient design and implementation efforts. While strict compliance may not always be necessary to achieve the desired economic effects, a better understanding of the drivers of compliance is essential (see Reuter (2015)). In this way, our approach empirically examines which factors have influenced numerical compliance with fiscal rules in LAC countries over the period 2000 to 2020.====To investigate the factors influencing compliance with fiscal rules in LAC countries, we use an empirical model where we associate three groups of specific factors with a greater or lesser probability of compliance with the rule. First, we consider the motivations, or reasons, why a country implements a rule in the first place. Descriptive and empirical work on fiscal rules has shown that often countries implement a rule as a fiscal tool to improve the sustainability of public finances and as commitment devices (see Debrun and Kumar, 2007, IMF, 2009, Eyraud et al., 2018, Barreix et al., 2019). In this way, changes in the macroeconomic panorama affecting public finance sustainability or accessibility to the country’s financing could influence their behavior and, therefore, compliance with the rules.====Another strand of literature has identified that governments prefer rule-based policies because they can protect the fiscal policy from corruption and possible principal–agent problems between political voters and authorities (see Drazen, 2004, Hagen, 2005, Wren-Lewis, 2013). Therefore, different configurations of the political environment can lead to different compliance outcomes. Finally, the need for fiscal rules to react to unexpected shocks has been highlighted at the operational level. Specifically, over time, several countries have included some features in the design of the rule to give them a greater degree of flexibility, transparency, and accountability (see Schaechter et al., 2012, Eyraud et al., 2018, Davoodi et al., 2022a). To the extent that the rules’ design responds to the countries’ needs, it is possible that the compliance record will improve since it would no longer be affected by unforeseen situations. Additionally, the efficiency of governments and the quality of institutions matter for fiscal outcomes. For instance, Bergman and Hutchison (2015) shows that when governments can manage and enforce their fiscal rules, these can effectively reduce the procyclicality of fiscal policy. Considering the dimension of compliance with the fiscal rule allows us to investigate whether they result from strong institutions or are the support of better fiscal performance.====Among the different factors we consider, we find that only changes in the macroeconomic environment, such as a wider output gap or increased inflation, affect the probability of compliance in LAC countries. This result is consistent with the idea that fiscal rules are frequently implemented to guide fiscal policy towards a more sustainable path or build an external reputation based on fiscal discipline. Changes in the macroeconomic environment can influence fiscal efforts to comply with the fiscal rule, mainly when the objectives are defined as a function of specific macroeconomic aggregates (e.g., GDP growth). However, that the government’s institutional environment and the rule’s design do not play an essential role in the result of compliance is an important point to consider when it comes to the optimal design and framework of fiscal rules. Considering recent reforms to fiscal rules in LAC countries, we observe that often great efforts are aimed at improving its institutional design while the definition of the objectives or restrictions is revised less frequently. Our results suggest that many of these changes do not end up being decisive for rule compliance.====The contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold. First, we estimate the possible determinants of compliance outcomes using numerical compliance rates for LAC countries and the rules implemented between 2000 and 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper analyzing what has influenced the countries’ compliance behavior for these economies. Second, we propose a framework comparable to previous work on compliance with fiscal rules in other regions. In this way, the determinants of compliance with fiscal rules for the LAC region can be compared with other types of economies where data is available, such as the European Union (see Larch and Santacroce (2020)).====Our work also contributes to the policy discussion of recalibrating fiscal rules in the region post the Covid-19 pandemic shock. The pandemic had significant effects on the supply and demand side, leading to weakened fiscal positions of countries and inevitable deterioration of fiscal balances, as well as increased spending and total debt. As the pandemic unfolded, it became clear that the pre-established fiscal rules and long-term commitments were too rigid and could not accommodate the necessary response from governments. The new macroeconomic conditions are not necessarily compatible with pre-pandemic objectives, creating a need to recalibrate the rules’ objectives and improve their design. Our paper’s results on the main determinants of compliance with fiscal rules help to understand the elements that increase compliance and shed light on upcoming reforms by revealing what has worked and what has not.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 presents the methodology for the estimations and descriptive statistics. Section 4 contains the results of estimating the determinants of compliance in LAC countries.

If so, how long does it take? Can diffusion cause path dependence, such that if a region is initially democratic (or autocratic), it becomes increasingly so? In this paper I estimate short and long run regional democratic diffusion and account for feedback to and from other countries within the region. Although it is difficult to establish causality, I estimate that when regional democracy in year (t-1) increases, domestic democracy receives or “catches” 40–42% of the increase in the next 5 years, 55–61% in 10 years, and 68–85% in the long run prior to accounting for feedback.

I also provide region-specific and contiguous neighbor estimates, use the model to explain ==== waves, and estimate the alternative V-DEM dataset. In the V-DEM data, democracy diffuses much faster, although the long-run diffusion effects are comparable.","Democracy has been related to poverty reductions, human rights, happiness, and other beneficial outcomes (Frey and Stutzer, 2000; Davenport and Armstrong, 2004; McGann, 2004; Ross, 2006; Inglehart et al., 2008; Bjørnskov et al., 2010) and democratic transitions have often occurred in regional waves (Huntington, 1991; Wejnert, 2005; Gleditsch, 2009; Hale, 2013). For example, Fig. 1 depicts the average polity2 democracy score in the Polity 5 dataset from 1962 to 2018 in six regions of the world. Although common unobserved factors might explain these regional trends, democratic diffusion could also play a role. For example, democratization in other countries within the region might increase the salience of democracy, coordinate the citizens on protesting, teach them protest techniques, or signal that the return to protesting is higher than expected, thus, increasing the “demand” for democracy or advancing democracy from below (Bamert et al., 2015; Arezki et al., 2020; González, 2020; Manacorda and Tesei, 2020; Marino et al., 2020). Alternatively, democratization elsewhere might increase internal divisions or decrease external support for the autocratic elite, thus, increasing the “supply” of democracy or advancing democracy from above (Teorell, 2010; Escribà-Folch et al., 2015; Hyde, 2020).====In this paper, although I do not advance the study of the causal mechanisms behind democratic diffusion, I propose two methodological contributions to understanding the spread of democracy within different regions of the world. First, I estimate short and long run democratic diffusion within regions in a unified empirical framework (an error-correction model). The short and long run diffusion effects could intuitively differ due to several reasons. For example, the short-run effects might be transitory as ousted elites conduct counterrevolutions or countries revert to their long-run democracy levels, which might be determined by domestic or non-diffusion international factors (Lipset, 1959; Nunn, 2009; Kalyvitis and Vlachaki, 2012; Hicks, 2013; Bjørnskov and Rode, 2020; Dorsch and Maarek, 2020; Pittaluga et al., 2020). Alternatively, the short-run effects might increase over time because autocratic regimes can temporarily resist democratization pressure, but they cannot permanently do so. Second, I allow for dynamic feedback from domestic democracy changes to future regional changes, then back to the domestic country in the following period, etc. This allows me to test whether democratic diffusion can create path dependence in the sense that, if a region is initially democratic, the remaining autocracies will eventually democratize and the region will then remain democratic all else constant. Conversely, if the region is initially autocratic, it eventually becomes trapped in autocracy (all else constant). If democracy exhibits path dependence at the region level, temporary political interventions, such as colonization or Cold War interventions, can have permanent effects (Leeson and Dean, 2009).====To address these questions, I estimate short and long-run regional democratic diffusion in an error-correction model. The error-correction model relates the change in the polity2 democracy score from the Polity 5 dataset and the Freedom Rating from Freedom House to the lagged democracy level as well as the lagged level and recent changes in other countries in the region. The coefficients on the regional change terms can be interpreted as the short-run effects while the level coefficients are proportional to the long-term effects. I estimate that when regional democracy increases, in the language of Leeson and Dean (2009), domestic democracy “catches” 40–42% of the increase in the next 5 years, 55–61% in the next 10 years, and 68–85% in the long run without accounting for feedback. However, even accounting for feedback, the average region still converges to a unique long-run democracy level (which is inconsistent with path dependence).====When I apply the error-correction framework to individual regions, I find that the evidence for regional diffusion is clearest in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. However, the lack of evidence for some other regions (including Western countries and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union) might reflect data limitations. When I estimate diffusion from contiguous neighbors as opposed to intra-regional diffusion, I find that the effects are significantly smaller, which suggests that contiguous neighbors do not play am outsized role (O'loughlin et al., 1998). Finally, I also estimate the Varieties of Democracy (V-DEM) dataset. This data reflects a broader range of possible definitions of democracy and democratic practices than the Polity 5 and Freedom House datasets (Coppedge et al., 2017). In the V-DEM dataset, I estimate that democracy diffuses much faster: When regional democracy increases, countries catch most of the increase in only two years. However, the long-run effects are slightly smaller. Altogether, although these results can only establish Granger causality, they are consistent with regional democratic diffusion.====The paper contributes to the literature on democratic diffusion. First, I estimate short and long-run democratic diffusion in a unified framework that allows for gradual democratic diffusion. In the existing literature, Wejnert (2005), Brinks and Coppedge (2006), Leeson and Dean (2009), and Houle et al. (2016) estimate short-run diffusion, which leaves the long-run effects unclear. For example, the short-run effects might be temporary as ousted elites conduct counter-revolutions, permanent, as new democracies become consolidated, or increase over time because autocracies can temporarily, but only temporarily, resist democratization pressure. Kelejian et al. (2013) study long-run institutional spillovers and Rahman (2017) links domestic democracy to contemporary neighbor democracy. However, both econometric frameworks assume that the diffusion process is instantaneous as opposed to gradual. Thus, they cannot explain democratization ==== unless the exogenous determinants of democracy change appropriately to produce the wave. In this paper, I allow the average country's as well as the average regional democracy level to gradually adjust toward the long run level and allow the data to determine how long the diffusion process takes.====Second, the paper allows for dynamic feedback from domestic changes in democracy to and from changes in democracy in other countries within the region. I characterize the evolution of the average regional democracy level as a function of time, initial democracy, diffusion and convergence effects, and long-run democracy determinants. Third, I use the dynamic nature of the model to explain democratization waves. Although the error-correction model can only explain either upward ==== downward waves unless the parameters or exogenous democracy determinants change, I discuss how changing either the parameters or the exogenous determinants of democracy could, potentially, produce “complete” democratization waves (i.e., upward followed by downward waves or vice versa). Finally, the paper estimates short and long run democracy diffusion in the V-DEM dataset and presents region-specific estimates.====In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 presents the materials and methods. Section 3 presents the baseline results. Section 4 discusses robustness. Section 5 presents regional estimates. Section 6 presents contiguous neighbor estimates. Section 7 applies the model to democratization waves (Huntington, 1991). Section 8 estimates the V-DEM democracy dataset (Coppedge et al., 2022; Pemstein et al., 2022).

It aims to establish whether public investment crowds in private investment, to what extent, and in which public policy areas the effect is stronger. The estimation results demonstrate that in the medium to long-term, extra public investment crowds in private investment as the latter adjusts to bring the stock of private capital closer to its long-term cointegrating relationship with public capital. The long-run public investment multiplier is around 2, which means that each additional dollar of public investment eventually attracts approximately two dollars of private investment. Public investment in economic affairs and infrastructure needed to improve human capital is the most effective in attracting private investment.","Accumulation of public capital is an important engine of economic growth (Abiad et al. (2016); Berg et al. (2012); Mourougane et al. (2016)). Over the past several decades, and especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, there has been a significant decline in public investment ratio.====It left scars on economic growth, as GDP growth rates remained subdued for several years after the crisis.==== In addition to the direct negative impact on GDP, the reduction in public investment could have led to a decline in private investment, which may have further negatively affected output. At the moment, awareness of the need to boost public sector investment is rising, particularly in light of climate change, the ongoing digitalization and the post-Covid recovery. Additional public investment in energy, telecommunications and infrastructure could encourage the private sector to accelerate private capital accumulation. In this paper, we study the relationship between public and private investment using a sample of advanced OECD economies and analyze the presence and the magnitude of the crowding-in effect, i.e. whether government investment attracts private investment and how strong this effect is.====Standard macroeconomic theory makes the traditional argument that increasing any type of government spending promotes competition for the available resources such as savings and labour, leading to higher interest rates. These in turn crowd out private activity such as consumption and investment. This channel is usually strong in the short-term, but we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about the relationship between public and private investment based solely on it. The possibility of the crowding-in effect in the longer term was first empirically explored by Aschauer (1989). Using the neoclassical production function approach, Aschauer (1989) confirms that in the short-term higher public investment raises public capital and pushes total capital stock of the economy above an optimal level chosen by rational economic agents, thus crowding out private investment. Conversely, in the longer term it increases the marginal productivity of private capital and crowds in private investment.====In the recent review of fiscal policy studies published after the financial crisis, Ramey (2019) pointed out that there has been surprisingly little evidence on the macroeconomic effects of public investment. He emphasized that the literature needs to focus on both the short-run and the longrun effects of infrastructure investment. In this study, we aim to fill this gap. Our objective is to contribute to the existing literature by examining the relationship between public and private investment from several perspectives. First, we investigate the possibility that public investment in specific areas is more successful in raising private capital productivity. Thus, for consumption Jalles and Karras (2022) demonstrate that the degree of complementarity between private and public consumption differs substantially across different spending categories. Second, we provide estimates of the public investment multiplier, which has been absent in the previous literature. To achieve the outlined goals, we examine the relationship between private and public investment in OECD economies over the period between 1995 and 2019.====The results obtained in this paper provide a strong evidence of the crowding-in effect. Private investment appears to react to changes in the deviation of private capital from its equilibrium path determined by public capital. More specifically, public investment cuts (hikes) lead to a decline (increase) in private investment. Furthermore, our findings suggest that in absolute terms private investment increases by more than one-to-one for each additional euro or dollar spent on public capital. The median value of the public investment multiplier reaches the value of 2 five-to-seven years after a public investment shock and exceeds 2 in an even longer term. Economic affairs and education are the areas where public investment is estimated to exhibit the strongest crowding-in effect, followed by recreation, culture and religion.====The findings of this paper suggest that insufficient government investment strongly depresses private investment and inhibits economic growth in the long-term. From the economic policy perspective it provides justification for fiscal rules to treat public investment in a different way as compared to other government spending items.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the previous literature. Section 3 lays down the methodology of the study and the data used. Section 4 presents the estimation results of private investment regressions. Section 5 provides robustness analysis of the obtained results, while Section 6 transforms the obtained regression coefficients into impulse responses of private investment to public investment and the public investment multiplier.

This finding is in ==== to the results reported by naive estimation strategies where the sample selection issue is completely ignored.","The United Nations (UN) has a target in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to significantly reduce all forms of corruption (Goal 16, UN General Assembly, 2015).==== As an inter-agency task team, the World Bank recognizes corruption as the main hindrance to ending extreme poverty by the target year of 2030 and enhancing the overall well-being of the poorest 40% of the population in developing countries (World Bank Brief, 2021).==== Corruption is defined as “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain” by Transparency International. It encompasses not only business and government bodies but also civil society, education, health, sports, and many other sectors. Corrupt practices institute a considerable amount of cost to society as a whole and come in various forms: social, economic, political, and environmental.====Given that corruption is such a worrisome phenomenon globally, an extensive literature has long been concerned with finding the empirical determinants of this illicit practice. However, to do so requires an empirical measure. And this is not straightforward, given the very nature of the activity. It is not only challenging to get unbiased data but having its validity unquestioned is equally difficult (Lambsdorff, 2006).====Early studies have heavily relied on ==== measures of corruption either at the country-level (for example, the perception-based index from Transparency International) or the state-level within a country (for example, convictions of public officials in the US from the Public Integrity Section).==== The country-level perception-based indices provided a means to enhance our understanding of the levels of corruption from one country to another (Lambsdorff, 2006). Simultaneously, within-country measures like convictions of public officials in the US helped capture the specific corruption environment observed in a country that may be considerably different from others. Pointing to this, Lambsdorff (2006, p. 82) states: “[T]he precise legal definition of bribery and corruption can be different in each national context, the differences drawn between bribery, embezzlement and fraud may be troublesome and the statistical methodology of counting and aggregating used in each national agency can differ considerably from that used elsewhere”.====These measures were, therefore, extremely valuable in developing the pertinent literature and contributing to our understanding of the crime to a significant extent. Nevertheless, such measures are not ideal and have their own limitations. They contain substantial measurement errors and do not vary much over time (Treisman, 2007, Choudhury, 2021). Moreover, the number of countries included, the total number of survey sources used, and the methodology applied to construct these measures generally change over the years. For example, the corruption perception index (CPI) used seven survey sources in 1995, with 41 countries in the sample. By 2018, CPI surveyed 180 countries with 13 different sources to construct the index.==== Additionally, because of a methodology change in 2012, CPI scores before this year are not comparable to that of later years.==== Besides these, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in cross-country or cross-state analysis while using such aggregate measures becomes difficult for empirical researchers.====Following this, various units within the World Bank started conducting firm-level surveys in the 1990s to assess the business environment across the globe. These surveys provided us with experience-based corruption measures for the first time. From 2005–06, a more consolidated approach towards this effort marked the beginning of Enterprise Surveys (ES) to report corruption measures at the ====.==== With this newly available measure, a large number of studies started exploring the empirical determinants of corruption afresh. This new disaggregated measure led to a deeper understanding of the relationships between corruption at the firm level and various other economic variables, thereby enabling researchers to study the phenomenon in detail. To be more specific, these data sets have been used in more than 564 journal articles, reports, and books between 1999 to 2021 – including corruption-focused studies – according to the official records of the World Bank.====While this new firm-level measure offers distinct advantages over the previous ones, it comes with its unique problem: ====. To the best of my knowledge, this issue has not been acknowledged so far, let alone addressed. If this issue indeed exists, as I comprehend, then ignoring it in the analysis may lead to an incorrect estimation of the parameters, thereby producing wrong inferences about the significance of the independent variables (Tonoyan et al., 2010). Under such a circumstance, all the empirical studies using the firm-level corruption measure from ES up to now as the outcome variable would bear the possibility of being erroneous in their implications. But before moving further with the details of this potential concern, it is helpful first to briefly establish the connection between firm-level corruption and entrepreneurial effort.====The most widespread opinion in this context is that corruption facilitates the entry of nascent entrepreneurs into a market, particularly when the quality of institutions is substandard. For example, when the entry regulations are intensive, offering bribes to government officials may help get away with some regulatory requirements. Supporting this, Damania et al. (2004) argue that weak institutions can actually create an extremely lucrative environment for bureaucratic corruption at a lower level. In this respect, Dreher and Gassebner (2013, p. 416) also state: “Despite the overall impact of corruption on growth being negative, it may still promote entrepreneurial activity which has been suppressed by rigid regulations”. In contrast to this popular belief, extant theories put forth an alternate viewpoint that is totally conflicting in nature (Myrdal, 1968, Shleifer and Vishny, 1993). In this school of thought, corruption is almost not ever helpful for entrepreneurship, even in the presence of an adverse business climate (Dutta and Sobel, 2016). Against this backdrop, empirical studies have not been able to provide any conclusive evidence either; rather, they reported contradictory results. Several studies find evidence favoring each of these two arguments; some even find mixed results (for example, Hanousek and Kochanova, 2016, Zakharov, 2019). I discuss these arguments and evidence in detail in Section 2.====For now, suppose one believes that corruption facilitates the entry process for nascent entrepreneurs in a market. In that case, a successful entry is contingent on how corrupt these entrepreneurs are and their willingness to pay bribes to initiate a start-up process. So, one may presume this willingness to be a crucial determinant of participation in entrepreneurship. Alluding to this, Dreher and Gassebner (2013, p. 427) state: “While it seems reasonable to assume that corruption...are...exogenous to the entrepreneur’s decision to enter the market in the short run, this might not be true in the longer term”. This possibility then makes the selection into entrepreneurship ====. Reinforcing this reasoning, Boudreaux et al. (2018) explain that entrepreneurs’ corruptibility may alter the very structure of an economy when they find it more beneficial to reallocate resources to those areas that yield higher profits through corrupt activities. Moreover, entrepreneurs are expected to participate in corrupt activities readily when their prevailing culture, norm, and surrounding social structure justify their actions as a matter of course (Tonoyan et al., 2010).====Based on all this, it is fair to presume that potential entrepreneurs ==== themselves into entrepreneurial activity contingent on their preference, perspective, and environment to pay bribes to public officials. This, therefore, builds a strong case for the underlying sample selection issue here. It is essential to bear in mind that the firms we observe in various corruption-related surveys to collect firm-level data basically represent the sub-population of entrepreneurs: the successful entrepreneurs, to be precise. So, if successful entrepreneurship is genuinely an outcome of bribery, these firms are likely to suffer from selection bias. The unobservables that affect successful selection into entrepreneurship are likely to be correlated with the unobservables that affect an entrepreneur’s decision to engage in bribery. This is mainly because the decision to pay bribes is expected to impact the chances of being a successful firm in the end. Thus, ignoring the sample selection issue in any such empirical analysis is expected to bias all estimated determinants of firm-level corruption.====To summarize, if the concern about sample selection is real and matters at all, then all the extant studies using the ES data to find empirical determinants of firm-level corruption are potentially flawed. The objective of this study is to assess this possibility. In this course, I reanalyze the impact of an economic variable – namely, government decentralization, that I discuss shortly – on firm-level corruption once the bias is controlled for. At the risk of sounding repetitive, it is worth highlighting that the concern raised here is relevant to ==== empirical investigations that involve bribery of firms observed in various corruption-related surveys as the dependent variable. In this regard, my current study makes a contribution to the literature on corruption in general and firm-level corruption in particular. If the posed concern is ultimately found to carry some truth, the prior estimates of various economic variables on firm-level bribery would not only be biased, but previous claims of causality would also be questionable. Thus, evaluating the potential problem is genuinely warranted.====While the concern is reasonable and remains unaddressed in the extant literature, conducting an analysis to control for this sample selection issue is not straightforward. The traditional solution for controlling such selection bias is the Heckman (1979) correction procedure. This solution conventionally requires information on the outcome of interest (corruption in the current context) ==== the selection equation’s outcome (entrepreneurial efforts in the present context) in the ==== data set. However, there are no firm-level corruption data that contains information on all entrepreneurial efforts (nascent- and non-entrepreneurs). Instead, ES data have only successful entrepreneurs, as explained above. Hence, implementing Heckman (1979) in its ==== way is not a viable option in the current context.==== Table 1 provides a visual representation of the problem as a reference point for my readers. The three columns represent the three possible data structures, respectively, that a researcher may encounter while carrying an analysis. The first column, “Ideal Data Structure” captures the situation of an absence of a sample selection issue. Hence, all the observations have information on both entrepreneurial effort ==== and corruption experience ====. Entrepreneurial effort ==== can either be a “yes” (represented by ====) or a “no” (represented by ====) for an observation. The second column, “Less Idea Data Structure” is the case where there is a sample selection concern, but the traditional Heckman (1979) correction procedure can be implemented readily. Here, a researcher has information on the entrepreneurial effort ==== for all observations. However, only a sub-sample, i.e., the first few observations in the table, contains information on corruption experience ====, while missing for the remaining. Thus, a single data set containing information on both ==== and ==== is available to apply the correction technique conventionally.====In contrast to these, the third column, “My Case” represents the unique situation relevant to my context. Here, there is a sample selection issue, but the traditional Heckman (1979) correction procedure is not a viable option. This is because there is no single data set containing information on both the entrepreneurial effort ==== and corruption experience ==== for all observations. Instead, only entrepreneurial effort ==== is observed in one sample of adult individuals with no information on corruption experience ====. And, corruption experience ==== is observed only for firms in a separate sample where these firms are already successful entrepreneurs, as depicted by ==== for entrepreneurial effort ====.====Given this impediment, I propose to solve the problem at hand by applying the standard Heckman Selection (1979) model in a ====. As Klevmarken (1982, p. 12-13) states: “Future research based on microdata might have to rely more and more on the kind of incomplete data discussed in this paper. To be able to do this, we will need some vehicle, a model, which links the variables of the different data sets”. To this end, I use ==== — experience-based corruption measures from ES and nascent entrepreneurship measures from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) — to obtain a new ‘two-sample Heckman selection estimator.’====As a cursory reference, my implementation strategy is analogous to two-sample-two-stage least-squares estimation (TS2SLS). The main idea was actually introduced by Angrist and Krueger (1992) as a two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimation. The essence of this methodology is that under certain conditions, the traditional instrumental variable approach can address the potential endogeneity of a regressor in a structural equation even when the outcome variable and the regressor belong to two different samples. However, because of computational feasibility, TS2SLS gained popularity over TSIV among empirical researchers (see Inoue and Solon, 2010, Pacini and Windmeijer, 2016). I discuss these and my implementation strategy in detail in Section 3. But at this point, it is worth noting that my proposed solution here is applicable to all those empirical studies that may lack one comprehensive data set to implement the Heckman (1979) correction strategy in a conventional way. Specifically, any researcher running into the situation represented by the third column, “My Case” of Table 1, has the possibility of availing of this suggested route. This is where I believe the second contribution of my study comes in: an extension of Heckman (1979) correction technique to handle a unique data situation.====Now returning to the point of reanalyzing an economic variable in the process, I use government decentralization as a plausible area of application. Government decentralization refers to the distribution of power among the various levels of a country’s government: central, state, and local. This is known to impact the rent extraction behavior of public officials in several conflicting ways. On the one hand, greater decentralization of power may bring public officials and the people close to each other and make the former more accountable (Fan et al., 2009). On the other hand, it may disrupt coordination among officials themselves and eventually increase the incentive and opportunities to extract bribes (see, for example, Monte and Papagni, 2007).====I choose government decentralization as the main explanatory variable of interest here for two reasons. First, this is an extensively discussed topic with substantial evidence of government decentralization affecting corruption. Readers are referred to Fan et al. (2009) for a good review on this wide-ranging subject. Second, prior empirical studies report government decentralization to ‘causally’ impact firm-level corruption experience (Choudhury, 2015). However, as illustrated earlier, these studies have failed to consider the potential sample selection problem. So, revisiting the question of the ‘causal impact’ of government decentralization on firm-level corruption while accounting for the underlying selection issue strikes as a credible point of investigation.====The results are noteworthy. I find reasonable evidence of selection bias, thereby confirming the decision to participate in entrepreneurship to be non-random. Once this bias is controlled for, government decentralization of a country ==== firm-level corruption in general by a significant amount. To be specific, greater fiscal decentralization, that is, a greater share of revenue to the sub-national government, decreases informal gifts by firms to officials while securing a government contract. This decrease is statistically significant and quite substantial in terms of economic significance. In contrast, naive estimation strategies report conflicting signs, magnitude, and statistical significance when the underlying sample selection problem is completely ignored. My main finding reinforces the need to consider sample selection issues while conducting a causal empirical analysis with firm-level corruption as the outcome of interest. Failing to do so is necessarily going to yield incorrect inference. I discuss the implications of my results in detail in Section 5.====To help comprehend my analysis better, I organize the paper in the following way. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Sections 3 Empirical strategy, 4 Data discuss the empirical methodology and data used, respectively. Section 5 presents the results.

We find that exposing the participants to a plea to help the beneficiary increases the average donation. Giving participants an opportunity to attribute small donations to luck decreases the average donation. We find that in our setting, the latter effect dominates.","People donate non-trivial shares of their income to charity (Andreoni et al., 2017; Charities Aid Foundation, 2016; Fielding and Knowles, 2014). They are particularly likely to donate when they feel empathy, or compassion, towards the beneficiary or when they identify with the beneficiary (Andersson et al., 2017; Arbel et al., 2019a; Arbel et al., 2019b; Arbel et al., 2016; Fielding and Knowles, 2014). They are also likely to donate when they believe that the donation reflects on their self-image (Kessler, 2017), and when they are asked to donate by a solicitor (Andreoni et al., 2017; Andreoni and Rao, 2011).====People, however, also take advantage of opportunities to avoid donations. They use a back door to avoid a solicitor in a mall (Andreoni et al., 2017). They avoid recycling machines that offer the opportunity to donate (Knutsson et al., 2013). They usually do not respond to letters asking them to donate (Donkers et al., 2017; Huck et al., 2015; Huck and Rasul, 2011). They make innocuous looking mistakes when the mistakes reduce the size of a donation, but make no such mistakes when the mistakes can harm their payoffs (Exley and Kessler, 2019). They reduce their donations when they can claim that the charity organization does not perform well (Exley, 2020), or when they convince themselves that the beneficiaries are not altruistic (Di Tella et al., 2015). They also take advantage of lotteries and uncertainty to reduce the size of their donations (Andreoni and Bernheim, 2009; Dana et al., 2007; Exley, 2015), even when they set the probabilities themselves (Snir, 2014). Potential donors also employ various psychological mechanisms to reduce the cognitive dissonance evoked by ungenerous behavior (Barkan et al., 2015; Tullock, 1971).====Below, we add to the literature by using a lab experiment to study and compare (1) the effect of manipulating the donors’ compassion towards the beneficiary, and (2) the effect of manipulating the ease with which the donors could “avoid the ask,” i.e., make a small donation without appearing unkind (Andreoni et al., 2017).====In previous studies of donations, the focus was on varying either the level of compassion toward the beneficiary, or the ease with which the participants could “avoid the ask” without appearing unkind. Thus, although it is known that when participants feel compassion towards the beneficiary they tend to increase their donations (Bechler et al., 2015; Charness and Gneezy, 2008; Engel, 2011; Goeree et al., 2010), it is not clear whether compassion can overcome the tendency of the participants to make small donations when they can do so without appearing unkind (Dana et al., 2007; Dufwenberg and Dufwenberg, 2018; Snir, 2014).====Our results are also related to the literature on expressive behavior. Hillman (2010) suggests that participants view experiments as an opportunity to earn expressive utiltiy at low cost. He argues that participants share money with strangers in dictator type experiments, because they gain expressive utility from depicting themselves as altruistic, while giving up small sums.====In our setting, participants can gain more expressive utility than in a dictator game, since they share a small sum with a charity instead of an annonymous person. Our results are therefore informative about the conditions under which participants choose to increase their pecuniary utility rather than their expressive utility (Grossman and van der Weele, 2017).====We employ a 2 × 2 design. The first factor is the level of compassion, which we manipulated by letting the participants in half of the treatments read the personal story of a beneficiary and a plea to help him. The second factor is the ease with which participants could avoid the ask. We manipulated it by asking the participants in half of the treatments to determine the size of their donations by tossing dice, thus giving them an opportunity to attribute a decision to donate a small sum to an external factor, luck.====In real life, participants usually do not have an explicit opportunity to attribute their decision to “luck.” Yet, in real life scenarios, participants often have opportunities to attribute a decision to donate (or not to donate) to external factors that play a role similar to the one played by luck in our experiment. For example, when a beggar asks for a coin, a person might claim, without checking, that she has no change, or that she has already given money to another beggar, thus attributing her decision not to donate to the beggar's bad luck. In Andreoni et al. (2017) a solicitor stood next to one of the exits of a large store and asked for donations. Many shoppers left through the other door, thereby avoiding the ask. It is possible that some of these shoppers avoided the ask because they decided that it would be easier to go out through the other door, thus attributing the decision not to donate to their location in the store, another manifestation of luck. We therefore believe that attributing a decision to “luck,” as we do in the experiment, can be informative about real life behavior.====In summary, our experimental design allows us to compare the effect of manipulating the donors’ compassion towards the beneficiary with the effect of giving the donors an opportunity to attribute small donations to an external factor. Comparing these two effects is important because one mechanism that charities employ to encourage donations is giving the donors information about the beneficiaries (Homer, 2021). In addition, because our data comes from a laboratory experiment, we can control for socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, marital status, religiosity, etc., that are hard to collect in other settings.====We find that although the donors in our experiment enjoyed complete anonymity, they donated, on average, 55.8% of their endowment. This is almost twice the average share of donations in dictator games: 28.4% (Engel, 2011).====We also find that letting the donors read a plea to help the beneficiary tilts the distribution of the donations to the right. Enabling participants to use a lottery to determine the size of their donation, thus giving them an opportunity to attribute a small donation to “luck,” tilts the distribution of the donations to the left. However, when participants read a plea to help the beneficiary and are also asked to use a lottery to determine the size of their donation, the distribution of donation is still tilted to the left relative to the baseline treatment. Thus, although reading a plea to help the beneficiary has a positive effect on the size of donations, we find that in our setting, the effect of attributing the decision to luck is the dominating factor.====As a robustness test, we conducted a second experiment. In the second experiment, instead of asking the participants to toss dice, we only offered the participants the opportunity to toss dice. We find that in the second experiment, participants in all treatments donated more than in the first experiment. Nevertheless, we still find that participants that tossed dice donated less than particiapnts in the baseline treatment, that participants that read a plea to help the beneficiary donated more than participants in the baseline treatment, and that the effect of tossing dice is stronger than the effect of reading a plea to help the beneficiary.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the experimental design. In Section 3, we present and discuss the empirical results. We conclude in Section 4 by discussing expressive behavior, offering possible explanations for the absence of gender and religiosity effects, and discussing several caveats.","An experiment on donations, personal stories, and bad luck",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000253,Available online 17 March 2023,2023,Research Article,14.0

Less harsh views on evasion are persistent for very high compliance levels in a follow-up survey.","Many taxpayers regularly face the task of filing their annual tax declaration, which requires processing large amounts of information and abiding ample documentation requirements. This is all the more cumbersome for taxpayers since modern tax systems are typically complex and involve many tax rules, which are often updated on a yearly basis. Therefore, it may not come as a surprise that existing work finds that people frequently have a poor knowledge on existing tax rules and their implications (Stantcheva, 2021).==== According to a recent representative survey, people perceive tax filing to be very or rather difficult and about 90% support a move towards simpler tax rules (Blesse et al., 2021). Complex tax schedules and filing processes also have important negative implications such as low-take up rates of tax benefits (e.g. Chetty et al., 2013, Bhargava and Manoli, 2015), large compliance costs on taxpayers (Benzarti, 2020), inattention to new tax incentives (Abeler and Jaeger, 2015) and the fact that taxpayers are confused and misinterpret economic incentives of taxes (Feldman et al., 2016, Aghion et al., 2017).====Against this background, complex tax rules may reduce compliance and enforcement levels (Krause, 2000). Notably, Bellemare et al. (2019) show lab evidence that people use the ambiguity from unintentional filing mistakes in complex tax settings as an excuse for non-compliance. This shows that complex tax rules have a negative direct effect on tax compliance by creating tax payer confusion and opening up wiggle room for individuals to opt-out of compliance. However, even though people also make individual tax compliance decisions in a social context (e.g. Traxler, 2010, Frey and Torgler, 2007), it remains unclear whether there may be indirect negative spillovers of observing other taxpayers to be confused and not being able to claim what benefits the tax system offers. Specifically, taxpayers may interpret such filing uncertainty of others as having lower perceived costs of tax non-compliance. Also, people may perceive tax avoidance of those with access to tax knowledge either as unfair or as legitimate and change their compliance accordingly.====This paper addresses this issue and provides causal evidence on spillover effects of peer information about tax confusion of others on attitudes towards tax evasion. Specifically, I show whether information about the perceived uncertainty of others how to file their taxes reduces individual support for tax compliance.==== In order to do this, I designed a survey experiment which asked participants about their tax compliance preference, i.e. their view on the justifiability of tax evasion (of both oneself or others), and compared their answers across three experimental groups which differ in the information about the taxpayer uncertainty among others in the context of complex taxes. The analysis is inspired by a recent representative survey among the general population in Germany from Blesse et al. (2021) which finds that half of survey respondents find their tax declaration difficult and especially see the chance of forgetting something or reporting falsely as the source of these difficulties in tax filing (Blesse et al., 2021 p. 56). While forgetting to claim eligible deductions may result in paying a needlessly large amount of taxes for those affected, uncertainty over existing tax rules may also lead to unintentional and ‘honest’ mistakes when declaring one’s taxable income. Regardless, tax uncertainty of others how to file their taxable income may increase empathy for non-compliance and judge tax evasion less harshly. Tax evasion likely comes with a social stigma in the eyes of the general public since survey-data shows consistently high support for tax compliance in Germany (see Section 2.1). Thus, information regarding taxpayer uncertainty among others and their respective lack of ability to optimize their taxable income over eligible benefits in the tax system should make people more accepting of tax non-compliance.====The study was fielded in the German Internet Panel (GIP) which is a large probability-based population sample in Germany. The survey has 3 experimental groups to study the role of taxpayer uncertainty of others for tax compliance preferences.====First, the ==== condition gives respondents the information about prevalent difficulties of others when filing their annual tax declaration, which is inspired from a previous survey of the author (Blesse et al., 2021). Specifically, the information states that in the context of complex tax laws due to many deduction and exemption possibilities many citizens are often not sure about whether they report all incomes correctly in their tax declaration. Respondents in this treatment should be more aware of other taxpayers’ lack of tax knowledge and their uncertainty on how to file their taxable income properly. This treatment condition thus allows me to test whether people are more lenient towards tax evasion when becoming aware of other taxpayer’s uncertainty about how to file their tax declarations and, thereby, their lower ability to optimize their taxable income over potential benefits the tax system provides or to make unintentional filing errors.====Second, the ==== treatment augments the peer information from the ==== group with the contrasting notion that other citizens exist who possess the relevant tax knowledge or have access to it through tax advisors and use that knowledge in order to reduce their tax burden through avoidance. Given different degrees of tax knowledge in both treatments, these groups are described to have different opportunities to optimize their after-tax incomes to their benefit. Third and last, a control group does not receive any information. All three experimental groups, however, read the same neutral opening statement about tax evasion in order to become familiar with the topic.====Please note that both treatment scenarios are realistic and relevant in non-prefilled tax systems (as the German one) where complicated rules make tax filing conditional on extensive tax knowledge. Naturally, someone who is uncertain how to file his or her income cannot knowingly (and thereby, intentionally) evade taxes which then leads to the question whether one’s support for tax compliance can be reduced by the statement that many cannot optimize their after-tax incomes likely due to under-reporting eligible tax deductions in the first treatment. The second intervention tests whether active avoidance behavior of others while taking benefit of tax knowledge affects the willingness to justify tax evasion from oneself and others. The treatments test interesting channels of how acceptance of deliberate tax evasion changes when subjects become aware of potential non-compliance in the context of complex taxes, be it either through taxpayer confusion and thereby potential non-compliance among others or through the fact that other taxpayers can take benefit of tax knowledge and optimize over deduction possibilities.====The results show that informing respondents about the prevalent uncertainties of others when filing taxes significantly decreases support for tax compliance. First, this shows that people are not necessarily aware of tax filing uncertainties of other taxpayers. This is true despite the fact that 50% of respondents elicited in an earlier wave of the GIP that they find tax declarations somewhat or very difficult themselves (Blesse et al., 2021). Second, the significant negative effect of the ==== treatment shows that subjects empathize with problems of others in optimizing their after-tax incomes in the context of complex taxes, making them more lenient towards tax evasion. The ==== group also significantly reduces support for tax compliance as compared to the control group but one cannot reject the equality of effects between both treatments.====Moreover, I find that the negative information effect of both treatments results entirely from fewer respondents choosing the highest answer categories for supporting tax compliance. Thus, information about uncertainties regarding tax filing due to complex tax rules especially reduces the prevalence of very honest taxpayers. Related effects are larger for the ==== group. Importantly, I also check for a potential alternative channel in which the treatments not only increase compliance costs due to the uncertainty of others on how to file taxes as originally intended but may have also increased the perception of own compliance costs of paying taxes. Using prior beliefs on individual perceptions of compliance costs to declare one’s taxes from a previous survey wave allows me to disentangle whether treated individuals update their views on tax evasion due to either channel. Since I do not find evidence on significant effects of individual perceptions of own compliance costs on attitudes towards tax evasion in the context of the experiment, I interpret this as supporting evidence that the results speak actually in favor of a peer information effect rather than a mere increase in own compliance costs. Please note that even though the peer effect channel seems to dominate the alternative channel regarding own compliance costs through the treatment provision, I cannot fully exclude that the latter mechanism may be valid and play some role in the present design. Related effects and potential caveats to this issue are discussed at length in Section 3.3.====I also analyze whether certain groups of participants respond more or less to either treatment with respect to their tax compliance preferences. Given longitudinal data of the GIP, I can exploit rich background information from previous survey waves. Older respondents show stronger negative responses than younger subjects to the ==== information, i.e. that many people are uncertain how to properly declare their taxable income.==== Left-wing subjects explain lower support for tax compliance in the ==== condition. This corresponds to the results of Alesina et al. (2018) who find that political preferences play a large for redistributive preferences. In line with their results, I argue that leftists are more lenient towards tax non-compliance if they are informed about active avoidance activities of taxpayers who have tax knowledge or access to it since these people are presumably more rich. Put differently, leftists are more empathic towards tax evasion, likely as a means of redistribution towards tax filers who either lack tax knowledge or do not have the means to access it through (presumably costly) advice.====I also study persistence using a follow-up survey two months after the main experiment. The treatment effects indeed appear to be largely persistent. Specifically, the share of high support for compliance is significantly reduced by peer information even two months after the intervention. Thus, peer information about tax uncertainty of others has persistent effects on very high levels of support for tax compliance but the resulting reductions in support grow somewhat less strong again over time. Persistent treatment effects, however, also suggest that the results arise due to new information rather than due to an increased salience of taxpayer confusion. They also alleviate potential concerns about experimenter demand in the experiment of the main survey. Again, I find that political ideology is an important driver of the negative effect of the ==== condition. The point estimates are virtually identical with the effects in the main survey. It appears that left-wing respondents internalized a more lenient view towards tax evasion when being informed that taxpayer uncertainties are common and when possible negative distributional implications for unaware taxpayers are highlighted to the participants.====This study makes several contributions to the literature. First, I add to the general literature on tax compliance and in particular to work regarding the intrinsic motivation of tax compliance (see Luttmer and Singhal, 2014 for a recent review). The treatment conditions both speak to peer effects and social influences as a channel of tax compliance and related attitudes (for reviews, see Luttmer and Singhal, 2014, Hashimzade et al., 2013, respectively). Cross-country survey evidence supports the hypothesis of ’conditional cooperation’ where people decide to comply depending on the (perceived) compliance of others (Frey and Torgler, 2007). Several randomized control trials (RCTs), however, provide a mixed picture whether information provision regarding compliance behavior of others has an effect on individual tax compliance. Some studies indeed find positive effects of peer information on compliance behavior (e.g. Hallsworth et al., 2017, Bott et al., 2020). Moreover, Del Carpio (2014) shows that informing taxpayers about average compliance has long-lasting positive effects but information about enforcement levels does not. Other studies show spillovers in tax compliance among peer networks (Drago et al., 2020 for the case of TV license fees; Paetzold and Winner, 2016 for reporting a commuter tax allowance). Other RCTs, however, do not find peer effects on average (such as Slemrod et al., 2001, Fellner et al., 2013, Castro and Scartascini, 2015 or Perez-Truglia and Troiano, 2018). Also social image concerns play a role for tax compliance and governments can exploit these concerns, e.g. through shaming (Perez-Truglia and Troiano, 2018, Dwenger and Treber, 2022). Rewards for compliance, however, can also backfire depending on the intrinsic motivation of taxpayers (Dwenger et al., 2016).====The present paper provides novel evidence on the effect of a yet overlooked type of peer information on attitudes towards tax compliance, i.e. the perceived taxpayer uncertainty among other taxpayers, using a survey experiment among the general public.==== My results suggest that once people become aware of tax confusion among others and their following limited ability to reduce their tax burden within their lawful opportunities, they become more accepting of tax evasion. The treatment likely increases the perceived individual cost of tax compliance through the tax filing uncertainty of one’s peers.====Second, my results complement recent studies on the effects of tax complexity on tax compliance (see the opening paragraph above). None of these papers show whether the perceived tax confusion among others (e.g., established in Blesse et al., 2021) itself has a causal effect on the acceptance of tax evasion.==== I show that information about the prevalence of tax filing uncertainty among others leads to more acceptance of tax evasion. High levels of support for tax compliance also become less frequent when distributional consequences of complex taxes are highlighted in favor of presumably rich taxpayers that can actively avoid taxes. This is especially so among left-wing respondents. These findings suggest a role for tax knowledge and its distribution among taxpayers in determining fairness and legitimacy perceptions of the tax system (see also Eriksen and Fallan, 1996).",Do your tax problems make tax evasion seem more justifiable?

We argue that fragmentation in a unitary developing country may not channel higher resources to local areas. Political motives may instead play a significant role in the allocation process. Using panel data methods and a novel dataset on government's district-wise allocation of annual development expenditure in Bangladesh covering the period from 2005 to 2009, the analysis focuses on the impact of local government fragmentation and tests key political distribution models (the ====, the ====, and the ","What determines the allocation of public spending? Traditional public finance theories suggest that the principles of efficiency, equity, and stabilisation decide the allocation pattern, where the central government plays a ‘benevolent role’ and tries to maximise social welfare (Rodríguez-Pose et al., 2016). Conversely, political distribution and political settlement theories argue that, as politicians are the ultimate policymakers, political motives play a major role in influencing the growth of aggregate and different categories of public spending (Golden and Min, 2013; Persson, 2007). This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the determinants of public spending allocation at the subnational level for a unitary developing country: Bangladesh. We analyse the impact of various type of local government fragmentation, a particular aspect of local decentralisation, and distributive politics on government's district-wise allocation of total development expenditure. This is especially relevant to the context of developing economies, as the empirical literature analysing the impact of various types of fragmentation and political patronage on total public spending at the subnational level of developing unitary countries is rather thin. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies empirically investigated the core voter versus swing voter debate or the impact of local government fragmentation on national government's spatial allocation of total development spending focussing on Bangladesh.====Bangladesh represents a very interesting case to study both the impact of fragmentation and distributive politics on public spending. The country has made remarkable progress in a number of development outcomes. Yet, what explain its progress is still unclear (Asadullah et al., 2014; Sen, 2016). Undestanding Bangladesh's progress requires also a closer look at decentralisation, as it has become a central feature of the country's development programme adopted during its period of success. In the country, both political and administrative decentralisation is promoted in the form of political fragmentation of local government (LG) units, with the scope to create local participation and representation (Faguet and Ali, 2009). Therefore, understanding whether local government decentralisation or political motive determines the geographical allocation of public spending in Bangladesh can feed into the national effort to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, SDGs 16 and 17 have emphasised the need for developing effective, accountable, and transparent institutions to ensure responsive, inclusive, and participatory decision making and strengthening domestics resource mobilisation at all levels (UN, 2015). Investigating the impact of fragmentation on government's development expenditure allocation will help us to understand how much the fiscal authority of the local units of Bangladesh contribute to the SDGs.====Existing literature suggests that all the theories that explains the determinants of public spending growth can be classified into three groups: ==== (in which, citizens’ preference is reflected in the size of the spending), ==== (in which, politicians and bureaucrats are seen as having power to impose their interests over the citizens interest), and ==== (in which constitutional design and rules constraints the state from using its power in a discretionary manner) (Facchini, 2018; Mueller, 2003). The ==== are historically the most discussed and empirically tested theories, focussing on determinants capturing the broad demographic and socio-economic condition, ethnic diversity, and political ideology of the population. A growing body of literature investigates ====, focussing especially on distributive politics. Conversely, ==== explanations have seen less discussion, although have been present in very recent literate (Facchini, 2018). In this study, by taking ==== variables as controls, we investigate the impact of distributive politics (a supply model factor) and local government fragmentation (a constitutional model factor, as it can create constitutional obligations and constraints) on public spending. This is important, as whether fragmentation favours or disfavours a more efficient and balanced spatial pattern of public spending is still unclear and, moreover, fragmentation itself can create scope for political patronage in resource allocation (Gottlieb et al., 2019; Lessmann, 2012; Livert et al., 2019). Therefore, one should take patronage and fragmentation together, as in this empirical study.====Regarding the relationship between decentralisation and the size of public spending, there is a long-standing theoretical disagreement. The “Decentralisation theory” argues that decentralisation can increase budgetary growth because local demands will be better served (Oates, 1972). Conversely, the “Leviathan theory” suggests that with decentralisation, the size of the total government spending declines as greater competition enhances efficiency and restricts expenditure growth (Brennan and Buchannan, 1980). Testing these theories, empirical studies have provided conflicting results and eventually concluded that the relationship is conditional to specific contexts (Hendrick et al., 2011; Qiao et al., 2019; Choudhury and Shau, 2022). However, the literature is biased towards federal countries, and has paid little attention to the impact of decentralisation on resource allocation in the context of unitary developing countries (Faguet, 2014; Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2010). Besides, studies have often failed to measure decentralisation properly, as they have concentrated only at the national level, whereas most of the unitary countries have implemented horizontal dispersion dimension of decentralisation at the subnational level rather than the vertical dispersion dimension (Boex and Edwards, 2016; Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2012). Furthermore, most of the comparative studies have heavily relied on the conventional indicators of fiscal decentralisation which captures decentralisation partially as unitary countries have shown more affinity towards implementing political and administrative decentralisation (Smoke, 2013). Besides, the comparative studies have the limitation of not capturing the difference in the institutional settings (e.g., the type, objective, or design of the programme) across countries (Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2010). Therefore, more empirical investigations, using appropriate indicators, should be carried out in the developing country context.====Similarly, the literature has offered several theories of distributive politics. It has been suggested that politicians may target the core voters (Cox and McCubbins, 1986), swing voters (Dixit and Londregan, 1996), core (or swing) constituencies rather than voters (Cox, 2010), voter turnout (Nichter, 2008; Casas, 2018), opposition abstention voters (Kaba, 2022), marginally winning constituencies (Persson et al., 2000), opposition strongholds (Casas, 2020), politically aligned constituencies or leaders (Wong, 2022; Baron, 1993), or hometown favouritism (Kung and Zhou, 2021). A vast body of research has provided empirical evidence supporting these theories. Review of the literature, however, confirms that most of the empirical studies are confined to the OECD and Latin American countries with few exceptions, e.g. Callen et al. (2020) on Pakistan, Das and Maiorano (2019) and Bardhan and Mookherjee (2012) on India, and Kung and Zhou (2021), Wong (2022) and Jiang and Zhang (2020) on China. Furthermore, these studies have mainly focused on electorally relevant aspects of taxes and transfers (Golden and Min, 2013). Analyses of the impact of distributive politics on total public spending in the context of a developing country are relatively scarce and often not based on a robust research design (Manacorda et al., 2011). Such investigations are also challenging to conduct as targeting certain areas with certain political features does not necessarily confirm politically motived spending, rather it can be an attempt to mitigate the interregional inequality (Banful, 2011). On the econometric front, one faces challenges due to the possibility of reverse causality (between allocation and voting behaviour) and omitted variable bias (caused by not considering regional heterogeneity), which are often not carefully addressed. In addition, studies have used a wide range of variables as a proxy to test the conventional models of distributive politics It is, therefore, important to test them in different settings. Overall, the literature would benefit from more country specific and methodologically sound empirical analysis and the present papers contributes to fill this gap. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically investigate the impact of distributive politics and fragmentation on government's total development spending at the subnational level of a unitary developing country, offering panel data evidence.====We construct a unique panel dataset on public spending at the district level, using Bangladesh government's district-wise allocation of the Annual Development Plan (ADP) funds over the period 2005–2009. We include a range of local government fragmentation and distributive politics measures. Our regression specification includes a large set of controls (including socio-economic and demographic variables) and, for robustness, uses a range of panel methods accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and dynamic effects. The results suggest that local government fragmentation (either total, horizontal, or vertical) does not have any significant impact on the per capita development expenditure allocated by the government at the subnational level in Bangladesh. Conversely, distributive politics plays a significant determining role, as the study found that a district's share of core vote for the ruling party, number of ministers, and the political alignment of the local representative with the ruling party have a significant positive impact on the per capita development expenditure. This suggest that the allocation of developing spending is significantly influenced by political patronage. And this may be a signficant obstacle to SDGs progress, as development spending may not be governed by resource delivery mechanisms that effectively target the poor.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on fragmentation and distributive politics; Section 3 describes the methodology of the empirical analysis; Sections 4 Results, 5 Discussion present and discuss the results.

We run a large-scale opinion survey with (1) onliners in internet-survey mode, (2) offliners in face-to-face mode, and (3) internet users in face-to-face mode. We find marked response differences between onliners and offliners in different modes (1 vs. 2). Response differences between onliners and offliners in the same face-to-face mode (2 vs. 3) disappear when controlling for background characteristics, indicating mode effects rather than unobserved population differences. Differences in background characteristics of onliners in the two modes (1 vs. 3) indicate that mode effects partly reflect sampling differences. In our setting, re-weighting online-survey observations appears a pragmatic solution when aiming at representativeness for the entire population.","Over the past years, internet surveys have become increasingly popular in economics (see, e.g., Haaland et al., 2022, for an extensive review of recent applications).==== Internet surveys offer several advantages over traditional face-to-face, telephone, or mail surveys for researchers who study people's preferences, opinions, or beliefs. They are easy to implement, offer access to relatively diverse sets of potential study participants, and can usually be implemented at much lower cost than other survey modes. In addition, they facilitate the implementation of attractive methodological tools, such as randomized survey experiments, at a large scale. However, internet surveys have a major drawback concerning their external validity: While they cover individuals who use the internet for participating in surveys – whom we refer to as “onliners” throughout the paper – they often exclude the non-negligible part of the population that does not use the internet – whom we refer to as “offliners.” As a consequence, it is unclear whether results from internet surveys can be representative for the entire population (e.g., Best et al., 2001; Berrens et al., 2003). For example, the share of offliners in a representative German face-to-face household survey was as high as 22 percent in 2014. While this share has gone down to 17 percent by 2017, offliners still make up a substantial part of the population.==== Since the offline population may differ from the online population in terms of their preferences, beliefs, or sociodemographic characteristics, coverage bias might undermine the generalizability of results from internet surveys to the offline population. A common method to address this bias are offline-population inclusion strategies such as providing offliners with internet equipment or mixed-mode surveys which complement internet-survey data for onliners with face-to-face or postal survey data for the offline population (e.g., van Soest and Kapteyn, 2011; Cornesse and Schaurer, 2021).====In this paper, we assess the extent to which the costly face-to-face complement of mixed-mode surveys is necessary to achieve representativeness with non-probabilistic internet surveys, addressing the practitioners’ question of applied researchers faced with the choice between a pure internet survey and a mixed-mode survey. To this end, we administered the ifo Education Survey 2017, an opinion survey of the German adult population on education policy topics, to three groups of respondents: (1) onliners interviewed in internet mode in an online access panel (N = 3699), (2) offliners interviewed in face-to-face mode in a probabilistic household survey (N = 382), and (3) internet users interviewed in face-to-face mode in the same probabilistic household survey (N = 622). The combination of groups (1) and (2) corresponds to a mixed-mode survey aimed at covering both onliners and offliners. For the purposes of this paper, we implemented the extension to group (3) which allows us to address several practical questions about results obtained from internet surveys.====In mixed-mode settings, any existing differences between onliners in group (1) and offliners in group (2) can either stem from (i) inherent population differences between the two groups or from (ii) mode effects that arise because onliners and offliners are sampled and surveyed in different modes. The first source is the potential reason that would necessitate the direct coverage of offliners, whereas the second source gives rise to the interpretability problems of mode-specific results inherent to any mixed-mode survey. Importantly, the internet users sampled in the face-to-face mode (group (3)) allow us to differentiate between these two potential sources: comparing groups (2) and (3), we can explicitly test for inherent differences between the answers of internet users and offliners while holding sampling and survey mode constant. And comparing groups (1) and (3), we can shed light on potential mode effects, which in this paper we conceive broadly to encompass differences in answering behavior (in internet vs. face-to-face surveying), sampling (non-probabilistic vs. probabilistic), and reachability and participation (in online panels vs. home surveys). As it was not possible for us to interview offliners via an online-access panel, we cannot disentangle these different dimensions of the mode effect; instead, our analysis investigates the combined difference between commonly used internet surveys and traditional face-to-face surveys.==== Note that because of these different types of mode differences, there is no “gold standard” that would describe the “true” values to which any population estimate could be compared. By necessity, applied research on the preferences, opinions, and beliefs of the population must depend on the voluntary participation of respondents in a given survey mode. Our goal here is more humble: We address the practitioner's question of whether a pure non-probabilistic internet survey can provide estimates similar to a mixed-mode setup with a probabilistic offline part – i.e., whether applied researchers can do without the expensive offline component of a mixed-mode survey.====Our analysis proceeds in three steps. In the first step, we compare groups (1) and (2) to test whether offliners provide different answers than onliners in the mixed-mode setting. For 22 out of 79 survey items (28 percent), we find that responses differ significantly (at the 5 percent level) between onliners interviewed in the internet survey and offliners interviewed face-to-face. This number reduces to 9 items (11 percent) when conditioning on respondents’ observed background characteristics (age, gender, education, income, region, family status, and employment status). That is, while differences in observed characteristics account for more than half of the onliner-offliner response differences in the mixed-mode survey in our setting, a sizable share of differences remains unexplained.====In the second step, we examine whether these response differences are due to inherent differences in unobserved characteristics between internet users and offliners or due to differences in the internet vs. face-to-face survey mode. To do so, we draw on group (3), i.e., internet users surveyed in the face-to-face mode, who were asked a subset of eight survey items that we had selected based on prior evidence of relatively large onliner-offliner differences.==== When comparing the responses of internet users and offliners interviewed in the same face-to-face mode (groups (2) and (3)), we find significant differences for five of the eight items. Intriguingly, all of these differences turn small and statistically insignificant (at the 5 percent level) when conditioning on respondents’ observed background characteristics.==== This suggests that response differences between onliners and offliners in the mixed-mode setting are not due to inherent differences in unobserved characteristics between the two groups but rather reflect mode effects.====A comparison of onliners interviewed in the internet mode and internet users in the face-to-face mode (groups (1) and (3)) provides additional indication that mode effects are important. For four of the eight items, we find significant differences, independently of whether conditioning on respondents’ characteristics or not. Interestingly, these differences all occur for survey items on relatively sensitive topics, namely policies related to refugees and how respondents grade schools.==== Arguably, such survey items are particularly susceptible to interviewer-demand or social-desirability effects, which are more likely to occur in the presence of an interviewer in the face-to-face mode than in the anonymous internet mode.====Furthermore, we provide evidence of heterogeneous sample selection across survey modes. Comparing background characteristics of onliners surveyed on the internet vs. internet users in the face-to-face mode (groups (1) and (3)), the latter group is significantly older, less likely to be full-time employed, and more likely to be retired or ill. That is, at least part of the response differences between internet and face-to-face surveying stems from the fact that the different sampling and surveying modes reach different subpopulations even within the group of internet users. Together, our findings suggest that mode effects – i.e., mode-related differences in answering behavior, sampling, and participation – are an important factor that drives onliner-offliner response differences in our mixed-mode setting. In contrast, inherent differences between the answers of onliners and offliners stemming from unobserved characteristics seem to be rather unimportant in our setting.====The third step of our analysis investigates the extent to which an approach that re-weights the responses of the internet survey can recover response patterns of the entire population (onliners ==== offliners) as observed in the mixed-mode setup. This analysis builds on the result that response differences are driven by differences in sampling and participation rather than inherent population differences between onliners and offliners. Such differences between samples are commonly corrected using probability weights. We compare internet-mode responses of onliners re-weighted to match the basic characteristics of the entire population (with respect to age, gender, parental status, school degree, federal state, and city size) to results of the mixed-mode sample, also weighted to represent the entire population. We find that there are only two of the 79 survey items (2.5 percent) for which the estimated population mean of the re-weighted internet survey differs significantly (at the 5 percent level) from the estimated population mean of the mixed-mode survey. Not only are differences in estimated population means statistically insignificant, but they are also small in magnitude: For more than half of the survey items, the difference is below one percentage point on the binary-coded responses, and it exceeds three percentage points in only four cases.====These results show that re-weighted non-probabilistic internet surveys can produce response patterns that are mostly indistinguishable, statistically and quantitatively, from those of mixed-mode surveys. Interestingly, the single largest difference of 7.7 percentage points between the two approaches is observed for the item whether respondents view themselves as winners of digitalization. This indicates that the re-weighting approach is less suited for questions that are directly related to respondents’ internet user status. But overall, our results suggest that re-weighting onliners can be a pragmatic, economical solution for applied researchers in many contexts to depict preferences, opinions, or beliefs of the entire (online and offline) population.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly describes our contribution to the literature. Section 3 introduces our data source, the ifo Education Survey 2017. Section 4 presents differences between onliners and offliners in the mixed-mode setting. Section 5 introduces our conceptual framework to differentiate between inherent population differences and mode effects and presents our main results.

The primary function of an institution is to determine how citizens in a society are matched pairwisely to interact. We examine three different types of institutions: utilitarian, egalitarian, and Nash. Two cultural types stand out in the long run through the evolutionary process. The ==== cultural type maximizes individual payoff against another ==== cultural type, while the ==== cultural type maximizes the total payoff of a pair. We show that the structure of the underlying interactions among citizens plays a critical role. On the one hand, the evolutionary stability of the ==== cultural type requires supermodularity of the citizens’ payoff function under the utilitarian institution and log-supermodularity in addition under the Nash institution. On the other hand, the evolutionary stability of the ==== cultural type requires submodularity of the citizens’ payoff function under the utilitarian institution and log-submodularity under the Nash institution. Neither type’s evolutionary stability is guaranteed under the egalitarian institution.","Institutions and culture are two pillars of the human civilization. How they interact with one another and jointly determine the trajectory of humanity has attracted increasingly more economists’ attention in the past decades (Alesina and Giuliano, 2015). Institutions cannot directly manipulate culture in the short run. Instead, they implement policy tools such as taxes/subsidies (Hiller and Touré, 2021), property rights protection (Bisin and Verdier, 2021a), building and maintaining religious infrastructures (Bisin et al., 2021), to change the citizens’ incentives in their daily life decision makings, which indirectly influence the evolution of culture across generations over time. In this paper, we attempt to investigate an important yet understudied channel through which institutions influence culture: matching. Matching is the fundamental way of organizing a society as citizens belonging to a society seldom live a solitary life but instead form partnerships and interact with one another. In a multi-cultural society, the intensity of cross-culture matching impacts the economic performances of different cultural groups, which in turn affect their sizes (i.e., the distribution of cultures) in the long run. How do institutions determine matching? Usually, institutions can promote policies on the aggregate level to alter citizens’ interactive patterns with one another. For example, segregating two cultural groups geographically raises the physical cost of cross-cultural interactions and in turn increases the citizens’ tendency of matching with their own kind. Historical evidence demonstrates that matching could indeed be critically determined by institutions. Racial segregation in the US and Apartheid in South Africa were caused by the fact that the non-white citizens were not empowered to matched with who they wish to interact. Their “entitlement to assort” were deprived by the institutionalized racial oppression.==== In the US, the Moving to Opportunity Programs (MTOs) in the mid-1990s aimed to integrate geographically different segments of the population, often majority and minority families. See for example Chetty et al. (2016). Lin (1990) finds that the great famine happened in China could be attributed to the fact that people lost their freedom to withdraw from the collective farming organization.====In our model, citizens in a society have different cultural types. Each cultural type specifies a set of characteristics. The citizens are matched to form pairwise partnerships, which generate payoffs for them. The citizens’ payoffs are determined by their cultural types as well as their partners’ cultural types. We abstract from the detailed process of how payoffs are determined by cultural types. Instead, we directly define different cultural types based on their distinct properties on the payoff function. The matching is determined endogenously by the institution of the society. More specifically, the institution would choose the index of assortativity, a measure of how assortative the matching process is. Following Bisin and Verdier (2021b), we conceptualize institutions as mechanisms through which social choices are delineated and implemented. This view on institutions is in line with North, 1981, North, 1990, David, 1994 and Grief (2006). We consider three different types of institutions: utilitarian, egalitarian, and Nash, which are represented by social welfare functions taking the forms of the average payoff of the citizens, the minimum payoff in the society, and the Nash product of the average payoffs of different cultural groups, respectively. The Nash institution is considered as a compromise between utilitarianism and egalitarianism as it encompasses both the goals of efficiency and fairness. Importantly, instead of interpreting the social choice problem normatively, we treat it as an indirect choice problem solved by the political process within an institution.====A growing literature argues that cultural evolution can be Darwinian, in the sense that evolution is at least partly driven by cultural fitness success (Besley, 2017, Besley, 2020, Besley and Persson, 2017, Besley and Persson, 2019). In this paper, we adopt the Darwinian approach. There are two cultural groups in the population: the incumbent and the mutant. The cultural fitness of a cultural group is measured by its average payoff. The group with a higher cultural fitness expands, while the other group shrinks. The incumbent cultural type is evolutionarily stable against the mutant cultural type if the mutant group will be eventually eliminated in the population. Since institutions determine matching and matching affects the payoffs of the citizens, we can examine the institutions’ long-run impacts on the evolution of culture through matching.====We find that two cultural types stand out in the long run through the evolutionary process. A citizen with the ==== cultural type seeks to maximize own payoff gain in an ==== society, while a citizen with the ==== cultural type does “what is right” for the society. We find that the evolutionary stability of these two cultural types differ across institutions and is determined by different properties of the payoff function. Under the utilitarian institution, supermodularity (respectively, submodularity) is crucial for the evolutionary stability of the ==== (respectively, the ====) cultural type. The rationale is that supermodularity (respectively, submodularity) results in the maximal (respectively, minimal) index of assortativity. The former provides a segregated environment for the ==== citizens to thrive, while the latter results in the most integrated society and only the ==== type can survive. Under the Nash institution, log-supermodularity is required in addition to guarantee the stability of the ==== cultural type, while log-submodularity replaces submodularity as the requirement for the stability of the ==== cultural type. The log conditions stem from the multiplicative nature of the Nash institution in contrast to the additive nature of the utilitarian institution. Under the egalitarian institution, however, neither types are guaranteed to be evolutionarily stable and it is likely to have them co-survive because egalitarian can lead to both the maximal and the minimal index of assortativity.====As opposed to the majority of the models in the literature, which consider specific types of underlying interactions among the citizens and restricted sets of cultural types, our model’s setting allows for arbitrary structure of the underlying interaction and arbitrary cultural type space. The generality allows us to reveal the intricate relationship between institutions and cultural evolution when matching serves as the channel through which the former influences the latter.====Several recent papers conduct comparative studies on how matching affects culture. Wu and Zhang (2021) show that different marriage patterns (assortative versus random) have distinct effects on the inter-generational transmission of culture. Wu (2021) shows that two different modes of matching (bargaining in match (BIM) versus binding agreement in the matching market (BAMM)) in the labor market between the majority and the immigrants can lead to different cultural phenomena such as coexistence and assimilation. Neither paper consider the role of institutions. Hiller et al. (2023) argue that different institutional arrangements of the matriarchal and the patriarchal societies may result in different ways of organizing the marriage markets (men-optimal stable matching (MOSM) versus women-optimal stable matching (WOSM)), which put these societies on diverse paths of cultural evolution. The institutional context considered by Hiller et al. (2023) puts genders on the opposing sides, while different cultural groups have a conflict of interests in our model. Several papers endogenize the index of assortativity through democratic processes (Rigos and Nax, 2016, Wu, 2016), but they do not consider it in the context of cultural evolution.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the model. Section 3 conducts the analysis. Section 4 discusses some of the assumptions made in the model and concludes.","Institutions, assortative matching and cultural evolution",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000241,2 March 2023,2023,Research Article,18.0

Our main hypothesis suggests that countries with lower levels of government economic support are more likely to experience a positive correlation between higher COVID-19 mortality rates and the emergence of internal conflict. Using cross-country data from over 100 countries and controlling for various factors that may influence internal conflict, our analysis provides some support for this hypothesis. The results suggest a possible moderating role for government economic support, with the evidence indicating a weakening or elimination of the association between COVID-19 mortality rates and internal conflict when government economic support is adequate. However, the moderating effect of government economic support is not always significant, and caution is needed when interpreting the results. Our analysis also highlights the potential risks associated with low levels of government economic support during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that in countries where the government's macro-financial package in response to the pandemic is less than approximately 25% of GDP, there is a possible risk of growth in civil disorder resulting from increased COVID-19 deaths per million.","During the two years of the pandemic (2020–2021), COVID-19 claimed the lives of around 5.5 million people worldwide (based on data on the coronavirus pandemic from Our World in Data, as documented by ====). However, the pandemic's impact extended beyond human loss and caused a significant global economic downturn. According to the ====). The economic turmoil caused by COVID-19 may also raise the risk of conflicts, particularly in nations that have been more deeply affected by the pandemic.====This study aims to explore the potential correlation between COVID-19 fatalities and the risk of internal conflicts while considering other critical factors that may contribute to internal conflicts.==== Furthermore, we investigate whether government economic measures implemented in response to the pandemic can help alleviate the relationship between COVID-19 fatalities and internal conflicts.====The International Crisis Group, in a report entitled “The Covid-19 Pandemic and Deadly Conflict” (====), recognized that “====”. Several regional studies have aimed to explore the possible implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for political instability and conflict. These studies include Africa (====), Southeast Asia (====), Latin America (====), and the Middle East and North Africa (====). A group of other studies has examined a similar question in country case studies such as Sudan (====), Haiti (====), and Lebanon (====). The conflict consequences of COVID-19 are also reflected in several policy papers, such as ====, ====, and ====, and in media outlets (e.g., ====; ====; ====). In a descriptive study, ==== examined quantitative and qualitative evidence for nine countries during the first half of 2020 and found mixed effects of the pandemic on armed conflicts, such as battles and explosive events. The likelihood of armed conflict increased in some countries (India, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, and the Philippines), mainly due to the weakening of government institutions and the lack of international attention during the global pandemic, while it showed a decline in others (Afghanistan, Colombia, Thailand, and Yemen), possibly because of less favorable opportunity structures for military rebel groups. In general, he found that the probability of armed conflict escalation was greater than de-escalation during the initial phases of the pandemic.====Despite these efforts, a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between COVID-19 fatalities and internal conflict, including its various components (e.g., civil disorder, terrorism, and civil war) for multiple countries remains missing. This study aims to fill this gap in literature by conducting multiple cross-country ==== and considering the different components of internal conflict, while also considering the impact of government economic interventions and the moderating effects on conflict.====Research has indicated that the pandemic has led to an increase in various forms of violence (====; ====). It is worth noting that the rise in internal conflict and social unrest caused by the health crisis is not unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has also occurred during previous pandemics such as the Black Death in the 1300s and the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 (====). A 2020 survey of leading economists by the Initiative on Global Markets (====) found that a majority believed the pandemic would worsen inequality, in part due to its disproportionate impact on low-skilled workers globally. An IMF report that compared the COVID-19 pandemic to previous outbreaks such as SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, and Zika, predicted that the gap in inequality between the rich and poor will continue to widen in the future (====).====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====).==== For example, the United States passed the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020, which is the largest economic stimulus bill in the country's history (====). The aim of such fiscal stimulus measures is to reduce uncertainty, bolster business and consumer confidence, and ultimately encourage household consumption and business investment (====). ====The contribution of our study is twofold. First, while there have been a number of descriptive and historical studies on the impact of health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on political stability and social unrest (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====), to the best of our knowledge, there is limited empirical research examining the association between COVID-19 fatalities and changes in risk of internal conflict across countries in 2020 and 2021.==== Second, we aim to add to the literature by exploring the possible moderating role of government economic measures in response to the pandemic on the link between COVID-19 mortalities and internal conflict. Despite the emerging literature on the impact of government economic measures in response to the health crisis on economic and financial variables (e.g., ====; ====; ====; Gholipour et al. forthcoming 2023), no studies have yet investigated the additional effects of these measures on political variables, including risk of internal conflict. This is a critical area of investigation as internal conflict can extend beyond borders and pose a direct threat to regional stability and international peace and security (====). In addition, as explained by the International Crisis Group (====), the political consequences of the pandemic are less understood and require further empirical research to fully understand the short- and long-term effects of the health crisis. With this study, we aim to address these gaps in the literature.====Our study suggests that there is a positive and statistically significant correlation between higher COVID-19 death rates and the development of internal conflict, specifically civil disorder, during the pandemic period, even after controlling for other sources of conflict, the initial level of conflict, and continent dummies. However, the relationship between COVID-19 fatalities and internal conflict can be weakened to some extent when governments provide economic support during the health crisis. Nevertheless, due to the cross-country nature of our analysis, we cannot make definitive causal inferences from our results. Furthermore, we examined the association between COVID-19 fatalities and the ICRG external conflict risk score during the pandemic years but did not find a robust and significant relationship. Overall, our findings suggest that while internal conflict may be the primary political risk factor affected by the COVID-19 crisis, further research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between the pandemic and political instability.====The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section ==== reviews relevant literature and proposes hypotheses, Section ==== details the data and methodology used, Section ==== presents the estimation results, and Section ==== concludes the paper.====The following is the Supplementary data to this article.",COVID-19 fatalities and internal conflict: Does government economic support matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268023000125,24 February 2023,2023,Research Article,19.0

Drawing on the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, we find that earthquake hazard increases civic capital. We exploit variation across neighboring municipalities and use a neighbor-pair fixed effect estimator to establish a causal link between earthquake hazard and the accumulation of civic capital. We decompose the effect of earthquake hazard variation along four dimensions – frequency, space, magnitude, and timing – and observe that the effect is mostly explained by high-magnitude seismic events in the past. Our results are in line with the intuition that cooperative social norms build over a very long time span.","How do societies cope with negative shocks such as natural disasters? In a world where insurance markets are incomplete and the provision of public goods may not be perfect, individuals may adopt different strategies. One possible solution is turning to religion for psychological relief or mutual support (e.g. Van De Wetering, 1982, Ager and Ciccone, 2018, Sinding Bentzen, 2019). Another solution is strengthening the political power. In the past, viewing natural disasters as divine punishment reinforced the authority of political figures, who were also religious leaders (Belloc et al., 2016). More generally, efforts to deal with the adversities of life often imply solving social dilemmas, a problem that is germane to human co-existence (Enke, 2019).====This paper aims to shed light on such questions by investigating whether earthquakes induce humans to cooperate and, if this is the case, through which channels. More specifically, we study whether and in which direction earthquake hazard affects the set of good social norms often referred to as ==== (Guiso et al., 2011). The answer is not straightforward. On the one hand, a disastrous event can spur chaos, looting and, more generally, individual opportunistic behavior (Winkler, 2021). On the other hand, the payoff from cooperation is higher after a disaster, giving individuals a greater incentive to behave pro-socially (Voors et al., 2012, Bai and Li, 2021).====A better understanding of this issue is crucial, as the role of civic capital in explaining cross-country differences in economic growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997, Zak and Knack, 2001), good governance (Knack, 2002), and, more generally, economic well-being (Guiso et al., 2011, Algan and Cahuc, 2014) is now well known. Yet, why (and how) some societies accumulate more civic capital than others remains an open debate.==== To the best of our knowledge, however, this paper is the first that explores whether the exposure to earthquake hazard is a contributing factor in the ==== of civic capital.====To this end, we employ geo-referenced information drawn from the historical dataset on earthquakes of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, and construct several measures of earthquake hazard. This dataset is combined with proxies of civic capital for 8082 Italian municipalities. In line with previous literature, we focus on several dimensions of pro-social behavior conducive to the accumulation of civic capital (Putnam, 1993). Specifically, we consider: (i) the presence of an organ donation association, to assess the purely altruistic component of prosociality (Guiso et al., 2011); (ii) a measure of tax compliance as a proxy of individual willingness to free ride on contribution to a public good (Buonanno and Vanin, 2017); and (iii) the density of Catholic churches as a reflection of the religious-driven component of civic capital (Paldam and Paldam, 2017, Ager and Ciccone, 2018, Sinding Bentzen, 2019). As our measures of civic capital may be affected by other variables that are also correlated with earthquake hazard, we add a rich set of control variables to our estimates, including climatic, geographic, and historical information about each municipality. Using this wealth of information, we find that earthquake hazard increases municipality-level civic capital. Moreover, given that the effects of earthquakes are not contained within municipal administrative boundaries, we also allow the variation in earthquake hazard to have potential spatial spillovers from a given municipality to its neighboring municipalities. Our preliminary results remain stable after the inclusion of this possibility.====To establish a proper causal link between earthquake hazard and the accumulation of civic capital, we exploit variation across neighboring municipalities (Acemoglu et al., 2012). Our results, indeed, could be due to a mere correlation, given by the non-random location of earthquakes that are generated by movements of the terrestrial crust along well-known fault lines. One could therefore argue that societies close to these lines are systematically different from those living farther away. To address these concerns, we use a neighbor-pair fixed effect estimator, so that the effect of the earthquake hazard is identified by comparing municipalities that are similar in economic and geographical characteristics but for their exposure to earthquakes. Results confirm that earthquake hazard increases municipality-level civic capital. In particular, a rise of one standard deviation in the earthquake hazard augments civic capital, in our most conservative estimate, by at least 6.7% of a standard deviation. Moreover, we provide a series of additional estimates that address possible selection effects resulting from the comparison of municipalities that have never been hit by an earthquake to those located in very seismic areas. In particular, we run our estimations on a subsample of municipalities hit by an earthquake at least once. Our results are robust to the inclusion of other geographic characteristics, historical controls, the adoption of a restricted sample of powerful seismic events, different reference distances, and a series of falsification tests. We also check that our results are not driven by historical migrations and selection on information.====Our findings indicate a heterogeneous effect among hit municipalities, with those having more frequently experienced earthquakes displaying on average a higher level of civic capital. Moreover, the effect is primarily driven by high-magnitude events that occurred in the past. This finding is consistent with the inefficient provision of public goods in pre-unitarian Italian states, a situation that fostered returns to cooperation. Indeed, the burden of reconstruction fell mostly upon local communities (Guidoboni and Ferrari, 2000, Guidoboni, 2014). Our results also speak to the historical formation and long-term persistence of cultural norms as contributing factors in the accumulation of civic capital. To this regard, one might ask to what extent the reactive cooperative behavior to the inefficient provision of public goods in pre-unitarian states has persisted culturally in these communities. Guiso et al. (2016) show that historical shocks may, in fact, generate long-lasting differences in civic capital accumulation. This accumulation is the product of both within-household inter-generational value transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981, Bisin and Verdier, 2001, Dohmen et al., 2012) and the co-evolution of culture and institutions. Indubitably, there is a strategic complementary between norms of interpersonal cooperation and the institutions that enforce them (Tabellini, 2008). To be applicable in our case, both mechanisms therefore require persistent exposure to earthquakes so as to induce the accumulation of civic capital. This explanation is also consonant with the findings of Giuliano and Nunn (2020), who demonstrate that environmental similarity across generations is a key determinant of observed cultural trait persistence.====As seismicity is a very stable natural feature, we can reasonably assume that it is highly capable of having a persistent effect on societies’ cultural traits. In adopting this view, we take a different approach relative to previous research, which has tended to focus on the short and medium term effects of (mostly) single seismic events. To this regard, scholars have explored saving and spending behavior (Filipski et al., 2019), social capital (Bai and Li, 2021, Giardini et al., 2022), crime (Hombrados, 2020), religiosity (Sinding Bentzen, 2019), GDP per capita (Barone and Mocetti, 2014), delayed transition to self-government (Belloc et al., 2016), public expenditures (Masiero and Santarossa, 2020), or electoral outcomes (Masiero and Santarossa, 2021).====Broadly, our results build on the literature investigating the role of disasters and negative shocks in shaping social norms and culture (Fong and Luttmer, 2009, Bauer et al., 2016). Our work also intersects with evolutionary anthropology research on social learning, which shows that norms and beliefs that maximize fitness to external constraints become prevalent in communities exposed to the same environment (Boyd and Richerson, 1988).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a conceptual framework that explains the relationship between earthquake hazard and civic capital. Section 3 describes the dataset used in our analysis. Section 4 introduces our baseline evidence. Section 5 provides causal evidence that earthquake hazard increases civic capital, while Section 6 presents robustness checks and additional evidence.

Under Israel's Labor Socialist regime, bread was mostly privately supplied. In setting prices, policymakers faced tradeoffs between producer profits/viability of small-scale producers and consumer welfare, and between producer profits and minimizing inflation and real appreciation. Subsidization entailed a tradeoff between producer profits and consumer welfare on one hand, and fiscal responsibility and exchange rate unification on the other hand. We study the regulatory changes that took place as the industry structure evolved, and document the changes that occurred in the revealed weights of producer profits, consumer welfare, fiscal responsibility and exchange rate unification. Over 1952–1977, regulatory reforms accelerated the process of technologically-based rationalization, and policy was strongly pro-consumer. This process did not unfold smoothly: Regulatory changes occurred in four phases, with (sometimes) sharp fluctuations in consumer welfare, producer profits, fiscal policy and exchange rate policy.","This paper is the first study of the political economy of bread regulation in a democratic country after World War II. In many countries, bread regulation took the form of a cheap bread regime—a combination of price controls and universal (=untargeted) bread subsidies. While there is a substantial social scientific literature on cheap bread regimes in autocracies (e.g. Egypt, Jordan, and Iran; see Ghada et al., 2013 and the sources cited therein), there is no literature on cheap bread regimes in democracies (e.g. Israel, 1948–1990; the UK, 1939–1956 and 1974–1977; West Germany, July 1950–1958 (from 1953, under the Berlin municipality); New Zealand (until 1967); India (1942–1995)).==== Our paper fills this gap.====From the establishment of the modern State of Israel in 1948 until 1977, the Government of Israel was led by the pro-Western socialist Labor Party. Israeli socialism was unique in that ownership of the means of production was divided among three economic sectors: the public sector (25% of NNP in 1953), the Histadrut—General Federation of Labor==== (almost 22%) sector, and the private sector (roughly 53%) (Halevi 1957). Monopolies and cartels were pervasive in the public and Histadrut sectors (Halevi 1957; Hillman 1988).====Consumer goods were generally supplied by the private sector. Many private consumer goods sectors were monopolistic or cartelistic, just like the Histadrut-dominated sectors (see Hillman 1988 for a comprehensive description of the economy, including socialist and private monopolies and cartels in individual industries). Despite the prominence of the public and Histadrut sectors, the economy was not planned but relied on regulated markets including regulated international trade. The combination of socialist ownership and markets led to the designation of the economic regime as “market socialism” (Hillman 1991). Because socialist ownership was not all-encompassing, the economic regime was also described as “socialism in less than one country” (Schnytzer 1991).====Like many consumer goods, bread was mostly supplied by the private sector: Initially, private bakeries had an 82–85% market share, and Histadrut bakeries had a 15–18% market share.==== With prices regulated, there was nonprice competition between bakeries in the same local markets—every morning, bakeries competed to deliver hot bread to retailers as early and as frequently as possible.====We study the evolution of bread regulation until the political upset of the 1977 elections, when the Likud party defeated the Labor Party for the first time in the history of the modern state. Using hand-collected data==== from Israel State Archives (ISA),==== newspapers and other sources, we address the following research questions: How did paternalistic socialist policymakers regulate the bread market to ensure both bread affordability and producer viability? How did regulated bread prices influence the industrial structure of the bakery sector, and how did the industrial structure of the bakery sector influence regulated bread prices? How did bread affordability change over time, and why? How did policymakers balance microeconomic and macroeconomic considerations?====Our story, in brief, is the following. Ca. 1952, Israel's bread industry was ripe for a technologically-based rationalization, due to the prevalence of small, high-cost bakeries and the existence of massive excess capacity. However, the rationalization was delayed due to successful rent seeking: Large, low-cost bakeries and small, high-cost bakeries jointly lobbied the government to set official bread prices based on the costs of small bakeries (“cost-plus for primitive bakeries”), and policymakers obliged. This ensured the survival of small bakeries and generous profits for large bakeries, and incentivized noncompetitive behavior and joint rent seeking. In mid-1952, new policymakers took over and decided to end the status quo. They implemented a series of policy reforms that disproportionately harmed small bakeries' profitability; these reforms signaled credibly that small bakeries were no longer viable and eliminated the incentive for noncompetitive behavior and joint rent seeking. The result was a dramatic rationalization of the bakery industry, which unfolded in four distinct phases. During 1974–1977, large bakeries began to exit, and the remaining bakeries transitioned to three daily shifts, which virtually eliminated excess capacity. By January 1977, just 90 bakeries remained, vs. 443 in December 1953 (Fig. 1).====Over 1948–1977, policymakers implemented a strongly pro-consumer policy that greatly increased bread affordability. Although policy was strongly pro-consumer in the long term, it was highly volatile in the short and medium terms: In 1954 and 1962, policymakers sharply increased bread prices, in the context of (attempted) exchange rate unifications and fiscal consolidations. However, during 1964–1973, policymakers froze prices for 9.5 years (!) despite skyrocketing global wheat prices and diminished bakery profitability.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the Stigler-Peltzman model of regulation, which explains some (but not all) of the major phenomena that we document. Section 3 describes the initial political economy equilibrium around 1952. Sections 4-7 describe the regulatory reforms and rationalization that occurred in four distinct phases over 1952–1977, and identifies the winners and losers in each phase.

We focus on the economic effects of the 1970s institutional reforms on government decentralization and wage bargaining. Our main hypothesis is that decentralization allocates the provision of public capital to institutions, the local ones, more exposed to a territory's social capital. Since social capital is lower in the Southern regions, decentralization made their developmental policies less effective from 1970 onwards, and regional ==== increased.====We build an ==== augmented to include the interaction between social capital and public investment as well as the reform of the Italian labour market.

To identify causal effects, we exploit the prevalence of Islamist terrorism in neighboring countries as an exogenous source of variation, arguing that regional terrorism affects local terrorism through ====. We show that increased activity by Islamist terrorist groups is linked to lower legal status of women. By contrast, we find that neither Islam per se nor other types of terrorism have comparable effects. This reinforces the notion that Islamist terrorism is singularly interested and effective in weakening women's rights. Our results are consistent with a rational-economic model of terrorism, where Islamist terrorists purposefully use violence to maximize political utility, while governments make concessions that constrain the role of women because the costs of compliance are lower than the harm from continued Islamist terrorism.","Terrorism is commonly defined as the “premeditated use or threat to use violence against noncombatants by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political objective through the intimidation of a large audience beyond that of the immediate victims” (Gaibulloev and Sandler, 2019: 278). This definition implies that terrorists use violence to induce government compliance with respect to their political objectives. Such concessions are expected to materialize when “a besieged government views the anticipated costs of future terrorist actions as greater than the costs of conceding to terrorist demands” (Sandler and Enders, 2008: 17).====Empirical research concerning the strategic effectiveness of terrorism is, however, mixed.==== In a survey, Gaibulloev and Sandler (2019: 321) conclude that “the question of terrorist groups' effectiveness [in extracting concessions] is by no means settled”. Indeed, some authors contend that terrorism can be an effective means to obtain political goals (e.g., Pape, 2003; Gould and Klor, 2010; Gaibulloev and Sandler, 2014). As the most prominent example, Pape (2003) studies the universe of suicide terrorism between 1980 and 2001, finding that suicide terrorism can be effective in coercing liberal democracies to make significant territorial concessions. For instance, he argues that in the 1980s, ==== was successful in achieving its objective of ending the U.S. intervention in Lebanon and aiding ==== own territorial ambitions by attacking U.S. targets, thus imposing political, military and human costs that were too high for the U.S. to bear (Pape, 2003: 354). Then again, others find that terrorism does not successfully induce government compliance after all (e.g., Abrahms, 2006, 2011, 2012; Cronin, 2006; Fortna, 2015). For example, Abrahms (2011) examines 125 campaigns by violent non-state actors, finding that terrorist campaigns against civilian targets are ineffective at inducing government concessions.====In this paper, we contribute to the empirical literature on the strategic effectiveness of terrorism by investigating how ==== is affected by ====.==== We hypothesize that Islamist militants use terrorism to curtail ====.==== In detail, we argue that Islamist terrorists behave according to a rational-economic model of terrorism in which violence maximizes utility (from gaining political concessions) and is thus employed strategically and purposefully to achieve political objectives (e.g., Landes, 1978; Sandler et al., 1983; Frey and Luechinger, 2003; Sandler and Enders, 2004). Islamist militants seek to return to an ostensibly unadulterated form of Islam and the rule of God's laws (====) and to establish a form of Islamic governance and society consistent with the purported will of God (e.g., Tibi, 1998; Lewis, 2003; Esposito, 2006; Roy, 2006; Hansen and Kainz, 2007; Toth, 2013). Besides many other aspects of social, economic and political life (e.g., concerning jurisprudence, the economic system, good governance and the treatment of sexual minorities and apostates), this also involves ultra-traditionalist perceptions of women and conceptions about women's role in society.==== Accordingly, Islamist militants reject modern and ostensibly “un-Islamic” notions of women's rights, female empowerment, feminism, sexual liberation and gender equality. Thus, achieving female subordination is expected to create utility for Islamist militants, yielding various spiritual rewards (redemption, salvation from evil, heavenly luxuries, etc.). Violence is a tool to achieve this objective and generate this very utility. Ultimately, concessions that weaken women's societal position will materialize when governments besieged by Islamist terrorism view the economic and political costs of Islamist terrorism as greater than the costs of concessions.====Evaluating the strategic effectiveness of terrorism means assessing whether and to what extent Islamist terrorists are successful in extracting concessions in the form of a weaker position of women in society. We therefore examine the relationship between Islamist terrorism and the status of women for a sample of 171 countries between 1970 and 2016. We add to the literature on the effectiveness of terrorism by focusing on a hitherto ====: the curtailing of women's position in society. Furthermore, we use an instrumental-variable approach to establish a ==== of Islamist terrorism on female empowerment, given potential concerns about reverse causation and feedback. To allow for causal identification, we exploit the prevalence of Islamist terrorism in neighboring countries as an exogenous source of variation in a country's likelihood of experiencing Islamist terrorism. The associated instrumental variable is relevant because terrorism tends to be influenced by terrorist activity in proximate countries, e.g., due to cooperation between militant groups, cross-border learning and imitation behavior as well as franchising by major Islamist terrorist organizations. Our exclusion restriction requires that there are no regional trends besides regional Islamist terrorist activity that similarly spread within the same world region and affect local Islamist terrorism. We probe the validity of our instrumental-variable approach by controlling for a host of regional economic, political and demographic shocks as well as by resorting to the plausibly exogenous framework of Conley et al. (2012) that allows us to investigate and relax the exclusion restriction. We show that our instrumental-variable estimates are robust to including various regional trends and plausible violations of the exclusion restrictions, mitigating concerns about identification threats. Finally, we contrast the effect of Islamist terrorism with the impact of other forms of ideology terrorism (left-wing or nationalist-separatist terrorism), investigating how ==== shapes the goal structures and strategic effectiveness of terrorism. In so doing, we add to the small literature on the role of ideology in the causes and consequences of terrorism (e.g., Piazza, 2009; Kis-Katos et al., 2014; Carson and Suppenbach, 2018; Meierrieks et al., 2021).====To preview our empirical findings, we find—consistent with our expectations—robust evidence that increased activity by Islamist terrorist groups is linked to lower levels of women's empowerment. Crucially, we always control for a country's Muslim population share; we consistently find that this share does not affect empowerment. Thus, our study also adds to the discussion concerning the perceived illiberalism of Islam, especially with regards to gender equality (e.g., Donno and Russett, 2004; Gutmann and Voigt, 2015; Gouda and Potrafke, 2016). Our findings strongly suggest that this illiberalism is a function of violent Islamist fundamentalism (indicated by the presence of Islamist terrorist groups) rather than the pervasiveness of Islam per se (indicated by the Muslim population share). We also find that left-wing and nationalist-separatist terrorism do not affect national levels of women's empowerment and rights, which reinforces the notion that the adverse effect of terrorism on the position of women in society is specific to Islamist terrorism. Finally, we show that the adverse effect of Islamist terrorism does not depend on whether a country is weak or strong in economic-military terms; by contrast, we find that Islamist terrorism does reduce women's empowerment in countries in which political deliberation is low and the concentration of political power is high. This is indicative of potential mechanisms of how Islamist terrorism undermines the status of women: Concessions appear to be a consequence of political feasibility (i.e., the ability to implement weaker women's rights) rather than economic-military vulnerability.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop our main hypothesis in more detail. We introduce the data and methodology to study the nexus between Islamist terrorism and the role of women in society in Section 3.

This paper examines the fiscal effects of compiling business-like financial statements on the expenditures of local governments in Japan as a complement to cash-based reporting. Using the variation in the deadlines for compiling new statements given by the central government in a difference-in-differences ==== approach, we found that business-like financial statements have limited effects on municipalities’ expenditures but have short-run effects on social assistance expenses. This might be a part of the reconstruction of their expenditure structure.","Traditionally, public-sector budgets have been prepared and settlements have been reported through cash-based accounting. Cash-based accounting statements generally do not report assets and liabilities, while business-like accrual-based accounting statements do report them. Cash-based accounting recognizes transactions only when the associated cash is received or paid, while accrual-based accounting recognizes transactions when they occur. Therefore, a reform from cash-based to accrual-based accounting can provide relatively comprehensive and long-term insights into the impacts of such a policy. This paper investigates the fiscal effects of compiling business-like financial statements in addition to traditional cash-based settlement documents by exploiting a change for Japanese subnational governments, using the variation in the deadlines set by the central government.====Following the arguments favorable to accrual accounting, in 2016, approximately three-quarters (25 out of 34) of the central governments of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had adopted an accrual accounting basis for annual financial reports, and approximately 30% of these countries (10 out of 34) had done so for budget preparation (Moretti, 2016). The financial statements of subnational governments are also becoming accrual-based. An OECD survey showed that two-thirds (21 out of 32) of OECD countries use accrual-based accounting for the statements of subnational governments (Irwin and Moretti, 2020). The central government of Japan, similar to those of other developed countries, has compiled balance sheets since 2000; however, they are complementary to cash-based fiscal reports (Moretti and Youngberry, 2018). Local governments are also asked to compile balance sheets and other related financial statements.====Despite the widespread use of business-like accounting systems, the empirical evidence regarding such a system’s effects is insufficient. The accounting literature is mainly based on case studies or questionnaires that examine the effects of accrual accounting.==== Some scholars have questioned the usefulness of business-like accounting per se: Carlin (2005) for the State of Victoria, Australia; Paulsson (2006) for the Swedish central government; and Kobayashi et al. (2016) and Kuroki et al. (2022) for Japanese local governments,==== among others. As Christensen (2007) summarizes, one of the challenges faced in measuring the effects of accrual accounting is that accounting reforms are often interconnected with organizational and managerial changes.====In examining the effects of an accounting system, it is insufficient to compare local governments with different accounting systems because a local government that wants to improve its fiscal balance or restructure its budget may well choose business-like accounting.==== To address this endogeneity, Christofzik (2019) uses the variation in the timing with which regulation for accounting is enacted among German states, and Dorn et al. (2021) use the variation in the timing of the introduction of accrual-based statements among counties in Bavaria, Germany. Both studies depend on the assumption that decisions regarding public accounting systems are random once observable variables, government- and time-specific effects and time trends are controlled for. A more recent paper by Raffer (2020) applies a quasi-experimental approach with different matching techniques to data from municipalities in the German state of Baden-Württemberg.====Regarding the choice of accounting standard as an intuition or a rule, this paper contributes to the literature on fiscal discipline. When fiscal deficits tend to be excessive (e.g., Alesina et al., 1998, Persson and Tabellini, 2000), numerical fiscal rules such as balanced budget rules are promising tools for fiscal discipline.==== The literature supports the effectiveness of fiscal rules for federal- and state-level governments (e.g., Poterba, 1994, Eichengreen and Bayoumi, 1994, von Hagen and Harden, 1995, Debrun et al., 2008). Negative effects of such rules, such as avoidance behaviors and creative accounting, have also been noted (e.g., Milesi-Ferretti, 2004, von Hagen and Wolff, 2006, Beetsma et al., 2009). Moreover, the effects of fiscal rules on local governments have been studied. Positive effects have been found in some studies, including those by Grembi et al. (2016) for Italian municipalities, by Dove (2016) for U.S. municipalities, and by Burret and Feld (2018b) and Chatagny (2015) for Swiss cantons, although avoidance behavior has also been detected by Balduzzi and Grembi (2011) for Italian municipalities, by Burret and Feld (2018a) for Swiss cantons, and by Hirota and Yunoue (2022) for Japanese municipalities. This literature shows that not only numerical rules but also fiscal institutions can play a role in fiscal health; this is the case with independent fiscal agencies and councils (Debrun et al., 2009) and systems of fiscal oversight and enforcement (Christofzik and Kessing, 2018), transparency (Alt and Lassen, 2006, Benito and Bastida, 2009), or fiscal information (Janků and Libich, 2019). As discussed by Dorn et al. (2021), accounting standards are a component of fiscal institutions and thus can affect governments’ behavior.====The purpose of this paper is to examine the fiscal effect of compiling new business-like financial statements in addition to traditional cash-based settlement documents as supplementary information. Our data are taken from Japanese local governments, and they provide us with an environment in which to measure the causal effects of this new accounting system.==== As mentioned above, in 2007, the Japanese central government asked local governments to compile new financial statements. It also set deadlines for compiling these statements, although following this request was not mandatory, as explained in the next section. The deadline given to each local government depended only on the type of local government and the population size; thus, the deadlines were not controllable by or endogenous to local governments. Our identification strategy exploits the variation in the timing of the deadlines in an instrumental variable approach to address the possible endogeneity in the compilation of the new financial statements, which might not be fully controlled for in Christofzik (2019) or Dorn et al. (2021).==== After the new statements were introduced, the traditional settlement documents continued to be published officially as the main documents in our setting, which enabled us to use comparable data before and after the introduction of the new statements. We applied a difference-in-differences with instrumental variables (DID-IV) approach, focusing on primary expenditures and each category of expenditure.====Our findings are summarized as follows. First, the new financial statements do not affect the primary expenditures of ordinary accounts. This is consistent with the results of Christofzik (2019) and Dorn et al. (2021), who find only a limited impact on the overall financial balance or expenditures. Second, the new statements negatively affect social assistance expenses. This result is robust across specifications, but it is only a short-run effect. Third, the new statements increase “other revenue”, most of which is revenue from the principal and interest of loans to others. Fourth, the effects of the different coverage of the new financial statements do not vary substantially.====These findings do not necessarily coincide with the technical-rational view that accrual accounting provides more comprehensive information than cash-based accounting and thereby improves transparency, efficiency and accountability. This may be due to short-run implementation costs that mask such advantages. As Dorn et al. (2021) point out, cash-based accounting may already provide sufficient information, and political decision makers may lack sufficient skill to use the information provided by the new financial statements. It is also possible that accrual accounting requires estimates and is thus not necessarily transparent, as Christofzik (2019) argues. Our interpretation is that the new financial statements have symbolic value rather than decision-making value, and they trigger the reconstruction of local governments’ expenditures on items as part of the administrative reform.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Bush. Our empirical analysis is based on the tonality of their political coverage using more than 815,000 news items on Democrats and Republicans from 2001 through 2012. Using the Political Coverage Index (PCI), we find evidence for partisan and biased news coverage across all of the newscasts, with a general tendency of ====, and ==== to be slightly more critical of the Republicans, and of ==== with a clear tendency to be more critical of Democrats. Moreover, and even more interesting, two of the newscasts – ==== and ==== – changed their political coverage such that it became more conservative when Democrat Barack Obama became president. This effect becomes even more pronounced when observations from election campaign periods are dropped. We interpret these results as evidence for a watchdog-like anti-government bias on the part of the observed newscasts. In contrast, ==== remains Democrat-critical independent of who is in office and can be seen as partisan from this perspective. The results are confirmed when controlling for differences in reporting rates between the parties and the administrations using interaction terms.","Media play an important role in the perceptions and decisions of individuals in economic and political contexts, with information typically gathered indirectly through media channels alongside direct communication and personal experience. Thereby, media can only provide a partial picture and not a complete coverage of everything that is happening in the world. Moreover, media reality is prone to various types of distortions, so-called media bias (Entman 2007).====In the political context, one bias of interest is if media outlets favor one or another side of the political spectrum. In addition, it is of interest if the political media bias is constant or changing, for instance when another political party gains power. The results are by no means ==== clear: One perspective can be traced back to parliamentary debate in 1787 in the United Kingdom over providing media access to the parliament. In this debate, Edmund Burke claimed that media form the “fourth estate” and, with this, acted as an additional controlling instance over government.==== In line with Burke, one could expect a critical anti-government bias in media reporting.====A different perspective is provided by Public Choice literature: For instance, Anderson and McLaren (2012) argue that media are owned by people with political and profit motives, who use their influence to change policy. Other authors claim that governments capture the media through policy decisions in their favor or by access to news stories in order to maintain “a ‘cozy’ relationship” with the media (Besley and Prat 2006, 720). In particular, the latter explanation of media capture implies that media outlets tend to be less critical of the government resulting in a pro-government bias. The former explanation would lead us to expect that such pro-government bias exists among media outlets that are owned or edited by people aligned with the political party in power.====In this contribution, we analyze the political coverage of four leading news gathering organizations in the US – ==== and ==== – on the basis of a unique dataset. It contains a large number of hand-coded media data from 2001 through 2012, which enables us to examine the tonality of political reporting by the aforementioned news organizations. Despite the fact that the selection of newscasts and timeframe is mainly driven by data availability, the selected news organizations are relevant, as ==== and ==== are the news divisions of the three big traditional commercial broadcast television networks in the US. Subsequently, in 1996, ==== was established as cable news channel, competing, in large part, with the three aforementioned news gathering organizations.====By applying a tonality-based approach to more than 815,000 news items on Democrats and Republicans from 2001 through 2012, we are able to identify the relative political positioning of the four newscasts during the time span analyzed. In a second step, we analyze whether media coverage of politicians and parties differs depending on the party affiliation of the president in office.====Methodologically, our analysis is based on a panel regression set up with media and time fixed effects as well as a multitude of economic and geopolitical controls. In order to reduce possible endogeneity issues, we first drop the months around the elections from our data and focus on periods from one month after an election to four months before the next election and, second, we extend our analysis by estimating the differences in media coverage about Democrats and Republicans during the presidency of Bush and the presidency of Obama, respectively.====Our results suggest that, overall, media reporting was more critical of Democrats when Democratic president Obama was in power than of Republicans when the Republican president Bush was in office. Interesting differences are observed between the newscasts: For ==== and ==== we find indications of an anti-government-bias, whereas for ====, reports are always much more critical of the Democrats than of Republicans and can be seen as partisan from this perspective.====The remainder of our contribution is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature and describes the research gap. In Section 3, the data are introduced and the political positioning of the newscasts is demonstrated by the Political Coverage Index.

This paper shows that the answer depends on the initial economic development level during the democratic transition when the foundation of institutions was laid. Democracy facilitates growth only in countries that already have adequate development at transition time. These countries are more likely to create and sustain growth-enhancing institutions than others. Without appropriate development, democracy does not improve growth; this applies to about 40% of the third-wave democratized countries. These results are based on a sample of 153 countries in 1960–2010 and robust to various specifications and endogeneity issues.","While most people around the world believe that democracy improves living standards,==== experts in social sciences are not so sure. Theoretical debates on whether democracy enhances or hinders economic growth have been very extensive.==== Substantial controversies also exist on the empirical side. For example, Doucouliagos and Ulubasoglu (2008) find that most estimated effects of democracy on economic growth are not significantly positive.==== The recent literature, however, shows that democracy substantially promotes economic growth by constructing alternative democracy indicators, using advanced econometric techniques, or employing new instrumental variables.====So is democracy good for growth or not? Rather than trying to reach a universal yes or no conclusion, this paper tackles the issue from a novel perspective. Our basic hypothesis is that countries whose democratization process starts while having adequate development are more likely to create and sustain institutions that enhance growth. Hence, the initial condition in terms of economic development is crucial for countries to embark on a path of faster economic growth after democratization. Countries can thus be divided into two groups: Democracy with Adequate Economic Development at Transition (labeled as ====) grows faster than before, while the other group (namely, Democracy with Poor Economic Development at Transition, labeled as ====) does not. Note that this “Strong vs Weak Democracy” label indicates the strength of initial development during the democratization period. In a nutshell, Strong Democracy is good for growth but Weak Democracy not====The relevance of our idea can be illustrated by the comparison between Benin and Ghana. Both countries went through democratization in the 1990s, their Polity scores have been above 6 since 2005, and are considered as fully “free” democracies by Freedom House. However, economic growth in Benin did not improve after democratization, while the opposite is true for Ghana. This can be seen in Fig. 1, which plots GDP per capita growth rates in Benin and Ghana after controlling for growth dynamics, income level, and the time trend. Such discrepancy in growth, however, is not surprising given their development conditions during democratization. According to the criteria proposed in this paper, Benin is categorized as a Weak Democracy while Ghana a Strong Democracy. In addition to a sizeable income gap at their transition times, Benin falls short in other developmental indicators as well as the overall institutional quality; for example, the percentage of adults with secondary schooling was only 8.65% in Benin but 43% in Ghana.====A formal test of the hypothesis is carried out on a sample of 153 countries during 1960–2010 using within estimators in a dynamic growth model. The estimated effect of Strong Democracy on economic growth is indeed positive and significant, while that of Weak Democracy is not statistically different from autocracies. Based on our preferred estimates, the long-run effect of a permanent transition to Strong Democracy would increase GDP by 35.56%, while it is only 1.22% for a Weak Democracy. This pattern is robust to various specifications and endogeneity concerns. In particular, when a composite indicator of development which combines information on education, natural resource share of GDP and income inequality during the political transition period is used, about 40% of the third-wave democratization (Huntington, 1993) are categorized as a Weak Democracy like Benin, and experienced no improvement in growth in comparison to autocracies.====The new insight emerging from our results is not simply that development matters, but that development at the critical juncture of the political transition time is more crucial for future growth. Thus, a natural question to ask is: Why does the initial development affect future growth? The potential channel is through the institutional quality, where adequate development is essential to create and sustain effective institutions in promoting growth.====A first glance of the data shows some preliminary evidence that institutional quality varies with the initial development level during democratization. In Fig. 2, for example, countries with higher GDP per capita in the year of democratic transition have a larger improvement in government transparency (measured by HRV index) after the transition.==== This relationship is stronger when the initial GDP is higher, which can be seen from the distinct slopes of fitted lines for Strong and Weak Democracies. In addition, Fig. 3 contrasts Strong and Weak Democracy groups in terms of transparency levels relative to contemporary autocratic countries. It visually shows that the trends are initially similar but start to diverge after democratization, where the transparency level increases much further in Strong Democracies than in autocracies, while it slightly decreases in Weak Democracies.====This pattern is confirmed by results of more sophisticated regressions for a broad range of institutions covering economic freedom, law and order, corruption, political and social stability.==== Even though the quality of democratic institutions may improve over time through learning-by-doing (Gerring et al., 2005), such effects are dwarfed by the influence of initial birth conditions (i.e., economic development at the political transition period). Furthermore, specific political forms, such as presidential versus parliamentary or majoritarian versus proportional regimes (Persson, 2005), do not have significant effects on growth once the initial development is controlled.====Conceptually, the democratization period is critical because it is the birth time of a suite of new and long-lasting institutions. Given that these institutions are expected to affect future resource allocation in many important ways, they are subject to serious negotiations among major groups in society, where the political bargaining power of each group is often underpinned by its economic clout at that moment (Huang, 2012a). For example, if democratization occurs when development is still weak, rent-seeking activities are likely to be prevalent, giving rise to weak institutions that are vulnerable to large policy swings between the elite rule and populism.==== In contrast, when the main growth engine has already evolved from natural resources to capital investment and innovation, the majority of population would have reached broad consensus on growth-enhancing institutions (Galor and Moav, 2006). Thus, the degree of economic development during the transition time leaves deep birthmarks on new-born institutions, through which it exerts long-lasting effects on future growth. Economic conditions in other periods, however, may only have transient influences, since institutions once established are not as malleable as in the nascent stage.====A useful policy implication of this paper is that key economic development conditions at the political transition year can be used as a better indicator for future institutional quality and growth, since they are more objective, widely available, and parsimonious than direct measures of specific institutions. This is demonstrated by our empirical results where the growth effect of Strong Democracy remains significant after controlling for many institutional variables. The rationale is that, it is not any specific institution ==== that can miraculously deliver growth, but the rising tide of better economic development that lifts all boats of growth-enhancing institutions. It increases the overall capacity of society to design, fund, operate, and monitor the daily functioning of many intermingled institutions in a dynamic economy so that the wheel of growth keeps turning.====The result that only Strong Democracy is good for economic growth may give rise to an interesting question: Is it better for a country to hurry into a Weak Democracy ==== or to wait and transit ==== to a Strong Democracy after further development? Even though in reality political transitions are often unexpected and thus difficult to be planned well ahead, they are still affected by some common beliefs. For example, if most people believe that transition to democracy is absolutely good for economic growth regardless of development conditions, then they are willing to incur great costs to facilitate such a transition as soon as possible. In contrast, if instead they believe democracy is good for long-term growth only when equipped with adequate development, then an option is to wait until the economic structure becomes ready to support a Strong Democracy.==== Similar concerns about the optimal sequence between economic liberalization and political democratization are also discussed by Epstein et al. (2006), Persson and Tabellini (2006), and Rode and Gwartney (2012).====This paper connects two competing views on whether it is development or institution that is more crucial for growth (North, 1990, Acemoglu et al., 2001, Glaeser et al., 2004, Glaeser et al., 2007) by showing that they are fused together at critical junctures as two sides of the same coin: Good institutions do not flow automatically out of political democracy, but need the nutritious soil of adequate economic development to germinate and grow. On the other hand, developmental conditions matter less in normal years than in the political transition time, because they need to be embodied by institutional changes to exert long-term impacts. The effects of development in an arbitrarily fixed year are indeed negligible as in Acemoglu et al. (2019), but become substantially positive and significant once development at the ==== is considered. These results also contribute to the extensive literature on the role of development in democracy.====The critical role of political transition periods is also examined from other perspectives in the literature. Yashar (1997) stresses that a robust civil society during the political reform time constitutes a necessary condition to form cross-class coalitions. Cervellati et al., 2014, Cervellati et al., 2015 show that violence during democratization has a long-lasting effect on the quality of democratic institutions. Besley and Persson (2019) propose that critical junctures in national political history are crucially important to later development.====The paper contributes to the literature on the heterogeneous effects of democratization on economic growth. The typical democratic indices such as Polity or Freedom House scores capture the main characteristics of electoral democracies, but not performance in economic growth. Our results show that checking whether an adequate initial development is achieved at democratization is a simple and effective way to predict future growth. Indeed, this categorization of Strong versus Weak Democracy is more effective in capturing the heterogeneous effects of democracy on growth than a related concept of Partial Democracy, which is defined as any country with a Polity score between 1 and 7 and covers most democratization cases after 1960 (Epstein et al., 2006, Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008b). Since Weak Democracy constitutes almost half of the Partial Democracy group, this means a sizeable number of countries experience no improvement in growth in comparison to autocracies, and thus require further in-depth research on their specific situations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next three sections describe the data, the dynamic estimation model, and the benchmark results with a variety of robustness checks. Potential channels through which democracy affects growth are examined in Section 5. Further discussions are conducted in Section 6.

Using more than thirty years of Japanese import data, we document statistically significant relationships between geopolitics and rare earth metals. We find that the import price per unit of rare earth metals is positively related to geopolitics, while gross import values are negatively related. The negative relationship in the import value appears strongest for rare earth metals sourced from China. Given the strategic and economic significance of rare earth metals, our findings shed light on the economic implications of geopolitical tensions in the decades to come. For users of rare earth elements, an effective risk management program could add value in times of high geopolitical tension. We also highlight rare earth elements’ value as a diplomatic tool for global policymakers.","Rare earth elements (REEs) are termed the “vitamins” and “spice” of a modern economy (Dent 2012; Zepf 2013) because adding small quantities of REEs to metals substantially improve the latter's properties. REEs consist of seventeen elements that are commonly added to elements like iron and boron, to produce materials that neither could achieve alone (Koerth-Baker 2012). Their wide application in technological advancement ranges from consumer products like electric vehicles to infrastructure construction (e.g., wind turbines).====REEs entered the mainstream discourse in 2011 following a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan. China's move to tighten REE exports sent their prices soaring to historic levels (Areddy 2011; Bradsher 2011; The Wall Street Journal 2011). China's dominant position in the global supply chain of REEs is well-documented (See for example Golev, Scott, Erskine, Ali, and Ballantyne 2014.). China's then leader, Deng Xiaoping, observed in the 1990s that “There is oil in the Middle East; there is rare earth in China” (Biedermann 2014, p. 276), so China positions REEs as strategic commodities.====Prior to the rise of China's influence, the US dominated the production and distribution of REEs but ceded supremacy in REEs to China, in all likelihood, because of legal constraints on radioactive elements. After the industry departed the West in the 1980s, China spent the following decades exploring and developing its hinterlands to build the world's largest REE mine in its northern region. According to Klinger (2017), China pursued REE development not only for economic reasons but also for domestic and international political reasons. Its monopoly on REEs originated from its need for nation-building, its territorial politics with the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and its atomic aspirations. China's REE dominance was fueled by its low labor costs and low environmental standards, which kept the price of REE exports so low that competing was not economically viable for players outside China. However, a prolonged period of over-exploitation led to overcapacity and the release of radioactive and corrosive pollutants into the local environment. These issues, along with the black market's impact on the profits of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), contributed to reducing export quotas, which led to the incident with Japan.====The economic-strategic nexus related to REEs can provide significant power to entities that control their production and distribution. Over the last three decades, China has controlled the global supply of REEs (Strafor 2020). Since there is no globally established exchange for trading in REEs and China may have used (or will use) REEs as a diplomatic tool, some political scientists see China's near monopoly as a threat to regional stability (Milner 1999, Rudra and Jensen, 2011). Others argue that China's export policy on REEs in 2011 was motivated by domestic reasons related to resource conservation and environmental protection and the development of downstream and high-tech industries (Biedermann 2014; Wübbeke 2013). As the supply of REEs, both mined minerals and extracted metals, cannot be increased easily—especially not in a cost-effective manner because of pollution issues—the factors that affect the import/export of these elements are of interest to a wide range of global industries.====China's global dominance in REEs is apparent in both upstream production and downstream industries, including the REE intermediary products, as Mancheri (2015) discuss. China's twelfth five-year-plan, announced in May 2011, set goals for boosting energy efficiency, lowering carbon emissions, and investing in transforming China into the world's top producer of renewable energy. Magnets, phosphors, hydrogen storage materials, and abrasive polishing materials were among the sectors on the priority list for expanding downstream REE industries and promoting advanced manufacturing in China. As a result, the government consolidated the entire REE industry from over 100 firms into 6 SOEs and directly funded national research labs for REE smelting and separation. These SOEs produced 99.9 percent of China's REE production quota for the first half of 2016.==== After three large mining conglomerates and two research institutes merge in 2022 into the China Rare Earth Group, China will control 30–40 percent of the global supply. Under the direct supervision of the State Council, the newly established SOE is expected to enhance China's power to price key REEs, which is likely to introduce shocks into the supply chain (Zhou and Brooke 2022). Vekasi (2022) posits that further consolidation of the REE industry in China will be motivated by the goals of improving state control, addressing imbalances in the domestic supply and demand, accentuating vertical integration, and promoting price stability.====According to Kalantzakos (2017), China's has two strategic objectives in developing its REE industry: China wants to ensure that it can meet its internal demand for REEs at cheaper costs than the cost it attaches to its exports, and it wants to continue to provide international corporations access to China by allowing them to relocate and keep their production units in China. These businesses would have to pay more than Chinese firms do, but their pricing would still be lower than would be available in the rest of the globe. Since some technologies rely on specific metals (e.g., catalytic converters and permanent magnet motors), and the REE supply chain cannot respond quickly enough to meet demand, Abraham (2015) postulates that Beijing needs to create only enough uncertainty in a foreign high-tech company's REE supply chain to persuade nervous executives that manufacturing in China is easier than doing so elsewhere.====Given the inter-disciplinary interest in REEs as strategic commodities and the qualitative nature of geopolitics, the academic debate on the topic is most prominent in the international relations (IR) and political economy literatures. The IR scholarship in the field of natural resources originates in the 1970s, during the global resource boom. Early studies’ focus includes disputes between multinational resource corporations and host governments (Moran 2014; Vernon 1971) and the intersection between resource security and foreign policy strategies (Krasner 1978; Mikesell 1987; Vernon 1983). More recently, IR studies extend to interstate affairs on ownership of, control of, and access to natural resources (Stoddard 2013), so they focus on the relationship between geopolitics and natural resources. The IR literature views this relationship as a zero-sum game and a governance issue that emphasizes cooperative dynamics and interdependence (Dannreuther 2013; Dent 2013).====Political economists, on the other hand, are interested in the conditions under which resource interdependence is securitized====—that is, the political process whereby governments consider the inability to access resources an existential threat (Dubash 2011). However, given the qualitative nature of geopolitics, the academic debate on the topic remains conjectural and hypothetical (See, for example, Campbell 2014, Kiggins 2015, and Wilson 2017.). In this paper, we contribute to the literature by offering an empirical and quantitative analysis of geopolitics’ impact on the international trade of such strategic commodities as rare earth metals.====Following the literature (e.g., Kiggins 2015), we contend that geopolitical tensions between, on one hand, countries that supply REEs and other countries on the other may have negative impacts on supplier countries’ volume of REE exports. We argue that, while the price of REEs may surge in the event of such tension, the effect of a decrease in the quantity exported more than offsets the impact of price hikes, thus driving down the total trade value. We test such links by examining the ==== association of geopolitics with the trade of REEs (in terms of volume and prices) in the China-Japan sphere. Our empirical results confirm that geopolitics significantly affect the trade of rare earth metals.====Our analysis of trading data for rare earth metals reveals that the prices for rare earth metals imported by Japan are positively related to the exporting country's level of geopolitical risk, suggesting that the intensification of geopolitical conflict between exporting countries and other countries can inflate the price of rare earth metals. Our analysis also reveals that the gross value of imported rare earth metals is negatively related to geopolitical risk, and the strength of that relationship is amplified if the REE comes from China. In addition, when we control for uncertainty in Japan's economic policies, the relationship between imports of rare earth metals and geopolitical risk becomes statistically insignificant, with the exception of geopolitical risk concerning China. This finding further indicates that the amount of REE exported from China is related to geopolitics. Finally, the negative relationship between Japan's imports of rare earth metals and geopolitical risk in China weakened during the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute on REE export quotas involving China, Japan, and several other countries. Factors like the substantial increase in black market exports and the reduction in export quotas that were induced by domestic political dynamics could have affected our results for this time period.====This paper makes three main contributions to the literature. First, the findings from our empirical and statistical tests on the relationship between geopolitical risk and REEs offer valuable information to a wide range of industries, including the renewable energy/green industry. Second, examining the role of geopolitics in REE trades from a political economy perspective deepens academic discussions on international trade and politics. Third, the study extends our understanding of commodity markets and broadens the application of text-based proxies for geopolitical risk.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional background of REEs and the trade of these commodities between China and Japan. Section 3 explains the data and methodology employed in the analysis.

Although substantial studies have explored the institutional sources of legitimacy, how non-institutional factors affect perceived legitimacy remains unclear. Human societies have a long history of employing symbolic icons to enhance the legitimacy of a given authority. This study reports a laboratory experiment of public goods that investigates whether (and to what extent) symbolic factors enhance perceived legitimacy. In the contexts of various incentive schemes and transparency levels, an “authority” in each group decides whether to target a “citizen” for punishment after observing the contributions of “citizens,” and untargeted citizens then choose to support or hinder the authority. A symbolic scepter is issued to the authority in the treated group, whereas this symbol is absent in the control group. The experimental results suggest that the political symbol significantly enhances the authority's legitimacy regardless of the payment scheme and information transparency. A further analysis shows that the political symbol is not associated with the authority's choices regarding enforcement. Rather, the symbol's effect on perceived legitimacy is primarily driven by the citizens' side—that is, the increasing intrinsic tendency to support authority.","Legitimacy plays a fundamental role in political economy because the performance of governance is strongly associated with the extent to which citizens perceive authorities and institutions as legitimate. Lower levels of compliance and support resulting from a lack of perceived legitimacy of the regimes and government officials increases the difficulty for authorities to enforce laws and public policies.====An extensive body of literature provides empirical and experimental evidence on the legitimacy of institutions and authority (discussed later).==== Seymore Lipset (1959) posits that “legitimacy involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the ==== that the existing political institutions are the most appropriate ones for the society” (p.86). Therefore, legitimacy is a somewhat belief-based concept, highly conditional on individuals’ subjective perceptions.==== Therefore, a natural question left unanswered is whether authorities can successfully use metaphysical matter to manipulate their legitimacy as perceived by their citizens.====Visual symbols, such as banners, insignia, and scepters, play a central role in political arenas.==== On the one hand, political symbols have been associated with totalitarianism; political scientists are aware that malevolent elites strategically use symbols to evoke fascination and obedience.==== Elder and Cobb (1983) postulate that political symbols “serve to constrain people's vision and make them vulnerable to manipulation” (p.30). Such political symbols have been pervasive across different regimes and regions. Scepters and coronation crowns were often used to present the imperial sovereignty of such rulers as Persian Kings, Egyptian Pharaohs, and Roman Emperors. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany used visual emblems (the hammer and sickle and the swastika, respectively) for propaganda and mobilization. Alternatively, modern democratic societies have also been permeated by political insignia, such as rank badges in police forces and armies and the sword, blindfold, and scales in the hands of Justitia. Despite the significance and intensity of political emblems, research into their impacts on legitimacy is surprisingly scarce in economics.====This article reports a public goods laboratory experiment that explores the role of symbolic factors in shaping legitimate authority. This experiment extends the original protocol in Dickson et al. (2015) (henceforth DGH). Each group in the experiment consists of four “citizens” who trade off between contributing to the public pool and free riding in each period, as well as one “authority” who can propose to punish a citizen for sustaining group cooperation after observing citizens' decisions. In the absence of citizen intervention, the probability of successful punishment is 1/2. The three untargeted subjects can change this probability by supporting or hindering the authority's proposal at their own cost. Through this design, perceived legitimacy can be measured directly. Treatment assignments were manipulated in three dimensions. The first two treatment dimensions are institutional arrangements—namely, the transparency level of contributions and the neutrality of the incentive scheme for the authority's punishment. While the experiment's institutional environment has the same variations as DGH, this experiment departs from DGH mainly in focusing on the effects of political symbols by inducing a symbolic scepter issued to the authorities in the treated groups. The experimental environment overcomes the endogenous leader characteristics by random treatment assignment. Moreover, in a controlled experiment, the political symbol does not have any instrumental function but is merely metaphysical. Hence, this design identifies the effects of political symbols rather than other binding powers. The results show that political symbols significantly promote the legitimacy of the authorities—that is, the citizens' propensity to support the authority's sanctioning decision. The estimated effects of the political symbol on perceived legitimacy are similar across different payment schemes and levels of information transparency. Further mechanism analysis suggests that the effect of the political symbol on legitimacy is mainly driven by the citizens' psychological change rather than the authorities' responsibilities.====The experimental findings provide important implications for political economy. The political symbol is a double-edged sword. Political symbols may produce real effects beyond functional performance, even in an authoritative regime. Therefore, we ought to be cautious and aware that they can be used as powerful tools of misdirection and deception as politicians can control the public subconsciously. In contrast, the use of political symbols under the rule of law and checks and balances may enhance the efficiency of appropriate policy implementation.====This study primarily complements two strands of literature in behavioral and political economics. First, it adds to a large set of experiments on the origins and consequences of leadership and legitimacy. Some experiments of collective action have documented the relationship between the procedure by which rules and leaders are determined (for example, democratic voting systems versus exogenous assignment) and their efficiency and legitimacy (Dal Bó et al., 2010, Baldassarri and Grossman 2011; Grossman and Baldassarri 2012; Markussen et al. 2014; Marcin et al. 2019).==== Much like this study, Dickson et al. (2015) investigate the institutional determinants of an authority's legitimacy in a public goods experiment wherein the authority can choose to punish one group member, and the unpunished subjects can decide whether to support or hinder the authority from implementing further sanction. They find that legitimacy is associated with authorities' compensation and the transparency of decision-making. An apparent novelty of this experiment is its investigation into the role of metaphysical factors, rather than humane, material, or institutional issues.====Second, this study contributes to recent delegation literature on the intrinsic value of decision rights—that is, one's preference for the power to determine the outcomes of themselves and others (Bartling et al. 2014; Fatas and Morales 2018; Ferreira et al. 2020; Sloof and von Siemens 2017).==== Although this literature sheds light on people's preference for decision rights and self-reliance, it neglects the other side of the delegation in a hierarchical organization—that is, how the masses evaluate the legitimacy of decision power. The current experiment fills this gap by demonstrating that symbolic icons do not affect an authority's responsibilities but do enhance an authority's legitimacy.====The remainder of this article proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces the experimental design. Section 3 presents the main results. Section 4 discusses the underlying mechanisms. Section 5 provides the concluding remarks.

They play a crucial role in important policy decisions that have ramifications for the corporate sector's cash flows, leading to changes in stock price and volatility. Using data from India, we find that legislative session meetings influence stock price volatility, and the effect is inversely proportional to the strength of the ruling coalition government. These findings advance the theories of intraparty portfolio allocation and partisan trust discrimination in representative democracies based on intraparty and interparty competition in a ruling alliance. Our findings suggest that political competition reflected through government strength in legislative session meetings shapes the mechanism of economic uncertainty, i.e., the foundation of asset price volatility. We draw implications for the conduct of parliamentary business as well as stock investment strategy.","Governments hold discretionary policy influence on economic outcomes which leads to political risk for private firms (Imai and Shelton, 2011). A number of studies have shown that policy uncertainty or political risk arising out of government actions affect stock prices (Beaulieu et al., 2005; Dimic et al., 2015; Lehkonen and Heimonen, 2015). Economic policy uncertainty feeds into changes in stock prices (Ko and Lee, 2015) as well as corporate actions like share repurchases (Pirgaip and Dinçergök, 2019; Anolick et al., 2021). In particular, stock market returns and volatility have been shown to depend on government partisanship (Mukherjee and Leblang, 2007), conduct of political events such as elections (Białkowski et al., 2008; Carnahan and Saiegh, 2021) and political processes such as legislative meetings (Lin and Wang, 2007; Wang et al., 2012). However, the roles of timing of legislative meetings and power of the ruling political formation are absent in the literature.====We argue that when it comes to legislative meetings, the extent of political risk may depend not only on conduct of congressional or parliamentary sessions but also relative strength of the party or coalition of parties (in case of a multi-party democracy) in power. If the ruling party or the ruling coalition has a bigger share of seats in the legislative house, the nature of political risk will be different as compared to a weaker ruling formation due to the former's advantages such as smoother passage of bills with less delays or dilutions caused by intensive scrutiny from the opposition.====While a few studies have shown that ideology of the ruling party has an effect on stock markets (Siokis and Kapopoulos, 2007; Białkowski et al., 2008), there are no studies on the role of strength of a ruling party or coalition in the house. This paper extends the literature on political risk and stock markets by studying the impact of coalition power on stock price movements during Parliament meetings in a vibrant developing economy, viz. India.====We specifically choose India because it is the largest democracy in the world in terms of population. It has 1.38 billion people, with 912 million people eligible to vote, making its elections the world's largest (====). Secondly, it is one of the fastest growing major economies in the world and had clocked a 5-year average GDP growth of 7% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Its economic success has concurrently witnessed a boom in stock markets with the BSE SENSEX- India's bellwether index - growing by 100% in the past 5 years. These political and economic trends justify our choice of India as a case study for the analysis.====We study the Indian Parliament that meets thrice in a calendar year for pre-defined sessions (known as ‘Budget’, ‘Monsoon’ and ‘Winter’ sessions). We focus on the impact of strength of the ruling government on the domestic stock market, during the three types of parliamentary sessions. We employ three alternate measures of government strength that are based on the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (using the seat share of the top 5 parties in the Parliament), the relative strength of the ruling party and the relative strength of the ruling coalition. The econometric estimation relies on the Exponential Generalised Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) model to analyse the effects on stock returns and volatility. We use publicly available data on the Indian Parliament and alternate stock market indices. The main analysis is for the period February 1999 to March 2022 (for BSE500 – a broad-based index) while additional results are presented for September 2005 to March 2022 (using BSE SENSEX – the bellwether index and BSE SmallCap, along with BSE500 for the same period).====Our results show that legislative session meetings lead to a rise in stock market volatility for the broader market and the effect is inversely proportional to strength of the ruling coalition government. Segmenting the indices by market capitalization, we observe that smaller capitalisation stocks are more sensitive to parliamentary activity and strength of the government. We also create a portfolio to evaluate the economic importance of our results. We find that avoiding equity markets during legislative sessions yields higher profits than participating in them. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on government's role in asset prices that has important implications for investors which we discuss at the end of the paper. In the spirit of Carnahan and Saiegh (2021), we contribute to the international political economy literature by establishing a relationship between financial market volatility and political developments.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant literature for the study. In Section 3, we provide a brief background of the Indian political system and develop the study hypotheses.

Building on this foundation we explore how views of trust and individualism interact to affect attitudes about income inequality. Our results show that while views regarding social trust generally positively affect the desire for income ====, this effect is strengthened in the presence of high individualism. Alternatively stated, distrust in highly individualistic environments leads to a greater desire for income differences (inequality). Our result highlights the important role played by market-based price and profit incentives in fostering economic activity and exchange in larger, impersonal extended orders where interpersonal trust and reputational effects are generally absent (in contrast to personal, small group exchange). Our results are robust to a variety of techniques to establish identification and account for sample selection and omitted variable bias.","Authors since the time of Adam Smith (1763/1978) have recognized the important role played by interpersonal trust in economic exchange and development. As Bjørnskov (2018) outlines, there are both direct and indirect channels through which trust directly contributes to economic development. Historically, as humans began to form larger and more complex societies, with specialization and exchange occurring in larger impersonal marketplaces, it was no longer possible to rely upon tribal or personal relationships as the basis for ensuring and enforcing the agreed upon terms of exchange. Following Knack and Keefer (1997) transactions involving a time dimension or those in which monitoring is difficult, for example, are the most susceptible to trust issues and opportunistic behavior. This led to the evolution of formal and informal institutions that could help to alleviate trust problems in exchange in this ‘extended order’ (Bjørnskov, 2018; Williamson, 2000; Fukuyama 1995; North, 1990; Hayek, 1989). By reducing transactions costs, trust itself, or these substitute institutions, facilitate economic development and human progress (Bjørnskov, 2018; Cline and Williamson, 2016).====One of the institutions that can help to alleviate these trust issues in impersonal exchange, stressed by Adam Smith himself regarding the ‘invisible hand principle’, is the differing personal rewards (i.e., income) individuals earn in markets based on the degree to which they satisfy their trading partners. When the personal reward is higher from satisfying your trading partner, it helps to align the personal self-interest of individuals in exchange. Thus, income differences based on market performance can be a substitute for trust in ensuring performance in interpersonal exchange.====While socialism and collectivist production/consumption arrangements may work sufficiently well in small tribal groups, they are unable to work as well in larger societies because these systems do not contain the incentive-based rewards that help overcome trust problems that exist in impersonal exchange. Thus, income inequality based on performance in trade relationships is a key factor that ensures (or at least strongly incentivizes) the performance of market participants in exchange, and the role it plays is strongest in impersonal marketplaces in which there are lower levels of interpersonal trust. More simply put, in the absence of trust one needs to be able to provide higher compensation for better performance to incentivize it.====There are large differences in the degree of social trust across countries, and these differences are rooted in many social, cultural, economic, historical, and demographic factors. We hypothesize that the desire for greater market-based income differences (i.e., greater income inequality) should be stronger in societies with lower levels of trust. In contrast, in high-trust societies the importance of differing market-based performance rewards should not be as strong, leading to a higher preference for income equality. Previous literature has found that differing levels of trust, for example, are a determinant of preferences for redistribution and the size of the welfare state (Bjørnskov and Svendsen, 2013).====While many prior studies have attempted to examine how the actual degree of income inequality affects levels of social trust, the literature has yet to examine how actual individual ==== for their desired level of income inequality in society are related to measures of social trust.==== Thus, a critical dimension on which our research differs from prior work is that we examine individual's self-reported desires and preferences for their ideal levels of income inequality rather the degree of actual inequality that exists. In doing so we turn the causal direction of the question around, and rather than asking how the current levels of existing inequality in a society affect attitudes toward trust, we ask how individual perceptions of social trust affect their preferences for the ideal (not actual) level of income inequality.====While the effects of social trust on many measures of economic development have been examined empirically, Bjørnskov (2019, 2021) argues that the effects of trust are often conditional on other factors. Bjørnskov (2019, 2021) further argues that this conditionality in trust's effect on other variables has been mostly neglected in prior literature and needs further examination. One recent study that does examine this conditionality is Dutta et al. (2022), who examine the impact of trust on gendered attitudes. Dutta et al. (2022) find that the relationship between trust and gendered attitudes is heavily influenced by the degree of a second cultural trait—individualism. Building upon that paper, our current analysis also considers how individualism affects the relationship between trust and the desired level of income inequality.====In the literature, measures of the cultural prevalence of individualism (versus collectivism) have also been linked to improved economic development outcomes and governance, and specifically to transactional trust related issues (Davis and Williamson, 2019; Nikolaev and Salahodjaev, 2017; Nikolaev and Salahodjaev, 2016, 2017; Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2017; Kyriacou, 2016; Davis and Williamson, 2016; Licht et al., 2007; Inglehart and Oyserman, 2004). Cline and Williamson (2016), for example, specifically examine how individualism affects measures of contract enforcement, which directly relates to our hypothesis involving trust in exchange. Similarly, Lu et al. (2021) find individualism alleviates mistrust in financial institutions and reduces reliance on informal networks, as individualistic societies lead to greater outgroup interactions with strangers that help to develop trust. Thus, we think it highly likely that individualism plays an interactive role in the relationship between trust and desired income inequality.====The concept of individualism relates to self-determination, personal freedom and the awarding of social status and higher incomes to individuals with greater accomplishments such as entrepreneurial discovery and innovation (Cline and Williamson, 2016). In contrast, the opposite trait on the continuum—collectivism—focuses on social conformity rather than individual achievement. We hypothesize that the relationship between trust and desired equality/inequality should be stronger in individualistic societies than in societies that are more collectivistic.====We thus provide a contribution to the literature that tries to explain the factors that affect individual preferences for the equality/inequality of income within society (Alesina et al., 2012; Alesina and Giuliano, 2010; Alesina 2004; Alesina and Glaeser, 2004; Persson and Tabellini, 2002). While that prior literature examines the role of views and opinions about how wealth is accumulated and whether individuals are deserving of such wealth, we are the first to examine how trust and individualism shape these views.====Our results suggest that indeed, less trusting individuals (and societies) generally desire higher degrees of income inequality. This relationship is also influenced by cultural beliefs regarding individualism (versus collectivism). Specifically, the strength of the relationship is heightened in individualistic cultures. Thus, in highly individualistic cultures, with the lowest levels of social trust, individuals have the highest preferences for income inequalities to exist among members of society. This clearly supports Adam Smith's conjecture that income differentials in market-based economies are indeed an important institution that substitutes for trust in helping to foster economic exchange and development.====In Section 2 we provide more details on our theoretical motivation and main hypotheses. In Section 3 we describe our data, while in Section 4 we explain our empirical methodology. Benchmark results are presented in Section 5, and in Section 6 we demonstrate the robustness of our results. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",Trust and attitudes toward income inequality: Does individualism matter?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001549,29 November 2022,2022,Research Article,30.0
Perez-Vincent Santiago M.,"Department of Economics, Università Bocconi, Italy","Received 11 May 2022, Revised 15 September 2022, Accepted 11 November 2022, Available online 28 November 2022, Version of Record 7 June 2023.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2022.102333,Cited by (0),". The positive effects of this policy are observed in municipalities with fragmented political systems, where signature requirements lead to fewer wasted votes and fewer spoiler candidates. The downside is observed in municipalities with concentrated political systems: signature requirements increase the frequency of uncontested races and reduce voter participation. Findings reveal how this barrier to entry impacts key dimensions of democracy and indicate that designing efficient electoral institutions requires a clear understanding of local political contexts.","Competition for public office is an essential feature of democracy. The presence of alternative viable candidates allows voters to express their preferences and keeps incumbents accountable. Indeed, political competition has been associated with positive economic and policy outcomes, such as high economic growth (Besley et al., 2010) and active legislative representation (Konisky and Ueda, 2011). However, having many candidates competing for the same position may be counterproductive: it increases the complexity of voters’ choices, potentially leading to voter confusion and the misrepresentation of the majority (Shue and Luttmer, 2009, Lau et al., 2014). In current democracies, ballot access regulations limit citizens’ right to become candidates, seeking to balance this trade-off by discouraging frivolous candidates who do not have popular support and simply add noise to the electoral process.====These artificial barriers to entry separate existing democracies from the democratic ideal of “free competition for a free vote” (Schumpeter, 2013) and might harm voters by substantially limiting the supply of candidates. Their potential value, however, is supported by recent studies that document possible benefits of having few candidates, especially under the plurality rule. First, such barriers may reduce the risk of voter confusion (Shue and Luttmer, 2009) and the prevalence of ballot order and adjacency effects by which candidates (particularly marginal ones) receive votes due to a favorable position on the ballot (Ho and Imai, 2008, King and Leigh, 2009). Second, fewer candidates may reduce vote splitting, which occurs when people with similar preferences fail to coordinate, vote for different candidates, and dilute their chances of winning (Hall and Snyder, 2015, Pons and Tricaud, 2018). Pons and Tricaud (2018) show, in the context of French parliamentary and local elections, that the presence of a third candidate reduces the vote share for the top candidate closest ideologically to her, frequently affecting the outcome of the election. The participation of a third candidate “often results in an outcome that harms a majority of her supporters (...) and a majority of voters” (Pons and Tricaud, 2018 p. 1623).====A frequent institutional response to avoid an excess of candidates is requiring prospective candidates to collect a certain number of signatures to run for public office. This rule is now commonly accepted and has become the most widespread method of regulating candidacy submissions in current democracies.==== Indeed, the “Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters” (European Commission for Democracy through Law, 2002) provides recommendations on how these signature requirements should be implemented, indicating that they are theoretically compatible with the principle of universal suffrage.==== The document supports the commonly-held view that “only the most marginal parties seem to have any difficulty gathering the requisite number of signatures” (European Commission for Democracy through Law, 2002 p. 16).====However, despite its ubiquity and acceptance, there is scarce well-identified evidence on how these requirements impact electoral competition and whether and how they affect other related political outcomes. The ideal experiment to answer these questions requires to compare elections between constituencies that differ only in the presence or lack of signature requirements. In this paper, I exploit a “natural experiment” that closely resembles this ideal study. I use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the causal effects of signature requirements on Italian municipal elections, exploiting the fact that candidates in cities with less than 1000 inhabitants are exempt from this requirement (which applies to all other municipalities). I use information on more than 5000 mayoral elections in small municipalities during the period 1993–2000, when the exemption in signature requirements did not coincide with any other policy change.====The paper contributes to the literature on the impacts of both political institutions and administrative burdens by providing novel and rigorous evidence on the causal effects of signature requirements on a broad set of electoral and policy outcomes. Based on this evidence, it also provides a theoretical framework to guide the normative assessment of the effects of signature requirements and inform about features of the political context that could moderate these effects.====The quasi-experimental variation in signature requirements and the existence of abundant data on Italian municipalities makes it possible to test how this widespread ballot access regulation – and their associated costs – affect the entry decisions of potential candidates and how changes in the candidate pool driven by this barrier shape voter behavior. To this end, I examine the impact of signature requirements on the number of candidates, electoral competition, voter participation, administrative efficiency, and candidates’ personal characteristics. Finally, informed by a theoretical framework that highlights the relevance of political fragmentation in shaping the effects of barriers to entry in politics, I assess how these effects look like in municipalities with high and low levels of political fragmentation.====I find that signature requirements reduce the number of candidates by 0.21, a 10 percent drop relative to the mean observed just below the threshold. However, this reduction is not driven solely by marginal candidates and does not seem to substantially simplify voters’ choices. The frequency of elections with more than two candidates, the number of wasted votes (defined as votes to candidates other than the top two), and the presence of potential spoiler candidates (that is, third candidates obtaining more votes than the difference between the winner and the runner-up) fall only slightly with signature requirements, and changes are not statistically different from zero (at standard significance levels). Instead, signature requirements lead to a reduction in political competition.==== The frequency of unopposed races jumps from 10 to 17 percent, the average winner’s margin increases 11 percentage points (from 29 percent to 40 percent), and the number of both “effective” candidates (Laakso and Taagepera, 1979) and “non-marginal” candidates falls.==== This reduction in political competition and, particularly, the decrease in the number of non-marginal candidates exceed signature requirements’ aim of avoiding frivolous candidates and points to the first risk of these requirements: acting as a barrier to entry for serious potential candidates and thereby reducing electoral competitiveness.====I then assess whether the observed reduction in electoral competition is driven by particular types of candidates. I use information on personal characteristics of mayoral candidates to determine whether signature requirements alter the profiles of contenders and elected mayors. I find that the signature requirements reduce the proportion of young candidates and candidates without local government experience. I also construct a measure of candidates’ attractiveness (based on personal characteristics associated with winning elections) and find no significant change in this variable at the cutoff, a result that reinforces the idea that signature requirements do not discourage only frivolous or unattractive candidates.====In addition to investigating these effects on candidate entry, I assess signature requirements’ impact on voter participation, an effect that could be driven by the reduction in electoral competition (Palfrey and Rosenthal, 1983, Myatt, 2015, Feddersen and Sandroni, 2006, Coate and Conlin, 2004) or the absence of their candidates of choice (Pons and Tricaud, 2018). I find evidence consistent with these models of voting behavior: signature requirements lead to a drop in voter turnout (by 3.6 percentage points), and an increase in the number of blank and null votes. These findings point to the second risk of signature requirements and barriers to political entry: reduced voter engagement. Electoral participation is considered an essential feature of a healthy democracy, and, therefore, policies with the potential to affect it should be carefully evaluated.====Lastly, I assess whether signature requirements impact municipalities’ budget allocation (shares of investments and current expenditures in total spending) and administrative efficiency. I find that signature requirements lead to a large and significant increase in the speed of investment payments – an indicator of administrative efficiency – but have no effects on the municipalities’ budget allocation.==== Overall, the extent of the impact on policy choices and implementation (as captured in budget data) appears small relative to the observed changes in political representation and participation.====I build on the observed results on electoral competition to propose a framework that guides the normative assessment of the effects of signature requirements and provides insights on features of local contexts that could moderate them. The framework presents a simple trade-off: increasing running costs can reduce vote splitting at the expense of an increased risk of uncontested elections. In the model, there is one candidate who always runs for office and two potential contenders (each representing one of two groups with similar preferences).==== If only one contender runs, there are no wasted votes, and the majoritarian candidate wins. However, if the two contenders run, the electorate’s votes split, and the majority might be misrepresented. Likewise, if no contender runs, the only candidate wins even when she does not represent the majority. Running costs influence contenders’ entry decisions: an increase in these costs reduces the likelihood of three-candidate races (“positive” margin) but increases the chances of uncontested elections (“negative” margin). The impact of a change in the running costs on each of these two margins depends on the contenders’ winning chances and, therefore, on the relative sizes of the groups and the ability of voters to coordinate.====I try to capture these features of the local political context using a measure of political concentration and assess whether the impact of signature requirements varies with it. I use the distribution of council seats in the year 1992 (before the exemption in signature requirements was introduced) to build a measure of fragmentation of the political system for each municipality in the sample, and I estimate the regression discontinuity (RD) effect in cities of low and high fragmentation separately. The presence of more groups and no absolute majorities in councils can be associated both with the absence of clear favorites and with more dispersed preferences and lower coordination across groups. Indeed, in cities with fragmented political systems, the introduction of signature requirements has a significant impact on the “positive” margin — the number of races with more than two candidates, the number of wasted votes, and the presence of potential spoiler candidates significantly drop at the cutoff without a significant change in the number of uncontested races. In cities with concentrated political systems, the number of unopposed races more than doubles at the cutoff, and there are no significant changes on the “positive” margin. The described framework provides a clear normative assessment of these results: signature requirements reduce the potential misrepresentation of the majority in cities with fragmented political systems but increase misrepresentation in politically concentrated ones.====The differential impact of signature requirements on political competition across municipalities also helps demonstrate the drivers of voter participation. In cities with concentrated councils where signature requirements lead to a jump in the frequency of unopposed races, voter turnout drops and the number of blank and null votes increases. Contrastingly, voter participation does not significantly change in cities with dispersed political power. This finding links the two main risks of barriers to entry in politics, associating an increase in uncontested elections with a decrease in voter participation.====The results in this paper have two main implications. First, they highlight the importance and the potential costs of institutional barriers to entry: signature requirements change the observed extent of both electoral contestation and participation, two dimensions considered central to democratic functioning. Second, they stress the relevance of the interaction between institutional and political factors in shaping politicians’ and voters’ behavior, pointing to the need of understanding local political contexts to design efficient institutions.====This paper contributes to several strands of literature. First, it adds to the study of the impact of administrative burdens on the access to public services and the exercise of citizens’ fundamental rights (Herd and Moynihan, 2019). This literature has shown how frictions in applications’ rules and processes have significant effects on people’s lives, affecting, for example, the choice and access to college education (Bettinger et al., 2012), the take-up of tax benefits (Bhargava and Manoli, 2015), and the choice of health plans (Kling et al., 2012). This paper extends these insights to the context of political candidacies, providing strong evidence in support of two of the main tenets of this literature: administrative burdens are consequential and have distributive effects, as they affect some groups more than others (Herd and Moynihan, 2019).====Second, this paper relates to the set of articles examining barriers to entry in politics. The existing literature has focused mainly on legislative elections in the United States where most restrictions apply only to independent candidates, and it has relied on selection-on-observables assumptions (Ansolabehere and Gerber, 1996, Stratmann, 2005) or on difference in differences (Drometer and Rincke, 2009, Kapoor and Magesan, 2018). The evidence in these papers associates stricter requirements with fewer candidates, especially independent or from minor parties. This paper contributes to this literature by providing causal evidence of this relationship using a novel identification strategy.==== By doing so, it provides evidence on the empirical validity of one of the most fundamental results of citizen-candidate models (Osborne and Slivinski, 1996, Besley and Coate, 1997): that running costs reduce the equilibrium number of (non-marginal) candidates. The evidence presented also emphasizes the importance of political contexts in moderating the effects of these requirements.====Thirdly, it contributes to the analysis of the institutional and political factors affecting voter participation. Most of the earlier work on this topic used cross-country comparisons to examine the role of compulsory voting, electoral systems (proportional vs. majority) and voter registration requirements in determining voter participation (Blais, 2006, Cancela and Geys, 2016). In recent years, new studies have begun to complement these analyses by exploiting quasi-experimental variation in the institutional framework across sub-national units and have found, for example, significant effects of compulsory voting (Hoffman et al., 2017), proportional representation (Eggers, 2015) or concurrent elections (Cantoni et al., 2021) on voter participation. This study adds to this latter literature and presents evidence on the impact of barriers to entry for candidates on voter participation. It also provides evidence on the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship (i.e. electoral competition and number of candidates) and the political factors that moderate it (political fragmentation). Since signature requirements are unlikely to have a direct impact on voter participation, the results of this study provide suggestive evidence of a causal link between the supply of political candidates and voter participation, a relationship that has been difficult to verify in the literature due to the pervasiveness of potential reverse causality and omitted variable biases.====Finally, in terms of methodology, this paper ties into a developing strand of literature that uses RD designs based on population thresholds to assess the impacts of various policies on political and economic outcomes. Regarding Italian municipalities, recent articles have examined the effects of politicians’ remuneration (Gagliarducci and Nannicini, 2013), electoral rules (Bordignon et al., 2016), fiscal rules (Grembi et al., 2016), term limits (De Benedetto and De Paola, 2019) and gender quotas (Spaziani, 2022).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes Italian municipalities’ institutional setting. Section 3 presents the data sources and the empirical strategy. Section 4 describes the main hypotheses and empirical results. Section 5 presents a theoretical framework describing the possible effects of signature requirements on the misrepresentation of the majority, and Section 6 assesses its empirical validity. Section 7 presents conclusions.",A few signatures matter: Barriers to entry in Italian local politics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001367,28 November 2022,2022,Research Article,31.0

Information about immigration has a positive impact on desired ==== among low-income respondents and a negative one among higher income earners. Information about ==== has no impact. On the provision side, middle- and high-income respondents increase desired public education expenditure in response to poverty, while low-income respondents reduce desired education spending in response to immigration. These heterogeneities are consistent with protectionist reactions to immigration and poverty.","Immigration has played a central role in the political debate and in nearly every electoral competition taking place in Europe and North America over the past decade, overtaking inequality, poverty and redistribution as a major topic in the political discussion.==== Many political races culminated in the rise of extremist and populist parties focusing their campaigns around immigration, while political actors promoting redistribution and social welfare expenditures were pushed to the margins, often by those segments of the population whom such policies would benefit most (see, for instance, Lamble (2018) and Ember (2019) for the United Kingdom and United States respectively).====These electoral successes might be explained by the economic and socio-cultural significance of immigration in the eyes of the electorate and its importance relative to other political topics (Hatton, 2017, Coester, 2018, Naumann and Stoetzer, 2018). Erosion of popular support for the welfare state might thus have been brought about by increases in social diversity, its economic consequences, and cultural conflicts (Gilens, 1995, Lee and Roemer, 2006, Roemer et al., 2007, Eger, 2010, Larsen, 2011, Cappelen and Midtbø, 2016, Bisin and Zanella, 2017).====Despite their recent political misfortune, however, redistribution, income support and poverty relief remain central to the contemporary socio-economic and demographic challenges faced by Western social welfare systems, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak and by the disproportionate impact on poor households of the ensuing economic crisis (Stantcheva, 2021). Poverty and redistribution have thus made their return as prominent debate topics in the political discourse. Crucially, so will they remain especially and precisely in connection with the contemporary migratory fluxes which, save for the Covid-19 “intermezzo”, paced up dramatically over the past decade (see, e.g., Hatton, 2016): First because immigrants are often perceived as threatening the livelihoods of vulnerable (e.g. low-skilled) native labour force groups, and simultaneously because migrants are often regarded as vulnerable groups requiring welfare support themselves.====Our first aim in this paper is therefore that of investigating how providing information and thus increasing people’s awareness about immigration and poverty, two important and recurring themes in the public debate, affects their demand for redistributive policies. Concretely, we run a survey experiment on a representative sample of the German population in which we randomise whether the respondents receive no information (our baseline), information on the extent of immigration (Immigration condition) or the extent of poverty (Poverty condition). Subsequently, the respondents proceed to answer a block of questions eliciting their demand for redistribution. To gain a better insight into how poverty and immigration interact in respondents’ minds to shape their redistributive preferences, we complete the design by adding two further interventions. The first provides respondents with information about the extent of both immigration and poverty (Both condition), the second adds information about the extent to which the immigrant and the poor populations overlap (Overlap condition).====Our second aim is that of distinguishing between and investigating, simultaneously but separately, the two components of ‘demand for redistribution’. We thus explore how raising awareness about immigration and/or poverty affects demand for (i) the financing and for (ii) the provision of redistributive policies. The first component pertains to how individuals wish to shape the income tax schedule, in terms of its progressivity, to raise public revenue to finance redistributive expenditure. The second pertains instead to their preferred allocation of the public budget over redistributive policies. The separate analysis of these two components allows us to better capture individuals’ nuanced preferences over an inherently complex public intervention like redistribution. The distinction between the financing and provision of redistributive policies has been recently found to be consequential in the investigation of individuals’ preferences (Cavaillé and Trump, 2015, An and Ye, 2017).====Our investigation targets the effect of exposure to experimentally comparable information about immigration and about poverty on individuals’ demand for redistribution. Since (as explained in Section 4) we expected our experimental conditions to work mainly via the “priming” channel, our design allows us to analyse the effect of “thinking about” immigration and poverty on people’s attitudes. In a political debate in which both immigration and poverty play a role, how does raising awareness about these topics impact individuals’ support for redistribution? Are the effects of the two issues similar in sign and magnitude? Crucially, previous research highlights how demand for redistribution is inherently heterogeneous across income classes, and it is reasonable to expect individuals differently positioned in the income distribution to react differently to changes in the economic environment (Sands, 2017, Alesina et al., 2018a, Naumann et al., 2018, Naumann and Stoetzer, 2018, Bussolo et al., 2021). Thus we also ask: How does the impact of information about immigration and about poverty vary along the income gradient?====Previous research proposes two opposing mechanisms for how thinking about immigration might affect individuals’ demand for redistributive policies. According to the so-called ====, if they predominantly associate immigration with reduced social cohesion due to ethnic diversity, this would cause natives to withdraw their support for redistribution and income support programs (supposedly) benefiting groups perceived as socially distant (Luttmer, 2001, Alesina et al., 2004). This argument is in accordance with the rise of anti-immigration platforms and parties mentioned in the opening of this article.====The ==== instead distinguishes individuals as net beneficiaries or contributors to the welfare state (e.g. Magni-Berton, 2014, Naumann and Stoetzer, 2018). As (low-skilled) immigration is expected (or perceived) to depress wages and threaten job security in high-immigration sectors (Borjas, 2003), unskilled and low-income earners should increase their demand for redistribution if thinking about immigration reminds them of migration inflows perceived as threatening their job security (Facchini and Mayda, 2009, Iturbe-Ormaetxe and Romero, 2016).==== High-skilled individuals with high incomes – net contributors to the welfare system – are expected instead to withdraw their support, as they are reminded that their share of the welfare burden is high in the presence of (low-skilled) immigration.====Similar to immigration, thinking about poverty might have two opposite impacts on demand for redistribution according to the placement of the individual in the income distribution (Bussolo et al., 2021, Sands and de Kadt, 2020).==== It might first of all remind poor individuals of their status as net beneficiaries of the welfare state, thus pushing them to increase their demand for public expenditure on redistributive policies and for progressive income taxation to finance them (findings consistent with this reading are for instance in Sands and de Kadt, 2020, Iturbe-Ormaetxe and Romero, 2016, Andreoli and Olivera, 2020). Second, it might remind the richer net contributors to the welfare state of the expenses they bear to finance social safety nets benefiting other social segments. This is the case for instance in Sands (2017), where the richest strata of the population are found to withdraw their support for redistribution once experimentally primed with poverty.==== We therefore investigate how the reactions elicited by information about immigration and poverty compare in terms of demand for redistribution once jointly investigated in a unified framework enabling their direct comparison within different portions of the income distribution.====We follow a burgeoning stream of literature using survey experiments to investigate the causal link between socio-economic phenomena of interest on self-reported preferences for redistributive interventions (Kuziemko et al., 2015, Karadja et al., 2017, Barrera Rodriguez et al., 2017, Alesina et al., 2018a, Barton and Pan, 2021). Different from traditional survey-based investigations (Senik et al., 2009, Alesina et al., 2018b), this approach allows us to rely on systematic differences in the responses to target questions induced by exogenous variation in the emphasis placed on specific elements of interest across the sample. That is, by randomly distributing information about poverty and immigration our survey experiment can be taken to randomise the salience given to poverty and immigration by electoral and media debates. Systematic relationships observed between the experimental conditions in the answers to target survey questions can therefore be interpreted as causal effects of the information provided on demand for redistribution.====We find that information about immigration has a sizeable effect on desired tax progressivity and redistributive public expenditure, with opposite signs for high income and low income individuals: High income earners desire ==== tax progressivity, offset by poor individuals requesting ==== progressive taxation. On the provision side, low income respondents want ==== public spending on public education in the presence of information about immigration. Information about poverty has no detectable impact on desired tax progressivity, but ==== high income respondents’ desired education spending.====Taken together, these results first of all offer evidence for protectionist attitudes affecting demand for redistribution, in particular on the financing side, i.e. desired tax progressivity. Similar mechanisms seem however to be at play on the provision side as well. Poor people’s lower demand for education expenditure once confronted with information about immigration might reflect the fear that public education would disproportionally benefit immigrants (and their children), thus increasing competition for themselves on the labour market. Conversely, and consistent with the discussion in Bussolo et al. (2021), richer people’s increase in desired education spending might result from a belief that education is a relatively painless way to deal with poverty and inequality, accompanied by an expectation that it is likely to, on average, also benefit themselves or their children.

This paper uses a survey experiment to assess whether providing citizens with expert information about the health risk of COVID-19 and the economic costs of lockdown measures affects their attitudes towards these policies. Our findings show that providing respondents with information about COVID-19 fatalities among the elderly raises support for lockdown measures, while information about their economic costs decreases support. However, different population subgroups react differently. Men and younger respondents react more sensitively to information about lockdown costs, while women and older respondents are more susceptible towards information regarding fatality rates. Strikingly, our results are entirely driven by respondents who underestimate the fatality of COVID-19, who represent a majority.","To contain the spread of the coronavirus, governments worldwide took measures that severely curtail economic and social life. These include contact restrictions, curfews, as well as the temporary closure of certain businesses. Arguably, the success of these policies critically depends on support from the public. A lack of support may not only reduce compliance with the containment measures, but also the governments’ ability to uphold them. In the debate about policy responses to the crisis, information provided by experts, in particular scientists, is widely seen to play an important role in shaping attitudes of the population.====This paper investigates whether information provision really affects what citizens think about key aspects of the crisis management and how reactions differ across different groups. We study whether providing people with information about (i) the fatality rates of COVID-19 (i.e., the share of persons with a positive Corona test who died) and (ii) the economic costs associated with the containment measures, causally affects their attitudes towards these measures. To this end, we designed a survey including an information experiment.====The survey was conducted in Germany in June 2020 and it comprises roughly 30,000 representatively selected German citizens. For the information experiment, the interviewees were randomly assigned to eight different groups and each group was ‘treated’ with different information. The information we provided encompassed potential economic costs caused by the containment measures, as well as the fatality rates among all infected persons and among those younger or older than 70 years. After receiving the information, respondents were asked what they think about the containment measures implemented in March, as well as the relaxation of these measures in May.====Our findings suggest that respondents’ attitudes towards the containment measures are significantly affected by information about the fatality of the coronavirus among the elderly. Respondents were informed that during the first months of the pandemic, an average of 210 out of 1000 persons older than 70 years registered as being infected with the coronavirus died. Respondents receiving this information tend to show greater support for stricter lockdown measures and greater opposition against relaxing these measures. In contrast, we do not find significant average ==== for treatments involving information about the coronavirus’ fatality in the entire population or among persons younger than 70 years.====Closer inspection suggests that this is linked to respondents’ prior beliefs about the fatality of COVID-19. Most respondents underestimate the fatality rate among the elderly. The median respondent believes that only seven persons older than 70 years die from COVID-19, while the actual number is 210. While the share of respondents underestimating the fatality rate in the entire population as well as among persons younger than 70 years is also large (88 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively), discrepancies between believed and actual fatality rates are smaller on average. If we restrict our analysis to respondents who underestimate the corresponding fatality rate and estimate treatment effects for the treated, we also find significant effects for the treatments involving information about the coronavirus’ fatality in the entire population and among persons younger than 70 years, albeit of smaller magnitude. Arguably, this is because the corresponding fatality rates are notably smaller. In the entire population, 46 out of 1000 persons registered as infected died, whereas the number of deaths per 1000 infected persons among persons younger than 70 years was eight. What is more, providing respondents with information about the economic costs associated with containment measures weakens their support for them.====While the average reactions among the population to the information treatment are intuitive, different population subgroups respond very differently and sometimes quite surprisingly. Firstly, we find that respondents who economically suffered from the Corona crisis are less responsive to information about the fatality of the coronavirus, but more responsive to information about the economic costs. The same is true for respondents who are younger than 70 years as well as male respondents. In other words, respondents scarcely affected (economically) by the Corona crisis, older respondents, and female respondents are more susceptible to information about fatality rate among the elderly but react less sensitively to information about economic repercussions ensuing from the Corona pandemic. Finally, we find that East German citizens show no significant reaction to any of the information we provided.====Our analysis offers insights into the way in which the population reacts to information provided by experts about the pandemic and policy measures taken to fight it. This is important because the extent to which policymakers can react to new empirical evidence in a rational way depends on how the population is willing to react to this evidence. The paper shows that the reaction of the population differs across groups and individuals. There is a systematic correlation between the way people react and their socioeconomic characteristics as well as the way in which they are affected by the pandemic. Through these results our paper contributes to understanding how evidence based policy making may find political support in the population.====Our findings contribute to a steadily growing literature on the Corona pandemic, containment policies, and the determinants of compliance behavior. Recent research highlights several factors influencing compliance with social distancing and other policy measures implemented to contain the spread of the coronavirus.==== These include socio-demographic characteristics (====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====); differences in risk perception (====, ====, ====); political affiliation and partisanship (====, ====, ====, ====, ====); social capital and trust (====, ====, ====, ====, ====); as well as trust in science (====) and the media (====, ====).====Most relevant to our paper are studies exploring how information affects behavior and attitudes towards containment measures using survey experiments.==== For instance, ==== investigate how the perception of risk affects individual behavior during the crisis, and whether correcting biased perceptions could help from a public health perspective. Conducting a series of online experiments in the U.S., the authors document that people overestimate their own COVID-19 mortality risk as well as that of young people but underestimate the mortality risk of older people. Correcting people’s risk perception by informing them about actual risk has no effect on donations for disease control and leads to a decrease in the amount of time invested in learning how to protect others from the virus. However, these negative effects could be counteracted by providing additional information on older people’s risk of mortality.==== analyze how beliefs about the infectiousness of the coronavirus affects social distancing behavior. They conduct an online experiment in the U.S. and the U.K., where randomly selected treatment groups are shown either upper or lower bound expert estimates of the virus’ infectiousness. They find that, on average, people overestimate the infectiousness and that providing people with expert information rectifies their beliefs to some extent. Moreover, ==== show that the more infectious people believe the virus to be, the less willing they are to adopt social distancing measures. The authors explain this finding with fatalism: If individuals believe they are highly likely to be infected by the virus irrespective of their own behavior, they may ignore social distancing and other containment policies.====Other survey experiments on compliance behavior show that the willingness to comply with self-isolation measures depends on how long citizens expect the measures to last in comparison to the official end date announced by the government (====), and that providing information about the safety, effectiveness, and availability of COVID-19 vaccines reduces people’s voluntary social distancing, adherence to hygiene guidelines, as well as their willingness to stay at home (====).

We analyze how the trade war impacted the 2020 US Presidential election. Our results highlight the political salience of the trade war: US trade war tariffs boosted Trump’s support but foreign retaliation hurt Trump. In particular, the pro-Trump effects of US trade war tariffs were crucial for Trump crossing the recount thresholds in Georgia and Wisconsin. Even more important politically, voters abandoned Trump in counties with large expansions of ","The trade war defined a key part of the Trump administration’s economic policy agenda. It began as a temporary and small amount of WTO-allowed tariffs in early 2018 on imports of solar panels and washing machines. But spring 2018 soon brought Trump’s much larger-scale tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in the name of protecting US national security. His even larger-scale tariffs on China then began in summer 2018 in the name of protecting US intellectual property rights against the alleged “forced technology transfer” practices faced by US firms in China. By September 2019 the US was hitting about two-thirds of Chinese imports with an average tariff of roughly seven-fold that imposed by the US on the rest of the world. Naturally, US manufacturing producers and farmers soon faced retaliatory tariffs when exporting to each of the US major trading partners including Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union. Ultimately, the Trump administration’s trade war is the largest since the trade war triggered by the US Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1930s and was still raging when Trump left office in January 2021.====When leaving office in January 2021, the Trump administration listed trade policy fourth on their list of achievements behind only the economy, tax reform, and deregulation.==== Thus, unsurprisingly, an extensive literature has already studied the economic effects of the trade war on higher US consumer prices (Amiti et al., 2019, Fajgelbaum et al., 2020, Cavallo et al., 2021), lower consumption and employment (Waugh, 2019, Flaaen and Pierce, 2020), and lower US exports via higher input tariffs (Handley et al., 2020).==== And, media commentary openly discussed the political implications of the trade war for Republicans and the Trump administration leading into the 2018 US midterm elections (Merica, 2018) and the broader role of the trade war in explaining the Democrat’s sweeping victory in those elections (Bryan, 2018). Reflecting these various economic effects, Blanchard et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2020) confirm the political salience of the trade war in the 2018 US midterm elections.====Naturally, various issues other than the trade war may have impacted the 2020 US Presidential election. Perhaps none more so than the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump administration’s handling of it. Indeed, according to the ====, “[T]the president finally lost, aides and allies said, because of how he mismanaged the virus” (Dawsey et al., 2020). But other very important issues also helped define Trump’s term in office. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans after its implementation in 2014. However, Republicans continued to pursue executive, congressional, and judicial avenues to repeal and undermine the ACA. These avenues arguably included the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the final days of Trump’s term given the line of questioning during her confirmation hearings and upcoming cases on the Supreme Court’s docket (e.g. Calamur, 2020). Indeed, media commentary (e.g. Lowrey, 2018, Scott, 2018) and academic studies (Blanchard et al., 2019) have documented the importance of the ACA in understanding the 2018 US midterm election results. Following immigration surges at the southern US border and high-profile police-involved deaths of African–Americans, the Trump administration’s stance on race (e.g. Edsall, 2020) and immigration issues (e.g. Narea, 2020) were also much-discussed leading into the 2020 Presidential election.====The main question we ask in this paper is how the trade war impacted the 2020 US Presidential election. To do so, we analyze the county-level impacts of the trade war – US tariffs, foreign retaliatory tariffs, and US agricultural subsidies – on the change in Trump’s vote share between the 2016 and 2020 US Presidential elections. Typical in the trade literature, we combine industry-level trade war tariffs (and agricultural subsidies) with county-by-industry employment composition to create county-level trade war exposure. We control for a large set of county-level characteristics (and state-level unobservables) along demographic, socioeconomic, economic and political dimensions that could correlate with the salient issues discussed above.==== To address remaining endogeneity concerns, we use the heteroskedasticity-based IV approach of Lewbel (2012) to instrument for our trade war variables. While less intuitive than a traditional IV approach, our Lewbel IV approach works well according to standard IV specification tests.====Our results highlight the political salience of the trade war for the 2020 US Presidential election. We find robust evidence of a pro-Trump effect of US trade war tariffs: voters rewarded Trump for protecting their local economy. And, we find robust evidence of an anti-Trump effect of foreign retaliatory tariffs: voters penalized Trump when their local economy faced reduced access to foreign markets. In contrast, we do not find robust evidence for an effect of agricultural subsidies. Given the states that ultimately decided the Presidential election were not the agricultural heartland of the US that bore the brunt of foreign retaliation, only the US trade war tariffs had a meaningful impact on the election results. Trump’s margin of defeat in Georgia and Wisconsin was below the thresholds enshrined in each state’s law, 0.5 and 1 percentage point respectively, for a recount of votes.==== Our results imply the absence of US tariffs would have pushed Trump’s margin of defeat in Georgia and Wisconsin out of recount territory. Thus, US tariffs would have been decisive in a slightly tighter election.====In controlling for the county-level political salience of non-trade war issues, we find a robust and crucial role for health insurance coverage expansion in explaining Trump’s loss. Closely following Blanchard et al. (2019), we use US Census data to obtain the increased share of the population with health insurance coverage in the 5-year period after ACA implementation. Interpreting this as proxying for the magnitude of voter anxiety over the ACA’s fragile judicial and legislative existence, our results imply Trump would have won Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada in the absence of undermining the ACA. And, he would have only lost Wisconsin by a few thousand votes. This would have put him on the precipice of re-election, only needing one more state (e.g. Wisconsin) for re-election.====Motivated by the recent work of Autor et al. (2020) and Che et al. (2022), we investigate whether the mechanism driving the effect of trade war tariffs and health insurance coverage expansion on voting behavior centered around political polarization or the impacts on local economies.==== We find no evidence that these issues simultaneously made solidly “red” Republican counties (or those Trump won in 2016 or have a majority white population) even “redder” and made solidly “blue” Democrat counties (or those Hillary Clinton won in 2016 or have a majority population of minorities) even “bluer”. Indeed, the strongest pro-Trump effects of US tariffs are in solidly Democrat counties and counties that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Ultimately, our results are more consistent with a mechanism of economic incentives rather than political polarization driving voter behavior towards Trump over the trade war tariffs and health insurance coverage expansion.====Our use of an IV approach is motivated by the trade policy literature clearly recognizing that politicians may endogenously choose tariffs based on various economic, social, and political factors (recent examples include Ma and McLaren, 2018, Fajgelbaum et al., 2020 and Fetzer and Schwarz, 2021). An econometric endogeneity problem arises if we omit demographic, socioeconomic, economic, and political characteristics that both (i) drive the change in voting behavior towards Trump between 2016 and 2020 and (ii) correlate with how the political tariff formation process maps to county-level exposure or correlate with how the ACA differentially expanded health insurance coverage across counties. However, our host of control variables and fixed effects leaves the IV point estimates for the trade war tariffs only modestly smaller than the OLS point estimates. In turn, formal tests of endogeneity cannot reject the null hypothesis that the trade war tariffs are actually exogenous.====Our paper makes various contributions to the literature. First, ours is the first paper we know that analyzes the political salience of the trade war for the 2020 US Presidential election. In doing so, we show its political salience in this election and how its political salience can differ between Congressional midterm elections and Presidential elections. Both Blanchard et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2020) show the political salience of the trade war for the 2018 US Congressional midterm elections. While Blanchard et al. (2019) do not find statistically or economically significant effects of US tariffs, we find statistically and economically significant effects of these tariffs: US tariffs are an important reason why Trump earned recounts in Georgia and Wisconsin in 2020. However, while Blanchard et al. (2019) find that foreign retaliatory tariffs accounted for one-quarter of the Democrats 18 seat House majority, we show the counties penalizing Trump in the Presidential election for foreign retaliation were mostly in solidly Republican states. Thus, political salience of the trade war can depend on the different voting boundaries that define Congressional versus Presidential elections.====Second, our analysis contributes to the literature discussing whether trade is a salient electoral issue. Indeed, the electoral salience of trade has been questioned in the literature. Numerous papers suggest very low salience (e.g. Guisinger, 2009, Blonigen, 2011 and Cobb and Nance, 2011). However, our paper is especially well suited to address this issue by analyzing the US Presidential election at the height of the largest trade war in at least nearly 100 years and one that was initiated by the incumbent president. In doing so, our paper provides important additional support to the rapidly growing strand of the literature emphasizing the electoral salience of trade (e.g. Margalit, 2011, Conconi et al., 2014, Lake and Millimet, 2016, Jensen et al., 2017, Colantone and Stanig, 2018, Blanchard et al., 2019, Nguyen, 2019, Autor et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020 and Che et al., 2022).====Third, unlike Blanchard et al. (2019) and Li et al. (2020), we present evidence on the mechanism behind the political salience of the trade war tariffs. In particular, despite the polarizing nature of Trump, our analysis suggests voter behavior towards Trump in the 2020 US Presidential election reflected the economic effect of his policies on voters rather than his policies driving political polarization. Indeed, past literature argues US trade policy reflects the resulting economic effects faced by voters.==== Che et al. (2022) argue the pro-Democrat effect of rising Chinese import competition in the 2000s reflected that Democrats typically voted against pro-trade congressional bills. Conconi et al. (2014) show that US politicians facing re-election risk are much more likely to vote against pro-trade congressional bills. When voting on Free Trade Agreements, Lake and Millimet (2016) show that US politicians facing re-election risk or representing constituents facing a lot of impending import competition are much more sensitive to the amount of Trade Adjustment Assistance their constituents receive.==== In contrast to these papers, Autor et al. (2020) argue that rising Chinese import competition led to political polarization by hollowing out the political center and by simultaneously pushing majority-white areas towards Republicans and majority–minority areas towards Democrats. Nevertheless, our results show voter behavior regarding the trade war crossed political and racial lines in the 2020 US Presidential election.====Fourth, our IV approach offers an alternative IV strategy (the Lewbel heteroskedasticity-based IV approach) for the literature dealing with endogenous trade policy and shows that the US trade war tariffs are quite plausibly exogenous. Recent empirical trade war papers discuss concerns about trade war tariffs reflecting a political calculus and creating econometric endogeneity issues. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) document that 2018 US trade war tariffs protected swing counties. Fajgelbaum et al. (2020) and Fetzer and Schwarz (2021) show 2018 foreign retaliatory tariffs targeted Republican counties and counties that swung to Trump in 2016. Earlier theoretical work, e.g. Ma and McLaren (2018), rationalizes how politicians target swing states. However, our Lewbel (2012) heteroskedasticity-based IV approach works well according to standard IV specification tests and produces very similar IV and OLS point estimates for the trade war tariffs. Thus, we cannot reject the null that the trade war tariffs are actually exogenous given our set of fixed effects as well as demographic, socioeconomic, economic, and political controls.==== Especially given the important efficiency cost of the IV estimator over the OLS estimator (Wooldridge, 2003 p.490), our analysis suggests trade policy can be plausibly exogenous with an appropriate set of fixed effects and controls.====Fifth, our results highlight the crucial salience of health insurance coverage as an issue underlying Trump’s loss. Blanchard et al. (2019) find the health insurance coverage expansion issue accounted for half of the Democrat’s 18 seat House majority following their sweeping 2018 US midterm election wins. However, our results say it essentially cost Trump the 2020 Presidential election which we would argue is an order of magnitude larger in terms of economic significance.====Our paper proceeds as follows.

Such policy change can take two forms: adjusting the accrual rate (the rate at which individuals built-up pension entitlements while working) or the ,"Many public pension schemes around the world involve Pay-As-You-Go (hereafter, PAYG) schemes. These are sustainable if the contributions from the workers cover the pension benefits of the retirees. For PAYG schemes to avoid running a structural deficit, it has to ensure that the revenue flowing into the scheme from current contributors covers the expenditure required for the payment of benefits to current retirees. The current retirement of the baby boom generations increases the ratio of current beneficiaries to current contributors, making PAYG scheme unsustainable. European countries have to undertake ambitious reforms and these should not only look at sustainability, but also at intergenerational fairness (European Commission, 2021). Our objective in this paper is to study in a transparent way the prospective consequences of pension reforms in terms of pension loss. Our goal is not only to analyze it for current retirees or near-retirees cohort, but for all generations alive at the time of the reform. By doing so, we avoid the mistake that consists of ignoring the pension burden adjustment to future generations.====The literature on reforming PAYG pension comprises several strands. A first strand examines the radical choice of switching from PAYG scheme (unfunded) to funded pension schemes (Kotlikoff and Burns, 2004). The drawback of this option is the high cost borne by the transitional generations who have to finance the two schemes at the same time (Miles, 1998). The second strand of the literature considers that there are three possible options to gradually assure the sustainability of PAYG schemes: adapting the contribution rate, changing the pension benefit or adjusting the retirement age. That literature often puts the focus on the choice (and the optimal mix) of those three options, without carefully analyzing the age and cohort specific consequences of those pension policies. In this paper, we follow the micro simulation approach to compare different benefit adjustments (Blanchet et al., 2016). Benefit adjustment can be cohort-specific (a cohort with longer remaining life receives lower benefits than a cohort with shorter remaining life), or time-specific (changing indexing rule by simply reducing benefits over time relative to average earnings). A key difference between these two alternatives for adjusting benefit is that the cohort specific rule only applies the adjustment to the newly retiring cohort, whereas the time specific rule reduces initial benefits for the newly retiring as well as for the already retired. So, phasing in benefit cuts over time has larger base and thus benefit cut can be smaller per capita. Different cohorts will have different preferences over the cohort specific reform and the time specific reform.==== A third strand of the literature, to which this paper also relates, considers the problem of heterogeneity. Bi and Zubairy (2022) shows that the heterogeneity in the phase-in period is important for making pension reform. They show that near-retirees individual could decide to retire sooner depending on the phase-in design.====The focus of our paper is on the intergenerational lifespan inequality of different pension reforms aimed at securing financial sustainability. In doing so we will concentrate on alternatives gradual benefit adjustments via a reduction of the accrual or indexation rate, assuming a fixed contribution rate. The main reason for not considering the possibility to raise contributions is their well-documented harmful consequences on long-run employment, growth and welfare (e.g. Kotlikoff et al., 2007, Kitao, 2014). Another focus of our paper is the political support for the different pension reforms. Most pension systems rely on a contract between different generations, and such intergenerational agreements cannot be dissolved. The path dependence is structural. The past pension rights and promises already accumulated from entitlements put a stop to the more radical proposals. So we will concentrate on gradual reforms and we will impose the grandfather clause (no retrospective reform) so that reform can only affect future pension rights. Interestingly the political support for any reform is itself influenced by the aging process. Reforms that increase retirement age can be politically accepted when few people are near retirement age but impossible with a growing size of the cohorts close to retirement (Bütler, 2000, Bello and Galasso, 2020). Retirement age reforms are more tricky to assess because their effect on labor force participation is ambiguous. Li (2018) showed that increasing the normal retirement age causes a decrease of payroll tax revenue and an increase of disability insurance expenses offsetting about 40% of the decrease of pension expenses. In this paper we will not consider reforms that increase retirement age. Cremer and Pestieau (2000) argue that the pension reform is shaped by conflicting political forces. The retirees are willing to shift the cost on the workers but they need those workers to pay their pensions (Breyer and Stolte, 2001). With demographic change the median voter is ageing and the old people gets politically more powerful (Sinn and Uebelmesser, 2003). There is empirical evidence that countries have not treated cohorts equitably with their grandfathering approach in their pension reforms, namely reducing the entitlement for younger generations while sparing those near retirement (Börsch-Supan, 2013, Fouejieu et al., 2021). One particular exception is Sweden, which was able to implement its reform because, at that time, they were more winners than losers from it (Selén and Ståhlberg, 2007).====In this paper, we compare the prospective consequences for all generations alive at the time of the reform adjusting gradually pension benefits. To assess the generational balance of the different reforms, we will have to adopt a normative criterion of generational fairness. We will consider the inequality across cohorts of the pension loss (relative to no reform) when gradually adjusting the pension benefit to balance government budget in the long run (finite horizon).==== To adjust the pension benefit, two parameters are available: the accrual and the indexation rates. Those are key parameters in most pension systems (either defined benefit, point system or notional defined contribution). The accrual rate is the rate at which someone builds up his rights to pension benefits, while the indexation rate guarantees that accrued benefits (during both the work and retirement years) stay in line with wage growth in the economy. Those pension parameters are widely used around the world.==== Various papers analyze the budgetary consequences of indexing relative to wages or to prices (Blanchet et al., 2016) and the pre and post retirement indexation (Piggott et al., 2009, Whitehouse, 2009). Indexing partially erodes pension over time and can put older retirees at risk of poverty (Hohnerlein, 2019). We contribute to this literature by analyzing the heterogeneity of the impact on the different cohorts alive at the time of the reform. The closest paper to ours is Auerbach and Lee (2011), which analyzes the heterogeneity of the impact of pension reforms on different cohorts. However, their framework is different from us. They base their analysis on the whole lifetime of individuals (both retrospectively and prospectively) and do not study the political acceptability of the reforms. On the contrary, considering that pension reforms are generally not retroactive (grandfathering clause) we study the prospective effects of the reforms over the remaining lifetime of the generations currently alive. If we would like to study the effect of the reform over the entire lifespan we should limit our analysis to the cohorts not yet born, which is at odds with our objective to compare the political support for various reforms (Auerbach et al., 1994, Kotlikoff, 2003).==== In a nutshell, the pension reform affects pension benefits, and so computing the expected changes of pension benefits to balance the inter-temporal budget is an effective way of measuring the reform’s effect for different generations. Since welfare analysis of pension reforms consequences on different cohorts with unequal remaining lifetimes is problematic (see Bommier et al., 2011), we limit our analysis to an actuarial (non welfare) evaluation. The reform is evaluated on a single dimension which is cohort-age. In doing so, we ignore within cohort heterogeneity in terms of income and needs. Extending the model in that direction would require additional within cohort distribution analysis of pension reforms but this would no change our main findings on the distributive analysis between cohorts. Lastly, we consider the employment response to the pension reforms.==== The assumption is that the reform will reduce employment of different cohort proportionally to their pension loss and the employment elasticity. Given this assumption we calculate the expected reduction of pension benefits needed to balance the inter-temporal budget in the presence of employment response and compare the accrual and the indexation reforms. The indexation reform provides efficiency gain (relative to the accrual reform) because it has a larger base and the pension loss is partly supported by those already retired. Nevertheless we show that a majority still prefers the accrual reform.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 illustrates the issues with a simple example. Section 4 describes the economic and demographic data used in our simulations of various pension reforms. We provide the prospective evaluation of accrual and indexation reforms in Section 5.

In Parliaments, legislators care about their reputation with several principals, namely their constituents and Party leaders. It is thus unclear in which direction votes will move when they become observable, and moreover legislators may prefer to opt out of voting entirely in order to avoid conflict. This paper first uses French voting data to show that reputational concerns drive the decision to participate in a vote: in order to avoid blame legislators are less likely to vote when there is disagreement between the constituents and the Party. Second, making legislators’ votes public increases their incentive to use voting for reputation-building, and, therefore, the distortion in group decision-making. The French transparency reform of 2014 provides a quasi-natural setting for a Difference-in-Differences analysis. Greater transparency led to less participation, as legislators preferred not to take sides.","The political economy literature often depicts legislators as agents representing the interests of one principal, most often their electorate. But legislators face an additional constraint: their political Parties also want to sway policy making. The legislators should, therefore, satisfy several principals. This paper first verifies that disagreement between the different principals leads to strategic non-voting in Parliament. Second, it shows that the more the principals have monitoring power, the more the legislators have incentives to behave strategically.====The principals’ monitoring power depends on how transparent is the agent’s behavior. Greater transparency comes from rendering the decisions made by legislators public and more traceable. Increasing transparency is a common phenomenon as the digital age has made it easier to systematically and automatically publish information. Previous theoretical work highlights that, when their behavior comes under scrutiny, decision-makers tend to comply more with the interests of the represented group.==== That is, greater transparency increases the monitoring power of the principal over the agent. However, there is suggestive evidence that Members of Parliament (MPs) represent not only their constituents but also the Party to which they are affiliated. These two groups will hold opposing positions on some issues, so MPs cannot align with both. Casting any vote will then potentially harm their relationship with one of the groups, and it is not obvious in which direction votes will move when they become observable. Two contributions have estimated the effect of transparency policies on legislative voting in Switzerland. Stadelmann et al. (2014) shows that increasing the visibility of legislators’ votes in the Swiss Parliament did not improve the quality of public representation, and in Benesch et al. (2018) it increased Party alignment at the expense of the constituents. But these studies overlook another possibility: MPs might prefer to opt out. Existing work has explained abstention and non-participation in part by conflict within the constituency (Cohen and Noll, 1991), between the National Party and the European Party group (Mühlböck and Yordanova, 2017), and between the constituents and the Party (Longley, 2003, Willumsen and Öhberg, 2013). This literature suggests that not taking any position is an outside option for the MPs that prevents them from being blamed by any of the represented groups. The objective of this paper is to test the ====: when their constituents and their Party disagree, legislators strategically choose not to vote. Then, to test to what extent a transparency shock on the principals’ monitoring power can affect this strategic non-voting behavior.====While Party positions are observable from voting behavior in Parliament, the electorate’s preferences are more difficult to infer. The literature adopted different approaches, which often cannot generalize to other votes or other Parliaments. Cohen and Noll (1991) considers only one subset of votes using the electoral support for the Presidential party as a proxy for voters’ preferences. Longley (2003) analyzes Canadian legislative voting over the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement, using constituency union density as a measure of voters’ preferences over this issue. Several papers relied on referendums on which both the legislators and the constituents voted (Hersch and McDougall (1988) on the “Sin” issues in Kansas, Garrett (1999) on lottery adoption in West Virginia, Stadelmann et al. (2013) on a series of referendums in Switzerland). Referendums are not a common feature of the French political system==== and, therefore, cannot be used in the context of this paper to measure congruence with the constituents. Other papers use survey data, examples include Blais and Bodet, 2006, Golder and Stramski, 2010, and Willumsen and Öhberg (2013). But no systematic surveys investigate the constituents’ preferences on all issues voted in Parliament. Hence, I propose a novel approach to estimating constituents’ preferences, using their characteristics and the MPs’ recorded votes, on each topic.====A second challenge is to estimate the causal impact of transparency on participation. The fourteenth French legislature==== provides a quasi-natural framework in which to identify the effects of voting transparency. France is one of the countries (others are Switzerland, the UK, and Australia) that have recently taken advantage of electronic votes to increase the visibility of Parliamentary decision-making. In 2013 and 2014, French politics went through a series of reforms aimed at increasing the transparency of public life for citizens, including a change in the method used to record votes in Parliament.==== To improve representative democracy, the President of the French Lower House of Parliament claimed that citizens should be able to find out how their MPs vote in the Assembly.==== This reform was implemented at the end of February 2014, almost two years after the opening of the fourteenth legislative term. All of the other aspects of Parliamentary political life were identical pre-and post-reform during this legislature. This French reform is of interest, as transparency rose for votes on one of the two kinds of votes==== (those called “ordinary”) but not on the other (“important”), producing a natural difference-in-differences setting with the latter serving as the control group. The novelty of the present work is to use this transparency reform to unveil distortions in participation, which allows us to see that both principals matter for legislative voting.====My results are twofold. I first use roll-call data to measure the extent to which conflict between Party leaders and constituents affects participation. I use the constituents’ characteristics to estimate their preferences. Hence, I can tell how likely each MP is to be “caught in the crossfire” on each vote. I find that an increase in the probability of conflict significantly raises the probability of non-voting. The results are robust to using the electoral support of constituents.====Second, I use the increased availability of information to identify which principal matters the most in the voting decision. I use the quasi-natural setting of the fourteenth French legislature to carry out a difference-in-differences analysis on participation and alignment rates. Transparency reduces participation by 8 to 12 percentage points and does not significantly affect the alignment rate. As their behavior becomes more-easily observable to both constituents and Party leaders, MPs strategically prefer not to take sides. This lower participation concerns not only unaligned MPs but also some previously-aligned MPs. I conclude that the legislators care about both their constituents’ interest and their Party line.====These conclusions are robust to a battery of checks: in particular, heterogeneous effects across Parties, the salience that citizens put on the different topics, and the local rooting of MPs do not affect the results. Nevertheless, the votes studied in this paper were recorded upon request and represent only a subset of all the issues voted in Parliament. This subset likely concerns the most conflicting issues. Thus, one should interpret the results as an upper bound of the strategic response to conflicting situations in Parliament.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The Crossfire Hypothesis and its foundations are presented in Section 2, and Section 3 describes the institutional context of the fourteenth French legislature. In Section 4, I show that the decision to participate in a vote is affected by disagreement between the constituents and the Party. I then assess the impact of the reform on MPs’ voting behavior in Section 5, and Section 6 discusses the results. Section 7 concludes.",Legislators in the crossfire: Strategic non-voting and the effect of transparency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001276,8 November 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

They argue that this may be the case because longer constitutions lead to greater ,"A constitution defines a society's institutions of governance as well as the constraints imposed on its governance providers. Those constraints are an acknowledgment of the agency problems that exist between the governed and their governance providers. One way in which these agency problems become apparent is in the incidence of corruption. In this paper, we contribute to our understanding of the relationship between constitutional design and corruption. In particular, we employ synthetic control analyses to ask the question: Do longer constitutions corrupt?====Tsebelis and Nardi (2016) and Tsebelis (2017) argue that the length of a constitution is positively related to corruption. They provide cross-country evidence consistent with this (as does Montenegro (1995) in an earlier paper). However, they note that there are two different causal mechanisms that might underlie the empirical correlation. First, in a corrupt society, constitutional drafters may include a large number of specific provisions in an attempt to protect the governed.==== In acknowledgment of the fact that political agents tend to partake in corrupt activities, the idea is to employ numerous, detailed prescriptions and constraints to provide those agents with “ongoing constitutional micromanagement” (Versteeg and Zackin 2016, p. 658).==== In that case, the existing corruption causes the constitution to be longer. Alternatively, political elites may pressure drafters to include provisions that facilitate their rent-seeking efforts. A longer constitution, then, facilitates (causes) more corrupt behavior on the part of those elites.====Take the Nepalese constitution of 2015 as an illustrative example. It dedicates nearly 900 words to constitutionally establishing a Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA).==== The stated purpose of the CIAA is to “conduct or cause to be conducted investigations of corruption by a person holding any public office.” A straightforward way to interpret the CIAA is as a response to Nepal's historically high levels of corruption: the CIAA was constituted to combat the problem. By this interpretation, the corruption of Nepalese society caused the constitution to be longer. However, such a commission may also be employed by elites to protect their rents. Rather than controlling corruption, the CIAA may actually give elites control ==== corruption. In that case, political elites will have succeeded in increasing corruption via additional CIAA-based constitutional verbiage.====Tsebelis and Nardi (2016) and Tsebelis (2017) are both careful to note that the cross-country correlations they report cannot establish the direction of causality.==== For that matter, such correlations cannot even establish the existence of causality. In a regression analysis, attempts at causal inference can be frustrated by simultaneity and also the biases associated with omitted variables. The challenge in asking if a longer constitution leads to more corruption, then, is to provide a valid counterfactual. For example, perhaps we hypothesize that a country's long constitution has caused greater corruption. How do we know what its level of corruption would have been in the absence of a significant increase in constitutional length? Ideally, one would be able to consider data from a large sample of countries over time, many of which also experienced a significant increase in constitutional length at some point. Then identification can be attempted via difference-in-differences or matching methods. However, there are a limited number of such cases and the availability of corruption data further limits the researcher.====The synthetic control methodology proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010, 2015) offers a promising alternative in this context. This methodology allows researchers to examine individual cases where a “treatment” (e.g. ta significant increase in constitutional length) occurred and then exploit data from a large set of non-treated countries to construct a counterfactual. For example, Grier and Maynard (2016) employ a synthetic control to assess the impact of Hugo Chavez's regime on the Venezuelan economy; following that study, Absher et al. (2020) analyze multiple case studies of Latin-American left-populist leaders. Given that significant increases in constitutional length are relatively infrequent, synthetic control methodology is well suited to the study of whether longer constitutions corrupt. Moreover, contingent on having a reasonably long pre-treatment period (here, 10 years) and a close pre-treatment match in outcomes (here, corruption), this method accounts for both simultaneity and unobservable confounders (Abadie 2021).====In this paper, we employ synthetic controls to analyze five countries that experienced a significant increase in constitutional length during the years 1994 through 2008. The increase in constitutional length is the treatment. Using data from the Comparative Constitutions Project (CCP), we identify four cases (Ecuador 1997, Ecuador 2008; Venezuela 1999 and Mozambique 2004) where countries adopted new constitutions at least 50 percent longer than their predecessors. We also identify the case of Indonesia in 1999, where an existing constitution increased in length by more than 50% due to amendment. In each case, we draw from a large sample of countries worldwide to create the synthetic controls. We then compare how corruption levels evolve through 2015 in treated countries versus their synthetic controls.====Pre-treatment constitutional length is one of the predictor variables used to choose donor countries for each synthetic control. Each counterfactual is thus constructed, in part, to resemble the treated country along that margin, prior to the latter experiencing a significant increase in constitutional length. Furthermore, pre-treatment constitutional length is reflection of unobservable determinants of constitutional design, which we want to take into account in creating the synthetic controls.====The results are null to mixed. Initial synthetic control analyses are consistent with a significant increase in corruption in both Ecuadorian cases (1997 and 2008) and the Venezuelan case. (In the other cases, there is no compelling evidence of a causal constitutional length-corruption relationship.) However, the longer constitution effect for Ecuador (2008) is not robust to a placebo test. Furthermore, for the Venezuelan case it is difficult to distinguish a constitutional length effect from a “Chavez effect” (Grier and Maynard 2016). Taken in and of itself, the evidence presented here leaves us unconvinced that meaningfully longer constitutions corrupt.====Our analysis is limited to a small number of treatment episodes (4 wholesale constitutional adoptions; 1 significant increase in length via amendment). However, synthetic control methodology was developed with an eye toward “open[ing] the door to precise quantitative inference in small sample comparative studies” (Abadie et al., 2015). Significant increases in constitutional length are few and far between in the real world, but we want to be able to exploit these limited number of cases to ask whether longer constitutions do indeed corrupt. With this methodology, for each of the (small number of) treated cases, we can draw on the (much larger) full sample of countries to choose non-treated cases that are appropriate for constructing a synthetic control.====In specifically addressing constitutional length in relation to corruption, our paper contributes to a burgeoning empirical literature on constitutional political economy (Voigt 2011).==== A recent example having to do with constitutional length is Dove and Young (2019) who report that shorter constitutions were negatively related to government defaults in nineteenth-century US states.==== Other recent examples include Eicher et al. (2018) who find executive constraints to be associated with greater social infrastructure; and Minkler and Prakash (2017) who find stronger language on social/economic rights to be negatively related to poverty rates. Alternatively, Feld and Voigt (2003) and Voigt et al. (2015) report that ==== judicial independence is not related to economic growth when controlling for a measure of ==== independence. Similarly, Callais and Young (2021a, 2021b) report no significant relationship between constitutional entrenchment and economic growth or institutional quality.====More broadly, our work speaks to the overarching debate on whether ==== (i.e., formal; written; codified) constitutions matter at all. Authors like Wenzel (2010, p. 65) “emphatically reject the notion that good constitutional parchment is sufficient for successful constitutionalism.” Salter and Furton (2018, p. 38) are more reserved but express a similar sentiment: “A written constitution can [only] specify which set of rules, from a much larger set of feasible rules, will operate[.]” The idea mere “parchment barriers” (James Maddison's term) can bind or constrain political agents at the constitutional level is understandably suspect.====But ==== constitutions are nearly ubiquitous today. When the US adopted its Constitution in 1789, it represented an almost singular rarity. Since then, however, 95 percent of states that have come into existence did so with a ==== constitution, or adopted one within 5 years (Elkins et al., 2009, p. 42).==== And numerous scholars have pushed back, arguing that ==== constitutions can serve as coordination devices that facilitate enforcement amongst citizens and their political agents (e.g., Hardin 1989; Ordeshook 1992; Weingast 1997; Mittal and Weingast, 2011; Hadfield and Weingast 2014; Young 2019, 2021).====Along with studies mentioned above – we contribute to understanding to what extent ==== constitutions matter. Recently, this has been framed in terms of whether there exists a “gap” between ==== provisions and ==== practices (e.g., Voigt 2020; Voigt 2021; Gutmann et al., 2021). We study whether one particular dimension of constitutional design (i.e., length) matters for a specific outcome (i.e., corruption). This contribution, along with many others (extant and future), will hopefully inform our view of whether parchment barriers have teeth.====We proceed as follows. In section 2 we briefly elaborate on the synthetic control methodology. Then in section 3 we discuss the case studies analyzed and the data brought to bear on them.

However, less is known about an individual’s investment in identification, i.e., in belonging to a social group. Using a language-learning platform utilized by refugees to learn the host country’s language, we design a field experiment that allows us to make effort as an investment in a new group identity salient. The social identity in our treatment is a refugee’s identification with the host society. We modified a mailing to 5600 refugees who use an online language-learning platform to learn the host country’s language. These treatment emails make salient that improving the host country’s language ability increases the belonging to the host society. Our analysis reveals that the treatment has a significant positive effect on the effort exerted on the language-learning platform, leading to more completed exercises and more time spent learning the host country’s language. This suggests that refugees invest in becoming part of the host country’s society for its social identity component. Our findings can inform policy considerations on the use of nudges for other integration measures intended for refugees and immigrants in general.","Identity is one of the most powerful social phenomena driving human behavior. A central question around identity is how individuals establish their identity. In general, identifying with social groups is human nature and an evolutionarily stable way to facilitate cooperation and coordination within groups. However, when individuals face a new environment with a different common identity, are people willing to invest in belonging to this identity? We tackle this question with refugees in their new host country.====Much research has shown that established social identities have an independent and substantial effect on behavior, such as public good contributions (Benjamin et al., 2016, Candelo et al., 2017, Charness et al., 2014), outgroup discrimination (Hoff and Pandey, 2006), test performance (Benjamin et al., 2010, Hoff and Pandey, 2014), honesty (Cohn et al., 2014, Cohn et al., 2010), altruism (Chen and Li, 2009) and cooperation (Chen et al., 2014). Social identities are multiple within each society (e.g., “German”, “academic”, “female”, “immigrant”), but only a few identities are salient to a person at any point in time (Shayo, 2009). Furthermore, studies point out that identification is always something active and subject to change (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Jenkins, 2008, Shayo, 2020). While such research has brought us far in understanding that individuals invest in social identification, less is known about an individual’s actual investment in establishing identification in a new social group. In addition, much of the previous work on exploring whether participants are willing to spend resources to change or stay in their social group(s) was examined in a lab setting (Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo, 2009, Hett et al., 2020).====Refugees==== present an interesting case for investigating the importance of social identities and how individuals invest in becoming part of a group in real life. In contrast to established identities as discussed above, refugees at the time of arrival in a host country are clearly faced with a new social identity setting. By investigating the large refugee influx in the EU in 2015 (see Brücker et al., 2016, Kroh et al., 2017, Brücker et al., 2018), we seek to address the question of whether individuals invest in a new identity with a policy relevant population. We test in a real-life setting whether refugees are willing to invest effort to belong to the host country’s social identity. In the context of this study, we treat belonging to a host country’s society as a social identity and investment in learning the host country’s language as an investment in a stronger belonging to that identity.====Membership in a group is a cognitive process by which people self-identify with the group (Tajfel, 1974). The two key factors determining identification are the social status of a group and the perceived similarity of a person to group members (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). Social status is important because people not only receive utility from consumption, but also from esteem gained from peers (Akerlof, 2017). Similarity relies on social categorization (Haslam, 1997), which allows people to define their surrounding in an us vs. them construct using a number of relevant categories (Tajfel, 1978). Although a person may choose to which group she belongs (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000), identification is not automatic and may require some investment or change in behavior for it to be credible to the self and to others. A refugee may, for example, need to invest in group-specific skills and symbols, such as wearing clothes in the fashion of the group, reading (local) newspapers or, what this paper investigates, learning the host country language.====An important factor for the success of the refugee integration process is learning the host country’s language, both as a means of learning about customs and as an end in itself (Clots-Figueras and Masella, 2013, Hicks et al., 2015). Investigating changes in effort invested in learning a new language is particularly interesting because it is a way to improve interaction efficiency and because it is valued by the local population (?). This allows for increasing acceptance within the host society, making it easier for the individual to identify and to be identified by others (Bauer et al., 2005, Dustmann, 1994, Georgiadis and Manning, 2013, Jenkins, 2008).====From observational data alone, it is often not possible to differentiate the reasons individuals decide to be part of a group. In the case of language learning of refugees or migrants, the challenge is to separate the identity investment from multiple other reasons why immigrants might invest in learning the host country’s language, the most obvious being the economic benefits of becoming employed and receiving higher wages (Chiswick and Miller, 1995, Dustmann et al., 2003, Lazear, 1999, Mcmanus et al., 1983). With our experiment, we try tackle the issue by attempting to separate the social identity incentive for investments in language learning from other incentives. We make use of an experimental setting involving a large number of newly arrived refugees. We designed an email treatment for users of an online language learning platform, which contrasts a neutral framing with an identity framing. The identity framing aims to make salient that, all else being equal, investing in learning the host country’s language increases the sense of belonging to the host society.====Refugees have the option to increase their own group’s relative status (e.g., by succeeding by their group’s stereotypical norms, values, and behavior, e.g., along religious norms if religion differs) or become more similar to the native population by learning the local language(s). Learning the language arguably increases the similarity. Thus, refugees with better language skills can engage in “social free-riding” (Bernard et al., 2016), i.e., they can receive the social status that the local population enjoys.====In designing the study, we utilized a data set of refugees already registered on an online language-learning platform. The emails we crafted informed all users that the platform was newly available as a mobile application. Apart from one paragraph in the email and the email subject line, all participants received the same email text. Additionally, all platform users received as reminders two slight variations of the first email. Our treatment has two separate arms. One identity treatment arm informed participants in the subject line and body of the mailing that by learning German they could “become part of the German community” (identity gain treatment). The second treatment arm stressed the participants could “remain part of the German community” (identity loss treatment). In the treatment arms, we also mentioned that learning the language helps to increase their belonging to the group (i.e., the host country’s society). By doing so, we identified the effect of an identity-framed nudge within an email on language learning.====Furthermore, we first argue why the identity-framed nudge might have only manipulated the identity dimension and, in doing so, allowed us to isolate this dimension of learning the language. Secondly, we claim that language learning is a group-specific investment (Clots-Figueras and Masella, 2013). Given that both these assumptions hold, our treatment effect measures the effect of an additional investment motivated by identity concerns about becoming part of a group. Moreover, our intervention comes at close to no cost as additional text in an email is free, which makes a cost-benefit calculation in case of a positive treatment effect trivially positive.====Several theoretical drivers could lead to an effect of our intervention. On the one hand, our treatment would act through a perceived encouraged social interaction of treated refugees with society. From this point, refugees have a strong interest to conform to the newly salient group, Germans, incentivizing them to increase language learning. This might be driven by the desire for peer esteem (Akerlof, 2017), which depends on the achievement in an activity valued by the peer group, in this case language ability. Alternatively, our treatment makes salient that learning German reduces the distance to the dominant peer group, German society (Shayo, 2009, Bernard et al., 2016), which in turn reduces the disutility from social distance. With our experiment we cannot distinguish between these drivers.====Our findings show that our intervention succeeds in significantly increasing some aspects of language-learning behavior, and that we find consistently positive point estimates. We also observe an increased likelihood of activities such as: opening the email; clicking a link to the platform as well as to more new logins; completed exercises; points achieved; and more time spent on the platform after four weeks after sending the first treatment mail. Our results reveal relevant increases in learning; for example, learning time on average doubles relative to the control group after four and eight weeks such that the treatment group learns five additional minutes. This effect is driven by learners who used the learning platform prior to our intervention. Given the assumptions discussed above hold, our results suggest that refugees invest effort in being part of the host country’s society. While we cannot observe the process by which participants were selected for our experiment, using post-treatment survey data we can show our sample seems to be representative for the refugee influx in Germany around 2015 for a large set of variables, the only exception being that our sample is on average more educated. Finally, we also find no significant difference between the identity gain and identity loss treatment.====This paper contributes to several strands in the literature. First, we contribute to the empirical literature on identity in economics, as recently summarized by Shayo (2020) and Charness and Chen (2020). By showing that individuals actively invest in language learning through a group identity treatment, we provide evidence for endogenous identity formation and a preference for identification. This means that identities may be optimized, flexible, and subject to an individual’s history (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Jenkins, 2008, Tajfel, 1974, Tajfel, 1978, Tajfel and Turner, 1986). Our setting is especially relevant given that we are the first to experimentally investigate the effect of an identity not assigned by an experimenter on longer term behavior outside the lab.====Closely related to our work is Hett et al. (2020). They show that individuals sacrifice monetary payoff in order to belong to a group based on certain group characteristics and interpret this as a preference for identification. During the experiment, status differences are induced by a quiz performance split, such that groups consisting of better performers may be more desirable. Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo (2009) show that people are willing to trade group memberships at a premium, from which they conclude that there exists a “psychological benefit” for groups in an interpersonal trust game setting. Where they differ from our work is that both papers are laboratory experiments using lab measures and self-chosen identity outside the lab (i.e. football club fandom). Furthermore, both Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo (2009) and Hett et al. (2020) measure identity choice using short-term monetary investments, while we look at investments in terms of effort over time. Our intervention further differs from prior work by targeting an identity which cannot easily be claimed by paying a fee. The difference between lab and the field is important in this case, as Hoff and Pandey (2006) have shown that the predictions from the identity literature on out-group punishment from the lab do not hold for lower caste members in India. Additionally, in the lab experiments above, individuals switch groups in exchange for monetary payoff and thus endure a cost of not being identified with what they would prefer for the duration of the experiment.====Our setting differs in two further dimensions. First, learning a new language is a long-term investment in identity; therefore, the participants do not automatically switch the group upon learning. This may reduce the incentive to change behavior as the participants face low and incremental changes in identity and at the same time their other social identity (refugee) which may frown upon the language investment. Second, language learning works as an investment in what others identify the participant with and what they identify themselves with in only one dimensions of identification (others being clothing, style, adherence to traditions and customs, etc.) further reducing the incentive to invest.====Our research also contributes to the growing literature on integration of immigrants and in particular the role of identification with the host country’s society. The effects of a migrant’s self-assigned identity on integration have received increasing attention in recent years (Constant et al., 2009, Epstein and Gang, 2010, Epstein and Heizler, 2015) and are found to be relevant to outcomes in the labor market (Bisin et al., 2016, Bisin et al., 2011, Manning and Roy, 2009). However, this line of research relies mostly on survey evidence, correlating identification with important economic outcomes such as labor market performance (Cameron et al., 2015). They usually find that higher identification with the host country’s society and societal values has a positive association. Some studies also find negative associations because subjects may choose oppositional identities,==== where actions towards others’ group norms are repellent (Austen-Smith and Fryer, 2005, Battu and Zenou, 2009, Fryer and Torelli, 2010, Bisin et al., 2011, Fordham and Ogbu, 1986, Ogbu, 1999, Patacchini and Zenou, 2016, Bisin and Verdier, 2000, Dehdari and Gehring, 2017, Monscheuer, 2018). In contrast to this work, our study aims at identifying a causal link and suggests that on average refugees want to belong to the host country’s society, thus providing evidence against a widespread oppositional identity formation for this specific immigrant group in Germany.====We also provide evidence that the effort invested in a group identity can be nudged (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008).==== We directly communicate with the users of a language-learning platform via email, prompting them to change their behavior depending on their preferences for identification. Importantly, this nudge can only work if refugees have not previously optimized over their choice of identities, and when the investment in learning the language is not their best response already. In fact, in their study Hoff and Pandey (2014) conclude that the choice of identity is frame-dependent, which means that participants were not aware of all dimensions of their identity at all times. Therefore, making the identity-building component of language learning salient may change behavior. Our findings can inform policy on nudging for other integration measures aimed at immigrants in general.====Finally, our identity intervention is framed as a potential loss for one third of our sample and as a potential gain for another third, based on the vast literature showing the effect of reference dependent preferences in which losses loom larger than gains (Kahneman and Tversky, 2011, Tversky and Kahneman, 1991). There are numerous effects consistent with this finding, such as the endowment effect (Thaler, 1980). In field experiments, the additional motivation effect of loss framing is found to be successful in motivating teachers (Fryer et al., 2012, Levitt et al., 2016), marketing messages (Bertrand et al., 2010), or worker productivity (Hossain and List, 2012).==== One could argue that refugees do not own the new identity, however, Kőszegi and Rabin (2007) would posit that expectations can count as reference points towards which individuals can exhibit loss aversion. With our specific subject pool of newly arrived refugees, we cannot support such loss aversion regarding the identity dimension.",Investment in identity in the field-Nudging refugees’ integration effort,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001240,22 October 2022,2022,Research Article,39.0

More precisely, the empirical analysis places the spotlight on trade unions and investigates whether ethnic diversity affects the decision of workers to participate in them. The analysis takes place along two layers: (a) country-level and (b) individual-level. First, building on a set of innovative instruments derived from the ====, our country-level analysis seeks to exploit exogenous sources of variation in ethnic diversity and establish a convincing causal relationship between ethnic diversity and trade union density across countries. In turn, we employ individual-level data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and investigate whether immigrants who cοme from more ethnically fragmented societies participate less in trade unions in their European countries of residence. Consistent with the prediction of the theory, both layers of the empirical analysis provide robust evidence of a negative, sizeable and highly significant effect of ethnic diversity on the participation in trade unions.","It is widely accepted that ethnic diversity can have far reaching consequences for economic and political development within countries (see e.g., Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005; Alesina and Glaeser, 2004; Fearon and Laitin, 2003). Focusing on the provision of public goods, a large number of studies suggest that increased diversity reduces the amount of public goods provided both across countries and across communities within a country (see Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005; Stichnoth and Van de Straeten, 2013 for reviews of this literature). The cornerstone of this widely observed fact is that individuals are less willing to contribute towards the provision of a good with public benefits if those benefits are directed to groups that share different racial, ethnic or linguistic characteristics.====Following a similar rationale, Alesina and La Ferrara (2000) investigate whether the participation of individuals in social groups is affected by the fact that a population may be heterogeneous in terms of race or ethnicity. Using survey data on group memberships in US localities, they conclude that participation in civil activities is significantly lower in more ethnically fragmented societies. These findings come as no surprise. According to Olson (1965) collective action presents public good characteristics (i.e., each individual has an incentive to “free ride” on the efforts of the others if the collective action aims to provide non-excludable benefits to everybody). Thus, the effect of increased ethnic diversity on the participation in social groups is expected to be qualitatively similar to the impact of increased ethnic diversity on the provision of any type of public goods.====The paper at hand places the spotlight on a specific type of social group (namely, trade unions) and investigates whether workers participate less in trade unions in ethnically fragmented societies.==== This hypothesis dates back at least to Marx and Engels who first suggested that increased ethnic and racial diversity undermines class consciousness and weakens the unity of the working class in the United States.==== More recently, Lipset and Marks (2000) investigated how increased racial antipathies within the US are interrelated with the so-called “American Exceptionalism” and the corresponding low participation of American workers in trade unions. It is worth noting that craft unions in the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were organized along ethnic lines, encompassing native workers and “old” immigrants from Northern Europe and largely excluding “new” immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, along with Chinese and African-Americans. Similarly, Davis (1988) reports that conflicts among ethnic groups were particularly intense in the US labor market during the early 19th century. Particularly, from the late 1830s, Irish immigrants entered the US labor market, which was formerly dominated by Germans, British and African-Americans. Irish workers were particularly successful partly because they were willing to work for lower wages than former immigrants (and even former slaves), and partly because the Irish had a strong sense of community that allowed them to exclude competing workers from other ethnic groups. Overall, the case of US labor market during the early 19th century provides striking anecdotal evidence that strong antipathies among workers belonging to different ethnic groups weakened their participation in trade unions.====This research aims to investigate the effect of ethnic diversity on the participation in trade unions using both country-level and individual-level data. More precisely, the analysis takes place in two layers exploiting exogenous variation in ethnic diversity across: (a) countries and (b) migrants of different ancestry within a country. The first part of the analysis relies on cross-country data from 90 developed and developing countries and investigates the effect of ethnic and religious diversity on trade union density. To address the usual concerns that a relationship between ethnic diversity and trade union density may be driven by confounding factors that remain unobserved (such as economic development or specific cultural traits), we instrument ethnic diversity on a set of innovative epidemiological variables that have been linked empirically to ethnic and religious diversity (see e.g., Cashdan, 2001; Fincher and Thornhill, 2008, 2012, 2014). More precisely, we employ as instruments the: (i) ====, (ii) ==== developed by Fincher and Thornhill (2012) and (iii) ==== variables developed by Fincher and Thornhill (2008).==== Epidemiological data are neither economic nor political in nature, thus they ensure a sufficient source of exogenous variation for ethnic diversity. Our empirical findings provide evidence of a negative, statistically significant and quantitatively important effect of ethnic diversity on trade union density, which remains robust across different specifications and estimation techniques.====In the second part, we re-examine the above-mentioned hypothesis by using individual-level data from the European Social Survey (ESS). More precisely, our analysis builds on a set of 6880 –first generation– immigrants from 116 countries of origin who reside in 32 European countries and makes use of the so-called ==== suggested by Fernandez (2008, 2011) and employed by a large number of scholars in order to separate culture from the environment (see e.g., Luttmer and Singhal (2011); Galor and Özak, 2016). This part of the analysis explores the effect of ethnic diversity in the birth country of a –first generation– immigrant on his/her decision to participate in a trade union in the country of residence. Individual data allows us to account for a number of personal characteristics (such as age, gender, education, type of employment etc) but most importantly to introduce residence country fixed effects that are able to account for institutional and cultural characteristics of the country of residence. Empirical findings suggest that the decision of a worker to participate in trade unions is affected negatively by increased ethnic diversity in his/her birth country. Once again, our empirical findings remain robust and qualitatively intact across different specifications and estimation techniques.====The remainder of the paper proceeds along the following lines. Section 2 discusses the economic argument upon which we base our empirical analysis. Section 3 discusses the data and the identification strategy. Section 4 presents the empirical findings.

There is, however, no commonly accepted rule for assessing the optimal number of seats in parliament. This article offers a review of the state-of-the-art, presenting the main contributions in political economy and related fields about the question of legislature sizes, their determinants and their impact. Based on a cross-sectional comparison of 139 countries, the review is accompanied with a set of figures and tables that illustrates a set of stylized facts.","On September 20 and 21, 2020, a constitutional referendum on the reduction of the number of parliamentarians was held in Italy. The referendum, which regarded amendments to articles 56, 57 and 59 of the Italian Constitution, was intended to reduce the number of lower house legislators from 630 to 400 and those in the Senate from 315 to 200. The reason behind this cut, according to the supporters of the reform, was to reduce the amount of political spending and to increase the performance of the decision-making process. The detractors of the reform, mainly minor parties, were arguing that those gains would not compensate the loss in political representation and would, instead, weaken the parliament and democracy. The referendum passed with 69.96 percent of the formal vote.====In the past decades, several countries have voted similar reforms in order to reduce the number of national representatives (Jacobs and Otjes, 2015) – e.g., Ireland, the United Kingdom and Hungary – and many others have debated about that possibility (Farrell, 2014). In the United States, there is an old yet ongoing debate about the size of the parliament related to the fact that the population-to-representative ratio is the second-highest worldwide: only one representative for 607,450 citizens in 2017, both houses included (see Fig. 1 which offers a cross-country comparison). India holds the record with less than one national representative for 1.7 million inhabitants. Comparatively, some other countries, mostly with a smaller population size, have a much lower ratio – e.g., Luxembourg with one representative for ten thousand inhabitants.====So far, there is no commonly accepted rule for assessing the optimal size of legislatures. Taagepera’s (1972) ==== specifies the optimal number of seats in a legislature as the cube root of the population, but this normative result is subject to discussion (e.g., Auriol and Gary-Bobo, 2012, Godefroy and Klein, 2018, Margaritondo, 2021, Gamberi et al., 2021). In the same vein, a set of empirical contributions show that the number of parliament members (MPs, hereafter) increases with population size, but the estimates can deviate from the theoretical values (Gamberi et al., 2021). The heterogeneity of preferences is also an important factor to account for, because a larger legislature (1) improves the representation of females, ethnic minorities and small-towns population (Brooks et al., 2011, Gerring and Veenendaal, 2020), (2) generates higher policy congruence between voters and representatives (Stadelmann et al., 2014), and (4) affect party representation (Taagepera, 2007, Lundell, 2012).====Another fraction of the literature investigates the link between the size of assemblies and public spending levels, expecting a positive relationship between the two variables. The tenet of the theory is that legislators act in their own interests and/or favor their constituents at the expense of the general community, e.g., through pork barrel spending and distributive policies (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962, Weingast et al., 1981). In that perspective, the number of representatives must be shaped in a way to avoid excessive spending levels.====The recent popular protests against national policies have drawn a lot of attention to the question of the efficiency of democracies. With the high rate of population growth, the question of the legislature size must be brought up to the table. In France, the number of seats in the lower house has barely evolved in 62 years (579 in 1958 versus 577 in 2020) while the population has increased by 75% (44 versus 67 millions). Despite this trend, most candidates for the 2017 French presidential elections were advocating a cut in the number of MPs. In the US, the ratio of citizens to MPs has more than tripled in one century (DeSilver, 2018). In 1850, an appropriation bill was introduced to enlarge the Capitol but, nowadays, the building cannot be easily expanded in order to accommodate more MPs (see, e.g., Kane et al., 2020). In India, the number of seats is fixed since 1976, yet a new building is expected to be completed by October 2022 in order to expand the parliament seating capacity.====The research question is also of interest at the subnational level. In the UK, the number of local elected representatives varies considerably and is, in large part, the result of historical accidents (Purdam et al., 2007). By way of contrast, the council size at the municipal level in France and Belgium is based on formulas that specify the number of seats as a function of population thresholds. Moreover, several studies address the question of the relationship between the size of local assemblies and local public expenditures (see, e.g., Meloche and Kilfoil, 2017, Höhmann, 2017, De Benedetto, 2018, Bel et al., 2018 for recent analyses).====This article offers a review of the current state of knowledge. We use a dataset of 139 countries to shed lights on the connections that exist between the size of national legislatures, their type (bicameral vs unicameral), their constitution (unitary republic, federal government, unitary monarchy), the population size, public spending and debt levels as well as several democracy indicators (control of corruption, voice and accountability, polity2, degree of political competition). This empirical work has an illustrative purpose only and will not address problems of causality among variables; but will, more simply, accompany the review with a set of stylized facts.====The outline of the review is as follows. Section 2 addresses the research question from an historical and fundamental perspective. Section 3 discusses the role of the population size. Sections 4 Impacts of legislature size on fiscal policies, 5 Effects on the quality of democracy examine the effect on fiscal policies and quality of democracy.

We introduce opportunities for political candidates and their media supporters to spread fake news about the ==== and perhaps about parties’ positions into a familiar model of electoral competition. In the baseline model with full information, the parties’ positions converge to those that maximize aggregate welfare. When parties can broadcast fake news to audiences that disproportionately include their partisans, policy divergence and suboptimal outcomes can result. We study a sequence of models that impose progressively tighter constraints on false reporting and characterize situations that lead to divergence and a polarized electorate."," Hochschild and Einstein (2015) ask in the title of their monograph on the role of misinformation in American politics that opens with the above quote. Do unwise policies result when politicians and the media spread false information and the citizenry accepts it unquestioningly when deciding how to vote? The authors use case studies to argue that “people’s willingness to use mistaken factual claims in their voting and public engagement is … dangerous to a democratic polity”. (2015, p.14)====Here we address a similar question with game-theoretic tools. We take the well-known probabilistic voting model of Lindbeck and Weibull (1987), in which parties and candidates have no policy preferences, as our baseline environment. In this setting, there are two political parties that differ in exogenous ways and a population of heterogeneous voters that evaluates them differently. The parties compete by staking positions on a “pliable” policy issue that voters consider along with their assessments of the parties’ fundamentals. In an equilibrium with accurately informed voters, the election delivers pliable policies that maximize aggregate welfare. But what if voters are ill informed and parties can compete by making false claims about the policy environment and the positions supported by themselves and their rivals? Under what circumstances will the potential for spreading “fake news” distort the parties’ positions away from those that are socially desirable? Will the parties make competing claims that polarize the electorate or will they broadcast similar announcements? We ask these questions in a sequence of models with increasingly tighter constraints on the scope for false reporting. First, we give the parties free rein to make claims both about a parameter that affects the desirability of alternative policies (i.e., the “state of the world”) and about their and their rival’s positions on the matter. The parties reach different audiences and have a greater chance of being heard by their own partisans. Next, we restrict the parties to announce their own position accurately, while still allowing false claims about the state of the world and about the rival’s intentions. Finally, we suppose that voters learn both parties’ actual positions, but still may be misled about the attractiveness of alternative policy options. In each case, we ask whether the parties converge or diverge in their positions and announcements and whether the fake news distorts the ultimate policy outcome.====While misinformation has long been a tool in political competition, recent trends have heightened concern about the spread of misleading or “fake” news. Social media and other internet outlets enable politicians and their allies to reach ever-larger, targeted audiences. Guess et al. (2018) estimate that one in four Americans visited a fake news website in the six weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election—where fake news is defined as the most extreme form of misleading information inasmuch as its content is intentionally and verifiably false. Allcott and Gentzkow (2017) document the increasing role that social media play as a source of political information and argue that “people who get news from Facebook (or other social media) are less likely to receive evidence about the true state of the world that would counter an ideologically aligned but false story” (p.221). Moreover, these authors and Silverman and Singer-Vine (2016) report survey evidence that many voters have difficulty distinguishing real and fake news and that many believe the false claims they encounter. Guess et al. (2018) provide evidence of selective exposure to fake news sources: Republican voters were more likely to receive news from pro-Trump sources than Democratic voters. This characteristic of the information technology features prominently in our modeling of the parties’ strategic use of fake news.====We contribute to a small literature on the role of imperfect information in electoral competition. Early contributions by Baron (1994) and Grossman and Helpman (1996) feature informed and uninformed voters, with the latter responding mechanically to campaign spending financed by interest groups. Glaeser et al. (2005) explain “extremism” in policy positions in a model in which individuals vote only if the expected benefit exceeds an idiosyncratic voting cost and potential voters are more likely to learn the position of their affiliated party than the position of the nonaffiliated party. In this paper, we study formally the strategic use of misinformation in political competition.==== A larger literature addresses the role of the media in providing information to voters. Although we do not consider the media to be the only source of false and misleading information—especially now that politicians and political parties can readily use social media to make direct contact with voters—partisan media certainly do play a role in informing and misinforming the electorate. Strömberg (2015) and Prior (2013) provide excellent surveys of the theoretical and empirical literatures, respectively, on the role of the media in electoral politics.==== Strömberg (2015) distinguishes models in which the media provides accurate information to uninformed voters from models that feature media bias. As examples of the former, Strömberg (2004) studies situations in which the media informs voters about candidates’ policy positions, whereas Snyder and Strömberg (2010) consider information about the quality of government services that voters use to assess the expected competence of the incumbent. In both papers, and others like them, the information provided by the media serves to improve the selection of candidates, enhance political accountability, and raise expected welfare. In contrast, Bernhardt et al. (2008) and Chan and Suen (2008) model the political ramifications of biased news coverage. They begin with Zaller’s (1992, p. 313) observation that the media lead voters to “hold opinions that they would not hold if aware of the best available information and analysis”. Bernhardt et al. (2008) focus on information suppression that occurs when news outlets withhold negative information about the competence of the candidate they prefer. They show how this can lead to the election of inferior candidates. Chan and Suen (2008) model candidate endorsements by partisan newspapers. In their setting, voters may be confused by countervailing endorsements, but if readers choose their news sources based on their ideological positions, the partisan guidance can eliminate voter mistakes. In both of these settings featuring fully rational voters, the authors conclude that ideological media reinforces prior beliefs and polarizes the electorate.====Our model differs from these precedents inasmuch as we consider a more active role for the politicians in choosing policy positions and we model information that concerns both the positions taken and the conditions that determine the optimal policy response.==== Perhaps the paper most similar to ours is a recent one by Wolton (2019). He posits two politicians with policy preferences and media outlets that also rank alternative policy outcomes. An incumbent chooses policy in the first period with knowledge of the state of the world and to reflect her own type, be it moderate or extreme. The single, rational voter seeks to infer the incumbent’s type from her action and also from (possibly) slanted reports released by the media. The reports by a biased media will impact the policy choices by the incumbent when electoral incentives are sufficiently strong. Compared to a world with unbiased media, the presence of a biased media can generate a better first-period policy outcome, but harm the electorate’s choice between the candidates. Key differences between Wolton (2019) and this paper include our supposition that voters are not able or willing to make sophisticated, Bayesian inferences and our treatment of a large and heterogeneous electorate.====Two of our findings bear particular emphasis. First, we find that the effect of fake news on policy choices depends on the scope for misrepresentation—in a somewhat counterintuitive way. When parties can misrepresent broadly, including false reports about their own intentions, they can “speak” separately to their two audiences. To those that obtain their information from biased sources, the parties misrepresent both the state of the policy environment and their own intended response. This leaves them free to choose an optimal response (in view of the actual state of the world) to attract votes from those that are fully informed. In contrast, when the scope for misrepresentation is more narrow—extending only to reports about the policy environment and possibly to claims about a rival’s intentions, but not to false allegations about own positions—then the parties must speak to two audiences at once. To attract votes from the well-informed, they prefer an appropriate response to the true policy environment. But to appeal to those to whom they have spread false information, they lean to policies that would be appropriate for the fictitious states. In short, policy choices need not be more distorted when the scope for misrepresentation is greater.====Second, we find that a polarized electorate can result when the fraction of misinformed voters is intermediate, but not when it is extremely high or extremely low. In the extreme cases, the parties have incentive to woo the same group of voters, be they the well-informed or the misinformed. The announcements that are strategically advantageous to the two parties are similar in these cases. In contrast, when both well-informed and uninformed voters are well represented in the voting population, the parties’ best responses might diverge, especially when voters’ sourcing habits are asymmetric. The party that attracts a greater share of listeners among its uninformed partisans adopts an electoral strategy that relies heavily on fake news. It issues an extreme report about the state of the world and a position that is appropriate for that false state. In these circumstances, the rival party might respond by appealing more to the informed voters. With a position far from that of its rival, it may lead its uninformed audience to believe something very different about the state of the world.",Electoral competition with fake news,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001185,30 September 2022,2022,Research Article,42.0

We analyse the effect of this bias in a two-period two-party election model in which voters care about both policy preference and competence. We find that, if voters (wrongly) believe that women are drawn from a distribution of competences with higher weights on lower values, female politicians are less likely to win office but, when elected, they are on average more competent than male elected officials. As a consequence, female incumbents seek re-election more often.","Under-representation of women in parliaments worldwide is an issue that has been puzzling political scientists and political economists for a long time. While gender gaps in many areas have been reduced or have completely disappeared, women are still a minority in elected legislatures. They account for 24.9% of the members of parliaments worldwide, in spite of being roughly 50% of the population.====This is clearly a failure of descriptive representation but this deficit is of even greater concern because women’s policy preferences receive more attention when a larger percentage of women are elected. It is therefore a question of substantive, not just formal, representation,==== as recent studies have shown that female politicians are more effective at addressing women’s policy needs (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004, Svaleryd, 2009, Clots-Figueras, 2011, Funk and Gathmann, 2015, Braga and Scervini, 2016).====The puzzle comes from the fact that elected women tend to be more qualified than men and while in office they seem to be better representatives for their district (Volden et al., 2012). If, given this superiority, women are still such a minority among legislators, it must be that voters hold some kind of gender bias when evaluating candidates (Pearson and McGhee, 2013). Studies have shown that voters hold women to a higher standard, and vote them only if they are both capable and likeable (Anzia and Berry, 2011), and that they believe that women are more suitable for dealing with some issues like healthcare and education and less with others like homeland security (Lawless, 2004, Falk and Kenski, 2004).====This paper proposes a belief-based theoretical model of gender bias without assuming explicit voters’ preference for male politicians and we study its implications on politicians’ quality and behaviour, and on their probability of winning an election.",Gender bias and women’s political performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022001173,27 September 2022,2022,Research Article,43.0

The second is the hypothesis that shirking by the incumbent governing party is decreased by greater expected electoral contestability and expected contestability is related to the effective number of competing parties (ENPSeats) nonmonotonically.

That is, the more competitive is an election, the more incentivized are political parties to promise programs that respond to the wishes of voters (Downs, 1957; Dahl, 1971; Alvarez and Nagler, 2004), the more accountable will political parties be for full-filling their program and performance promises (Ferejohn, 1986; Persson et al., 1997; Dash and Ferris, 2021), the higher will be the quality of representatives and decision makers within government (Buchler, 2011), and the more likely that special interest politics will result in policies that benefit, rather than opportunistically disadvantage, the overall electorate (Becker, 1983; Hillman and Ursprung, 2016). To test these hypotheses, different measures of government responsiveness, accountability, size and composition have been related to measures of electoral outcome used to proxy electoral competitiveness ex ante (Rogers and Rogers, 2000; Skilling and Zeckhauser, 2002; Ferris et al., 2008; Besley et al., 2010; Dash et al., 2019; Winer et al., 2021).====This paper is concerned not with electoral competition nor with the size of government per se but with the economic performance of governments between elections and the role of political parties and expected electoral contestability in monitoring the degree of shirking that arises in government behaviour and is reflected in excessive spending (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Persson and Tabellini, 2000 chp. 4). Here shirking is interpreted broadly as the use of government resources to further personal and party interests that are in addition to those valued by voters. To test these hypotheses we use the ex post closeness of an election as a metric of the extent to which political party rivals in the legislature can monitor the behaviour of the incumbent party effectively and so minimize the ongoing dissipation of governance rents coming through higher levels of spending.==== While narrow electoral outcomes increase the opportunity for rivals to monitor incumbent behaviour, the effectiveness of that monitoring will depend on the degree to which rival criticism is accepted being meaningful by the electorate, that is, on the degree to which the upcoming election is contestable. Duverger's view that electoral competition in winner-take-all elections will lead the effective number of parties (ENP) to converge on two also implies an increase in the credibility of the rival party as a feasible alternative to the incumbent (Demsetz, 1968; Dash et al., 2019)). On the other hand, as the number of viable competitors fall the remaining few have greater opportunity to collude at the expense of the electorate. Together these considerations raise the possibility of a nonmonotonic relationship arising between excessive government size and ENP.====The idea that the effect of political competition on economic performance through government policy may be nonmonotonic is not new and has been argued by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) and tested for (and confirmed) by authors such as Leonida et al. (2015) and Alfano and Baraldi (2015). In these cases, the relationship between the number and/or effective number of political parties and economic growth is found to be U shaped; that is, political competition is less effective in its effect on growth when it is either too limited or too intense. In our case an inverted U shaped relationship is expected to be found in the relationship between the effective number of political parties (ENPSEats) and election contestability.====The paper proceeds in section 2 by outlining in more detail the hypotheses to be tested on 155 years of Canadian annual data covering the 44 post-Confederation federal elections held between 1867 and 2021. Section 3 describes the variables used to model the fundamentals underlying federal government expenditure size, their time series characteristics and then outlines how these measures will be used to test the between-election role that political competition plays in minimizing political shirking. Section 4 presents the regression model results of these tests using both election year and annual data. Section 5 examines the robustness of the two regression model findings by first examining in Section 5a whether the U shaped relationship revealed between government size and ENPSeats is symmetric. Using a fractional polynomial model on election data we show that the best fitting ENPSeats and government size relationship is neither monotonic nor symmetric. That is, the effect of ENPSeats on government size slowly falls before rising more rapidly as it passes its minimum estimated value of 2.7. In Section 5b we look for more insight from the greater number of observations in annual data and find that the distribution of government expenditure sizes is bimodal. By using a finite mixture model with two classes, the analysis reveals the presence of two classes of behaviour: a dominant class of behaviour that encompasses over seventy percent of the data and a second class associated with behaviour a smaller percentage of the data focused on the upper end of the size distribution. The estimated model of the dominant class is consistent with a strong U shaped ENPSeats relationship and this finding helps to explain why the U shaped effect is obscured when only a single behavioural class is assumed and estimated. A plotting of the finite mixture's predicted marginal effects yields a U shaped relationship with a minimum of about 2.4.

We test the hypothesis that democracy exerts an impact on access to credit. We perform regressions at the firm-level on a large dataset of 46,000 firms in 108 countries. We find evidence of a negative relationship between democracy and ==== for firms. We further establish that democracy contributes to reduce borrower discouragement and leads to more bank loan approval decisions. Our key finding is therefore that democracy favors firms' access to credit. Our work contributes to the debate on the impact of democracy on economic development by considering one firm-level channel of transmission.","Following the fall of the Berlin wall, the world has witnessed an impressive rise in the number of countries transitioning from authoritarian regimes to democratic rule. According to Democracy Project, the number of democracies in the world has nearly doubled, rising from 51 in 1989 to 99 in 2018.==== The recent years have however suggested a potential reversal trend with the gradual move to authoritarian regimes in several countries such as Turkey or Russia. These changes in political regimes generate questions regarding which type of political regime brings about the greatest economic benefits.====Economists and political scientists have devoted a great deal of attention to this debate, with recent studies supporting the beneficial impact of democracy on economic development, at least in the long run (e.g., Rodrik and Wacziarg, 2005; Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008; Acemoglu et al., 2019; Colagrossi et al., 2020). In their recent paper, Acemoglu et al. (2019) find that democratization increases GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the next 25 years.====The beneficial impact of democracy on economic development can occur through its influence on financial development, since financial development has been shown to favor economic development (Levine, 2005; Popov, 2018). At the macroeconomic level, Huang (2010) has shown that democratization is associated with higher financial development in a cross-country study. It is however of importance to identify the channels through which this impact takes place at the firm-level. Delis et al. (2020) provide the first evidence on this issue by showing that democratization reduces the cost of credit in an investigation performed on a cross-country sample of syndicated loans, which are large loans granted to large companies.====Another channel through which democracy can exert its influence on financial development is through access to credit for firms, which has been shown to be a major force through which financial development can boost economic growth. Indeed, evidence has shown that the lack of access to credit is one of the main obstacles for the growth of firms, in particular for small and medium-sized firms (Beck and Demirguc-Kunt, 2006: Nkurunziza, 2010). Credit-constrained firms cannot realize worthwhile projects and cannot consequently exploit all investment opportunities. Consequently, greater access to credit favors the expansion of the private sector. Lack of access to credit also contributes to hamper productivity of firms (Gatti and Love, 2008; Butler and Cornaggia, 2011) and then slows down the level of productivity of countries. Thus, the inability of firms to access credit is a major brake on economic growth, which explains the numerous efforts from international organizations to enhance access to credit for firms in developed and developing countries.====In this paper, we examine how democracy influences access to credit. We perform this analysis with firm-level data on access to credit in a cross-country study including firms from all sizes. We are then able to establish the relation at the firm-level without restricting our conclusions to one country. In comparison with the analysis of Delis et al. (2020) concentrating on large companies, our work is of broader interest for the channels of the impact of democracy since SMEs have fewer financing options than large companies and are thus more dependent on bank credit for external finance. Therefore, enhanced access to credit is expected to play a larger role in financial development than reduced cost of credit for large companies, which can rely on other financing sources.====We face one key challenge in the investigation of the link between democracy and access to credit: the identification of credit-constrained firms. A first set of works uses a perception-based approach to measure credit constraints by focusing on whether firms perceive access to finance as an obstacle to their operations (Beck and Demirguc-Kunt, 2006; Clarke et al., 2006; Asiedu et al., 2013). Perception-based measures can be problematic since they are subject to perception bias and then may imperfectly inform on credit-constrained firms. A second set of studies defines credit-constrained firms as those not using formal credit (Muravyev et al., 2009; Aterido et al., 2013; Love and Martínez Pería, 2014). The concern then is that some firms do not apply for credit because they do not need it, and then cannot be considered as credit-constrained. Thus, we adopt a third approach following Popov and Udell (2012) and Léon (2015). Using data on access to credit from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, we define credit-constrained firms as either firms that applied for credit and were denied or did not apply for credit because they were discouraged. This identification strategy enables us to disentangle the effects through loan approval and borrower discouragement so that we can truly examine the effect of democracy on firms' access to credit. We combine this information on access to credit and a large set of firm-level control variables with democracy indicators from the Polity IV project and additional country-level variables. We then consider a sample of about 46,000 firms in 108 countries. We are then able to examine how democracy could influence access to credit for firms and further identify potential channels through which this effect is transmitted.====Our primary finding is that democracy favors access to credit. Firms in more democratic countries have lower credit constraints. This effect is more pronounced for small and medium-sized firms, which tend to suffer the most from credit constraints. The identification approach is further enhanced by analyzing the effects of democracy on loan approval and borrower discouragement. We establish that in more democratic countries, firms are less discouraged to apply for credit and banks are more likely to accept loan applications, consistent with the view that democracy transmits positive signals to banks and firms.====We further demonstrate the role of the individual constitutional dimensions of democracy as well as the impact of political guarantees on firms' credit access. While all four constitutional components of democracy (i.e., competitiveness of executive recruitment, openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive, and competitiveness of participation) are important in alleviating firms' credit constraints, the openness of executive recruitment, which reflects the existence of institutions and procedures through which citizens can participate in the political process, matters the most in fostering firms' ability to access credit. The political guarantees also play an important role: rule of law, property rights, and press freedom all have significant impact in determining the negative effect of democracy on credit constraints. Overall, we show that democratization enhances firms' ability to access credit.====Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we contribute to the debate on the relationship between democracy and economic growth (e.g. Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008; Acemoglu et al., 2019) by investigating a financial channel through which democracy can be beneficial for economic development. Our work provides the first evidence on the impact of democracy on access to credit, which has been shown to be a fundamental driver of firm growth (Beck and Demirguc-Kunt, 2006). Second, we extend the strand of literature that examines the determinants of access to credit for firms. Existing studies have identified bank competition (Chong et al., 2013; Léon, 2015), foreign bank participation (Clarke et al., 2006), institutional development (Beck et al., 2006), gender (Asiedu et al., 2013; Aterido et al., 2013), social capital (Heikkilä et al., 2016), among others. We augment the literature by emphasizing the importance of democracy on access to credit. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the effect of democracy on firms' access to credit.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the related literature and then present the theoretical framework. Section 3 describes the data and econometric methodology used in the study. Section 4 discusses the results, while Section 5 shows the robustness checks.

In this article, we exploit the regional distribution of refugees at the sub-prefectural (province) level as a natural experiment in order to delineate the political effects of what the Greeks call the ====. We find that the settlement of refugees produced positive persistent effects on the electoral share of left-wing parties in the interwar and postwar periods. This is particularly the case for provinces with a high settlement rate of refugees originating from Asia Minor rather than from East Thrace or the Black Sea region. However, the refugee impact on the left-wing vote disappears completely in the post-dictatorship period.","Abrupt migratory flows are inclined to result in significant economic and social transformations. Research on mass migration has yielded an abundant literature on the impact of refugees on socio-economic development and political attitudes. This paper contributes to the study of migration waves as region-specific shocks and, in this way, offers a new outlook on the 1923 Greek-Turkish population exchange. The exploration of its political effects sheds new light on our understanding of inter- and post-bellum Greek political development and, in this way, it provides a robust explanation for the interwar and postwar rise of the Greek Left. It is important to point out that the Greek setting constitutes a powerful vehicle for analyzing the political effects of forced migration in the destination regions across different national, transnational, and historical contexts. Utilizing the framework of Marantzidis (2001) on West Black Sea refugees in Northern Greece, we underscore the differential integration of Ottoman Greek refugees into modern Greek politics and society as well as their political polarization toward the Left or the Right.====Our paper contributes to the discussion on the relationship between forced migration and political polarization in the region or country of destination.==== The 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey becomes, therefore, a historical laboratory for the comparative political economy of forced migrations. Building on the qualitative findings of Marantzidis (2001), we offer strong quantitative evidence for a refugee effect on the rise and consolidation of the Greek Left in the interwar and postwar periods, as well as its dissipation in the post-dictatorship period. Drawing evidence from data on refugee distribution at the sub-prefectural (province) level, we use OLS modeling, propensity score matching (PSM), and coarsened exact matching (CEM) to estimate the effect of refugee settlement on Greek political development such as vote shares for Greece's liberal, conservative, and communist parties in the interwar, postwar, and post-dictatorship periods. Furthermore, the control variables of our model include population growth, arable land per capital, altitude, and a prefecture capital dummy. We discover a positive and significant relationship between Greek refugee shares and the vote shares of the Left in the interwar (United Front in 1932 and Popular Front in 1936) and postwar (the United Democratic Left in 1958 and 1963) periods.====Following the same logic, we underscore the heterogeneity of Ottoman Greek refugees based on their region of origin. We report results related to the three major regions of origin of Ottoman Greek refugees: Asia Minor (mainland Turkey including the Aegean and Marmara coasts, Cappadocia, Bithynia, Central and Eastern Anatolia; see Fig. A.3A), East Thrace (the metropolitan territory between the modern Greek land border and Istanbul; see Fig. A.4A), and Pontus (Turkey's Black Sea coast; see Fig. A.5A). We find that Asia Minor refugees contributed to the rise of the Greek Left more than East Thrace and Black Sea refugees, while East Thrace refugees exhibited comparable levels of support for the Left and the Right in the interwar and postwar periods. Black Sea refugees, however, appeared more inclined to vote for right-wing parties such as the People's Party in the interwar period and the National Radical Union in the postwar period.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

From an economic perspective, the pandemic can be thought of as a triple shock, as it combines elements of a supply, a demand, and an uncertainty shock. These economic shocks likely affect consumer sentiment and, thereby, could dampen current and future spending. At the same time, however, expansive fiscal and ==== measures may ease the negative effects of the pandemic on consumer sentiment.====, ====). In a pandemic, this uncertainty also relates to the government’s and the general public’s reaction to the crisis. As a consequence, the economic optimism or pessimism of consumers depends not only on the effect of the pandemic itself, but also on how well they feel the government and the general public are handling it. In such a situation, individuals may rely on others’ beliefs as a guideline, for instance, those contained in cross-country rankings.==== Consumers in emerging market economies are more vulnerable to income losses, as the social security net is often less developed. We thus study the effect of information treatments about others’ beliefs using randomized control trials (RCTs) integrated into online consumer surveys conducted in Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand and Vietnam are interesting case studies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, because both countries are neighbors of China and were among the first countries worldwide to be affected by COVID-19.====The first wave of our survey took place in May 2020, shortly after the easing of the first lockdown in both countries. A follow-up survey was conducted in December 2020, at the start of a second wave of infections in both countries. The first information treatment presents average response shares across countries from another survey measuring views about the appropriateness of the government’s response to the COVID-19 crisis (==== treatment). Here, we exploit a notable asymmetry among our two sample countries. The cross-country survey by ====, which we use for this treatment, finds that Thailand is ranked lowest in terms of agreement with the government’s response, while Vietnam receives the highest ranking. We utilize this cross-country variation to evaluate whether it matters for our respondents’ own beliefs at which end of the distribution tail the beliefs shown in the treatment lie.====The second treatment presents evidence on average beliefs about the inappropriateness of the general public’s response during the COVID-19 crisis in a cross-country survey by ==== (==== treatment). This treatment is more symmetric across our sample countries because the average inappropriateness ratings in Thailand and Vietnam are relatively similar and lie in the middle of the cross-country distribution, rather than in the tails.====The opposite beliefs in the two countries in the ====, ====).====Our results show that both the ==== and the ==== treatment have positive effects on unemployment and economic growth expectations of Vietnamese consumers in the first survey in May 2020. Interestingly, both treatments thus seem to be perceived as “good news” by Vietnamese consumers. Conditioning on respondents’ prior beliefs about the governments’ economic policies in normal times (elicited before the treatment) shows that this effect is primarily driven by those who previously thought the government did a bad job. Presenting these more negatively opinionated consumers with a cross-country ranking showing their home country to do well leads to more optimistic macroeconomic expectations and significantly more positive sentiment. Similarly, Thai respondents who previously held a positive opinion about their government (a minority) become significantly more pessimistic after receiving information about their country’s negative cross-country ratings.====However, the treatment effects are rather short-lived, as most turn out to be insignificant when re-interviewing participants in the second survey in December 2020. We also treated a part of our sample with the information treatments for the first time in December 2020. In the first wave, all the significant effects were found for the Vietnamese sample, whereas in the second wave, most of the significant treatment effects were found for the Thai sample. Most of these estimates point to negative effects of either treatment on macroeconomic expectations and sentiment. This suggests that people’s assessment of such information depends on its timing during the pandemic, which is characterized by evolving case numbers as well as changes in the government and the public’s reaction to it: The positive “good news” effect in the Vietnamese sample was dominant when conditions improved after the first wave, whereas the negative “bad news” effect in the Thai sample was more pronounced at the start of the second wave of infections.====Our paper contributes to the growing literature that combines consumer surveys with RCTs to study economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, however, most studies focus on the United States (U.S.) and were conducted at the beginning of the pandemic. ==== conducted two survey experiments at the start of the pandemic in the U.S. that is, in early-mid March 2020. They show that providing information about true contagiousness or mortality significantly lessens concerns over the individual or the aggregate economic situation. While ==== measure economic sentiment using questions on personal economic concerns related to COVID-19, we calculate an individual index of consumer sentiment based on financial and macroeconomic expectations as well as the readiness to spend on durable goods. ==== conducted a survey of Nielsen Homescan panelists in April 2020 and randomly provided several information treatments about the severity of the pandemic and monetary, fiscal, and health policies in the U.S. They find no notable effects of information about policy responses on macroeconomic expectations or planned spending. ==== surveyed U.S. consumers in April 2020 and included RCT information treatments referring to several historical stock market crashes. The authors find that those who received information about a more severe stock market crash in the past are more pessimistic about current stock market development. Finally,  ==== conducted a survey from October 19–21, 2020 in the U.S. to study the effect of the expected presidential election outcome on economic expectations. The authors find that providing public polling information significantly changes the opinions of only those respondents who are political independent and/or have no strong initial beliefs about the outcome.====Our paper also adds to the literature on the link between consumer sentiment and perception of the government or political preferences.==== ==== model theoretically the two-way relationship between subjective consumer sentiment and government competence. The authors assume that households either form their beliefs about government competence first and then use it as an anchor for their personal economic sentiment, or, alternatively, they form their economic sentiment first and, based on that, assess the government’s performance. Using data on the U.S., ==== find more evidence supporting the latter sequence. However, ====’s finding supports the former channel. Media affects how citizens view the U.S. president’s ability to govern the economy. Their views in turn have both long-run and short-run effects on consumer sentiment.====More generally, our paper is also related to the literature studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumption, a body of work that includes, among others, ====, ====, ====, ====, and ====. In a companion paper using the same survey and sample countries employed in the present study, ==== analyze the effects of fiscal policy in the form of financial assistance to households. We find that financial support to households during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to more positive consumer sentiment and increases in actual and planned durable spending, while also being correlated with a more optimistic macroeconomic outlook, higher trust in the government, and higher personal well-being. Finally, ==== study the correlation of employment status with household financial situation and economic expectations in Vietnam using an online survey from April 26 to May 9, 2020. They find that having a job is positively correlated with a better financial situation, fewer job concerns, and more optimism with respect to future economic development.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss a behavioral mechanism based on Prospect Theory, which can explain why a person’s reaction to good news might not simply be the reverse of his/her reaction to bad news. In Section ====, we describe our survey and the treatments. Section ==== contains the results of our analysis.

In the rent-seeking literature policies are usually taken as one-dimensional. This paper models policy formation using a political contest with endogenous policy proposals containing two dimensions, e.g. access and quality of education. The two dimensions provide an opportunity to trade off one policy over another to make the lobbying opposition less aggressive. In a first stage, the government proposes a reform over the two policies, and in a second stage engages in a contest with an interest group over the enactment of the proposed reform. As a result, the government makes a compromise, under-proposing in the policy the interest group opposes and over-proposing in the policy the interest group desires. Effectively, there will be strategic bundling of desired policies with undesired ones in an attempt to increase enactment probability and overall utility. We study this prediction empirically using a newly complied dataset on education ==== in the states of California, Illinois and Texas. Results suggest that stronger opposition is associated with less quality reforms. Moreover, as predicted by the model, when bundling access reforms together with quality, the negative effect is counteracted.","Policy reforms are frequently multifaceted. They are composed of a collection of provisions involving more than one policy dimension. In international trade, for instance, decisions must be made about the commodities to be regulated as well as the level of tariffs. In health care policy, insurance coverage and insurance policy standards may fall under a single health reform bill. In education, a reform could contain provisions on the salary of teachers as well as on the curriculum. In social welfare, reforms can contemplate a change in the generosity of some benefit, and also changes in the group of beneficiaries. Often, these different elements of reform are used by opposing interests as tools for bargaining in the political arena. A group that prioritizes one policy dimension over another may use the other dimension as an instrument for negotiation.====During the heated 2009 debates regarding the United States’ Obamacare health bill, certain concessions were made in order to secure the support of politicians to ensure the bill’s passage, some of those policies on which compromises were made were the federal funding for abortion and the public health insurance option, which many agreed to be minor parts of the overall reform. Another example is Australia’s controversial Higher Education Bill of 2014, whose main purpose was to reform the funding system for Australian universities through deregulation of higher education fees. The bill has undergone a series of compromises since its introduction early in 2014, including the proposed budget cut to universities by 20%, in order to win over the labor party, the Greens, and resistant cross-bench politicians.====In this paper we explore such strategic behavior in a political contest model with two policy elements that may be traded off to augment the probability of winning. We consider a policy-oriented government interested in reforming a bundle of two policies, one of which is opposed and the other supported by an interest group. In the first stage, the government makes a reform proposal to the legislature, which then decides on its enactment in the second stage. The decision to enact the proposed reform is influenced negatively by the lobbying effort of the interest group and positively by the lobbying effort of the government. We therefore model the legislative process as a contest in which effort exerted by the interest group and the government are costs associated with gaining votes in the legislature. In this endogenous policy formation framework, we investigate the composition of the government’s reform proposal in the presence of the interest group. By threatening to block the reform enactment in congress through lobbying, the interest group can nudge the government’s policy proposal closer to their desired bundle. In equilibrium, the government makes a compromise with respect to its optimal bundle by proposing less of the interest group’s opposed policy and more of the interest group’s desired policy.====This result has an interesting implication for policy bundling. If the government were interested in reforming only one policy dimension, then, absent opposition, he would propose to keep the other policy at the ====. However, if this policy is desired by the interest group, the model implies that an opposition would induce him in equilibrium to propose a level higher than the ==== to appease the lobby. In such a case, the government strategically bundles the policies into one proposal to maximize the chances of enactment.====The setup of our model has three features of the policy-making process that deserve preliminary comment. First, the government does not decide on reform enactment. Existing literature models the government as the contest maker who decides on the proposals of two opposing interest groups that expend effort to gain the favor of the government. Here, we assume instead a government whose reform-making power is constrained by the legislature. Thus, the contest-maker in our analysis is the legislative process. Second, although reform enactment is not determined entirely by the government, it has agenda-setting power.==== The government can propose a reform bundle, whose enactment is then decided in congress. If congress votes favorably, the proposed reform is enacted; if not, ==== is maintained. Third, since government and an interest group engage in a legislative contest over the enactment of the proposed reform, both must exert effort to increase their probability of winning. We therefore assume that the effort expended by both sides are activities conducted for the purpose of gaining votes in their favor.==== From the viewpoint of the interest group, lobbying effort comes in the form of campaign contributions, hiring lobbyists, organizing protests and printing newspaper ads and other publicity materials. From the viewpoint of the government, successful reform passage requires effort put into talks and negotiations with legislators, and into trying to nudge public debate in their favor, consequently influencing the constituencies of the legislators who must cast their vote.====Such a setup is well suitable to represent numerous real-world applications, particularly presidential systems and coalition governments where the ruling party does not decide on the policy, but can propose bills that must survive the legislature. As a well known example of government lobbying, during the 111th United States Congress where the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) was introduced, time and effort were spent in negotiations to break the threat of a Republican filibuster. Former U.S. president Barack Obama himself delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress to emphasize his commitment to the reform. Another example of government lobbying is the video released by the Italian government in the spring of 2015 about the highly-controversial and much opposed ==== (The Good School) education reform. The video showed Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi discussing in detail the benefits of his administration’s proposed reform. Other examples can be found in the sociological and political science literature, for instance in the fields of welfare state (Busemeyer and Neimanns, 2017, Häusermann et al., 2019), labor market (Gallego and Marx, 2017) and pension reforms (Milkman et al., 2012).====The strategic compromise and policy bundling resulting from our framework can be empirically analyzed using a newly complied dataset on U.S. state-level education legislation over the period 2008–2013. The advantage of education legislation is that policies can be grouped into two broad categories: access and quality policies, the former being supported, and the latter opposed, by education’s strongest interest group: teachers’ unions. Our model assumes the existence of only one lobby, or more lobbies but with aligned interests, and this fits the case of teacher unions in the US. We focus on the states of California, Illinois and Texas because these three states combined already make up 12 percent of all enacted education legislation during the period, and have a good balance of teachers’ union strength, with Illinois and California having one of the strongest, and Texas having one of the weakest teachers’union in the whole country. We find that stronger opposition induces fewer quality reforms. However, this negative relationship is counteracted when access is bundled together with quality reforms. Our paper contribution to the literature is thus two-fold: first it adds a multidimensional component in the theoretical framework of policy formation under lobby, secondly, our empirical analysis makes use of a newly collected dataset of legislation on education. More in detail, our paper innovates the theoretical literature on this topic by extending the main result of Epstein and Nitzan (2004) to the case of a two-policies space. The concept of “strategic restraint” is extended in a bidimensional polity, in which one of the players (the agenda-setter) proposes a bill not only with a lower level of its own “preferred” policy, but also with a higher level of its “opposed” policy. We show that this proposal is rational and utility maximizing in that it reduces the lobbying effort and it increases the probability of approval. Our paper also innovates the empirical studies, as it uses a novel dataset collected specifically for this purpose. First, we retrieved actual draft of bills on education at all stages of the legislative process (from the proposed to the enacted version) and we classify them according both to the type of intended reforms (access vs quality) and their direction, relying on automated text analysis. Second, we match each bill with its author and the characteristics of the district of election of the authors themselves. Finally, we measure the relative strength of teachers and teachers’ unions in each district. We are therefore able to test the political mechanisms resulting from the theoretical model with data on education reforms in three US States.====The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we review the most relevant literature. In Section 3 we present the basic setup of the model, that we solve and discuss in Section 4. Our empirical results on U.S. state-level education bills are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.","Strategic compromise, policy bundling and interest group power: Theory and evidence on education policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000805,6 September 2022,2022,Research Article,48.0

However, it is not clear if such policy efforts have a feedback effect on political competition. In this paper, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in perceptions of electoral credibility following the introduction of a technology-induced voting reform in India and find significant impacts on political competition. Electronic voting machines in India were mandated to include an additional layer of transparency by the introduction of a Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). We find that with the introduction of VVPAT, the winning margins and vote share of winners decline whereas the number of candidates in the average race increases. The results are robust to ==== concerns arising out of staggered implementation of the program providing support to our identification design. Our results also point to heterogeneous effects of the VVPAT roll-out in constituencies that received it only once relative to those that got the VVPAT in two successive elections. Interestingly, we note that much of the welfare improvement through increased political competition is reversed with more experience, suggesting the presence of important learning effects.","Higher political competition is typically associated with favorable implications for economic efficiency (Albornoz and Cabrales, 2013, Besley et al., 2010, Dash and Mukherjee, 2015, Bierbrauer and Boyer, 2016, Solé-Ollé and Viladecans-Marsal, 2012, Grossman and Helpman, 1996, Sørensen, 2014). Electoral competition, in particular, often raises the bar for politicians who end up making more promises and commit to more deliverables (Walkowitz and Weiss, 2017). However, the way political competition is operationalized in major democracies is often problematic. For instance, there may be a lack of adequate number of candidates commensurate with preferred policy positions of voters (Lizzeri and Persico, 2005); or micro-targeting of campaigns and polarization of electoral outcomes (Prummer, 2020, Galeotti and Mattozzi, 2011); poorer quality of candidates with worse outside options in the labor market (Caselli and Morelli, 2004); use of endogenous political institutions to weaken potential new entrants who could be electoral threats to incumbents (Baskaran and Lopes da Fonseca, 2016) and, perhaps most critically, an increased incidence of electoral fraud (Dawson, 2020, Nyblade and Reed, 2008, Nichter, 2008, Sidorkin and Vorobyev, 2020).====Establishing a causal relationship between political competition and electoral fraud, or conversely credibility of elections, is challenging. This is primarily because political competition and credibility of elections are likely jointly determined. As a result, any standard approach using ordinary least squares estimation is likely to run into reverse causality issues. Dawson (2020) uses ex-ante close elections to estimate the effect of competition on potential electoral fraud. In this paper, we are interested in estimating the reverse; i.e., the impact of making elections more credible on political competition. Understanding this relationship in a causal framework is important given that considerable government efforts are directed towards creating institutions and policies that make electoral processes free, fair and smooth. Aside from the instrumental benefits of having fair elections, an impact on political competition would also imply potential efficiency gains as those discussed above, thus providing a stronger rationale for such policies.====We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in credibility of elections generated by the introduction of a new technology in the voting process in India, which is the world’s largest democracy. Following court verdicts in 2011, the Election Commission of India (ECI), the independent and autonomous body in charge of conducting major elections, introduced a Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) to enhance the reliability of votes recorded in EVMs and counter allegations of voter fraud and tampering. Although, the VVPAT system was experimentally rolled out in 2011, the universal mandate for VVPATs in all EVMs came much later. Using this phased introduction of VVPAT technology in voting and exploiting the temporal variation generated by the pre-determined electoral calendar of India where different sets of states go for elections at different times, we estimate the reduced-form impact of increased credibility of elections on political competition.====We examine outcomes such as winning margins and winners’ vote-shares. Additionally, we study candidate-specific outcomes such as number of individuals choosing to run in a given constituency (equivalent to an electoral district), number of candidates forfeiting their deposits, composition of experienced candidates fielded by political parties etc. The results are noteworthy and ought to serve as a guide to future policy discussions. We find that average winning margins decline with introduction of the VVPAT technology suggesting that enhanced credibility of elections can lead to more competitive elections. We also find that the vote shares of the winner (ex-post) declines and number of candidates contesting in a given constituency increases. This is consistent with the idea that increased political competition implies more candidates are attracted to the race as well as a tighter race for the winner. There is significant heterogeneity in our results driven by past exposure to VVPAT. In general, the results are very different for constituencies that are exposed to VVPAT for the first time compared to those that have prior experience of voting under VVPAT. This suggests presence of some learning effects and that the impact of credibility on competition may be dampened when agents get used to the technology.====Our identification strategy relies on two main sources of exogenous variation. First, the institutional features of the VVPAT program itself, which entailed a phased roll-out of the technology over time. The VVPAT was experimentally introduced in some constituencies initially; before being gradually rolled out in other constituencies across states. This phased rollout provides administratively generated variation in exposure of constituencies to the VVPAT technology. Second, the pre-determined electoral calendar of India implies that states go to elections every 5 years (unless there are exceptional circumstances such as government losing majority in the legislative assembly) and not every state goes to elections at the same time. This provides a natural variation in the timing of elections and consequently in the timing of being exposed to VVPAT technology. Our identifying assumption regarding the counterfactual is that in the absence of VVPAT, the constituencies which were exposed to VVPAT earlier and the constituencies which were exposed later would not have differential trends in outcome variables of our interest, pre- and post-VVPAT implementation. For instance, one of our main outcomes of interest is the winning margins. Our assumption implies that the differences in average winning margins in early VVPAT receivers and late receiver constituencies would not be statistically different over time, in the counterfactual. We conduct robustness checks of our model vis-a-vis the weighting used in standard two-way fixed effects models by using the latest Bacon-decomposition techniques and find that our results do not change (Goodman-Bacon, 2021). This provides support to the validity of our identification strategy and the underlying counterfactual assumption.====The paper contributes to three important strands of literature in political economy and electoral accountability. First, the literature on credibility of elections beginning with voter behavior and voters’ responses to various shocks to electoral credibility (Kamada and Kojima, 2014). While Bush and Prather (2017) show that election observers and their role can shape local beliefs about the credibility of the election process, Fearon (2011) documents the implications of a ==== where choices of governments can determine the incidence of citizen rebellion. From the point of view of candidates, however, the literature has been focussed on policy positions and responses based on accountability and credibility norms (Van Weelden, 2013, Sengupta and Sengupta, 2008, Duggan and Martinelli, 2017, Gagliarducci and Nannicini, 2013) or inducing political participation based on campaigns designed appropriately (Houser et al., 2011). Our paper contributes to a gap in this literature in understanding the direct implications of electoral credibility on political competition.====Second, the paper makes an empirical contribution to a large theoretical literature on political competition. Economists and political scientists over decades have debated on the determinants of candidate entry and the choice of citizens to contest in elections. The classical models of political competition date back to the Hotelling-Downs formulation of competitive markets (Hotelling, 1929, Downs et al., 1957, Osborne, 1995). Later, theoretical developments such as citizen-candidate models endogenized the decision of entry into the electoral race (Osborne and Slivinski, 1996, Besley and Coate, 1997). The basic idea behind such citizen-candidate models is that any citizen can choose to become a candidate by incurring some cost and implement their favorite policy (based on a robust maximization exercise) if elected to office. Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) show that better pay for politicians can attract better quality of candidates and such an idea can perhaps mitigate the problem of adverse selection as suggested by Caselli and Morelli (2004). However, whether targeted administrative efforts at making the electoral process more credible can affect competition or candidate entry has not been well established, to the best of our knowledge.====Third, our paper complements the large literature on the impact of policy-driven changes in the voting process, particularly through technology induced innovations, on political and economic outcomes (Fujiwara, 2015, Ujhelyi et al., 2021, Chatterjee and Kamal, 2021, Baland and Robinson, 2008, Card and Moretti, 2007, Baerlocher and Schneider, 2021). The paper is most closely related to studies set in India which estimate the effects of EVMs on a wide range of outcomes (Desai and Lee, 2021, Debnath et al., 2017). The impacts of electronic voting technology is not India-specific and has also been studied in other developing country contexts, where the marginal value of free and fair elections are usually higher (Fujiwara, 2015). The similarity of the findings provides confidence in the generalizability and external validity of our results.====Interestingly, new literature points out that there could be alternate forms of fraud that emerge as a result of technological innovations to clean up the electoral process. For instance, Schneider (2020) discusses the case of disenfranchisement of poor voters and alternate fraudulent methods such as ==== in Brazil. The VVPAT intervention may be perceived as a potential policy to mitigate some of the threats from these alternative forms of fraud that may emerge with the introduction on electronic voting.====Debnath et al. (2017) find that introduction of EVMs made the electoral process more competitive and winning margins and vote shares of winners reduced. Our results are in line with Debnath et al. (2017), in that, we find that an additional layer of credibility through VVPAT leads to more competition. Desai and Lee (2021) study the impacts of EVMs on incidence of invalid votes and the veracity of electoral outcomes. They also find that EVMs with VVPAT are not necessarily different in terms of their performance compared to non-VVPAT EVMs. This is useful for our empirical methodology as it provides support to our underlying assumption that the variation generated in VVPATs affects electoral outcomes through perceptions of credibility of elections and not through intrinsic differences in the technology of the machines. Along these lines, using data from Brazil, Schneider and Senters (2018) finds that introduction of electronic voting led to a stronger concentration of votes among the leading candidates suggesting a change in the political competition.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides details on the background and institutional context regarding the VVPAT implementation across India. Section 3.1 describes the data and the construction of our key variables. This is followed by the section on the empirical estimation and identification strategy in Section 3.2. Results are presented in Section 4 followed by robustness in Section 5.4.

Workers tend to systematically overpredict their productivity, which lowers the turnover rate (Hoffman and Burks, 2020). CEOs often overestimate the returns on their investment projects, which leads to overinvestment (Malmendier and Tate, 2005). This study contributes to the literature of behavioral political economy (Schnellenbach and Schubert, 2015) by investigating how the political preferences of overconfident people, specifically preferences regarding equality, change when they see a gap between their economic status and their self-evaluations of their ability.====Overconfident people do not actually earn what they think they can, implying that they may be aware of a negative gap between their economic status and their own evaluations of their ability at some point during their lives. As they hold a strongly biased belief about their own ability, they would not attribute this gap to their low ability but rather that their economic status does not appropriately reflect their talent and effort, which implies that society is non-meritocratic and unfair. As such, overconfident people would attribute the negative income-ability gap to the unfairness of the economy, which should in turn increase overconfident people’s support for reducing income inequality. They may also increase the support for government interventions.====While several recent studies emphasize the role of personal economic experiences as a determinant of the view on fairness and preferences for redistribution (e.g., Deffains et al., 2016, Ng and Semenov, 2019, Fehr and Vollmann, 2020, Berthet et al., 2020), the effect of realizing the negative income-ability gap is understudied, despite its prevalence. In particular, there is no experimental evidence outside labs because manipulating actual economic experience is difficult beyond hypothetical situations in the labs.====By running a unique experiment, we explore how realizing the negative income-ability gap changes political preferences in a real economic environment. We conducted an online survey experiment in the US with around 4500 participants. At the beginning of the survey, respondents were asked to disclose their income and self-evaluation of their earning ability, which provided us with their self-perceptions of the income-ability gap. For the majority of the respondents, the self-evaluations of their earning ability were not equal to the location of their income. Furthermore, among such respondents facing the income-ability gap, the majority considered that their income were lower than their earning ability, which we call ====. Then, respondents were randomly assigned to the treatment that emphasizes the income-ability gap constructed by their previous answers.====The unique structure of our survey is that we customized this treatment for each respondent. For example, consider respondents who chose “very high ability” as their self-evaluation and chose “low” as the relative location of their household income. We assigned half of these respondents randomly to the treatment question, which reminds them that their income is low despite their very high ability, and the other half to the control that received no such question. By exploiting this feature of our survey design, we explore the causal effect of realizing the income-ability gap on preferences for reducing inequality. Our interest is in the treatment effect on respondents facing the negative income-ability gap.====We obtained two main results. The first result is on the effect on the perceived degree of unfairness. We found that realizing the negative income-ability gap makes people think that ordinary people earn incomes below their ability. That is, people attribute the negative income-ability gap not to low ability but to the unfairness of the economy.====The second result is on the preferences for reducing income inequality. Due to the aforementioned effect on the view of the unfairness of the economy, we hypothesized that realizing the negative income-ability gap might increase people’s support for income equality. We found that the effect on preferences for income equality was limited. On average, it does not increase the support for reducing income inequality or the support for government intervention. This result indicates that finding out the world is not as one thinks it is does not necessarily influence one’s preferences for equality.====As existing experimental studies show (Alesina et al., 2018, Kuziemko et al., 2015), the effect of information provision on policy preferences for equality could depend on political attitudes such as political ideologies or political trust. Such potential heterogeneity of the treatment effect may have resulted in the null result on the average treatment effect. Taking this possibility into account, we also examined potential heterogeneity. We found that realizing the negative income-ability gap does not change the support for reducing inequality among centrists and right-wing people. On the other hand, we found a suggestive evidence that it enhances the support for reducing inequality among left-wing people, though it is not statistically significant at a conventional cutoff (the ====-value was 0.06). However, even left-wing people did not increase the support for government intervention. In addition, we also examined heterogeneity depending on a political trust level, but we did not find the heterogeneity.====Overall, the results indicate that after realizing the negative income-ability gap, people are more likely to think that society is unfair, but do not necessarily increase support for reducing income inequality. Overconfident people do not actually earn what they think they can, and thus they would be aware of a negative gap between their economic status and their own evaluations of their ability at some point during their lives. Our study shows how realizing this negative income-ability gap influences people’s view on fairness and inequality.==== Whether the causes of inequality are meritocratic significantly affects preferences for reducing inequality (e.g., Alesina and Angeletos, 2005, Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005, Krawczyk, 2010, McCoy and Major, 2007). Thus, it is important to explore the conditions under which people change their understanding of the meritocratic or non-meritocratic causes of inequality. As a determinant of beliefs on the causes of inequality, several recent studies emphasize individual economic experiences such as individual economic success and failure (e.g., Deffains et al., 2016, Ng and Semenov, 2019, Fehr and Vollmann, 2020, Berthet et al., 2020). We contribute to this strand of the literature by showing the novel interplay between overconfidence and the individual income-ability gap.====The most closely related study to ours is Ng and Semenov (2019), who also analyzed the role of overconfidence.==== Specifically, they conducted a lab experiment in which they assigned income to participants randomly based on task performance and chance, where the degree to which income depends on task performance was uncertain. Overconfident participants overestimated their task performance, and thus after receiving low income, believed that economic system in the lab was not based on task performance. Consequently, even without self-interested motivations, overconfident participants chose more redistribution when they experienced failure. The novelty of our study is that we test the theory not in an artificial context of lab experiments but in a real economic environment using respondents’ real incomes. Our results differ from theirs in an important way. We find that realizing the negative income-ability gap does not necessarily promote support for reducing inequality in a real economic context.","Overconfidence, income-ability gap, and preferences for income equality",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000775,28 August 2022,2022,Research Article,50.0

This legislator can face competition from additionally elected competitors to the Bundestag from precisely the same constituency. The existence of several legislators per constituency allows voters to benchmark their quality against each other. We analyze the causal impact of having more elected competitors from the same constituency on legislators’ personal success versus the success of their parties. Our data cover the legislative terms in the German Bundestag and federal elections in the period 1953–2021. In our analysis, we rely on exogenous variation in elected competitors by investigating changes induced by legislators who leave the Bundestag during the legislative period and their respective replacement candidates as ====. We find that legislators are less successful in elections when they are exposed to elected competitors from the same constituency. The results suggest that benchmarking possibilities are relevant for voters to evaluate their representatives.","Elections are a crucial mechanism in democracies to hold politicians accountable. Incumbent politicians’ reelection constraints are more binding if they are active in a politically competitive environment and if voters are well informed about their performance (e.g., Ferraz and Finan 2011; Ashworth 2012). In this paper, we ask the question of how being exposed to ==== competitors from the same constituency affects electoral success of legislators. Relying on parliamentary and electoral data from 1953 to 2021 for the German Bundestag (federal parliament), we find that legislators are evaluated less favorably by voters when they have more elected competitors from their constituency. We provide evidence that is consistent with the idea that the existence of more than one elected legislator per constituency makes it easier for voters to assess the quality of their representatives by benchmarking them.====Due to the two electoral tiers of the mixed-electoral system employed in German federal elections, candidates have two options to obtain a mandate: (1) They can obtain a direct mandate in one of the local constituencies by winning the plurality of votes. Alternatively, (2) they can obtain a mandate through a closed state party list. One-half of the statutory size of the Bundestag encompasses legislators elected in the constituencies, and the other half stems from the state party lists allocated by proportional rule. Dual candidacies are allowed, that is, candidates usually run for election in both electoral tiers. Thus, if candidates lose in the direct election in their constituency, they still have a chance to enter the Bundestag via the state party list. While every constituency is represented by exactly one directly elected legislator, it is possible that defeated direct candidates can be mandated additionally to the Bundestag through the party lists depending on their party list positions. The electoral system thereby generates differences in the representation of constituencies in the Bundestag and it induces observable differences in the level of competition from ==== competitors within constituencies (Maaser and Stratmann 2016; Frank and Stadelmann 2021a).====Elected competitors from the same constituency may serve as benchmarks against which voters can compare and evaluate their legislators (Frank and Stadelmann 2021b). Benchmarking can provide valuable information to voters: If legislators run again in the election, voters are better able to assess their dedication and quality, which can result, ceteris paribus, in more adverse conditions to being electorally successful (e.g., see Ferraz and Finan 2008; Ashworth 2012; Costas-Pérez et al., 2012; Chong et al., 2015). Legislators without elected competitors instead may profit electorally if there are no benchmarking possibilities for voters.====To analyze the effect of exposure to elected competitors on electoral success, we compile competition data for all German legislators from 1953 to 2021. Conditional on them running at least twice, we investigate the impact of elected competition on their electoral outcomes. We analyze a sample of 7507 observations in 18 federal elections.====The panel data structure allows us to employ a legislator-specific fixed effects strategy in a first step, that is, we compare the electoral success of the same legislator in campaigns with elected competitors to campaigns when the legislator faces no elected competitors. Our fixed effects strategy helps to alleviate omitted variable bias concerns. It does, however, not enable us to account for all potentially time-variant (unobservable) variables, such as changes in a politician's valence, popularity, or political networks which may correlate with both competition and electoral success. Thus, we also employ an instrumental variables strategy. Our instrument leverages a peculiar feature of the electoral system: During a legislative period, it happens that legislators resign their mandate (one in 15 legislators drops out of parliament before the term ends). The most common reasons are death or the acceptance of another office or mandate. There are no by-elections. Instead, the first not yet elected candidate from the closed state party list who is in most instances an unsuccessful direct candidate from another constituency receives the replacement mandate. Consequently, the resignations of legislators lead to changes in the number of representatives and, hence, changes in competition in ==== constituencies. First, competition decreases in the constituency where the withdrawing legislator originated from. Second, competition increases in the constituency of the replacement candidate. The reasons for resignation and the rule-based replacement mechanism should be orthogonal to the characteristics of other legislators representing the two affected constituencies, which qualifies both changes to be used as instruments for elected competition.====Our empirical results show that legislators are less successful when they are exposed to other elected competitors from their constituency. This effect is comparatively large and statistically robust with respect to different specifications for competition, instrument use, and various subtleties that party politics might imply. With regard to mechanisms, we discuss potential channels that may explain the impact of exposure to elected competitors on electoral success and provide indicative evidence in favor of benchmarking: Having elected competitors from the same constituency is more detrimental to legislators when they are from an ideologically close party, in more recent legislative terms characterized by converging positions of the major parties and when the elected competitors are relatively more competent.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 explains the German electoral system and outlines how competition is linked to individual electoral success through benchmarking.

From the early 2000s, the EU introduced a series of directives to prevent a race to the bottom in asylum policies and to harmonise policy between destination countries, but the results have not been fully assessed. In this paper I examine the determinants of recognition rates for asylum applicants from 65 origin countries to 20 European destinations from 2003 to 2017. The outcomes of the EU directives have been mixed, but taken together they are associated with increased recognition rates. These made a modest contribution to the trend increase in recognition rates, most of which is due to increased political terror and human rights repression in origin countries. But differences between European countries remain large, even after accounting for origin-country composition and for differences in the adoption of EU directives. Some of this may be accounted for by differences in bureaucratic frameworks through which policy is administered.","In the last two decades Europe has witnessed the arrival of mounting numbers of people seeking refuge from persecution and applying for recognition as refugees. With the exception of the crisis years 2015–16, more than half of asylum claims lodged in Europe have been rejected. Individual countries have faced political pressures to reduce the inflows by imposing strict rules. Since the early 2000s the European Union has been developing a Common European Asylum System (CEAS), most prominently in the form of a series of directives, which were subsequently transposed into national legislation. The two most important directives relate to the criteria for granting refugee status and to the procedures used in assessing asylum claims. These aimed to protect the rights of refugees and also to harmonise policy across European countries in order to mitigate the so-called asylum lottery. In the presence of other influences on recognition rates, such as the increase in the spread and intensity of persecution in origin countries, it remains unclear how far these goals have been achieved.====I focus on the transposition and implementation at the national level of the Qualification Directive (2004) and the Procedures Directive (2005) and their recast versions of 2011 and 2013 respectively. These are examined using a panel of recognition rates for 20 European destination countries of applicants from 65 origin countries over the years relevant to the policy reforms, 2003 to 2017. Exploiting the differential timing of the implementation of these directives I find that recognition rates are negatively associated with implementation of the Qualification Directive, but positively associated with its recast version. In contrast, the associations are positive for the implementation of the Procedures Directive, but negative for its recast version. The same pattern emerges when using different methods of controlling for violence, persecution and human rights abuse in origin countries and when controlling for other policy-related variables in destination countries. These mixed results differ somewhat from those implied by the qualitative literature, but taken together, the net effect of the directives is positive.====Contrary to prevailing impressions, average recognition rates have been increasing, and not only in the migration crisis of 2015–16. The evidence suggests that this was mainly due to increased political terror and deteriorating civil rights in origin countries. But policy reforms introduced by the EU directives also contributed to the upward trend despite pressures to impose ever more restrictive policies. However, there remain large differences in recognition rates between destination countries. Even after accounting for differences in the implementation of directives and the origin-country composition of asylum applications, there has been little convergence. The evidence suggests that these persistent differences, sometimes characterised as an ‘asylum lottery’, are influenced in part by the diversity of administrative arrangements through which policy is delivered. This in turn supports the argument for a Europe-wide integrated asylum system.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the following sections I outline the trends in, and composition of, asylum applications and recognition rates and provide an outline of policy developments with a focus on EU directives. A summary of previous research findings is followed by a discussion of estimation and data issues. The next sections focus on conditions in origin countries, the influence of EU directives, contributions to trends over time and differences between destination countries.

Using the gravity model, we find evidence of a negative assortative matching in ==== with respect to corruption. We find that corruption in a country is negatively associated with trade flows from high-corrupt countries and is positively associated with trade volume from signatories of the OECD convention. Our results suggest that future studies on this topic should consider controlling for institutional dissimilarities between the trading partners as it has implications for bilateral trade costs.","The negative effects of corruption on several outcomes, such as investment and economic growth (Aidt et al., 2008; Gründler and Potrafke, 2019; Mauro, 1995), sustainable development (Aidt, 2009), foreign direct investment (FDI) (Cuervo-Cazurra, 2006; Habib and Zurawicki, 2002; Wei, 2000), and financial development (Cooray and Schneider, 2018), are well-documented. While several studies have investigated the effect of corruption on international trade (Anderson and Marcouiller, 2002; De Jong and Bogmans, 2011; Dutt and Traca, 2010; Lambsdorff, 1998; Musila and Sigue, 2010), the impact of corruption on the composition of a country's trading partners has not been studied. We investigate whether the level of corruption in a country influences the composition of its trading partners. This is plausible because corruption in a country is likely to impose asymmetric costs on its trading partners, depending on their characteristics. Accordingly, we focus on two such characteristics: (1) the level of corruption in the trading partner, and (2) the trading partner's membership status in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (henceforth, the OECD Convention). The focus on the OECD Convention is due to the fact that it requires member countries to declare international bribery illegal and take action to combat the prevalence of international bribery (discussed in detail later in the text).====The focus on the level of corruption in the trading partner is motivated by the literature on assortative matching. In a seminal paper, Becker (1973) introduces the theory of assortative mating – positive and negative – in a theory of marriage. In a positive assortative matching, two individuals or groups with similar characteristics form an alliance. If on the other hand, an alliance is formed by two individuals or groups with opposite characteristics, it is known as negative assortative matching. This theory has since then been applied to several contexts including international trade.==== To the best of our knowledge, no study has been undertaken on assortative matching in international trade with respect to corruption. The present paper fills this gap in the literature by investigating whether there exists a positive or negative assortative matching in international trade with regard to corruption. We argue that a country's level of corruption does not only impact its volume of bilateral trade, but also the composition of its trading partners because it imposes heterogeneous costs on different trading partners depending on their aforementioned two characteristics.==== Consequently, a change in the level of corruption in a country is likely to impact bilateral trade flows from some trading partners more than others, depending on their level of corruption, resulting in a change in the composition of its trading partners. Therefore, we investigate whether the level of corruption in a country determines its volume of trade with different trading partners based on the level of corruption that exists in the latter. In other words, we seek to answer the following question: Do high-corrupt countries trade more or less with one another?====A second issue that we investigate is whether the level of corruption in a country impacts its trade flows with members of the OECD convention differently to that of non-members and thereby the composition of trading partners. This is plausible because by requiring members to take action against bribery overseas, the OECD convention affects member countries’ ability to deal with corruption in trading partner countries. As a result, changes in the level of corruption in a country can impose different costs on members of the OECD convention compared to non-members, causing an asymmetric effect on the volume of bilateral trade from different countries, depending on whether or not they are signatory to the OECD convention. Therefore, as the level of corruption in a country changes, the composition of its trading partners (member versus non-members of the OECD convention) could change. To explore whether this is the case, we examine if corruption in a country plays a role in determining the volume of trade flows from different trading partners, depending on their membership in the OECD Convention.====The most important contribution of our study is that this is the first to shed light on how corruption in the importing country affects the composition of its trading partners. While some earlier studies have controlled for the level of corruption in the importing country (====, Lambsdorff, 1998), and others have argued that corruption levels in both importing and exporting countries affect the cost of trade (====, Musila and Sigue, 2010), existing studies have not looked at the interaction effect in which the level of corruption in a country plays a role in determining whether it attracts more trade flows from high-corrupt or low-corrupt countries. The second important contribution of our study is to provide further insights into the effects of anti-bribery laws in international transactions on the volume of trade by providing evidence that the effects of such laws depend on the trading partner's level of corruption. The current literature reports that by making international bribery illegal and subject to legal sanctions, such laws (for instance, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), 1977 and the OECD Convention, 1997) make engaging in international bribery more costly, affecting various outcomes related to businesses overseas (see, for instance, Geo-Jala and Mangum, 2000; Cuervo-Cazurra, 2006, 2008; Dass et al., 2020).====We investigate these two hypotheses using a large dataset from the Centre d'Etude Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales (CEPII) on bilateral trade flows covering 193 UN member countries over 1996–2014. We perform a number of robustness checks to ensure the validity of our results and the reliability of our estimates. First, we utilize different estimation techniques including the pooled OLS and the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood method (PPML). Second, we control for a number of factors to minimize the possibility of an omitted variable bias. Third, we check the robustness of our results using an alternative specification to capture institutional dissimilarities, using alternative corruption indices and high-dimensional fixed effects. Finally, we check the sensitivity of our results by using an alternative trade data source – the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), which allows us to exclude fuel-related trade to ensure that our results are not driven by, and are not contingent on, trade involving fuel.====We find evidence in support of a negative assortative matching in international trade. We find that as corruption levels in a country increase, the volume of trade from high-corrupt countries decreases. Further, we find that as a country becomes more corrupt, it receives more trade flows from the members of the OECD convention relative to the non-members. Our results also indicate that countries that are signatory to the OECD Convention generate more trade flows than non-signatory countries. Further, consistent with the findings of previous studies (for instance, Musila and Sigue (2010)), we find that the levels of corruption in both importing and exporting countries have negative impacts on trade. Our study thus provides important insights into the effect of corruption on the composition of a country's trading partners that have been absent from the literature until now. Another important implication of our study is that it could shed light on why there is a lack of unanimous evidence on the effect of corruption on trade flows (see, for instance, Lambsdorff (1998) versus Musila and Sigue (2010)). The findings of our study clearly demonstrate that not only corruption in the exporting and importing countries matter for bilateral trade (Musila and Sigue, 2010) but the levels of corruption in the two countries also jointly influence the volume of trade. Our results suggest that institutional dissimilarities between two trading partners have implications for bilateral trade costs and their omission could be one of the sources of specification bias. Therefore, future empirical studies on bilateral trade flows, especially those focusing on the role of governance and institutions, should control for the interaction effect of corruption or their distance to proxy for trade costs arising out of institutional dissimilarities.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we discuss the related literature and present the theoretical foundations for the hypothesis by placing it within the larger literature on corruption and trade. Next, we present the empirical methodology and discuss the control variables and data sources in section 3. We go on to present the results in section 4, and the final section concludes with implications highlighting the significance of our findings.",Corruption and assortative matching of partners in international trade,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000738,13 August 2022,2022,Research Article,55.0

Although there is a consensus that IMF-supported programs can have a direct effect on the labor market of recipient countries, it remains unclear how IMF participation decision and ==== attached to IMF loans can affect the unemployment rate of borrowing countries. Using a world sample of countries from 1980 to 2014, we investigate how lending conditional programs of the IMF affect the unemployment rate. Our analyses account for the selection bias related to, first, the IMF participation decision and, second, the conditions included within the program. We show that IMF program participation significantly increases the unemployment rate of recipient countries. Once we control for the number of conditions, however, we find that only IMF conditions have a detrimental and highly significant effect on the unemployment rate. There is evidence that the adverse short-run effect of IMF conditions holds robust in the long-run. Disaggregating IMF conditionality by issue area, we find adverse effects on the unemployment rate for four policy areas: ====, reforms requiring privatization of state-owned enterprises, external sector reforms stipulating trade and capital account liberalization, and fiscal policy reforms that restrain ====. Our initial results are found to be robust across alternative empirical specifications.","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has become an almost universal financial institution, with its membership rising from 44 states in 1946 to 190 at present. The basic conception of the IMF's role is to uphold global financial stability, and it is often considered as the “crisis manager” for developing and developed countries. With its loan programs the IMF promoted policy reforms, such as the privatization of state-owned enterprises, trade and financial liberalization, economic deregulation, social policy, labor market reforms, and ‘good governance’, able to restructure the domestic economy of borrowing countries (Kentikelenis et al., 2016). Previous studies highlight that IMF loan programs can have multi-level effects on borrowing countries, including their growth rates (Barro and Lee, 2005; Dreher, 2006), poverty and income inequality (Oberdabernig, 2013; Forster et al., 2019; Lang, 2021; Stubbs et al., 2021; Chletsos and Sintos, 2022), labor rights (Lloyd and Weissman, 2002; Reinsberg et al., 2019), tax revenue (Crivelli and Gupta, 2016; Reinsberg et al., 2020), public spending (Rickard and Caraway, 2019) and health outcomes (Forster et al., 2020).====A strand of literature highlights the impact of international financial institutions (IFIs) on labor (Blanton et al., 2015; Martin and Brady, 2007; Nooruddin and Vreeland, 2010; Vreeland, 2002). Previous work points out that these organizations have notoriously sought to increase the “flexibility” of labor markets – that is, increasing employers' ease in hiring, firing, or setting working hours (Burgess, 2010, p.202) – in borrowing countries, with the promise of future economic growth. Furthermore, previous studies examine the link between IMF programs and labor rights. While Abouharb and Cingranelli (2007) and Blanton et al. (2015) conclude that IMF programs significantly reduce both individual and collective labor rights, Reinsberg et al. (2019) demonstrate that collective labor rights increase in the wake of IMF programs. In this context, studies also examine the effects of IMF program on the public sector. Research results on the effects of IMF loans on public spending are mixed and depend on the sample used and estimated procedure (e.g. Bulír and Moon, 2006; Clements et al., 2013; Kentikelenis et al., 2015; Nooruddin and Simmons, 2006; Nooruddin and Vreeland, 2010). More specific results are reported in Rickard and Caraway (2019), who find that the implementation of reforms related to the public sector to a country's IMF program reduces government spending on the public sector wage bill. Li et al. (2015) point out that IMF policy reforms often lead to an inactive business investment, poorer government service, severe social instability, and a higher unemployment rate – all of which may damage the economic development of bailed-out countries in the long term. The IMF also promotes policies to reduce external and domestic arrears by imposing restrictions on available sources of credit (Kentikelenis et al., 2016). These monetary and debt measures typically lead to higher interest rates, increasing the cost of borrowing and making it more expensive for businesses to expand (Beck et al., 2008; Chletsos and Sintos, 2021a; Marques et al., 2017), which in turn may affect the creation and destruction of private sector jobs. Moreover, previous research documents that IMF conditionality has adverse effects on a range of labor related indicators, including employment levels, wages and employment protection policies (Lloyd and Weissman, 2002; Blanton et al., 2015). Pastor (1987) and Vreeland (2002) empirically investigate the impact of IMF programs on the labor share of income and show that IMF programs are linked to a decline in labor's share of income. In addition, Ohanyan and Androniceanu (2017) show that IMF participation decreases the level of employment using a combination of propensity score matching with the differences-in-differences estimator for the EU-28 between 1993 and 2013. Arguably, the IMF through its policy reforms can alter the underlying structure of an economy, including the labor market (Reinsberg et al., 2019; Chletsos and Sintos, 2021b). Therefore, we focus our attention on labor market issues, and specifically on the level of unemployment.====Should we care about unemployment? During the last century, unemployment has been considered one of the most important factors behind the rise in poverty (e.g. Corcoran and Hill, 1980; Osinubi, 2005; Saunders, 1990). Furthermore, the level of unemployment is linked to various health outcomes. An increased level of unemployment is associated with several mental health issues, such as mixed symptoms of distress, depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, subjective well-being, and self-esteem (e.g. Backhans and Hemmingsson, 2012; Björklund and Eriksson, 1998; McKee-Ryan et al., 2005; Paul and Moser, 2009). There is also evidence that unemployment increases mortality rates and suicidal behavior (e.g. Córdoba-Doña et al., 2014; Gerdtham and Johannesson, 2003; Lundin et al., 2010; Platt, 1984). Moreover, previous research points out that unemployment increases alcohol consumption and drug use (Henkel, 2011). In addition, several studies show that there is a causal positive relationship between unemployment and both property and violent crime (Lee and Holoviak, 2006; Lin, 2008; Papps and Winkelmann, 2000; Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001). All of these suggest that unemployment is damaging for those who experience it.====In this paper, we explore the influence of IMF programs on the unemployment rate. In exchange for low-cost financing, the IMF requires governments to implement a set of reforms, known as conditionalities (Dreher, 2009). IMF's structural adjustment involves a series of reforms in sensitive policy areas, such as privatization of state-owned enterprises, trade and financial liberalization, economic deregulation, social policy, labor market reforms, and ‘good governance’ (Kentikelenis et al., 2016). These required structural adjustments designed by the IMF to its borrowers can affect the labor market and in turn the unemployment rate of recipient countries. Our study follows the recent strand of the literature (e.g. Forster et al., 2019; Kern et al., 2019; Reinsberg et al., 2021; Stubbs et al., 2020), by investigating both the effect of IMF program participation and conditionality. Most studies treat IMF programs as homogenous (e.g. they include only a binary indicator to capture IMF program participation) and are therefore unable to distinguish specific pathways via which IMF programs affect the outcome of interest. Moreover, to account for the endogeneity bias related to the IMF participation decision and the conditions attached to IMF loans, we follow a recently developed econometric technique (Stubbs et al., 2020), by estimating a system of three equations including instrumental variables via maximum likelihood and allowing for correlated errors across equations (Roodman, 2011).====To account for the aforementioned challenges, this study meticulously assesses the impact of IMF loan programs (conditional on their mandated policy reforms) on the unemployment rate using annually compiled panel data for a world sample of countries between 1980 and 2014. Our baseline findings show that IMF program participation significantly increases the unemployment rate of recipient countries. Once we control for the number of conditions, however, we find that only IMF conditions have a detrimental and highly significant effect on the unemployment rate. In addition, we show that IMF conditions have detrimental long-term implications for the unemployment rate. A more detailed analysis identifies adverse effects on the unemployment rate for four policy areas: labor market deregulation, reforms requiring privatization of state-owned enterprises, external sector reforms stipulating trade and capital account liberalization, and fiscal policy reforms that restrain government expenditure. Our initial results are robust across various specifications.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the potential pathways through which IMF programs affect the unemployment rate. In Section 3, we discuss the relationship between IMF programs, labor market institutions, and unemployment. Section 4 analyzes our data and the empirical methodology used. Section 5 reports the results.

Five-decades of declining fertility and increasing life expectancy rates have led to significant demographic change and shifts in the age structure of the population.==== Moreover, fertility trends are expected to worsen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.====The financial pressure that aging places on pay-as-you-go pension systems and other social protection programs as more individuals enter retirement has been documented widely in the economics literature. Family support policies and childcare subsidies are often used as a policy instrument to raise the total fertility rate by reducing the cost of child rearing, as well as increasing female participation in the labor force. Yet despite persistently low fertility rates, public expenditure on childcare subsidies in Italy remains below similar high-income European countries. For example, Italy spends 16 percent less on early childcare than the EU average, while countries of similar economic activity such as Germany and France spend 20 to 53 percent more, respectively. Meanwhile, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and Iceland spend over twice the EU average (see Fig. 1).====Aging can influence publicly provided financial support for children and families by changing the age composition of the voting electorate and voting preferences over childcare policies. If older populations provide less support for policies in favor of fertility, it can lead a low-fertility country into a ‘trap’ of aging and low-fertility.==== Childcare subsidies are aimed at younger cohorts of the population who benefit from reduced childcare costs. Older cohorts may oppose them since they receive no direct benefits and are faced with a higher degree of income taxation. However, to the extent that childcare subsides impact fertility decisions and lead to population growth, indirect effects coming through changes in prices, taxation and pension outcomes can impact all population subgroups.====Aggregate data across OECD countries reveal a positive correlation between aggregate family benefits as a fraction of GDP and the long run fertility rate (Fig. 2).==== Among European countries over the last decade, family benefits are negatively correlated with the share of the elderly population aged 65 and over (Fig. 3) and changes in the mean age of women at first birth (Fig. 4). For Western European countries, these correlations are even stronger. They suggest that, on average, countries with an older population provide less support to families with children which in turn is associated with a higher increase of women’s age at first birth and lower fertility rates.====In this study, we aim to investigate one explanation behind these observations that highlights the link between political support for publicly financing childcare programs and the age structure of the voting electorate, and how voting choices over childcare policies are determined in an economy with an aging population. We build a computable general equilibrium overlapping generations model with endogenous and age dependent fertility decisions in which childcare subsidies defray the cost associated with raising children. We assume that parents care about having children and they are viewed as a normal good in the utility function. Data from the Italian economy is used to parametrize the model and replicate closely the aging demographics of the Italian population. The model is used to estimate equilibrium outcomes and the welfare impact of increasing childcare subsidies that are financed by using a mix of taxes on labor and capital income and varying pension contribution rates. Agents of different cohorts vote with commitment on preferred policies while accounting for both direct and indirect general equilibrium effects of policy choices. We estimate a probabilistic voting model that is used to measure voting outcomes over a range of childcare subsidies and tax policies used to finance them.====Our findings indicate that, in the long run, childcare subsidies are welfare improving. They also have a positive impact on total fertility by prompting younger and more fertile cohorts to have more children. We find that a 10 percent increase in the level of childcare subsidies, can increase the population growth rate by an average of 0.47–0.70 percentage points. The size of welfare gains depends on the financing method and type of redistribution that takes place across generations. We find that welfare gains are larger when childcare subsidies are financed by a combination of an increase in labor or capital taxation and a reduction of the pension contribution rate. However, we also find that, regardless of the tax mix used for financing, the majority of the voting electorate does not support childcare subsidies.====Our paper is related to an earlier literature that examines the effects of family and childcare policies on population growth in both partial and general equilibrium models with endogenous fertility (see for example Reijnders, 2018, Miyazawa, 2016, Fanti and Gori, 2012, Hashimoto and Tabata, 2010, Day and Dowrick, 2010, Apps and Rees, 2004).==== Findings indicate that aggregate outcomes of increasing child subsidies can vary, but the overall impact on fertility is positive. A subset of these studies (for example Yasuoka and Goto, 2011, Van Groezen et al., 2003) investigates fertility outcomes of childcare transfers in the context of pay-as-you-go pension systems and explores issues around their sustainability and financing.====. However, the bulk of this literature consists of theoretical two or three period models that are typically not suitable for quantitative analysis.====Our research contributes to a recent quantitative macroeconomics literature that examines the impact of childcare related programs in heterogeneous agent frameworks. One dimension of this literature looks at the labor force outcomes of female workers and shows that costs associated with child-rearing are an important determinant of the labor supply of married women (Attanasio et al., 2008, Hannusch, 2018). Expanding childcare subsidies has positive effects on female labor supply (Bick, 2016), can be welfare improving and an efficient policy (Domeij and Klein, 2013, Ho and Pavoni, 2020). Another dimension of this literature explores fertility outcomes and shows that higher childcare subsidies both in the form of transfers and subsidizing childcare can increase fertility, e.g. Fehr and Ujhelyiova (2013). Studies that look at the macroeconomic effects of childcare transfers find positive long run economic growth and welfare gains, particularly when combined with public pension reform (Okamoto, 2020, Oguro et al., 2011). Guner et al. (2020) also examine the macroeconomic outcomes of transfers to households with children in a life-cycle model with a high level of heterogeneity, although they abstain from modeling endogenous fertility. The expansion of existing US child benefit programs is found to have a positive impact on female labor supply and welfare gains for young households.====Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we analyze the effects of childcare subsidies by looking at a life-cycle model that explicitly considers age-dependent fertility choices. This framework allows us to study the fertility consequences of interactions between a mix of childcare subsidies and various income tax policies. Secondly, we use a probabilistic voting system to estimate political support for child subsidies among voters of different age groups in an economy with aging demographics that match statistics of the Italian population. Age matters because it determines the stage along the life-cycle of an individual and therefore their labor productivity, propensity to save and future planning horizon. An expansion of childcare subsidies can give rise to an intergenerational conflict because of the differential impact of these transfers on voting members of the economy.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the model economy, its stationary equilibrium and the political process. It also provides a discussion of parameter values and the model calibration. The results of our policy experiments are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 concludes with a discussion of our findings.

Our objective is to evaluate their respective role in the evolution of public personnel expenditures at the municipal level, in a context where local politics comes into play. We consider a large panel dataset of municipalities embedded in IMC structures between 2011 and 2018. Our main results, obtained using an original identification strategy, are threefold. We first find evidence that a substitution effect between municipal and IMC personnel expenditures is at work. Second, we find a partisan distorsion through the grant allocation: despite its formula-based definition, aligned and unaligned municipalities are treated differently by the central government. Third, we show that cuts in grants lead to cuts in municipalities’ public wage bills, while partisanship hinders such cuts.","We study French municipalities’ public personnel expenditures to address the issue of the local public sector size. France has witnessed an increasing trend in the local public expenditures, as the result of the soft budget constraint falling on its municipalities. We choose to focus on two channels used by French authorities to limit this expansion. More precisely, French authorities have fostered inter-municipal cooperation (IMC) since the early 1990s and recently decided cuts in the grants received by municipalities. Our objective is to evaluate their respective role in the evolution of public personnel expenditures at the municipal level. However, French authorities good intentions are bedeviled by local politics. The attempt to put the brakes on this increase in spending is compromised by mayors’ opportunistic and partisan behavior and strategic use of transfers by the central government.====French municipalities constitute a good laboratory for the study of this issue for different reasons. First, we concentrate on a category of current expenditures: local public personnel expenditures which have received little attention, though in France as in many other countries, an important fraction of the population works in the local public sector. Second, as in many European countries, IMC has been promoted in order to rationalize local public expenditures. The institutional change brought by the 2010 Act that forced municipalities to join an IMC structure by 2014 gave rise to interdependent local public decisions. Members of these consolidated structures choose, for instance, the scope of public services to deliver at the municipal and IMC levels. The gradual set up of IMC, reinforced by the 2015 Act, results in an entangledness==== raising the issue of the public sector size with overlapping jurisdictions. The effect of this overlapping is ambiguous as it might either lead to an expansion for re-election purposes and other rent-seeking motives, or a contraction, reflecting a rationalization of the expenses. Third, the increase in current expenditures at the municipal level has become unsustainable for public finances and the rise in personnel expenditures is a major concern for French central government. Under the pressure of the EU Stability and Growth Pact, French authorities are compelled to contain the evolution of spendings and, without constitutional fiscal or budgetary binding rules, they are led to adopt other restrictive measures. Since 2014 municipalities have been required to participate in the recovery of public finances, hereafter CRFP,==== which consists in a planned reduction in the central grant from 2014 to 2017. As the grant is an important share of the municipalities’ resources, it is likely to play a key role in the evolution of expenditures. Local politics however blurs the outcomes.====With a dataset of 2527 municipalities over the recent period 2011–2018, we use a panel fixed effects model and adopt an IV method to identify the causal effects of both the grant and the IMC wage bill on the municipal wage bill. We apply an identification strategy taken from the empirical industrial organization literature to local public finance. The idea is to build instruments that get rid of local unobservable factors by exploiting the environment of municipalities and IMCs. In short, for a given municipality (resp. IMC body), we look at those municipalities (resp. IMCs) which are comparable in terms of the characteristics relevant for the provision of local public services and compute the average grant (resp. average IMC wage bill) on these comparable neighbors. Below, we provide arguments justifying that our instruments are appropriate, i.e., that the exogeneity and relevance conditions are met. Our approach therefore departs from spatial econometrics as we do not define the neighborhood according to geographical distance and do not use a spatial autoregressive model, thereby avoiding the spatial/lag IVs simultaneity concerns (Gibbons and Overman, 2012).====We first show that municipalities do not take advantage of their IMC body to grow. A substitution effect==== is operating between the two tiers. When an IMC body increases its wage bill, e.g. as a result of the increased competencies transferred by a municipality member, the latter decreases its own wage bill. This suggests that it would take more transfers of competencies to the IMC level to limit the municipal expenditures. This should however be interpreted with caution, owing to the magnitude of the personnel transfers.==== Our result does not allow us to invalidate the hypothesis of a natural expansion of the public sector size (the Leviathan hypothesis) as, while the municipal wage bill decreases when the IMC wage bill increases, we do not know which of the two opposite effects dominates.====The objective of disciplining the Leviathan has led countries to adopt different strategies from institutional rules such as election rules to constitutional binding budgetary dispositions. In France the cut in the central grant has been used to curb the trend of increasing expenses, notwithstanding the absence of any budgetary rule. We find a positive grant-elasticity==== of the municipal wage bill meaning that the planned decrease in grant, which started in 2014, did trigger a decline in public wage bills, all other things being equal. However municipalities executives resisted, as the grant-elasticity is smaller==== after than before the reform, thereby altering the efficiency of the cuts in grant.====As mayors have their own agenda, we provide evidence of opportunistic effects on public wage bills: close to a municipal election, data show a spike in public wage bills. Pure partisan and alignment effects might also occur. As a matter of facts, municipalities governed by a right-wing executive spend less, and this ideology-based effect is enhanced when the mayor’s margin of victory is larger. Moreover, we actually find a partisan distorsion in the grant allocation: despite its formula-based definition, municipalities aligned with the central government and those which are unaligned are treated differently. As a consequence, the effort in downsizing is antagonized by the mayors’ partisanship: the wage bill decreases as the grant decreases for all municipalities, but those from the left-wing decrease theirs less.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the studies close to our work. Section 3 gives institutional facts related to French municipalities and their IMC bodies.

For that, we analyze a dynamic model of opinion exchange in which individuals have imperfect information about the true state of the world and exhibit bounded rationality. Key to the analysis is the presence of internet bots: agents in the network that spread fake news (e.g., a constant flow of biased information). We characterize how agents’ opinions evolve over time and evaluate the determinants of long-run misinformation and polarization in the network. To that end, we construct a synthetic network calibrated to Twitter and simulate the information exchange process over a long horizon to quantify the bots’ ability to spread fake news. A key insight is that significant misinformation and polarization arise in networks in which only 15% of agents believe fake news to be true, indicating that network externality effects are quantitatively important. Higher bot centrality typically increases polarization and lowers misinformation. When one bot is more influential than the other (asymmetric centrality), polarization is reduced but misinformation grows, as opinions become closer the more influential bot’s preferred point. Finally, we show that threshold rules tend to reduce polarization and misinformation. This is because, as long as agents also have access to unbiased sources of information, threshold rules actually limit the influence of bots.","In the last decade, the United States has become more polarized than ever. A recent survey conducted by The Pew Research Center indicates that Republicans and Democrats are further apart ideologically than at any point since 1994 (see Fig. 1 Fig. 2).====Traditional theories in economics and political science typically model disagreement as arising from one of two sources: (i) differences in preferences and (ii) informational frictions. In the first case, agents may disagree on the optimal level of a given policy because they benefit differently from it. This happens when their income or wealth levels are different (such as in the case of redistributive policies) or when they have different preferences over public goods (e.g. defense vs education or health-care, etc.). In the case of informational frictions, there may exist an optimal action, but society may not know exactly what it is. Examples are the need for environmental policy, mandatory vaccination, unconventional monetary policy, or simply choosing one political candidate over another. Individuals may learn about the desirability of the policy (or political candidate choice) by acquiring information. But to the extent that they are exposed to biased sources of information, their beliefs may differ at the time in which decisions must be taken.====There is a large literature trying to explain how slanted news and media bias may affect voters’ opinions by generating misinformation and exacerbating polarization (see DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) or (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017)). While this literature has been mostly focused on traditional media, such as newspapers, radio, and cable TV – broadly covered under the umbrella of ‘broadcasting’ – recent interest has shifted towards social media. There are several reasons for this shift. First, because individuals are increasingly obtaining information from social media networks. According to a 2021 study by the Pew Research Center, 53% of adults get their news from social media.==== In addition, 59% of Twitter users regularly get their news from Twitter (Facebook users have a similar pattern).====Second, the technology of communication in social media is significantly different. In the world of broadcasting, agents are mostly consumers of information. There is a small number of news outlets that reach a large (and relatively passive) audience. In the world social media, individuals are not only consuming information, but they are also producing it. This technological change is less well understood. A key aspect of social media communication is that one given message can reach a large audience almost immediately. Another important change is that it is much more difficult for individuals to back out the reliability of a piece of information, as they observe a distilled signal from a friend in their network without necessarily knowing its source. This allows biased actors to affect views indirectly (e.g. reach a wider audience) and much more effectively (e.g. send more signals at once).====This is relevant when coupled with another phenomena that became prevalent particularly around 2016 presidential election and has still not been resolved: the massive spread of ==== (also referred to as disinformation campaigns, cyber propaganda, cognitive hacking, and information warfare) through the internet. As defined by Gu et al. (2017), ‘Fake news is the promotion and propagation of news articles via social media. These articles are promoted in such a way that they appear to be spread by other users, as opposed to being paid-for advertising. The news stories distributed are designed to influence or manipulate users’ opinions on a certain topic towards certain objectives.’ While the concept of propaganda is not new, social media has made the spreading of ideas faster and more scalable, making it potentially easier for propaganda material to reach a wider set of people. Relative to more traditional ways of spreading propaganda, fake news are extremely difficult to detect posing a challenge for social media users, moderators, and governmental agencies trying control their dissemination. A December 2016 Pew Research Center study found that ‘about two-in-three U.S. adults (64%) say fabricated news stories cause a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.’ Moreover, 23% admit to having shared a made-up news story (knowingly or not) on social media. Understanding how fake news spread and affect opinions in a networked environment is at the core of our work.====In this context, we study a dynamic model of opinion formation in which individuals who are connected through a social network have imperfect information about the true state of the world, denoted by ====. For instance, the true state of the world can be interpreted as the relative quality of two candidates competing for office, the degree of vaccine efficacy, the optimality of a specific government policy or regulation, the need for environmental policies, the degree of government intervention in concentrated markets, etc. Why is this relevant? Because common beliefs about the value of our variable of interest may be a decisive factor in the implementation of certain policies under uncertainty. Consider, for example, the decision of whether to implement a mask mandate during the COVID-19 outbreak, with ==== representing how effective masks are in preventing the spread of the disease. To the extent government representatives respond to their constituencies, implemented policies may differ from the optimal ones when bots are present. If a large number of voters have homogeneous beliefs but are ==== (that is, have beliefs far away from the true ====), implemented policies will be inefficient. In our example, this would happen if the true ==== is high, but a majority of voters believed their efficacy was low and no mandate would be in place. Another source of inefficiency arises when there is ====. This happens when there are two sizeable groups with opposing beliefs and a status-quo that needed to be changed in a timely manner. In this case, there need not be a majority of people who are misinformed, but a mass large enough to stall the decision making process. Sub-optimal delays (or even inaction) in response to shocks would arise. Going back to our example, if masks were effective in protecting against COVID-19 but people were polarized about their efficacy, the government would not change the status-quo (no masks) when the optimal choice would have been to impose a mandate. This could potentially prolong the pandemic. Hence, polarization can also be detrimental for welfare.====Individuals can obtain information about the true state of the world from unbiased sources external to the network, like scientific studies, unbiased news media, reports from non-partisan research centers such as the Congressional Budget Office, etc. This is modeled as an informative and unbiased private signal received by each agent. Due to limited observability of the structure of the network and the probability distribution of signals observed by others, individuals are assumed to be incapable of learning in a fully Bayesian way. Moreover, we assume that individuals are unable to process all the available information and for that they can also rely on the information from their social neighbors (i.e. individuals connected to them through the network) who are potentially exposed to other sources. In this sense, individuals in our network update their beliefs as a convex combination of the Bayesian posterior belief conditioned on their private signals and the opinion of their neighbors, as per the update rule proposed by Jadbabaie et al. (2012) (JMST (2012) henceforth).====There are three types of agents in this society: ====, ====, and ====. Their characterization is to some extent interrelated because it depends not only on signals observed, but also on their mutual connections. In terms of signals received, both regular agents and bot followers receive informative private signals every period of time. Bots, on the other hand, produce a stream of fake news to countervail informative signals. In terms of connectivities, bots do not relay in the information of others (they are sinks in a Markov chain sense), and have a positive mass of followers. Their followers are unable to identify the bot as a source of misinformation, implying that they cannot detect and disregard ====, which are incorporated when updating beliefs. The opinions generated from the exchange of information forms an inhomogeneous Markov process which may never lead to consensus among regular agents since they are exposed to bot followers.====The structure of the graph representing the social media network and the degree of influence of bot followers shape the dynamics of opinion and the degree of misinformation and polarization in the long-run. More specifically, long-run misinformation and polarization are determined by the network topology (e.g. the relative exposure to bots, how central they are, and the ability of bots to flood the network with fake news). Because a theoretical characterization of the relationship between the topology of the network and the degrees of misinformation and polarization is not trivial, we construct a synthetic large network (with around 4,000 nodes) and calibrate it to a real life social media network: Twitter. We then run multiple Monte Carlo simulations in which the location of bots and their followers is assigned randomly, and the process of communication exchange is simulated over long periods of time. While we fix the number of bot followers, we allow bots to have asymmetric influence (e.g. a different in-Degree). All other variables are kept constant across simulations. Our goal is to infer how the absolute and relative centrality of bots (and their followers) affect long-run polarization and misinformation.====For our calibrated synthetic network, we find that significant levels of misinformation and polarization are possible even though only 15% of agents believe fake news to be true and there are only ==== bots, who progressively become extreme. Even though most agents can detect fake news and exclude them from their information set, their views are indirectly affected through the opinions of other friends in the network. To the extent that bots are able to target a small amount of ‘influencers,’ biased signals will travel through the network affecting a large number of agents and hence generating misinformation and polarization. This is relevant, because it shows that ==== are quantitatively important. A summary of our quantitative results follow.====First, we find that misinformation and polarization have an inverted u-shape relationship when bots are symmetrically extreme (e.g. their preferred state is equidistant from the true state): on the one hand, when individuals are able to effectively aggregate information and learn the true state of the world, polarization vanishes. On the other hand, there are situations where there is no polarization because most individuals in the network converge to the wrong value of ====, i.e. they end up with the same (wrong) opinion and for that they do not polarize. This involves maximal misinformation with no polarization. In addition, there are cases in which individuals are on average correct but distributed symmetrically around the true state of the world, with large mass at the extremes of the belief distribution. Here, there are intermediate levels of misinformation and extreme polarization. Even though this implies somewhat better information aggregation, it may lead to inefficient gridlock due to inaction.====We distinguish between average centrality and relative centrality. The former captures how disruptive bots are, on average, to the aggregation of information. The larger its value, the higher the polarization and the lower the misinformation observed. The latter happens because when bots are equidistant from the truth, they offset each other and the unbiased signals become more important. Relative centrality, on the other hand, captures how much more influential one bot is relative to the other (keeping the total number of followers unchanged). As this rises, the more influential bot manages to pull opinions towards its extreme views. This significantly increases misinformation and reduces polarization in our benchmark case. This happens even in simulations in which polarization is significant.====Second, we find that the strength of fake news relative to informative news, as measured by the flooding capacity parameter of bots, increases both misinformation and polarization in a society. However, the technology seems to have decreasing returns as the effects of increasing the flooding parameter vanish at some point. We also show that increasing the number of signals each bot can send, or flooding, (keeping number of bots constant) is not equivalent to increasing the number of bots (keeping flooding constant). This is because flooding affects how fast the bot becomes extreme, whereas the latter affects the weight of bot’s signals relative to other signals.====Finally, we experiment with a ==== (bounded confidence model) by which agents only pay attention to sufficiently like-minded agents. Interestingly, we find that this tends to reduce both polarization and misinformation. The result may seem counter-intuitive at first, as one could expect that if agents only communicate with like-minded friends, the differences between societal views would widen. However, these threshold rules make bots less relevant early on, which allows unbiased signals to move opinions towards the true state. While this may depend on initial conditions, and studying this is beyond the scope of this paper, we find this to be a promising avenue for research.","Social media networks, fake news, and polarization",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000623,14 July 2022,2022,Research Article,59.0

This paper presents a related, but new possibility: whether local ==== impact Green party electoral outcomes. According to the ====, high-income countries will see decreased environmental degradation as they become wealthier, but it is yet to be seen whether this relationship is carried over to environmentally friendly political parties. Using a panel data set that includes over 250 elections from 26 European countries, we find that elections held during times of economic growth increase the vote share that Green parties win. This effect is especially robust for national elections, as opposed to elections for the European Parliament. The magnitudes are large enough to potentially alter the number of seats Green parties have in national legislatures. This provides evidence that Green parties are most likely to gain seats when the economy is growing, and support for the existence of an ====.","For decades, social scientists have posited that current economic conditions affect elections (Kramer, 1971). This is known as the voter popularity, or VP-function (Nannestad and Paldam, 1994). The intuition is straightforward; the ruling party will be credited or blamed for an economy’s successes or failures, respectively. That said, the direction of causality can be difficult to identify, because while the economy may have an impact on who wins an election, winners of an election may have an impact on the economy. The latter is referred to as the Political Business Cycle, or PBC (Nordhaus, 1975). Teasing out one effect from the other is not straightforward. In countries like the United Kingdom, only two parties have governed for the last hundred years, meaning almost all current economic policies can be attributed to either the Labor or Conservative party.==== Even in more fractious democracies with many parties, such as the Netherlands, only several parties won elections and formed governments over the last few decades. This creates a tangled web of whether politics is affecting the economy, the economy is affecting politics, or both.====The purpose of this paper is to establish the existence of a VP-function in a specific case, that of European Green parties. Green parties are a relatively new phenomenon, with the United Tasmanian Group and Values Party of New Zealand the first to contest a regional election and national election, respectively, in 1972 (Rainbow, 1992). Despite their founding in Oceania, Green parties have had the most success in Europe, and most European Union (EU) countries have had multiple Green party candidates win seats in the national legislature. Many EU countries have also had Green cabinet members. Although the raison d’être of Green parties is environmentalism, most have also adopted other progressive causes such as social justice.====Green parties in Europe are unique in that although many countries have viable, reputable Green parties that have had seats in parliament for decades, to date a Green party has never won a plurality of votes in a national election, and has never had the most seats in parliament while participating in a ruling coalition. While Green parties have participated as junior members in government coalitions, and very rarely have occupied the prime minister post, they have not been able to craft economic policy to the extent that traditional governing parties have.==== This fact allows us to plausibly isolate the effects of economic growth on Green party political popularity.====Using a data set that comprises 26 countries and over 250 elections for both national legislatures and the European Parliament and a fixed effects framework, we find that economic growth, measured as real quarterly GDP change, is a key component of a Green party’s popularity. A one-percent increase in GDP during the quarter of an election compared to zero growth increases a European Green party’s vote share by 0.64 percentage points, or 9.6 percent of the median Green party vote share. This effect is driven by national elections, indicating voters may be more responsive to economic conditions when electing leaders to their own governments as opposed to the European Parliament. Another interesting result is that being part of a ruling coalition has a strong negative effect on the success of Green parties, costing them over 1.5 percentage points of the vote share and three seats on average. This is a large effect, as it corresponds to almost a third of a standard deviation for both vote share and number of seats of Green parties.====These results also indicate the existence of a VP-function even for parties that are not responsible for current economic conditions, which are the focus of much of the existing literature. A wide variety of economic variables is thought to influence voter popularity, such as economic growth at both the national and international level (Leigh, 2009, Friedrichsen and Zahn, 2014, Hobolt and Tilley, 2016). Unemployment also appears to play a role (Elinder et al., 2015, Cameron and Crosby, 2000), as does voter income, exogenously determined by mechanisms such as lottery wins and government subsidies (Manacorda et al., 2011, Bagues and Esteve-Volart, 2016). Even the strength of local organized crime can have an impact (Buonanno et al., 2016). These results are found both in Europe and the United States, in elections for heads of state and national legislatures (Fair, 1978, Fair, 1996, Charles and Stephens, 2013, Berlemann and Enkelmann, 2014).====Along with the determinants of vote share listed above, economic conditions can also affect voter turnout (Ashenfelter and Kelley, 1975). When the economy is doing especially well or poor, voters are more likely to head to the polls (Martins and Veiga, 2013). Additionally, the same economic conditions will affect individuals based on their family structure, such as whether they have young children in their household (Elinder et al., 2015). Even exposure to international trade may change voter behavior (Autor et al., 2020).====Of course, there is some dissent over the exact relationship between economic conditions and elections (Stigler, 1973). While a robust literature supports the notion of VP-functions (Bellucci and Lewis-Beck, 2011, Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2013), the PBC predicts the opposite; that is, elected officials will impact the economy (Grier, 2008). Research has found that increases in government spending increase the chances that a local government is reelected and that peak in the business cycle predict elections. (Balaguer-Coll et al., 2015, Voia and Ferris, 2013). Political leaders may also impact immigration and tax policy (Folke, 2014, Freier and Odendahl, 2015). Of course, in many countries politicians can call for early elections, meaning that the PBC may be endogenous (Heckelman and Berument, 1998).====Again, this web of causality is difficult to untangle, and makes the study of Green parties useful to address concerns of reverse causality. Green parties cannot unilaterally call for new elections based on economic conditions, as no Green party has ever had a plurality of seats in a national legislature and has rarely had the political power to dissolve a ruling coalition. Also, while Green parties influence economic platforms while serving as junior members of the ruling coalition and possibly while members of the opposition, they will play a substantially lesser role than that of the ruling party. Still, there may be some concern that a Green party is affecting the economy, rather than the other way around. To address the possibility of a junior partner influencing the economy, one of our specifications includes only elections where the Green party is in the opposition, and this does not significantly change the results. Finally, the existence and popularity of the European Greens, a federation of European Green parties, shows most Green parties have similar platforms across countries in non-environmental topics, known as the green agenda.==== That said, the presence of Agrarian and Christian Democratic parties in various countries will influence the local Green party and result in potentially significant differences when comparing the Green party of one country to another (Debus and Tosun, 2021).====The link between economic health and Green party popularity also provides evidence of the existence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The EKC predicts that poor countries will have a low amount of environmental degradation, as there is not enough industry to cause large-scale destruction of the environment. Then, as a poor country becomes wealthier, the increase in industry will lead to an increase in environmental destruction. Eventually, however, a tipping point is reached, and as middle-income country becomes wealthier the amount of environmental destruction will decrease, and environmental quality will increase. The result is an inverted U-shape curve, which predicts that wealthy countries will see an increase in environmental quality as they become wealthier (Grossman and Krueger, 1995).====The newness of the EKC concept has led to a profusion of studies on the topic, with mixed results. Churchill et al. (2018) find some evidence of the existence of an EKC when using a long panel of countries from 1870–2014, but find less evidence when looking within country. Conversely, He and Richard (2010) find no evidence of an EKC using parametric modeling. Others have found similarly mixed results (Stern et al., 1996, Cole et al., 1997). These mixed results are also present in a closely related theory, the clean democracy hypothesis, which predicts democracies will be more environmentally friendly than non-democracies (Kammerlander and Schulze, 2020). There is also some debate over the shape of the EKC, with some arguing that an “N-shaped” EKC is more accurate than the originally proposed “inverted U-shape” (Pfaff et al., 2004). Interestingly, Chen et al. (2019) found that the EKC reaches its peak earlier in countries that have more environmental awareness. The findings here provide a possible cause or effect of environmental awareness — the success of the local Green party.====Our contribution is twofold. First, we arguably identify a causal relationship between economic growth and Green party popularity. Our empirical design leverages country, year, and month fixed effects, as well as current government variables, to plausibly isolate the effects of a growing or contracting economy on Green Party vote share. These results are robust to numerous specifications and are remarkably stable. One percentage point growth in GDP consistently corresponds to around three-quarters of a percent increase in vote share, and these results are statistically significant. Additionally, this effect holds even when the Green party was not a junior partner in the ruling coalition, and could not influence the timing of elections or have a large influence on current government policy, making the potential reverse causality less likely.====Second, this relationship provides evidence of a political EKC. Although not a direct measure of environmental quality per se, Green party popularity will be correlated with public sentiment. For the typical voter, one of the most effective ways they can change their country’s environmental approach is through the ballot box. The expectation is that the better the economy, the more voters will care about the environment, and thus the more they will vote for Green party candidates. We use economic growth rate during the quarter of the election, as it is likely that people will be concerned with the relative strength of the economy, not the size of the economy in levels. For example, consider a situation where the economy of Romania is growing and the economy of Denmark is contracting. We expect that to benefit the Romanian Green Party and hurt the Danish Green Party, even though Denmark is a significantly wealthier country, because as the economy of Romania grows the citizens are wealthier relative to their benchmark and will thus care more about the environment. This is in agreement prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Therefore, the findings in this paper can be thought of as a political environmental Kuznets curve, much in the same way previous scholars have tested for the presence of an energy EKC (Acheampong, 2018, Shahbaz et al., 2020). Note that as all the countries in the sample are at least highly developed according to the Human Development Index (HDI), the results only provide evidence supporting the second half of the EKC, where wealthy countries see environmental quality increase as they become wealthier.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Our data considers electoral results at the municipality level of the Senate of the Italian Republic and the Chamber of Deputies over the period 2006–2018. Using an IV strategy based on the shift–share instrument, we find that immigration generates a sizable causal increase in votes for the right-wing populist party ====. Immigration also works as a major catalyst for the electoral distance between ==== as a national movement affects the relation between immigration and support for the party.","Over the last two decades, the number of foreign-born citizens in Italy more than doubled. There were roughly 1.4 million foreign-born citizens in 2000 and about 5 million in 2017, equivalent to 8.3% of the total population. The vitriolic rhetoric of right-wing populist parties across Europe and America has been pushing for anti-immigration policies. Immigration played a key role in Donald Trump’s 2016 victory and the United Kingdom’s Brexit. Lepen’s extreme right party, ====, obtained 34% of the vote in the first electoral round and ended up losing in the second round against Emanuel Macron’s party (====). The far right ==== (====) got 35.1% of the votes in Austria’s 2016 presidential election. Populist discourse jeopardizes the benefits of an open and a more inclusive society. Rodrik (2018) suggests that right-wing populism usually emerges when globalization takes the form of the mass movement of migrants.====In this study we centre our attention on the effect of the presence of foreigners at the municipality level on the electoral support for right-wing populist parties in Italy. The Italian case is interesting and worth studying, as virtually all right-wing parties have been labelled populist since 1994, when Berlusconi became prime minister. The amalgamation of populist parties in Italy offers the possibility of discerning in which type of populism anti-immigration rhetoric yields the best electoral returns. We examine the electoral results of both houses of the Parliament (Chamber of Deputies - ==== - and the Senate of the Republic - ==== -) for the 2006, 2008, 2013 and 2018 Italian national elections. Even though Italy has been and continues to be a land of emigrants (Anelli and Peri, 2017), in the last two decades Italy has received a growing number of immigrants from both new EU countries (mainly from Romania) and Africa. The rise in immigration has been mainly driven by the successive enlargements of the EU coupled with the instability on the southern coast of the Mediterranean. A series of uprisings, demonstrations and protests against unemployment and political restrictions in Arab countries between 2010 and 2011 triggered a refugee crisis. The Italian right-wing populist discourse against foreigners shifted from a soft anti-immigration discourse, which held foreigners responsible for job losses, to a more nativist approach during the last general election in 2018.====There may be several grounds as to why immigration may influence the voting behaviour of the local population. For example, a rise in low-skilled immigration boosts the populist vote and that may not really depend so much on the increase in low-skilled immigration ====, but on the extent to which the qualification of immigrants interplays with the skills of the native population. Even if immigration has a positive effect on the economy, factors such as the cultural distance between the natives and immigrants may lead to a rise in the populist vote. Previous studies suggest that even controlling for fixed effects at the municipality level and electoral year, there may be still unobservable characteristics correlated with both, immigration and voting for populist parties. For example, immigrants may self-select in municipalities with better economic opportunities where the emergence of populism could be driven by factors other than the flow of immigrants, such as demanding a status of fiscal autonomy or lower taxes on individuals and businesses. To overcome this problem and obtain causal estimates of the effect of immigration on voting the populist party option, we construct a shift–share instrument as in Card (2001). The rationale behind this instrument is that factors previously attracting immigrants to settle in a geographical area are uncorrelated with the current political environment. We use historical data of immigrant communities in 1991 because it was before the “Tangentopoli scandal”, in which the two biggest political parties at the time (==== and ====) disappeared because of illicit financing. References to immigration were not present in the political discourse in 1991. Far-right parties with a harsh anti-immigration rhetoric, such as ==== and ====, did not participate until the 1994 national elections. Thus, the decision to move to Italy was not clouded by a political anti-immigration environment.====We find a positive effect of immigration on the surge of ====, whereas immigration has a negative effect on the electoral performance of the conglomerate outcome of other major right-wing parties. Our results show that ==== managed to capitalize on the discourse against foreigners better than other parties. The electoral distance between ==== and its most direct competitors, even ====, another populist party with a similar anti-immigration rhetoric, is exacerbated by the effect of immigration. Thus, a first contribution of our paper is to point out that not all populist right-wing parties in Italy capitalize on the electoral divide over the anti-immigration rhetoric, as also shown in Lonsky (2021) on the electoral performance of the far-right party in Finland. The second contribution of our paper is to include as a counterpoint a subsection analysing the impact of immigration on the electoral performance of ==== (Five Star Movement in English) for the 2013 and 2018 elections. Even though ==== is a populist party, its ideology is not considered right-wing. This analysis shows that immigration only feeds a certain right-wing populist type to rise.====Robustness deals with issues identified in the current empirical literature: ==== re-scaling our outcome variables of interest into the larger geographical unit of the local labour market (Barone et al., 2016, Lonsky, 2021); ==== examining whether an inflow of immigrants at the municipality level affects the mobility of natives; ==== re-estimating the main specification using a shift–share instrument constructed with 2004 immigrant distributions; ==== evaluating our main results with those from a model that only uses the share of each area of origin on the total immigrant population in 1991 to define our instrument, showing that our strategy is effective in capturing exogenous variations in the proportion of immigrants; ==== performing placebo tests using pre-1991 electoral data exclude that the instrument not driven by persistent trends at the municipality level.====An additional contribution of our study is to offer two unexplored plausible mechanisms behind the scenes to contextualize the main results obtained the paper: ==== and ====. We examine the heterogeneous effects of immigration on the vote for right-wing populism across municipalities based on their level of fiscal autonomy, defined as the share of taxes on current revenues at the municipality level. A municipality’s ability to raise tax revenues may be, among other factors, the result of greater social cohesion among its citizens alongside better economic opportunities. Thus, lower levels of tax autonomy may be indicative of a greater competition among natives and immigrants for the use of public services and opportunities in the job market (Bordignon et al., 2019).==== We find that in municipalities under the median of the yearly distribution of tax autonomy, immigration has a larger positive effect on the electoral rise of ====; however, a negative effect on votes going to other major right-wing parties.====We also analyse the party changing its electoral brand from ==== to ==== in 2018. Its new strategy no longer places the citizens of the north in opposition to those of the south. The current strategy is broadly based on pandering to an anti-immigration rhetoric and placing Italian natives in opposition to immigrants. Our results show a positive effect of immigration on votes for ==== in the 2018 elections in places where the party was not present in previous elections.====The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 summarizes the empirical literature, Section 3 presents the Italian institutional and political background, Section 4 describes the data, Section 5 the empirical strategy, Section 6 results and robustness checks and Section 7 plausible channels.

Due to the large scale of the crisis and its effects on many individuals worldwide, reliable information about the development of the pandemic is of high relevance (WHO, 2020b). This demand is met by a large and continuously evolving amount of information in relation to the crisis, recently coined an “infodemic” (Cinelli et al., 2020). Part of this “infodemic” are media and news outlets which offer a selection of editorially prepared information to consumers and, thereby, potentially engage in framing of its original content (Chong and Druckman, 2007).====This paper analyzes the role of news outlets in shaping public opinion about governmental policy during the COVID-19 crisis. We conduct an experiment employing a large-scale representative online sample of 3000 individuals in Germany in which we inform survey respondents about a key macroeconomic indicator: the forecasted GDP growth rate. This expert forecast of economic growth stems from a highly regarded annual report about the state of the German economy, covered by German newspapers on a regular basis.====In the survey, we experimentally vary the provision of the baseline information, i.e. the expert forecast itself based on its press release, and its coverage in newspaper articles which engaged in framing of the baseline forecast information in relation to the pandemic. Framing in our setting is the evaluation of forecasted GDP growth as either a good or bad growth trajectory in the context of the crisis. After the provision of information, we assess individuals’ support for governmental policies in response to the crisis, addressing the question whether economic information and/or its framing by news outlets affects support for pandemic policy during the ongoing pandemic.====We find that positive framing of the forecasted GDP growth rate by news outlets increases support for governmental policy during the COVID-19 crisis. This effect corresponds to an increase in policy support by up to 13 percent of a standard deviation. In addition, it is even more pronounced for respondents with more pessimistic expectations about future GDP growth, and related to the policy domains of health and education policy. In contrast, we estimate precise null effects of the baseline information about the expert forecast on support for governmental pandemic policy. This result highlights the role of the media in offering context to macroeconomic indicators.====Furthermore, we find that in times in which negative news are more frequent, i.e. during crises (Aslam et al., 2020, Krawczyk et al., 2021), there is no evidence for an adverse effect of negative framing on policy support. In line with this argument on negative news, we document that respondents perceive the negatively framed information as more credible, and observe an amplifying effect of positive framing and larger news consumption by individuals.====The analysis on beliefs in relation to GDP growth further reveals similarities to studies investigating expectations about other macroeconomic indicators: Prior beliefs about future GDP growth are largely dispersed between individuals. Interestingly, the median growth expectation lies slightly below the forecast of economic experts, potentially mirroring the perceived recession during the field phase of the survey. Furthermore, when systematically accounting for outliers, the mean expected growth rate is close to the forecast by economic experts.====Our results suggest that in a setting of an economic recession and health crisis in which news with negative sentiment are prevalent, negatively instead of positively connotated economic news are more in line with respondents’ expectations about the sentiment of the information. Thus, the exposure to the expected negative news does not translate into a change in political opinion. On the contrary, we find that embedding information on expected GDP growth into a positive context related to the ongoing pandemic increases pandemic policy support in the population. The paper thus informs the understanding of the role of the media for the dissemination of economic information and its effect on public opinion formation in times of crisis. While media and news outlets produce editorially prepared information for consumers, they put economic information into a broader context, thereby translating into political assessments.====Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we add to the literature on how media shapes political attitudes. Previous research has found media reporting and exposure to affect political opinions and voting behavior (DellaVigna and Kaplan, 2007, Gerber et al., 2009). Other studies focus on the evaluation of individual perceptions of the information and find that consumers conversely exert a tendency to prefer like-minded news (Chopra et al., 2019, Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010). We extend this literature by investigating the effect of framing by the media in the spirit of Tversky and Kahneman (1981) on support for governmental policy.====Our analysis thereby also informs the methodological literature on information provision experiments in terms of the relevance of framing effects related to information interventions. This is important as it is commonly advised to frame information treatments in a neutral manner (Haaland et al., 2020), but tailored research on the size of framing effects in the context of information provision experiments is sparse. In this context it is, however, crucial to point out that our framing interventions are based on real-world excerpts from newspaper articles and therefore not engineered by the researcher.====Second, we contribute to recent experiments addressing the general relevance of information provision in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early analyses were conducted during the first months after the initial coronavirus outbreak. For instance, Coibion et al. (2020b) investigate how information on policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis influences households’ economic expectations and spending plans. Binder (2020), in turn, studies the effect of the Fed’s announcement to cut interest rates as a direct response to the virus outbreak on consumers’ unemployment and inflation expectations. Similar to our analysis, Fuest et al. (2021) study support for lockdown and relaxation policies in Germany focusing on the first half of 2020. With varying effect sizes for different subgroups, they find that information about COVID-19 fatalities increases policy support, while information about the costs of lockdown measures decreases support for lockdown measures.====Relatedly, Fetzer et al. (2021) provide evidence for effects of information framing on perceptions of pandemic risk and overall economic anxiety. With respect to media effects, Bursztyn et al. (2020) find media bias to increase the spread of COVID-19 in areas in which consumed media tends to understate health risks. Simonov et al. (2022), in turn, provide evidence that media persuasion reduces the propensity to stay at home during the early stages of the pandemic. Concerning endogenous information acquisition during the crisis, Faia et al. (2021) find that individuals rate less preferred newspaper articles as significantly less credible. Our paper adds to this literature by directly investigating the effects of information consisting of economic news on pandemic policy support.====Third, our survey experiment extends the literature investigating macroeconomic expectations in the context of information provision. This literature often examines expectations about future inflation. For instance, studies on households document large differences between individuals’ inflation expectations for different groups of the population. These household expectations often deviate to a great extent from the inflation rate forecasted by economic experts, and households substantially update their beliefs when confronted with experts’ inflation expectations (Cavallo et al., 2017, Coibion et al., 2019). Similar studies using information provision experiments investigate expectations about interest rates, the likelihood of a recession, or house prices. They also find households’ knowledge about macroeconomic variables to be limited and dispersed across individuals (Armona et al., 2019, Coibion et al., 2020a, Roth and Wohlfart, 2020).====We add to this literature via directly investigating individuals’ expectations about GDP growth as another key macroeconomic indicator. We focus on GDP growth as it is often used as a central indicator for a country’s prosperity and allows to capture individuals’ assessment of a country’s future economic prosperity within a single measure. This is of special relevance in a setting of economic recession in which individuals are exposed to a large amount of different types of (economic) information. Thereby, our experiment is the first to shed light on individuals’ belief updating process in relation to their country’s GDP growth rate as compared to beliefs about the likelihood of a recession (Roth and Wohlfart, 2020) or the uncertainty involved in forecasting GDP growth (Coibion et al., 2021).====Based on the literature on macroeconomic beliefs, we hypothesize that there exists large variation in individual expectations about GDP growth during the crisis, and that information provision induces an exogenous shift based on the sign of biases in prior beliefs. Respondents who underestimate (overestimate) future GDP growth may support pandemic policy more (less) strongly. There is growing evidence that political attitudes are influenced by individuals’ evaluation of a country’s macroeconomic outlook (Jacobs et al., 2021). At the same time, recent research suggests that media and news outlets play an important role in shaping both economic perceptions and public policy assessments (Soroka et al., 2015).====Since individual expectations about a country’s future prosperity further likely depend on the assessment of its policy, information provision may hence also translate into individuals’ policy assessments in times of crisis. In conjunction, framing of economic news by newspapers may further influence support for governmental policy in a positive or negative manner, based on the context provided by the media. Finally, such framing effects can amplify or offset the effect of the baseline information.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the pre-registered design and hypotheses of our survey experiment. Section 3 provides an overview of the data and presents descriptive statistics of key variables used in our analysis. The main results of our survey experiment are presented in Section 4.

The survival analysis suggests that the most efficient firms quit the market at a faster rate than other companies do. Survival functions of the least efficient firms do not always differ significantly from those of other enterprises. Additional financial support from government contracts helps firms in all efficiency groups survive but this effect is stronger for laggards. The shift of gains from the public procurement system towards low productive firms leads to the distorted allocation of resources in the economy and, in the long run, may undermine economic growth by allowing inefficient companies to stay in the market significantly longer than would be the case in a more competitive environment.","In recent years, studies examining productivity trends have provided evidence that productivity growth has slowed at the aggregate level after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). This was found to be true of various countries differing in the level of economic development. Research based on data for developed countries suggests that this trend emerged even before 2008. Estimations using aggregated data (see, for example, Voskoboynikov, 2017) show similar trends in the Russian economy. Since 2010, various industries have suffered a decline in both labour and total factor productivity growth rates.====Recent cross-country studies based on firm-level data attribute this slowdown in productivity growth to an increasing gap in productivity levels between the most and least efficient firms within the same industries rather than to a decline in the rate of technological progress. Research provides a number of explanations for this phenomenon, one of them being that the nature of technological progress has changed, innovation now involves higher costs, and inefficient firms do not have sufficient resources for innovation.====This explanation invites two questions. First, why has technological diffusion from leading companies to less efficient firms slowed down and why has it become more difficult for less efficient firms to replicate best practices? Second, why do inefficient firms not exit the market, continuing instead to use scarce production factors in their operations? This study focuses on the second question and deals with the analysis of firm dynamics in the Russian economy and the factors enabling inefficient firms to stay in the market. Recent research in productivity trends for developed countries quite often explains the presence of inefficient firms in the market by their access to cheap credit thanks to low interest rates after the GFC. This is not very relevant to Russia, where the levels of interest rates remained much higher than in developed countries over the period under study. The existence of a large share of inefficient firms in the market seems to arise from other factors.====In my research, I regard the public procurement system as a possible source of supporting inefficient companies in various industries. Recently, public procurement has been increasingly seen as one of the possible means of implementing industrial policy in a broad sense. In this case, public procurement, in addition to reducing the costs of acquiring goods and services for public needs, may also seek to address goals related to social issues, regional or sustainable development, etc. Government procurement contracts are widely used to support domestic firms via increasing demand. Studies based on data for the less developed countries quite often find that involvement in the public procurement system has a positive effect on growth, especially in lagging regions. In Russia, government purchasing contracts accounted for 27% of GDP in 2019,==== with a significant share of firms (almost 37% in my sample) involved in public procurement. Thus, government financial support through public procurement is quite substantial and may have a considerable impact on the Russian economy.====Government (local or federal) purchases generally have a positive effect on economic development through an increase in demand, especially in less developed areas. But the impact could be different for different types of firms involved in the public procurement system. If the system of public procurement is not based on transparent and competitive practices, the positive effect on economic growth could fail to materialise, since the politically connected but not necessarily the most efficient companies can have access to financing through the public procurement contracts. In this case, the final allocation of resources could be distortional and have a generally negative effect on economic growth in the long-term, even though short-term effects could be positive, for example, due to supporting employment in a region.====The contribution of this study is to evaluate the effect of additional support via the public procurement system on the performance of firms with various efficiency levels, and to analyse the influence of government purchases on the creative destruction process.====For this purpose, I combine firm-level data from three sources: data from companies' balance sheets from the RUSLANA dataset; data on each firm's entry in and exit from the market from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities; and information on the participation of a firm in government procurement auctions from the SPARK Marketing database.====I estimate production functions for narrowly defined industries to evaluate TFP growth and the efficiency level for individual firms. Based on this estimation the companies in my sample are divided into three groups: the leaders, the baseline group and the laggards. I conduct the analysis by comparing exit hazards for each group, as well as by estimating the effect of winning government procurement contracts on the survival of firms of different efficiency levels.====I have found that the most efficient firms exit the market at a faster pace than firms from the other efficiency groups. At the same time, lagging companies quit the market less frequently than other firms. This suggests that the market mechanism of selecting the most efficient firms is not itself efficient enough in the Russian economy.====According to World Bank studies (see Cusolito et al., 2020), Russian markets are highly fragmented and if the high rates of exits of leaders are due to the limitations of local markets, one would expect that local governments can support leaders through the public procurement system to help them extend the market boundaries. My analysis shows that the opposite trends are observed. I show that the government procurement system indeed helps firms involved in it stay in the market longer but does not necessarily support the most efficient firms with growth potential. The comparison of exit hazards among firms with a government contract shows that inefficient firms with government contracts stay in the market longer than companies from the other efficiency groups.====Wide access of low-productivity firms to the public procurement system provides more incentives to distorted allocation of resources in the economy and in the long run undermines economic growth further by allowing inefficient companies to stay in the market significantly longer than would be the case in a more competitive environment.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

For proactive measures, lobbying activities in a single targeted country lessen underprovision, raise overall counterterrorism, and reduce terrorism. Welfare decreases in the lobbied country but increases in the other targeted country owing to enhanced ====. Lobbying influence on the targeted countries' welfare is tied to terrorists' targeting preferences and how the lobbied government weighs citizens’ welfare. Lobbying in both targeted countries may result in the first-best equilibrium. International policy coordination may lead to less efficient outcomes than the noncooperative equilibrium.","Despite the passage of over two decades since the four skyjackings on September 11, 2001, (henceforth, 9/11) with the loss of nearly 3000 people, the wounding of over 6000 people, and tens of billions of US dollars in damages, the threat of transnational terrorism looms large and results in the spending of tens of billions of dollars annually (Sandler et al., 2009). Terrorism is the premeditated use or threat to use violence against noncombatants by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political objective through the intimidation of a large audience beyond that of the immediate victims (Enders and Sandler, 2012, p. 4; Hoffman, 2006). Terrorists aim to generate sufficient audience costs through ghastly attacks that may put virtually anyone at risk, so that some governments feel constituency's pressure to concede to terrorists' political demands in order to bring tranquility. Because most governments are loath to grant terrorist demands, intransigent governments must resort to enhanced counterterrorism spending to protect their civilians' lives and property.====A rich and varied literature developed during the last couple of decades, spurred in part by 9/11 (see, e.g., Arce and Sandler, 2005; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011: Bandyopadhyay and Sandler, 2021; Carter, 2016; Garcia-Alonso et al., 2016; Hausken, 2012, 2021; Heal and Kunreuther, 2007; Jindapon and Neilson, 2009; Kunreuther and Heal, 2003; Rosendorff and Sandler, 2004; Schneider et al., 2015). The literature distinguishes between two kinds of counterterrorism actions. Proactive measures are offensive responses against terrorist organizations' assets (i.e., training camps, sponsors, safe havens, resources, and personnel) with the goal to weaken the groups’ capabilities so that they pose a much-diminished threat, thereby resulting in fewer operations. Moreover, launched terrorist operations are less formidable if proactive means are effective. By contrast, defensive actions are protective, intended to limit the success or consequences of terrorist incidents by fortifying potential targets (Bier et al., 2007; Bandyopadhyay and Sandler, 2011; Hausken, 2018; Hausken et al., 2009; Landes, 1978). Such defensive measures can also allow targeted entities to recover faster in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. The fortification of potential targets (e.g., metal detectors in airports) is a prime defensive example. Other instances include air marshals on flights, cement barriers around buildings, installation of surveillance systems, and intelligence gathering on potential terrorist targets.====For multiple at-risk countries, theoretical studies of proactive and defensive counterterrorism identify two important policy tendencies: (1) proactive measures are generally underprovided by commonly targeted countries, and (2) defensive responses are oversupplied by commonly targeted countries (e.g., Arce and Sandler, 2005; Bandyopadhyay and Sandler, 2011; Cárceles-Poveda and Tauman, 2011; Gaibulloev and Sandler, 2019; Hausken et al., 2009; Rossi de Oliveira et al., 2018; Sandler and Lapan, 1988). The undersupply of proactive operations stems from their purely public good properties (i.e., nonrival and nonexcludable benefits) that motivate targeted countries to free ride, when possible, on the proactive response of other countries threatened by a common terrorist adversary. By sitting back and waiting for other countries to weaken the terrorist group, a country can save its scarce proactive resources for other expenditures. When a nation takes proactive measures, it accounts for its own derived marginal benefits but not for those that its actions confer on other targeted countries, so that derived marginal benefits are not equated with marginal costs (Cornes and Sandler, 1996; Enders and Sandler, 2012). The general tendency for the undersupply of proactive measures may be curtailed if such actions enrage terrorist supporters leading to a negative “backlash” externality that increases terrorists’ support and capacity (see, e.g., Bier and Hausken, 2011: Glaeser, 2005; Hausken 2021; Rosendorff and Sandler, 2004). If, as we assume henceforth, free riding is a stronger motive than backlash, then proactive measures remain undersupplied.====Alternatively, the overprovision of defensive measures comes from an attempt by targeted countries to raise the price to terrorists from attacking them (Bier et al., 2007; Enders and Sandler, 2004), which leads to terror transference to other countries. As countries engage in similar counterterrorism efforts, a deterrence race ensues whereby defensive actions increase well beyond the point at which marginal benefits equal marginal costs, thereby resulting in overprovision. Generally, two targeted countries' proactive measures are strategic substitutes that vary inversely, while two targeted countries’ defensive actions are strategic complements that vary directly (Hausken, 2018; Sandler and Siqueira, 2006).====The purpose of the current study is to show theoretically that lobbying activities by defense contractors, say drone manufacturers, can affect the conventional wisdom with respect to the under- and overprovision of proactive and defensive counterterror measures, respectively.====For proactive measures, lobbying by the defense firm reduces underprovision and, in some cases, may even result in overprovision when one of two targeted country is lobbied.==== The single-country lobbying scenario may actually lift the targeted countries' combined welfare even as the politically influenced country experiences a welfare decline, but a first-best optimum cannot occur. The effects on the two countries' welfare are dependent on the weight that the lobbied country assigns to its citizens’ welfare and on the targeting preferences of the terrorist group, who operates from some third country (e.g., al-Qaida in Afghanistan or Islamic State in Iraq). Those terrorists may favor attacks against one country over the other. In the two-country noncooperative lobbying scenario, surprising results arise where a first-best optimum may follow and outdo a two-country cooperative lobbying situation.====The issue of global overprovision (or underprovision) of counterterrorism measures, analyzed here, is clearly related to a pioneering study by Aidt and Hwang (2014) that shows that lobbying by foreign firms can help internalize cross-border externalities and improve economic efficiency. For example, organized domestic firms may lobby their government to increase import tariffs, while foreign firms may lobby the domestic government against such tariffs. Such countervailing lobbying limits the tariff distortion and aligns the interests of the (unorganized) domestic consumers with those of the foreign firms. For a comprehensive discussion on the topic of foreign lobbying in the contexts of international political economy, see Aidt et al. (2021).====Since our main story hinges on the lobbying by defense firms that produce counterterror weapons, we must provide some background. Most of our analysis involves lobbying for proactive measures. An apt instance comes from producers of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, which can target terrorists’ assets in the field. An increased demand for drones grew during the post-9/11 conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the War on Terror (Hall, 2015).==== During 2001–2013, US spending on drones increased from $36.3 million to $2.9 billion. By 2012, UAVs accounted for one-third of all US military aircrafts (Hall and Coyne, 2014). Drones played a vital role in US proactive counterterror attacks with hundreds of missions authorized by the Obama and Trump administrations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen during 2015–2018 (see the list of operations by location in The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2022). In part, drone attacks are favored because they pose much smaller risks to US military personnel. Ideally, but ====, such attacks can avoid collateral civilian casualties, which could result in backlash. Currently, combat drones are possessed by an ever-growing number of countries including the United States, the UK, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (New America, 2022; Weiss, 2017). Those and other countries have used drones against terrorists – e.g., US drone strikes involved al-Qaida, Haqqani Network, and Tehrik-i-Taliban in Pakistan (TTP) (Jaeger and Siddique, 2011; Johnston and Sarbahi, 2016).====In the United States, the four major producers of drones – Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman – spent millions in lobbying the Congress to promote UAVs (Conradis, 2013a, 2013b; Karbal, 2020). Hartley (2017) recognizes that the War on Terror offered profitable opportunities for arms producers to promote their specialized weapons systems. Drones became one of the favored weapons in proactive responses to terrorists (The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 2022). Johnston and Sarbahi (2016) find that drone strikes in Pakistan generally reduced the rate and lethality of terrorist attacks.==== Moreover, those authors present evidence that drone attacks limited the Taliban's targeting of tribal elders, which was viewed favorably by the local population.====The remainder of the paper has five sections. In Section 2, we formulate a baseline model containing two targeted countries – ==== and ==== – and a terrorist group, based in country ====. This model involves the targeted countries strategically deciding their levels of proactive measures, given their counterpart's proactive choice and the targeting bias of the common terrorist group. Each targeted country produces a general consumption good and counterterror proactive good. A welfare-optimizing choice of the two goods is determined when the targeted countries act independently and there is no lobbying. Section 3 allows country ====, but not ====, to have its counterterror proactive production influenced by lobbying. With political lobbying, total proactive measures increase despite some free riding in ====, leading to a decrease in overall terrorism in the two targeted-country scenario. Not only does lobbying limit proactive underprovision but it may, under identified circumstances, bolster the two countries' welfare, which, however, remains suboptimal. We compare the targeted countries' unilateral welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium with their politically influenced equilibrium. In Section 4, the investigation permits lobbying in both countries to unleash a complex set of externalities that hinges on how targeted countries weight their citizens' welfare, the countries' capital shares, and the terrorists' targeting decision. Under specified parameter values, the two-country lobbying scenario may achieve a first best and outdo a cooperative two-country lobbying equilibrium.==== Section 5 considers lobbying when at-risk countries are providing defensive counterterror actions. Now, lobbying exacerbates the routine tendency of overprovision, leading to further welfare losses.

We find that participatory budgeting systematically alters the pattern of local spending. Municipalities using participatory budgeting reallocate resources toward more immediate and visible expenditures and away from long-term development expenditure. We also find evidence that participatory budgeting affects the municipal budget by a greater amount than the expenditures directly allocated through participatory budgeting. Our findings indicate that participatory budgeting leads to the reallocation of local public spending by increasing information flows between policymakers and service users.,"It is widely believed that participatory budgeting promotes an efficient allocation of public funds by allowing citizens to participate directly in budgetary decisions (Gonçalves 2014; Wampler 2012).====Participatory budgeting leads to public spending allocations that closely match popular preferences by improving information flows between policymakers and service users (Gonçalves 2014; Boulding and Wampler 2010; Ebdon, 2002).==== Intuitively, participatory budgeting gives policymakers access to better information about service users' preferences for public goods (Ebdon 2002; Gonçalves 2014). For instance, in a study of Brazilian municipalities, Gonçalves (2014) found that participatory budgeting increases spending on sanitation and health services, in line with the participatory meetings’ demands. In a study of 220 Brazilian cities, Boulding and Wampler (2010) similarly found that the adoption of participatory budgeting redirects budget priorities toward health and education programs that matter for the poor majority.====However, improved information flows may also lead to a shift toward more immediate and visible expenditures and away from long-term expenditures. Because participatory budgeting is a short-term exercise (one or two years), citizens’ demands are often biased toward more immediate and visible programs (Cabannes 2004; Gonçalves 2014; Jeong and Kim 2014; Kim and Lee 2016; Kim 2017; Lee and Kim 2011; Son and Kim 2017).==== In addition, municipal executives have an incentive to reallocate resources toward more visible expenditures to increase their chance of reelections.==== Thus, municipalities with limited resources for new programs shift resources away from other programs, such as expenditures for long-term development (Boulding and Wampler 2010; Cabannes 2004; Jeong and Kim 2014).====While researchers focused on the effect of participatory budgeting on a few specific expenditures, there is little research on the effect of participatory budgeting on the overall pattern of local expenditures.====Using data from 226 South Korean municipalities from 2002 to 2017, we examine the effect of participatory budgeting on the composition of local public spending. We find that participatory budgeting systematically alters the pattern of local public spending. Municipalities using participatory budgeting reallocate resources from long-term development expenditures (for instance, urban projects) toward more immediate and visible expenditures including welfare (for instance, public employment), health and sanitation (for instance, waste collection), and transport (for instance, road maintenance).====We also find evidence that participatory budgeting affects the municipal budget by a greater amount than the expenditure programs directly allocated through participatory budgeting process. Our findings support the view that participatory budgeting leads to spending allocations that match popular preferences by increasing information flows between policymakers and service users.====Note that South Korea (hereafter, Korea) provides an ideal setting for our research because nearly all municipalities have adopted participatory budgeting with sufficient time variance. The widespread adoption of participatory budgeting in Korea reflects the strong tradition of citizen participation, deeply rooted in the country's experience with military governments in the 1960s–1980s and the subsequent democratization through mass mobilizations (Byeon et al., 2018; Sintomer et al., 2012).====Participatory budgeting is implemented similarly across Korea. In most municipalities, participatory budgeting programs have similar structures and processes, rules for recruiting citizen representatives, methods of ranking proposed projects, and shares and categories of the municipal budget allocated through participatory budgeting. This allows us to effectively identify the effect of participatory budgeting on the pattern of local government spending (In Section 2, we provide a more detailed discussion of participatory budgeting programs in Korea.).====Our study is closely related to the large literature on direct democracy based on the experiences of Switzerland and the United States. This literature has found that classic forms of direct democracy, such as the referendum and initiative, move fiscal policy closer to the preferences of citizens, or the median voter (Feld and Kirchgässner 2001; Feld and Matsusaka 2003; Matsusaka 2018).==== In particular, direct democracy restrains the spending bias of governments by requiring majority votes (Feld and Kirchgässner 2001, 2003; Feld and Matsusaka 2003; Matsusaka 1995; Schaltegger and Feld 2009).====In representative democracies, the government may deviate from the preferences of the median voter for various reasons, including budget-maximizing bureaucracy, pressure groups, fiscal commons, and representatives’ own policy preferences (Matsusaka 2018). Direct democracy allows citizens to control their representatives on specific policies, even during non-election periods (Feld and Kirchgässner 2001, 2003; Matsusaka and McCarthy 2001). In addition, direct democracy increases the information flow between representatives and their constituents (Matsusaka 1995).==== If voters are fiscal conservatives, government spending should be lower in a direct democracy than in a representative democracy (Feld and Kirchgässner 2001a).====A number of studies find that the fiscal referendum effectively limits the size of government: spending and debt are lower in jurisdictions with direct democracy than in those with pure representative democracy where representatives have a monopoly power on legislation (Feld and Kirchgässner 1999, 2001, 2001a; Feld and Matsusaka 2003; Funk and Gathmann 2013; Matsusaka 2018; Schaltegger and Feld 2009).==== Previous studies also find that the initiative is associated with less government spending in US states and Swiss cantons (e.g., Matsusaka 1995, 2018).====Similar to the referendum and initiative, participatory budgeting is a bottom-up process in which the initiative starts with the ordinary citizens (Feld and Kirchgässner 2001a). In both referendums and participatory budgeting, the fiscal outcome is influenced by the increased accountability of politicians to voters. Fiscal policy decisions are thus made by voters rather than by their representatives (see Matsusaka and McCarthy 2001).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains participatory budgeting and local public expenditures in Korea. Section 3 describes the data, and section 4 explains the empirical strategy.

We study one specific international ideological spillover, namely, the effect of the unexpected election of a United States (US) president (Donald Trump on the 9==== of November 2016), who openly questioned the so-called ‘core liberal consensus’, on European's core political beliefs. Using a ==== (RDD) around the election event, we show that the Trump presidential election (TPE) gave rise to a ‘backlash effect’. That is, it steered core European beliefs in two specific domains, making Europeans more favourable to (i) globalisation and (ii) international mobility (about 10% change in the overall Likert scale range of the statement that immigrants contribute to a country). Contrasting with the hypotheses of ‘belief contagion’, we do not find evidence that TPE steered illiberal beliefs. Furthermore, TPE improved (deteriorated) the view Europeans had of their own country (the United States).","Most Western democracies after the World War II have been organized around what is commonly known as the ‘liberal consensus’, a meta-ideology that defines the key tenets of most Western political systems. Such liberal consensus relies on narratives of tolerance, openness and acceptance of diversity, and the belief that individuals should always ‘err on the side of freedom’ (Kaufman, 2019). However, such core liberal beliefs are countered by alternative illiberal narratives around the costs of globalization and migration, which have been labelled as ‘populism’ in some circles (Joppke, 2020; Nagel, 2019). To date, we know little about what motivates such changes in core political beliefs,==== and especially around some specific domains such as ‘globalization’ and ‘migration’. We argue that beliefs can change because of ideological spillovers,==== both domestic (e.g., corruption scandal in one specific party's effect on support for the ideas of another party), and international (e.g., election of a new leader in another country) that manage to change the prevailing political narratives, influence media groups and political parties. This paper documents evidence of the latter.====International ideological spillovers take place when political beliefs are sensitive to new prominent ideas beyond one's country's borders. Typically, such a phenomeon proliferates when new political narratives developed overseas influence how individuals define their core political beliefs and views of the world.==== One of the potential sources of ideological spillovers comes from political shocks in the United States (US), a pivotal country in modern capitalism, the narratives of which can influence individuals' narratives across the world.====It is important to disentangle whether such ideological spillovers take the form of ====, namely when same ideas proliferate internationally==== or instead, take the from of ====. That is, when individuals form their beliefs in opposition to narratives elsewhere.==== If ideological spillovers follow some form of belief ==== (Acharya et al., 2016; Schindler and Westcott, 2021), Golman et al. (2016), then one should expect individuals to be more likely to adopt the core beliefs of a new ideology in the United States. In the present study, belief contagion would mean the strengthening of illiberal beliefs after the Trump presidential election (TPE). A clear example of contagion type ideological spillover was the development of the ‘market liberalisation ideology’ (the notion that free markets are the solution to all, or many policy reform problems) put forward by President Ronald Reagan in 1980's. Such ideology exerted a strong influence on the beliefs in many European countries, and rather than fading with a new US administration, it even had lasting effects until today in the political narratives (Van Apeldoorn and Overbeek, 2012). Contagion type spillovers are more likely when individuals share a common set of beliefs, as most extreme public choice disputes tend to take place between individuals who share a ‘core set of beliefs’ (Golman et al., 2016).====Alternatively, new narratives can produce emotional reactions strengthening in the form of ==== ====Strawson, 2008), especially if individuals’ identity is defined by opposing such ideas (Schwarz, 2012)====. ====We hypothesize that the latter might have been an alternative common reaction in Western Europe after the election of Trump as US President, if the TPE is perceived as questioning the core liberal consensus of Western democracy, and deeply held principles in the European Union.====This paper contributes to the study of political belief formation by examining whether the election of Donald Trump as US president (Trump presidential election, also referred to as TPE), gave rise to an ==== on the support for core liberal political beliefs in European countries. We measure beliefs of Europeans ====. We find evidence consistent with ==== in Europe after the TPE. We show that beliefs in Europe expressed a clear opposition to some of the illiberal ideas professed by President Trump. More specifically, the “America First” doctrine he put forward, proposed an open critique of globalization (presents globalism as a quasi-adversarial ideology),==== advocated for migration controls (the famous ‘wall’ and ‘Muslim’ travel ban), national sovereignty (ending NAFTA) and reform of key public programs (Obamacare). Finally, President Trump has been described as embracing authoritarianism as a political style (e.g., Choma and Hanoch, 2017).====Previous studies have mostly focused on the effect of the TPE in the US rather than abroad,==== except for Giani and Méon, 2021 and Minkus et al. (2019). In the US TPE reduced the costs of disclosing views that before were not perceived as ‘acceptable’ such as xenophobic attitudes, a phenomenon known as ==== (Kuran, 1991; Bursztyn et al., 2020). In contrast, we know little about other spillover effects in other parts of the Western world, such as in European countries, which are closely connected to the United States politically and culturally (in the form of NATO membership as well as culture and media consumption), and face the rise of populist movements of their own. Yet, to date, the only evidence of such contagion effects comes from Giani and Méon (2021) who document an increase in the probability of an individual reporting a racial bias within the 15 days of the election of Trump as a president.==== However, we know little about effects on individuals' core liberal beliefs. Closer to our study, Minkus et al. (2019) reports evidence that the TPE lead to a significant increase in EU's popularity in Europe after the US presidential election in 2016. However, it does not examine how TPE shifted core political beliefs in the relevant domains that were at the core of President Trump's ideology.====This paper focuses on examining the hypothesis of ideological spillover effects of the TPE, and more specifically whether Europeans changed their core liberal beliefs with respect to two main domains, namely (i) globalization, (ii) openness and migrations. We employ evidence from two survey datasets fielded around the TPE, the Eurobarometer survey and the European Social Survey.====We rely on the fact that to most European observers, Trump's victory was unexpected, and came not only as a surprise, but also as a shock. Hence, an analysis of peoples attitudes close to the time of the TPE helps our understanding of how political beliefs were affected. More specifically, we use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) around the election event. This empirical strategy is quasi-experimental, and is especially suitable for survey data around an event like the TPE (Eggers et al., 2014).====Against the backdrop of a growing body of literature that links the TPE to contagion (namely increased adoption of illiberal beliefs such as negative views on immigration, globalization in the United States, see Bursztyn et al., 2020), our analysis suggests evidence of backlash. That is, Western Europeans increased their support for liberal political beliefs after TPE. For instance, considering the statement that immigrants contribute a lot, we find that the TPE effect corresponds to a 10% shift in a likert scale ranging from the category ‘tend to disagree’ to ‘tend to agree’.====We argue that such ideological spillovers can be explained by the anticipation of similar illiberal beliefs as those propagated by Donald Trump in their own country.==== That is, by a backlash reflected in the increased support for the core liberal beliefs of openness, globalisation, and international migration. Such findings are in line with other work on ego-defensive attitudes after core political shocks (Katz, 1960), and are consistent with the ==== (Collins and Loftus, 1975), as the extension of Trump-like movements could be viewed as a threat to the liberal consensus (e.g., influencing world openness or challenging the fundamentals of the liberal order). Other explanations include a reaction to Trump's antagonistic depiction of the European Union (EU), his support for the Brexit campaign,==== as well as the negative portrayal of Trump by the European media (European Journalism Observatory, 2017).====Finally, we show that the TPE led to an increased share of Europeans perceiving that the United States is moving in the ====, while increasing the support for the own country moving in the ==== consistently with Minkus et al. (2019).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, in section two we provide the background of the paper, followed by the data and empirical strategy in section three and four.

Although several empirical and field studies have found that the threat of external audit reduces corruption (Olken, 2007, Avis et al., 2018, Zamboni and Litschig, 2018), the mere implementation of formal enforcement mechanisms, increasing the expected cost of corruption, may not be particularly effective in countries where legal institutions are lacking and corruption is systematic.====Following the release of the 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, which shows that anti-corruption efforts stalled in most of the 180 surveyed countries,==== Transparency International has highlighted the importance of free speech and an open and engaged civil society in curbing corruption.==== Enabling citizens to speak out against a corrupt act directs attention to petty corruption, namely to everyday life, small-scale bribes that are most harmful to ordinary people. In this paper, we focus exactly on such petty bribes and on the importance of grassroots participation to the fight against corruption. Petty corruption will take the form of collusive bribery that, while benefiting the briber–bribee pairs, generates negative externalities to other members of the society.==== We ask whether collusive petty corruption can be decreased through empowering the other members of society that suffer from it with the possibility of sending free-form text messages, together with emoticons, to the corrupt parties. Hence, we give a “voice” to those who do not participate in the corrupt transaction, but pay a cost for it because, for instance, they receive slower and/or lower quality service.====Two main reasons account for the importance of communication and increased citizen participation in the fight against corruption. First, ordinary citizens are likely to be better informed about corrupt transactions as compared to central government bureaucrats. Second, the parties involved in the corrupt transaction may suffer higher non-monetary or “moral” costs when they know to be under the scrutiny of other members of their community, for instance, because they dislike receiving expressions of disapproval and informal social sanctions.====Given the type of research question we want to address and because most corrupt transactions are secretive by nature and thus difficult to measure reliably, we follow a growing number of studies that use laboratory experiments – and lab based corruption games – to measure corrupt behavior (see Abbink and Serra, 2012 for a review). We build on the bribery game introduced by Barr and Serra (2009), which wants to mimic the following petty corruption situation. Imagine a private citizen endeavoring to secure a preferential treatment such as a speedier admission to hospital. For this reason, he offers a bribe to a public official, who must then decide whether or not to accept the bribe. If a bribe is offered and accepted, the briber–bribee pair benefits (the former obtains a quicker service and the latter gets the bribe), but a third member of society suffers a monetary loss because, e.g., the preferential treatment granted to the citizen leads to an inequitable allocation of resources. We assess the impact of public knowledge of messaging opportunities for the other members of society by comparing how bribes offered and bribes accepted change in two different treatments: a treatment where the other member of society is just a passive player (like in Barr and Serra, 2009), and another treatment where the other member of society, having learned of the private citizen’s and the public official’s decisions, is allowed to send them a costless text message which, together with a happy, neutral, or sad face (emoticon), is posted on a public bulletin board (visible to all participants).====Our principal hypothesis is that anticipated negative written messages and concerns about negative social judgement can increase the moral costs (loss of utility) associated with corrupt behavior and thus reduce the frequency of corrupt transactions. In our setting, where corruption is interpersonal – in the sense that it entails a collaboration between two corrupt agents (Köbis et al., 2016) – and the interaction is one-shot, the act of offering or accepting a bribe can be improper according to a Kantian unconditional view of morality and on the basis of prevailing social norms against corruption, where the norms can be either injunctive (i.e., what one ‘ought to do’) or descriptive (i.e., what one expects others to do). Messaging opportunities granted to those who suffer from corruption may enhance the psychological distress caused by the performance of immoral actions or the violation of shared social norms against corruption.====There are a number of experimental studies documenting how symbolic non-monetary punishment in general, and expressions of disapproval in particular, influence behavior. More specifically, it has been shown that if people are given the opportunity to express their disapproval of the others’ choices, they reduce costly punishment in ultimatum games (Xiao and Houser, 2005) and increase cooperation in public goods games (e.g., Masclet et al., 2003, Rege and Telle, 2004, Koukoumelis and Levati, 2019). People are also found to respond positively to the possibility of judgment by others in the sense that they act in a fairer manner when they anticipate disapproval from those who suffer from their actions (e.g., Ellingsen and Johannesson, 2008, Xiao and Houser, 2009).====As to the corruption literature, the experimental evidence about the role of non-monetary incentives for bribers and bribees is scarce but rapidly expanding in the last decade. Here it is important to distinguish between experiments aimed at testing whether moral costs are actually at play in a bribery game and experiments that exploit the presence of moral costs to reduce the frequency of corrupt transactions. The former group of experiments includes Abbink et al., 2002, Barr and Serra, 2009, Drugov et al., 2014 and Banerjee (2016). Abbink et al. (2002) find no evidence of moral costs associated with corrupt behavior. In their experiment, however, bribers and bribees are the very same individuals suffering from the corrupt actions and thus the null finding can be attributed to negative reciprocity. Barr and Serra (2009) are the first to test whether bribers and bribees suffer moral costs from harming others by introducing, in a one-shot bribery game, passive members of society who cannot engage in bribery but suffer a monetary loss for any corrupt transaction. Their data indicate that corruption is lower, the higher the negative externalities suffered by the passive members, which the authors interpret as supporting the hypothesis that people bear moral costs when they cause harm to others or engage in acts perceived as immoral. Drugov et al. (2014) introduce intermediaries in a modified version of Barr and Serra’s (2009) design and find that intermediaries facilitate corruption because their presence lowers the moral costs of bribers and bribees. Banerjee (2016) provides further evidence that moral costs are at work when bribers and bribees are made aware of operating under a corruption setting and feel entitled to their earnings. The article by Banerjee and Mitra (2018) falls into the second group of experiments—those “manipulating” moral costs. They let subjects go through a four-week ethics course before participating in a harassment bribery game with the specific aim of raising the moral costs of demanding a bribe. Ethics education is found to affect the likelihood of bribe demand, although its effect is short-lived.====Carefully controlled evaluations of the impact of community-based monitoring and grassroots participation on corruption are equally limited and the findings are mixed. In a randomized field experiment, conducted in Indonesian villages, Olken (2007) allows the involved villagers to leave anonymous comments on a road project that was being undertaken in that period. He finds that this type of grassroots monitoring does not decrease corruption due, mainly, to free-rider problems and elite capture.==== We note, however, that Olken (2007) measures corruption by comparing an estimate of the project cost (prepared by a team of engineers) to what was reported by the villagers rather than by considering directly the decisions of potential bribers and bribees. Recent laboratory experiments assessing the effectiveness of grassroots participation include Ryvkin et al. (2017) and Salmon and Serra (2017). Ryvkin et al. (2017) investigate the efficacy of the “I Paid a Bribe” website, an anti-corruption platform where people can report their experience of harassment bribery. The authors allow participants to post on a public bulletin board the bribes that they were, eventually, asked to pay, and find that this kind of reporting is efficient when posts disclose information not only about the size of the bribe, but also about the specific location of the office that requested it. In Ryvkin et al.’s study, it is the bribe-giver (not a third party) who can leave posts and communication is numerical, and not – as in our experiment – verbal and free-form.==== A limited form of communication – consisting of emoticons – has been used also by Salmon and Serra (2017), who investigate the impact of social observability and culture on corruption. In Salmon and Serra (2017), the emoticons are seen in private by the corrupt individual and are not displayed to all participants, as it is the case in our experiment.====Our study is also tangentially related to a growing stream of laboratory experiments investigating individuals’ willingness to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. Standard whistle-blowing systems, where the briber can blow the whistle and report to the authorities, have been implemented by, e.g., Abbink et al. (2014) and Engel et al. (2016), who show that the possibility of blowing the whistle has a strong deterrence effect on one-shot illegal transactions, especially if the ensuing punishment is asymmetric (i.e., affects only the bribee). Butler et al. (2020) investigate how monetary and non-monetary incentives affect employees’ willingness to blow the whistle against their managers. Non-monetary incentives take the form of public scrutiny to which whistle-blowers are exposed. Their most important finding is that public scrutiny increases whistle-blowing when the negative externalities caused by fraud are visible to the public.====To our knowledge, there are no studies that examine, in a carefully controlled laboratory experiment, whether communication opportunities given to the passive members of society, who suffer from corruption being no part of it, affect the propensity to offer and accept bribes. To anticipate our results, we find that the presence of messages decreases the probability that the private citizens offer a bribe, but leaves the size of the offered bribe and the public officials’ acceptance rates unaffected. Hence, while the extensive margin (i.e., the decision on whether to offer a bribe or not) reacts to the treatment, the intensive margin (i.e., the magnitude of the offered bribe) does not. This clean and unambiguous distinction of the treatment effect between margins can be attained thanks to the use of a laboratory study, which enables us to overcome the measurement and identification problems inherent in empirical work on corruption.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the description of the experiment: it introduces the bribery game, describes our treatments, derives the behavioral predictions, and provides details on the employed experimental procedures.

Independent fiscal institutions are linked to a smaller bias to forecasts of the structural budget balance but have no effect on the forecast errors of the headline budget balance.","The efficacy of official fiscal forecasts – that is budgetary projections made by national governments and the European Commission - has been in the spotlight since the introduction of the euro. The literature in this area has primarily focussed on the forecasts of budget balance and output variables in EU member states' annual Stability and Convergence Programmes (SCPs). The emphasis on the overall, or headline, budget balance and its sub-component, the structural budget balance, over other fiscal variables reflect their being central to the EU fiscal rules. Excessive deficit procedures (EDPs) have been invoked when the headline budget balance is in deficit by more than 3 per cent and the structural budget balance is critical to the Stability and Growth Pact's medium-term objective (MTO) of a budget balance close to balance or in surplus. Forecasts of these budget balance ratios are dependent on output performance, which affects the headline budget balance's cyclical component directly and the structural budget balance indirectly. Consequently, evaluation of GDP growth and output gap projections are critical to assessing the viability of budget balance targets and the extent to which fiscal outturns differ from forecasts.====Besides the influence of output conditions, there are political economy considerations surrounding official fiscal forecasts. The forecasts are in the public eye; as Jochimsen and Lehmann (2017, p. 212) note, in the parliamentary process “drawing up the budget attracts more attention than controlling budgetary implementation.” The audience for fiscal forecasts will include both the electorate and analysts whose perspective on the projections can inform public reaction. Governments will want to be seen as competent in their management of the public finances and to have this illustrated in official forecasts. At the same time, they may wish to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy to maintain their standing among the public. This can be a particularly important consideration when a general election is imminent or expected since, as Nordhaus (1975) notes, governments are primarily interested in being re-elected. Alesina and Perotti (1994) and Persson and Tabellini (1997) find governments looking to boost the economy through fiscal policy prior to elections to improve their appeal to the electorate. Biases in forecasts by national agencies have been found to be influenced by the electoral cycle (e.g., Bruck and Stephan, 2006; Brogan, 2012; Merola and Perez, 2013). Specific political economy considerations may act on budget balance forecasts among EU member states. The EU fiscal rules' emphasis on ==== performance (as captured in budgetary forecasts) incentivises an optimism bias to member states’ forecasts that could lead them not to implement the planned budgetary adjustments needed to meet fiscal rule targets. Member states will also want to indicate in their forecasts that their structural budget balances are moving towards their MTO if that objective has not been met, while those in an EDP need to demonstrate that their headline budget balance is improving.====Empirical assessments have shown clear deficiencies in official forecasts within the EU. Strauch et al. (2004) detected biases in the forecasts in the earliest SCPs (those from between 1991 and 2002) with member states not using the information available to them efficiently. Jonung and Larch (2006) found an optimism bias in official forecasts of output growth among the four largest EU member states (Germany, France, Italy, and the UK), that is those forecasts, on average, over-estimated growth rates. Frankel (2011) and Frankel and Schreger (2013) attribute frequent ==== violations of the excessive deficit threshold to such a bias. Fioramanti et al. (2016) find that, for many member states, larger forecast errors arose for the output growth rate and the General Government budget balance between 2008 and 2014 compared to the period 2000 to 2007. Fiscal policy in the EU is also responsive to output developments in a pro-cyclical manner (Larch et al., 2021a). Member states’ fiscal policy often reacts to economic developments after their SCPs have been submitted, with recent data indicating intra-year fiscal policy in EU member states being sensitive to cyclical developments in the economy (Cronin and McQuinn, 2021a). In relation to the implementation of fiscal policy, Beetsma et al. (2009) noted budgetary adjustment routinely falling short of that planned. Such an occurrence implies, ====, that fiscal outturns will be poorer than expected. Merola and Perez (2013) and Frankel and Schreger (2013) find member states subject to an EDP producing more optimistic budget balance forecasts.====As well as assessments of member states' forecasts, those of the European Commission have also been examined in the literature, including for the reason that such forecasts are critical to analysing member states' compliance with the EU fiscal rules. Yet, independent agencies, such as the Commission, often lack sufficient information about member states to provide accurate country forecasts (Leal et al., 2008). Merola and Perez (2013) outline a dilemma that the Commission and international agencies face when making projections for member states: they wish to obtain as much information from government forecasts and government agencies as possible, while facing a “signal extraction problem” in trying to discern authentic information from political partiality. Those authors find supra-national organisations displaying similar biases to member states. Von Hagen (2010) attributes such outturns to those institutions’ reliance on national authorities for country information in preparing their own forecasts. Gilbert and De Jong (2017) hypothesise that such a dependence provides national authorities with an opportunity to steer Commission forecasts and illustrate that those forecasts are biased upwards when member states expect EU fiscal rules to hold.==== Chabin et al. (2020) observe that Commission forecasts have been improving in recent years and have a comparable performance to that of other international institutions.====One mechanism for curbing biases and political sway in official forecasts is the putting in place of institutions that can help remove such influences (Fabrizio and Mody, 2006). Artis and Marcellino (2001) and Buettner and Kauder (2010) present evidence of greater forecasting accuracy being associated with institutional independence. Jonung and Larch (2006) argue that biases can be addressed by having independent national authorities prepare member states’ official forecasts to “foster the production of unbiased forecasts”. Their empirical assessment is that such institutions have no significant biases in their forecasts. Frankel and Schreger (2013) find smaller biases in official forecasts among member states that have adopted certain rules and institutions at the national level, particularly by creating independent fiscal institutions.====The sharp deterioration in member states’ public finances in the late 2000s and the accompanying turmoil in European sovereign bond markets resulted in reforms of the EU fiscal rules, focussing in part on addressing deficiencies in official forecasts and in making forecasts independent of political influence. Those reforms were intended to address some of the longstanding issues highlighted above but also particular effects felt during that recessionary period. For example, Blanchard and Leigh (2013, 2014) find that a consequence of a poor forecasting of macroeconomic variables in the EU during the early 2010s was that the severity of fiscal consolidation measures on output growth were underestimated.====The major reforms to the EU fiscal rules and procedures then took place in two stages. First, the European Semester took effect in 2011 with the specific purpose of improving ==== budgetary policy among member states. It provided a more integrated framework for peer review and assessment of member states' budgetary forecasts. The Semester spans the first six months of the calendar year, with the forecasts in the SCPs, submitted in April, being the focus of attention. The introduction of the Semester was followed by the adoption of the six pack in 2011 and of the Fiscal Compact (more formally, the fiscal chapter of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance), which took effect from the start of 2013. It aimed to reinforce the Pact, including by having EU fiscal rules written into national law, and to strengthen the Pact's “preventive arm” through greater scrutiny of member states' budgetary forecasts. These measures included providing a role for independent fiscal institutions in domestic budgetary practice with a view to tackling forecasting issues. Such institutions would provide autonomous oversight of member states' forecasting at the national level. Independent fiscal councils/institutions became the norm among member states during the 2010s.====Consequently, given this changed rules and oversight framework and the prospect that lessons were learned from earlier forecasting practices, it is appropriate to undertake an assessment of whether biases in official EU forecasts, widely documented as having occurred during the 1990s and 2000s, continue to arise, or not. This is pursued here through a statistical analysis of forecast errors and an econometric analysis of whether political economy factors and output growth forecast errors explain errors in forecasting fiscal variables. Given their importance to the EU fiscal rules, the focus is on annual projections for four variables (the General Government (headline) budget balance, the General Government structural budget balance, the real GDP growth rate and the output gap) relative to their outturns for 22 member states over the period 2013 (when the Fiscal Compact took effect) to 2019. The Spring Forecast occurs at a similar juncture in the calendar year to when SCPs are submitted and, consequently, the European Commission's forecasting performance is evaluated alongside that of the member states. Examining the Spring Forecast can also shed light on whether a supra-national body, detached from the concerns of member states, has better forecasting power or shares any shortcomings in member states' forecasting.====In section 2, the data used in the study are outlined. Section 3 considers the descriptive statistics and the properties of the forecast errors of the four variables. Those indicate a pessimistic bias to the forecasts of the headline budget balance and the two output variables during the sample period. Section 4 then provides an econometric analysis of the forecast errors in the budget balance and the structural budget balance with a particular focus on how the critical EU rule requirements (the excessive deficit procedure and medium-term objective) and related institutions (independent fiscal councils) affect those errors. The estimations indicate that forecast errors in the output variables explain forecast errors in the budget balance variables. Member states in an excessive deficit procedure provide optimistic forecasts of the headline budget balance relative to non-EDP countries, while countries that have not yet met their medium term objective have smaller structural budget balance errors. Member states with independent fiscal institutions report smaller forecast errors for the structural budget balance, but not the headline budget balance, than those without those institutions. Section 5 concludes by assessing the empirical findings and their policy consequences.",Official fiscal forecasts in EU member states under the European Semester and Fiscal Compact – An empirical assessment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000404,9 April 2022,2022,Research Article,68.0

Therefore, in contrast to the general result in the literature, asymmetry in contests can increase competition.","Contest models are widely used to analyze sports tournaments, political competition, R&D races, labor promotion tournaments, conflicts, and rent seeking (see Congleton et al., 2008; Konrad, 2009; Congleton and Hillman, 2015; Hillman and Long, 2019; Fu and Wu, 2019).====In general, models in the contest literature support the conventional wisdom that a symmetric match between two players is more competitive than an asymmetric one, implying that a contest organizer who wishes to maximize effort should level the playing field (see, for example, Franke, 2012; Corchón and Serena, 2018).==== Furthermore, this implies that asymmetry is beneficial in rent-seeking contests in which effort is wasteful. Nevertheless, there are exceptions. In a quite general setting, Drugov and Ryvkin (2017) derive conditions under which introducing bias into a contest between two symmetric players increases aggregate effort and also achieves other objectives, such as maximizing the effort exerted by a single player.==== Fu and Wu (2020) show that in the case of more than two players the aforementioned result often does not hold.====Loosely speaking, the asymmetry between players in these models is generated either by adding a constant to the effort of some of the players or by multiplying their effort by a constant. Other models have employed contests between players with different prize valuations or different linear cost functions (see Hillman and Riley, 1989; Nti, 1999; Stein, 2002; Ryvkin, 2007). In contrast, I consider a Tullock contest (Tullock, 1980) with a common-value prize between two risk-neutral players, where one of them faces a linear cost-of-effort function and the other a strictly convex cost-of-effort function (herein: a “linear-convex contest”). Such asymmetry is suggested by various real-world situations.====For instance, suppose that effort is in the form of money invested in the campaign of a political candidate. For a rich candidate, the cost of effort can be proxied by the rate of interest or the rate of return on some alternative economic activity, in which case the marginal cost of effort is constant. On the other hand, a poor candidate may need to inject her own funds at the expense of her consumption, which implies that her marginal cost of effort is increasing. Alternatively, the poor candidate may choose to invest time rather than money, where the alternative cost of time is usually considered to be increasing (for a detailed discussion, see Esteban and Ray, 2001).3==== A similar situation would arise in the case of a costly legal battle over property rights, where one side is rich and the other poor.====A further example is conflict of interest between the public and an energy company that is trying to obtain a tax exemption on profits from natural gas drilling, or an exemption from Pigouvian taxes that it must pay for the pollution it produces. For this company, effort is usually in the form of the cost of lobbying and therefore the marginal cost of effort is constant, as already noted. By contrast, the public might spend time protesting against the company's activity and therefore for them the marginal cost of effort is increasing.====Another example is a head of government who treats the government budget as his own personal wealth and uses it to maintain his power or to fund his own private investments. The marginal cost-of-effort to maintain power is constant, while the public's effort to depose him is in the form of time-consuming protest activity.====I show that if the value of the prize divided by the cost coefficient is above (below) a certain threshold level, then the equilibrium aggregate effort in a linear-convex contest is larger (smaller) than that in a contest in which both players are characterized by the same strictly convex cost-of-effort function as that of the “convex player” in the linear-convex contest (herein: the “convex-convex contest”), and smaller (larger) than that in a contest in which both players are characterized by a linear cost-of-effort function (herein: the “linear-linear contest). I therefore contribute to the contest literature by demonstrating a new result in which asymmetry can increase effort.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets up the model.

We calculate the likelihood of this ==== anomaly for any (possibly large) odd number of districts and any (possibly large) odd number of voters per district. The likelihood of the paradox is close to 50% when the issue/candidate is divisive (voters across all districts are split almost 50%–50%). The paradox virtually disappears when the issue/candidate is supported/opposed by at least two-thirds of all voters.,"The referendum (or compound majority) paradox is also known as election (or majority) inversion. It occurs when the majority of voters in the majority of districts supports an issue/candidate but the majority of voters across all districts opposes the same issue/candidate or vice versa (====. Nurmi, 1998, Section 2.4, p. 336). For example, in the 2016 United States presidential election the Republican Party candidate Donald Trump received 2.8 million votes less than the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton but Donald Trump won the election by receiving 304 electoral votes (while Hillary Clinton received only 227 electoral votes). Another example is the 2000 United States presidential election when the Republican Party candidate George W. Bush received half a million votes less than the Democratic Party candidate Al Gore but won the election by receiving 271 electoral votes (Al Gore received only 266 electoral votes). Lahrach and Merlin (2009) provide further examples of the referendum paradox in the French local elections.====The result of a referendum or a direct presidential election depends only on the popular majority. The result of an indirect (representative) election additionally depends on the distribution of votes across districts. For example, if all but one state have only a tiny majority for a Republican Party candidate and the remaining state (say California) has a huge majority in favor of a Democratic Party candidate, then the latter wins the popular vote but the former wins the electoral votes (====. Nurmi, 1998, pp. 344–345). Such referendum (or compound majority) paradox is closely related to the Ostrogorski (1903) paradox.====May (1948) was the first to calculate the likelihood of the referendum paradox for an odd (possibly infinite) number of districts each with an odd (possibly infinite) number of voters under the assumptions that each voting situation is equally likely within districts and independently distributed across districts. For three districts May (1948, Section 3, pp. 204–205) used a combinatorial technique. In general, when the number of districts is not necessarily three, May (1948, Section 4, pp. 205–206) employed the method of Euler based on collecting terms of a polynomial generating function.====However, May's contribution (published in a mathematical journal) received a relatively limited acknowledgement in the economic literature. Feix et al. (2004, Table 4, p. 236) calculated the likelihood of the referendum paradox when there are only three, four and five districts each with the same (up to 21) number of voters as well as asymptotic results for an infinitely large number of voters. Feix et al. (2004, Section 3.3) also provided computer simulations for a larger number of states and voters per state.====Wilson and Pritchard (2007, Section 3.5, p. 254) calculated the likelihood of the referendum paradox for up to nine districts by counting integer points in convex polytopes with Ehrhart polynomials (====. Lepelley et al., 2008). However, Wilson and Pritchard (2007) ignored the constraint that the number of votes in each district cannot exceed the number of voters in the district. Lepelley et al. (2011, Box I, p. 30) corrected this omission and calculated the likelihood of the referendum paradox when there are five, seven and nine districts. Lepelley et al. (2011) also calculated the asymptotic results for an infinitely large number of voters and approximative results for a large number of districts and a large number of voters. Geruso et al. (2022) numerically estimate the likelihood of the referendum paradox in the U.S. presidential elections in 1836–2016 as a function of the national popular vote. They find this conditional probability to be relatively stable for close elections.====Several studies of the referendum paradox employ more distinct voting models. Hinich et al. (1972) study the likelihood of the referendum paradox using a voting model where the proportion of voters supporting an issue/candidate is independently distributed across equally-sized districts and drawn from a beta distribution within districts. de Mouzon et al. (2020) estimate numerically the probability of the referendum paradox for three equally-sized districts and any (possibly large) number of voters per district. de Mouzon et al. (2020) employ a voting model where each voting situation within the population is equally likely. Kaniovski and Zaigraev (2018) study the probability of the referendum paradox for three possibly unequal districts and various voting rules. Le Breton et al. (2014) estimate the likelihood of the referendum paradox for mixed voting systems. Kikuchi (2017) explores the impact of voting rules on the likelihood of the referendum paradox.====The main contribution of this paper is to derive an explicit formula for the probability of the referendum paradox conditional on the referendum result (voter majority). For example, the United States presidential election in 1984, when a Republican candidate Ronald Reagan enjoyed a solid majority, was qualitatively different from elections in 2000 or 2016, when American voters were much more divided. Aggregating these elections together overstates the likelihood of the referendum paradox in the former example and understates in the latter example. The formula of conditional probability of the referendum paradox derived in this paper is arguably more appropriate.====The second contribution of this paper is to calculate the overall likelihood of the referendum paradox by aggregating conditional probabilities. This gives us an alternative method for calculating the overall probability of the referendum paradox by means of a relatively elementary combinatorial technique. As mentioned above, May (1948, Section 4, pp. 205–206) employed a relatively complex method of Euler, which is more difficult to follow.====We find that the likelihood of the referendum paradox is close to 50% when the issue/candidate is divisive (voters across all districts are split almost 50%–50%).==== Yet, it quickly decreases for larger margins in the popular vote. For example, with 19 districts the likelihood of the referendum paradox is less than 5% when at least 56% of all voters support/oppose an issue/candidate. The paradox virtually disappears when the majority in the popular vote is two thirds or more. Nurmi (1998, p. 345) already showed that the referendum paradox cannot exist when the majority in the popular vote is greater than or equal to 75%. This paper illustrates that this theoretical upper bound is rather excessive.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our mathematical notation and modelling assumptions. Section 3 presents main results. Section 4 concludes with policy recommendations on how to limit the occurrence of the referendum paradox.",The likelihood of the referendum paradox for a given referendum result,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000416,15 April 2022,2022,Research Article,72.0

Not all communications are the same, however; recent literature has shown that shorter and/or clearer communications have stronger effects (Jensen, 2002, Bholat et al., 2019, Baerg et al., 2021). Missing from this literature is a theoretical explanation for why central bank communications vary in the first place. If there is a premium on central banks releasing clear information, why would central bank communications ever be vague?====To solve this puzzle, we present a simple model of a monetary policy committee (MPC) comprising committee members who bargain over the level of vagueness in central bank communications. Following from previous literature, we focus on different types of institutional features of MPCs including committee size, members’ roles, and the preference composition of committee members (Riboni and Ruge-Murcia, 2010). We generate hypotheses about the types of MPCs that are expected to produce more or less ====. There are many examples of MPCs deploying language with strategic vagueness. For example, in 1974, Federal Reserve chair Arthur Burns felt it necessary to communicate that high nominal interest rates would need to continue “for a time” (cited in Nelson, 2021). A more precise (less vague) message is one that provides a more concrete time horizon. Yet, to our knowledge, researchers have only recently started to examine vagueness in the context of MPCs (Baerg, 2020). Fortunately, the political science literature has produced a large body of research on this topic, from which we draw. For example, Owens and Wedeking (2011) finds that court justices sitting on a court where judges have divided opinions have incentives to increase the level of strategic vagueness in their rulings to appease conflicting views on the court. In this article, we examine whether central bankers on MPCs behave similarly.====To theorize whether and how MPCs institutional design matters, we examine committee size, structure, and composition and their possible associations with strategic vagueness. We develop a simple bargaining model that depicts group members bargaining over how precisely (or how vaguely) to transmit information to an external audience. Following from the literature, we refer to vagueness of the ==== kind. This kind of vagueness is produced as a result of accommodating (or not) other members in the group, in a strategic game, rather than by a lack of understanding or information. Strategic vagueness is thus similar to what Caillaud and Tirole (2007) call strategic ambiguity. The model we develop is in the tradition of an agenda setting model by Romer and Rosenthal, 1978, Romer and Rosenthal, 1979 and extended by Baerg (2020). Different from Romer and Rosenthal, 1978, Romer and Rosenthal, 1979 is that instead of bargaining directly over policy, committee members’ negotiations focus on the level of distortion in communications.==== Different from Baerg (2020), we consider a committee of unlimited size, including a committee of one (a “Dictator”), and we rank order different types of committees based on their levels of vagueness, thus speaking to the literature on optimal committee design.====We find that delegating to a committee where the chair and the median committee member have opposing preferences is associated with lower levels of strategic vagueness compared to committees with either no chair or members with aligned preferences. Another important finding is that appointing committee members with less extreme preferences results in lower strategic vagueness. For example, appointing a very “Dovish” or “Hawkish” central bank governor will result in vaguer communications compared to appointing a moderate. Knowing this, those appointing central bankers can protect against vagueness by appointing oppositely biased committee members. We also show that a member acting alone (a Dictator) has the greatest ability to be vague. Therefore, we also contribute the finding that one benefit of delegating policy making to a committee is a reduction in strategic vagueness. To our knowledge, these conjectures are new to the literature on central bank communications.====Our model also generates important predictions that can be evaluated empirically. In this article, we test the claim that opposing and aligned committees are systematically associated with communicated vagueness using textual data from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. central bank, during the tenure of Arthur Burns (1970–1978). The empirical results show a consistent positive correlation between an opposing bias (of the chair and median member) and the share of words that convey certainty (====) to those that convey uncertainty (====) in committee meeting language. Although our empirical investigation examines only one specific time frame and only one central bank, our findings are broad enough to speak to a larger set of institutions that govern by committees, as well as to other time periods. Furthermore, our other conjectures provide opportunities for future research.",Divided committees and strategic vagueness,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000490,1 June 2022,2022,Research Article,73.0

First, our experimental findings show that the proportion of intermediate coalition formation is much lower than predicted by theory, regardless of the relative negotiation power between veto and non-veto players. Second, allowing coalition formation among non-veto players does not affect the surplus distribution between veto and non-veto players, which diverges from core allocations. These findings contrast to the literature, which views the ability to form an intermediate coalition as a valuable asset for non-veto players in increasing their bargaining power.","In many economic, political, and managerial institutions, veto players are prevalent.==== Some well-known examples include the permanent members in the UN Security Council and the US President’s veto power over legislative actions. In the super-majority provision, a majority party cannot control the whole body yet still has veto power against others. Since von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), collective decision-making problems with veto players have been formally studied in the frame of game theory.====In such veto games, the central question is on the distribution of power among the players and the allocation of the surplus. The ==== property, which is the best-known game-theoretic solution concept for stability, requires that veto players extract all the surplus.==== On the other hand, other well-known cooperative power indices put forth by Shapley and Shubik (1954), Banzhaf (1964), Deegan and Packel (1978), Johnston (1978), Nowak and Radzik (1994), and Lee and Driessen (2012) assign a substantial value to non-veto players.==== Moreover, experimental results have consistently observed non-core allocations since Maschler (1965).====One of the rationales behind such non-core allocations is a possibility of an agreement between non-veto players or intermediate coalition formation: a blocking coalition of non-veto players can behave as a “collective veto player” if they can commit, although the worth of the coalition is zero in the original game. Specifically, Maschler (1963) argues that “when an intermediate coalition is formed, it may partition itself into subcoalitions, who enter the next stage of the game as single players” and that non-veto players would “flip a coin under the condition that the loser would go out of the game”, to enforce one of the non-veto players to bargain with the veto player; Murnighan and Roth (1980) also point that the non-veto players have an option to “attempt to form a coalition with the veto players”.====In experiments, both Maschler (1965) and Murnighan and Roth (1977) find that the results are significantly different from the core allocation, observing the occasional occurrence of intermediate coalitions between non-veto players.==== However, the role of intermediate coalition formation has not been rigorously tested in the literature.==== Based on the advances in non-cooperative coalition bargaining models developed for the last decades, we design experiments to test the role of buyout options in a veto game and discuss whether allowing intermediate coalition formation yields a substantial amount of payoff to non-veto players.====In Section 2, we provide theoretical predictions based on the model developed by Lee (2018).==== The model is suitable to study the interactions among multiple players and the effects of allowing coalition formation. Specifically, the model presents two types of players, i.e., veto and non-veto players, where the veto player has stronger negotiation power in the sense that the surplus cannot be realized without the veto player’s agreement. The most important element of the model for our purpose is whether strategic coalition formation among non-veto players is allowed. In particular, we study two different versions of the model depending on whether non-veto players can form a coalition. If they have the ability to form a coalition, a non-veto player can make a coalition offer (i.e., “buyout” offer) to the other non-veto player by offering upfront transfers, and a coalition is formed if the proposal is accepted. The model provides us with theoretical predictions for our experiments. First, non-veto players are more likely to form a coalition as their negotiation power against the veto player diminishes. Second, the ability to form a coalition among non-veto players is expected to benefit them by increasing their shares in negotiation. The model also predicts that non-veto players obtain larger shares as the veto player’s negotiation power diminishes.====Section 3 explains our experimental setting. In the main stage of our experiment, subjects played a game called ==== in a group of three members, in which a veto player possesses an indispensable item for hunting the deer whereas two non-veto players possess a dispensable item each. We implemented a 2 × 2 design in our experiment: one dimension is whether non-veto players are allowed to form a coalition, and the other dimension is the strength of negotiation power of the veto player.====Section 4 presents our experimental findings. First, non-veto players did utilize the opportunity to form a coalition when they were allowed, but not as often as predicted by theory. Moreover, in contrast to theory, the frequencies of coalition formation were not correlated with players’ negotiation power. Second, in contrast to the theoretical prediction, we found that the power to form a coalition had no effect on non-veto players’ shares in negotiation. Instead, our experimental data support non-core allocations, in which even non-veto players obtained a substantial amount of share, ==== they were allowed to form intermediate coalitions. This observation contrasts with the hypothesis in earlier literature, which views the ability to form an intermediate coalition as an important factor behind the prevalence of non-core allocations in veto games.====In the literature on veto game experiments, researchers have studied various factors influencing bargaining outcomes, including information availability (Murnighan and Roth, 1977), group size (Murnighan and Roth, 1980, Montero et al., 2008, Drouvelis et al., 2010), and voting rule (Bouton et al., 2017, Agranov and Tergiman, 2019).==== But we are not aware of an experiment that explicitly tests the effect of the ability of non-veto players to form a coalition.====Our paper is also related to the experimental works showing that non-core allocations, such as bargaining sets (Medlin, 1976, Rapoport and Kahan, 1976) and the Shapley value (Murnighan and Roth, 1977, Bachrach et al., 2011), better describe actual human decision making. In relation to this literature, we also find that our participants frequently choose non-core allocations. More importantly, we show that non-veto players’ ability to form a coalition may not be an important factor behind the occurrence of non-core allocations reported in the literature.====In general, our experiment is related to the growing literature on multilateral bargaining experiments based on Baron and Ferejohn (1989): open and closed amendment rules (Fréchette et al., 2003), public good provision (Fréchette et al., 2012), pre-play communication among players (Agranov and Tergiman, 2014), endogenous production of surplus (Baranski, 2016, Baranski, 2019), proposer selection contest (Kim and Kim, 2017, Hahn et al., 2020), and legislative bargaining of cuts versus increases in government spending (Christiansen and Kagel, 2019). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experiment has investigated the effect of intermediate coalitions among a subset of players. In particular, we contribute to this literature by testing the effect of buyout options of non-veto players.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the standard model in the literature and derives our theoretical predictions. Section 3 explains our experimental setting and Section 4 shows our experimental findings.

The setting is compelling because reforms of disclosure requirements for outside earnings provide finer-grained data, tackling challenges of previous studies. The full sample results do not suggest that outside earnings were overall correlated with absence rates, speeches, interpellations, or group initiatives. I also examine heterogeneity across age cohorts, government and opposition parties, and modes of entry into parliament. MPs who entered parliament via party lists reduce their parliamentary activities the most when they receive higher outside earnings, suggesting that electoral accountability matters for the relationship between outside earnings and MPs’ efforts in parliament. Results for subgroups of MPs also point to an increase in parliamentary activities when certain MPs receive higher outside earnings, indicating that high-performing MPs reconcile their side jobs with their parliamentary duties. Outside earnings may therefore give rise to a shift in the focus of MPs’ parliamentary work.","In 2021, outside earnings of German Members of Parliament (henceforth MPs) became the subject of heated public debate when it was revealed that some MPs from the Christian Conservative Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), received high agency fees for commissioning face masks during the COVID-19 crisis. In response to the scandal, the MPs resigned and left their political parties. Outside earnings also played a role in the run-up to the 2021 federal election, when it became known that top politicians (including chancellor candidate Annalena Baerbock from the Green Party) had not declared their outside earnings correctly. The timing of these cases coming to light was likely no coincidence. On 14 March 2021, two important state elections were held in the German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate. In both elections, the CDU lost votes at a high rate. Scandals often come to light shortly before elections (Kauder and Potrafke, 2015, Le Moglie and Turati, 2019). It has been shown that in democracies, perceived corruption in the public sector is higher in election than in non-election years (Potrafke, 2019).==== In Argentina, corruption was higher in the weeks before national elections than after (Figueroa, 2021).====In response to the scandals surrounding the outside earnings of German MPs, the German federal parliament (“Bundestag”) passed a new law in June 2021 that restricts MPs’ possibilities to earn supplementary income (e.g., by prohibiting honoraria for lectures) and tightens disclosure requirements.====Secondary employment – either continuing a previous job or taking up a new occupation – is permitted for MPs in Germany. Prohibiting politicians from continuing activities from their previous profession may give rise to adverse selection effects, because members of individual professional groups might no longer run for office. High-performing MPs may also be able to do both: being active in parliament and have a second job.====Outside earnings may interfere with the parliamentary work of MPs. In a survey among all tenured economics professors in Germany, 99 of 146 respondents (68%) stated that they believe that outside earnings jeopardized the quality of the MPs’ parliamentary work (Gründler et al., 2021a). In the event of an unavoidable conflict of time, sideline activities could be a decisive factor influencing the amount of time and effort spent on parliamentary work. According to Article 38 of the Basic Law, the members of the German Bundestag are representatives of the whole people and therefore should act in the interest of the electorate. The ability and ultimately the effort of MPs to do so might, however, be diminished by sideline activities.====Despite the controversies surrounding outside earnings, the amount of outside earnings of MPs in the Bundestag has risen steadily over time. In the 18th legislative period (2013–2017), the total amount of outside earnings of MPs was at least 26.5 million euros, and in the 19th legislative period (2017–2021) it increased by nearly 40% to 36.3 million euros (Osterberg, 2021).====Much of the public debate in Germany revolves around MPs in the federal parliament. The literature examining the relationship between outside earnings and parliamentary activities also focuses on national parliaments or the European Parliament. There is no evidence on how outside earnings are related to MPs’ activities in state parliaments. This study provides first evidence on the relationship between outside earnings and parliamentary activities at the state level using new, self-compiled data for seven German state parliaments. The setting is particularly well suited because many states introduced stricter disclosure requirements after the Bundestag passed a major reform in 2013. The data on outside earnings are therefore much finer-grained, solving the challenge of previous studies that the observed variation in reported outside earnings is low due to heavy censoring.====Theoretical predictions about when to expect negative effects of outside earnings on parliamentary work emphasize the importance of the institutional framework. My study makes two contributions to previous studies: Most importantly, by using data on state parliaments, I examine the influence of public attention. Public attention is a potential key factor influencing the behavior of MPs when they receive higher outside earnings. Public attention for members of state parliaments is limited compared to members of the federal parliament. The costs of being absent and reduced activity in parliament are therefore lower, suggesting that the relationship between outside earnings and parliamentary activities is likely to be different for members of state and federal parliaments. I am the first to empirically examine whether greater leeway in reducing parliamentary activities alters this relationship. Second, theoretical predictions suggest that MPs’ socio-demographic factors and political background likely play a role in the relationship between outside earnings and parliamentary activities. I conduct a rigorous empirical analysis of subgroups of MPs to examine possible heterogeneous effects.====Empirically estimating the effects of outside earnings on parliamentary effort is not straightforward. Previous studies faced the challenge of disentangling the effects of outside earnings and innate ability. Observing MPs for each year of the observation period has the major advantage that I can include MP fixed effects in the empirical model. MP fixed effects control for unobserved ability and other sources of individual-specific heterogeneity and are therefore an effective tool to address the problem of omitted variable bias.====Previous studies indicate an increase in MPs’ absence rates. Examining the data for the seven state parliaments, this cannot be confirmed for my sample. Rather, the results for the full sample suggest that higher outside earnings are hardly correlated with parliamentary activity. This applies to both the extensive and the intensive margin of outside activity. When examining heterogeneity across age cohorts and between MPs from the governing and opposition parties, no general pattern of heterogeneous effects emerges. However, the results from an analysis of directly elected MPs and MPs who entered parliament via party lists suggest that outside earnings give rise to different behavioral responses depending on the political background of MPs. MPs who entered parliament via party lists are the subgroup that cuts back most on their parliamentary activities when receiving outside earnings, suggesting that, due to lower electoral accountability, they prioritize parliamentary work less when they receive higher outside earnings.====Some parameter estimates also indicate that high-performing MPs balance their outside employment with their parliamentary duties. Especially the results for the Bavarian and Rhineland-Palatinate state parliaments show that subgroups of MPs ==== the number of speeches they make and/or their attendance rate in parliament when they receive higher outside earnings. The increase in such high-profile parliamentary activities could be an attempt to prevent a possible negative perception of secondary employment by constituents. Therefore, outside earnings may result in a shift in the focus of MPs’ parliamentary work.",Part-time parliamentarians?

To this end, we collect textual data on the quarterly hearings of the ","Is there a relationship between party ideology and politicians’ sentiments towards independent central banks when debating monetary policy? According to partisan theory, left-wing governments would pressure for a more expansionary monetary policy aimed to boost employment at the costs of higher inflation, whereas right-wing politicians would favour lower inflation at the cost of higher unemployment (Hibbs, 1992; Goodman, 1992). Yet, one of the main theoretical reasons to grant independence to monetary policy was exactly to isolate it from ideologically-driven preferences (Aklin and Kern, 2020; De Haan and Eijffinger, 2016; 1996). According to this approach, if monetary policy was dependent on the government, the alternation of left-wing and right-wing executives would create a time-inconsistent policy which would generate higher unemployment and inflation in the long-run. If recent empirical findings suggest that monetary policy measures are unaffected by party ideology when the degree of central bank independence is strong enough (Giesenow and De Haan, 2019; Cahan et al., 2019; Belke and Potrafke, 2012), party ideology may still influence the attitudes of politicians towards the central bank.====Answering this question is relevant as party ideology can still matter for the process around the setting of monetary policy, even if the central bank is independent. Politicians may seek to influence the central bank by signalling their preferences over monetary policy (Havrilesky, 1988) and using the impact they can exert on its reputation, which central banks care about (McPhilemy and Moschella, 2019). In addition, they may use their attitudes towards the central bank as an ideological marker that differentiates them from competing parties and reflect the interest of their constituents (Grier, 1991). Through their ideological stances, parties reflect the cleavages in the constituencies they represent (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967). The lack of this representation in the debate over monetary policy could amplify the perception of democratic deficit and the populist sentiment against central banks (Tucker, 2018). This, in turn, may weaken the support for central bank independence, possibly leading to sub-optimal monetary policy decisions (Goodhart and Lastra, 2017).====The debates between central bankers and elected politicians during parliamentary hearings represent a good test to check for the role of ideologies when discussing central banking issues. These parliamentary hearings are a key accountability practice that is common to the majority of central banks (Bank for International Settlements, 2009). Central bank hearings enable representatives from different parties and ideological stances to interact with the monetary authority on a regular basis. Moreover, they allow to check for the ideology of all political groups, not just for the government’s preferences.====In this paper we investigate the role of ideology in the attitude of politicians towards the central bank when holding it accountable. We focus on the quarterly hearings of the European Central Bank (ECB) before Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). To this end, we introduce a novel textual database that collects the universe of the transcripts of the hearings of the ECB before the European Parliament (EP) from January 1999 to January 2019. Using text analysis techniques on this data, we explore the relationship between ideology and parliamentarians’ sentiments when discussing monetary policy with the central bank.====Existing research shows that, while ideology matters in the EP, the left–right divide is not the only relevant dimension affecting MEPs’ preferences. Using data on voting in the EP from its first term in 1971 up until 2004, Hix et al., 2006, Hix et al., 2007 and Hix et al. (2009) show that MEPs tend to vote along these two ideological axes: left–right and pro-/anti-EU. More recent evidence confirms this result, but shows that since the euro crisis the pro-/anti-EU dimension has become the dominant one (Otjes and van der Veer, 2016, Blumenau and Lauderdale, 2018, Cheysson and Fraccaroli, 2019). This dimensionality is not only reflected in MEPs’ voting behaviour: using Twitter data on the MEP candidates in the run-up to the 2014 European elections, Nulty et al. (2016) find that the emotional tone of communications reflects preferences along the EU dimension of political contestation.====The relation of the ECB and the EP is a case in point to study the interactions of politicians with independent central banks for three main reasons. First, the ECB is one of the most independent central banks in the world (De Haan, 1997). It has a measurable and narrow mandate of price stability which allows to control whether politicians’ attitudes relate to the ECB’s ability to fulfil its mandate or are driven by other ideological factors. Second, the EP is the only directly elected supranational assembly in the world (Hix and Høyland, 2013). For this reason, each MEP is member of a national party, political group and a national delegation, depending on the country where she is elected. This allows us to study ideology while controlling for different drivers of MEPs’ sentiments including asymmetric economic shocks. Third, the presence of multiple parties in the EP allows us to assess the role of ideology (and of different ideological dimensions) with more precision than in works that looked at the ideology of the governments.====Using text analysis on more than 1,900 speeches by 210 MEPs from 128 parties in 28 countries, we are able to detect how MEPs’ sentiments vary depending on their ideology when they interact with the central bank. We find that party ideology plays a role in discussing central banking issues. The tone of elected representatives when talking to the ECB is predominantly related to their stances on European integration. MEPs that are more supportive of European integration tend to adopt a more positive tone, whereas Eurosceptic MEPs use a more negative one. These results are similar when we measure ideology at party-level based on expert surveys or at MEP-level based on their voting behaviour. Moreover, in both cases the estimates are robust after controlling for a number of factors, including the occurrence of elections, changes in EU citizens’ trust towards the ECB and support for the euro, and macroeconomic factors.====First and foremost, our evidence adds to the empirical literature on partisan behaviour over monetary policy. Recent evidence in this literature shows that, when central banks are highly independent, their policies are unaffected by the partisan preferences of incumbent governments (Giesenow and De Haan, 2019; Cahan et al., 2019; Belke and Potrafke, 2012). On the other hand, evidence is mixed when the focus shifts from government actual influence to government communication. Using data on newspaper articles and newswire reports, Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2011) find that, while on average euro area governments favour lower interest rates than the ECB, this relationship is stronger when left-wing politicians are in government. More recent evidence in Binder (2021) shows that government ideology plays a role in determining political pressures on central banks reported by the media. In particular, she finds that pressures are more likely to come from left-wing and nationalist governments. By looking at the position expressed by politicians from different parties, we show that party ideologies still matter when debating monetary policy. The advantage of our approach is to examine ideology in a setting, the hearing, that was exactly conceived to balance the independence of central banks. In this way, we are able to investigate the relationship between ideology and political sentiments for a number of politicians from different parties and countries that simultaneously interact with the central bank.====Our findings enrich the literature on the parliamentary hearings of central banks, which is relatively scant. Based on a survey conducted on MEPs, Collignon and Diessner (2016) show that the parliamentary hearings of the ECB were key in informing legislators on the policies of the central bank. Similarly to this paper, other works use text analysis to study the interactions between elected representatives and the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the ECB. Schonhardt-Bailey (2013) shows that members of the US Congress tend not to discuss technical aspects of monetary policy with the Federal Reserve, as they are constrained by electoral considerations. Bisbee et al. (2022) identify a gender bias in the congressional scrutiny over the Federal Reserve that emerges when the chair of the central bank is a woman. Sanders et al. (2018) explore the differences between various types of hearings in the UK, including those of the Bank of England, and between hearings in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Ferrara et al. (2021) find that MEPs tend to lower their focus on price stability in their interactions with the ECB following higher rates of unemployment. Fraccaroli et al. (2020) provide a comparative perspective, as they use text analysis to track the topics and sentiments in the hearings of the Bank of England, the ECB and the Federal Reserve. They find that while the hearings tend to focus on the central bank’s objective, the sentiments become more negative when inflation diverts from the central bank aim. Against this background, our work is the first that uses the hearings to study how ideology influences the legislators’ interactions with the central bank.====We also expand the dimensions of ideology in monetary policy. This literature has, so far, focused on a single dimension of ideology, namely the left–right divide (Giesenow and De Haan, 2019; Cahan et al., 2019; Hibbs, 1992; Alesina, 1988). While this divide has proved to be historically relevant (Gethin et al., 2022; Piketty, 2018), existing works in political science point to the emergence of new dimensions that might have superseded this traditional distinction in party politics (Ford and Jennings, 2020; Caughey et al., 2019; Norris, 2019; Kriesi et al., 2008; Inglehart, 2008). New political cleavages have potentially affected the relationship between politicians and independent central banks too. For example, recent works highlighted how populism – rather than the left–right divide – may affect the attitude of politicians towards independent central banks (Agur, 2018; Binder, 2021; Goodhart and Lastra, 2017).====From a broader methodological perspective, our paper also contributes to the scholarship that applies text mining to central banking (for a review see Bholat et al., 2015). Existing works analyse the text of central bank policy announcements and speeches (Lucca and Trebbi, 2009; Born et al., 2014; Tobback et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2019; Ferrara, 2020; Moschella et al., 2020), the minutes of their meetings (Apel and Blix-Grimaldi, 2012; Hansen et al., 2017; Shapiro and Wilson, 2019), or of news and tweets related to central banks (Binder, 2021 and Bianchi et al., 2019 respectively). We provide evidence on a novel database of central bank text which has been largely left unexplored, i.e. the transcripts of central banks’ parliamentary hearings.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a background on the functioning of the hearings and of party politics in the EP.

We document that participation went down disproportionately in towns exposed to higher COVID-19 risk. Towns that lean towards the far-right saw a stronger drop in turnout, in particular in the vicinity of known clusters of infection. We argue that these patterns are partly a result of risk perceptions, and not only of political considerations. We use data on the drop in cinema admissions in early March 2020 and show that these went down more around infection clusters, especially in areas with substantial vote for the far-right. Taken together, our findings suggest that the fear of COVID-19 may have been on average more prevalent among far-right voters, contributing to a drop in their electoral participation.","The first round of the French local elections of 2020 took place on March 14, when the country was just starting to grasp the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. All political parties expressed their support for maintaining the elections but many voters were worried, or plain scared by the health situation.==== The nationwide turnout was 44.75%, 18.8 percentage points lower than the previous elections in 2014. The COVID crisis is remarkable in that it made voting potentially life threatening, for oneself and for the others. While common in many countries, such a situation is unknown for most voters in advanced democracies. The timing of the French local elections also makes it of particular interest. Data on infection at the time were unreliable, the disease transmission was poorly understood and protective equipment (hydroalcoholic gels, face masks) was in short supply. These circumstances provide a unique opportunity to study the factors that made voters respond to an unusual increase in the risk of voting.====Our paper first establishes that towns more exposed to factors of risk linked to the pandemic saw a larger drop in turnout. We construct a group of towns identified as clusters in the media before the elections and of towns connected to these clusters, which we measure by commuting patterns (or alternatively by geographic proximity). Together, these form our group of relatively more exposed towns given the information at the time. We show that the drop in turnout between 2014 and 2020 was significantly higher in exposed towns, in particular if they also had a high proportion of people aged 60 or above, a known risk factor at the time. We also show that, conditional on our covariates, exposed towns had a similar evolution of turnout in previous local elections as the rest of the country, whether their population is old or not. Taken together, this suggests that voters did respond to factors influencing the known risk of voting. We confirm the risk interpretation by additionally looking at the evolution of cinema admissions between early March 2019 and early March 2020. We show that admissions went down relatively more in cinemas close to identified clusters. Going to the cinema is likely orthogonal to the political dimensions determining electoral participation but should strongly reflect the risk perception of going out. The similarity of our results for electoral turnout and cinema admissions points to perceived risk as the main driver of the shift in the former.====We also document the determinant role of political affinity in explaining the subjective perception of the pandemic risk. We find that towns in which Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, came first in the 2017 presidential election (short: “far-right towns”) saw a stronger decrease in turnout, in particular among exposed towns. This result holds conditional on observable measures of the risk and on a number of socio-demographic factors at the town level.==== It is robust across specifications and sub-samples, and cannot be explained by specific pre-trends in participation in far-right towns. One possibility is that far-right voters in France exhibit on average a higher degree of risk aversion, and respond more to the same increase in risk than other towns. Another is that they were more prone to lose faith in the political system due to the COVID-crisis, or were less attached to voting and responded more to a given change in risk perception. To disentangle these two channels, we use our data on cinemas and show that admissions went down more close to identified clusters, particularly so if the surrounding towns were far-right towns. We take these results as suggesting that the subjective perception of the risk of COVID-19 was at the time higher among far-right voters. This can at least partly explain the stronger drop of turnout in far-right towns.====Our analysis relates to the very recent but quickly expanding literature on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral participation for example in regional elections in Spain (====) or presidential election in Malawi (====). A contemporaneous paper by ==== also examines how participation in the French municipal elections of 2020 reacted to the risk of catching the disease. While we differ in our sample and implementation, and put more emphasis on causality, we confirm that participation went down more in towns that were close to identified clusters and particularly so for towns with a high share of older voters. Compared to this literature, our contribution is to identify the key role of the far-right vote in explaining the electoral response to the COVID risk. We argue that a differential perception of risk between far-right voters and others is a likely contributor to the sharp heterogeneity in the drop in participation across the political spectrum.====In that sense, we contribute to the literature linking political preferences to the attitude towards risk or fear. ==== find that, in the United States, Republicans are less likely to social distance, to self-isolate, and to wear masks. ==== argue that the fear of the virus made voters turn to more conservative parties in the French municipal elections, while (====) that voters turned more to nationalistic parties in the Basque country in July 2020. We also relate to the literature in political psychology showing how the need to manage uncertainty or threats correlates with conservatism or extremism (see e.g. ====).====To our knowledge, three other papers look specifically at the context of French local elections in 2020. Two of them study the health impact of the elections, in terms of the spread of the disease (====) and of risk for politicians (====). ==== on the other hand show that strong lock-down restrictions in the spring of 2020 favoured incumbent mayors in the second round of the elections.====Our paper is structured as follows.

It is thus unsurprising that researchers and practitioners have devoted a lot of attention to both the consequences of and reasons behind choosing different currency regimes. However, despite ample research, we still know “surprisingly little about either the causes or consequences of national choices of exchange rate regimes” (Rose 2011, 652).====The most prominent theoretical framework for analyzing exchange rate choices has been based on the optimum currency area (OCA) theory. OCA theory analyzes the costs and benefits of joining a single currency area such as the euro area, but its conclusions carry over to the discussion over fixed versus flexible currency regimes in general (Grittersová 2014, 205; Klein and Shambaugh 2012, 76). The seminal OCA authors identified wage flexibility as a critical criterion determining whether a country should join a geographic domain of a single currency or several currencies whose exchange rates are pegged. As a result, the importance of flexible labor markets has become one of the guiding principles in monetary integration (see, for instance, Goodhart 1998, 419–20). According to De Grauwe (2006), countries should have sufficient flexibility in the labor markets to adjust to asymmetric shocks once they are in a currency union because such flexibility constitutes a viable substitute for nominal currency devaluation. Therefore, one should expect that countries with more flexible labor markets should be more willing to have fixed exchange rate regimes, as labor market flexibility reduces the drawbacks of fixing.====The necessity of labor market flexibility under fixed exchange rate regimes has become part of conventional wisdom in academic and policy circles. A prominent case in point is the advice by the International Monetary Fund to the Southern euro area countries, especially during the sovereign debt crisis, to increase labor market flexibility. For instance, the International Monetary Fund's Program Strategy for Portugal's adjustment to the euro area crisis stated: “In the absence of exchange rate policy, the program seeks an internal devaluation through front-loaded reforms to increase labor market flexibility” (IMF 2011). Given this theoretical and policy consensus, it is surprising that there have not been any attempts in the literature so far to quantitatively investigate the relationship between labor market flexibility and exchange rate regimes. We aim to fill this niche by testing – and finding support – for the hypothesis that countries with more flexible markets will be more likely to have more rigid (fixed) currency regimes.====The next section outlines the previous literature on currency regime choices. We then turn to the theoretical considerations on why the flexibility of labor markets can be an important parameter in a currency regime choice. The exposition of our data and empirical strategy follows. Subsequently, we present the results, followed by robustness checks, including instrumental variable estimations. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the conclusions.",Labor market flexibility and exchange rate regimes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000222,11 March 2022,2022,Research Article,79.0

Studies on financial decentralization look both at its determinants (Oates, 1972; Panizza, 1999; Letelier, 2005; Bodman and Hodge, 2010; Canavire-Bacarreza et al., 2016) and its impacts on other economic factors, including government size, government spending composition, economic growth, regional disparity, governance quality, and corruption (Martinez–Vazquez et al., 2017).==== Increasing rates of financial decentralization policy across the globe imply a more urgent need to understand it (Garman et al., 2001; Hooghe et al., 2010).====In this paper, we re-visit the impact of fiscal decentralization on government size where no consensus has been reached in the extant literature, either in theoretical or empirical terms (Golem, 2010; Martinez–Vazquez et al., 2017) and examine the role of ethnic fragmentation behind such mixed findings. The two contradicting views of the impact of fiscal decentralization on government size are attributed to two different generations of theories of fiscal federalism. The older theory holds that fiscal decentralization is associated with an overall increase in government spending. The theoretical justification is that since fiscal decentralization brings the public jurisdiction closer to the needs and preferences of the local people, it augments the efficiency and quality of governance in public service delivery. This happens especially in the existence of heterogeneity in demand and preferences of public goods and services across jurisdictions (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1972).====Newer theory suggests that fiscal decentralization restricts overall public spending. The main idea behind this hypothesis is that, under decentralization, the mobility of firms and citizens across jurisdictions gives rise to a competitive pressure to reduce the “tax price”. This ultimately results in bringing down the Leviathan monopoly of the government, which otherwise aims to maximize its size of revenues through higher levels of taxation. This brings the local preferences of people closer to the jurisdiction, thereby resulting in less bureaucratic waste of public resources and reducing the overall size of government spending (Oates, 1985; Weingast, 2009).====Both theories focus on local needs and preferences for public goods provision as an explanation for the effects of fiscal decentralization. In this study we use the mediating factor of ethnic fragmentation to bridge these opposing effects. Ethnic fragmentation refers to individuals within a country belonging to many different cultural, linguistic, and/or religious groups (Alesina et al., 1999). Higher ethnic diversity implies heterogeneous preferences, which we might expect would lead to bigger increases in government spending when decentralization occurs than in a more homogenous area (Panizza, 1999; Tanzi, 2000; Dreher et al., 2018).====We test this hypothesis on a panel set of 65 developed and developing countries spanning over the time period of 1972–2013. We find that the impact of financial decentralization on government size is negative in general, but with ethnic fragmentation as a mediating factor, this relation is positive. These key results are robust to the use of alternative indicators, different subsamples, the use of urbanization as an instrument, and other robustness tests.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature, the empirical specification and data are in Section 3, the results are in Section 4, the robustness checks are in Section 5, limitations of this study are outlined in Section 6, and finally, Section 7 concludes.",Revisiting the nexus between fiscal decentralization and government size - The role of ethnic fragmentation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000118,25 February 2022,2022,Research Article,80.0

We answer this question in the context of Italy, where voters are assigned to polling stations according to their address and candidates know how many votes they receive in each polling station. When the number of voters per polling station (voter density) is low, this jeopardises the secrecy of voting and gives politicians an instrument to tightly monitor people. Exploiting variation in voter density across cities and over time, combined with rich data on the results of local elections across all Italian municipalities between 1989 and 2015, we estimate the effect of voter density on electoral competition. We find that when voter density is lower (and secrecy is at greater risk), politicians who are already in office (and can wield stronger retaliatory power) are more likely to retain their post. The analysis addresses the potential endogeneity of voter density. The results are stronger in regions with lower social capital and worse institutions.","The well-functioning of modern democracies rests on the anonymity and secrecy of voting. Casting votes by secret ballot is commonplace around the world and is crucial to prevent illicit practices that may influence the outcome of elections, such as voter intimidation, blackmailing, and vote buying (Norris, 2014). The right to hold elections by secret ballot is enshrined in many international treaties and agreements, including the ====, which states that ”The will of the people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.” (UN, 1948). How do electoral outcomes change when the perception of ballot secrecy falters? In this paper, we explore this question by proposing and empirically investigating a mechanism that jeopardises the secrecy of voting in an advanced industrialised country.====In Italy, voters are assigned to a specific polling station according to their address, and the number of voters per polling station varies. After an election, information on the number of votes obtained by every candidate in each polling station is publicly available. When the number of voters per polling station is low, this may severely limit the secrecy of voting, as recently discussed in the Italian Parliament (Rubino, 2018). A politician who receives fewer votes than expected in a particular area knows with certainty that some of the people who pledged their vote did not keep their promise. In the limiting case, when a politician receives no votes in a given polling station, he or she can be certain that none of the people in a confined geographic area voted for him or her. As a result, s/he can sanction them by being less generous if elected in office, or through other systems of retaliation.==== Such a mechanism may affect voting and is especially likely to have an impact on the outcome of local elections, where candidates have a close relationship with voters and a detailed knowledge of their geographic distribution.====To test this hypothesis, we investigate how the results of municipal elections change when voter density (the average number of voters per polling station within a municipality) decreases and it becomes easier for politicians to detect voters’ behaviour. In particular, based on a simple theoretical model, we hypothesise that lower voter density reduces political contestability by favouring incumbents, who have greater retaliatory power and can therefore benefit the most from being able to monitor voters more tightly. We test this hypothesis on both mayors and city councillors, but focus primarily on the latter, since our proposed mechanism should be strongest when the number of candidates is large (and the number of votes each candidate can expect in a given polling station is low, on average, facilitating monitoring). Indeed, between 1989 and 2015 we find that the average number of votes per polling station received by candidates for the role of councillor is lower than 17 and that over 25% of candidates receive fewer than 10 votes per polling station.====Our empirical analysis exploits variation in the average number of voters per polling station ==== and ==== municipalities (over time), combined with data on all Italian politicians who are in office at the municipal level between 1989 and 1985.==== Our objective is to test how the probability of remaining in office for an incumbent changes with voter density. To address the potential endogeneity of voter density, we propose two complementary IV strategies. The first one is based on the geographic and topographic characteristics of a municipality’s territory, which drive exogenous variation in the number of polling stations between municipalities. The second one uses time-variation in voter density at the regional level to instrument time-variation within individual municipalities.==== The two strategies deliver coherent results, which support the hypothesised mechanism.====We find that lower voter density significantly increases the probability that an incumbent retains office. The effect is sizeable and non-linear: it becomes stronger as density falls, as predicted by our theoretical framework. We also find that lower voter density has a stronger positive impact on the probability that an incumbent retains office in cities with lower levels of social capital and worse institutions. The explanation we advance is that when public institutions are less effective, having the sympathy of politicians is more important to obtain public services that are provided transparently in places with better institutions (e.g., a place in a good school, a consultation in a hospital that would otherwise require a long wait). In other words, in places with worse institutions politicians (and, more prominently so, incumbents) have greater retaliatory power.====This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, that analyses how voter density may limit the secrecy of voting and affect electoral competition. The problem has recently caught the attention of policy makers and a proposal has been made in the Italian Parliament to increase the minimum number of voters who can be assigned to a single polling station (Rubino, 2018). Yet, no study has quantified the impact of this mechanism on electoral results. Furthermore, our findings are relevant well beyond the Italian context, as the broader issue of voter anonymity and ballot secrecy has attracted the interest of a growing literature in a range of countries. Gerber et al. (2013) use survey data from the United States and show that when the perception of ballot secrecy falters voting behaviour may be affected. Similarly, based on survey data from Singapore, Ostwald and Riambau (2017) show that doubts over ballot secrecy can alter voting behaviour even when the vote is secret. They find that, as a result, approximately 8% of the Singaporean electorate votes for the dominant party despite a preference for the opposition. Elklit (2018) shows that issues of voting secrecy can be important even in countries like Sweden, where levels of electoral integrity are among the highest in the world (Norris et al., 2018). Finally, in two related recent papers, Gingerich (2020) and Gingerich and Medeiros (2020) offer interesting investigations into the strategies of Brazilian politicians at a time when the electoral system offered ==== but not ==== ballot secrecy. We contribute to this literature by studying a novel mechanism that can limit ==== ballot secrecy and affect voters’ behaviour, when the voting system is ==== anonymous.====Second, our work contributes to the literature on incumbency advantage. Early work by Gelman and King (1990) and Krebs (1998) highlighted incumbency as a strong predictor of electoral success in the United States. More recently, Trounstine (2011) highlights an incumbency advantage of 32 percentage points at city council elections between 1915 and 1985 in four U.S. cities. In the case of Italy, De Benedetto (2014) documents the existence of an incumbency advantage for mayors. While explaining the origin of such an advantage is beyond the scope of our work, we explore a mechanism that may contribute to consolidate it.====Third, our paper contributes to the expanding literature on the role of social capital for the well-functioning of institutions (e.g., Putnam, 1993). Recent contributions to this literature include the work by Nannicini et al. (2013), who show that, when social capital is higher, voters who share values and beliefs that foster cooperation are more likely to vote based on criteria of social welfare rather than private gain. As a consequence, they are more likely to hold their political representatives accountable and to punish misbehaviour. In a similar vein, Batinti et al. (2017) show that incumbent Italian mayors who carry out a forward-looking and transparent fiscal agenda are more likely to be re-elected where the level of local social capital is larger. Thus, the good conduct of incumbent mayors is rewarded, but only in contexts with more social capital. We contribute to this literature by showing that the adverse effects of lower voter density on electoral competition is stronger in municipalities with lower social capital. Consistent with Nannicini et al. (2013), our findings may be explained by the fact that in areas with higher social capital voters are more likely to vote based on criteria of social welfare and they are less sensitive to the threats of retaliation that may affect their private welfare.====Finally, our work contributes to the recent empirical literature on how different features of political systems affect elections. A number of studies, for instance, focus on the selection of politicians and show how it is affected by wage schemes (Gagliarducci et al., 2010, Gagliarducci and Nannicini, 2013), the use of closed lists (Galasso and Nannicini, 2015), the share of competitive districts (Galasso and Nannicini, 2017), and the voting systems (Gulino, 2021). Beath et al. (2016) are closer to our analysis, since they study the role of district size on electoral outcomes. They find that representatives selected by elections with a single (large) multi-member district are better educated and exhibit less extreme policy preferences. Their analysis, however, does not dwell on the effects of voter density.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our conceptual framework. Section 3 outlines the procedure we have followed to construct our data. Section 4 presents our empirical strategy and discusses our results and Section 5 explores several extensions.

The analysis carried out can be differentiated from its predecessors by its focus on past decisions to perform in-depth reviews and the associated weakly behavioral, political, and institutional factors, which, even though lying outside the scope of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) Scoreboard, may, nevertheless, affect warrant considerations. Thus, this analysis endeavors to identify potential additional determinants of the decision-making process underlying Alert Mechanism Reports (AMRs). To achieve this goal, binary choice models have been used to analyze panel data on EU member states constructed from the initial ten rounds of the MIP. Apart from the expected impact of indicators obtained from the AMRs, the analysis has not provided a sufficient amount of robust and conclusive evidence which would confirm the effect of any specific additional determinant from those that were examined. Factors that showed notable indications of an effect were concurrent reports implying a country-specific economic crisis, positive political preferences within the country toward the EU, and the perceived level of regulatory quality.","At the time of writing this paper, the European Union (EU) had already spent a decade performing the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP), which was first set up in 2011. The EU can, therefore, draw upon considerable experience by means of its own macroeconomic surveillance and coordination mechanism. A crucial point of the procedure is the publishing of the annual Alert Mechanism Report (AMR) by the European Commission (EC), through which the EC may announce warrants to conduct an “in-depth review”, i.e., an additional investigation of a country to address whether it is, in fact, experiencing imbalances and whether any corrective measures are required. Although the AMR features the so-called MIP Scoreboard, which is a set of 14 headline indicators published together with a collection of additional auxiliary indicators that should provide a quantitative underpinning for the entire procedure, the decision to subject a country to an in-depth review (IDR) is not purely mechanical and is left to the discretion of the EC.====In this regard, past research has discussed that the decision-making of policy-makers, committees, and various bureaucratic organizations may be affected by a significant array of additional factors (see McFadden, 1975; Kaarbo, 2008; Arregui and Creighton, 2018; Bjørnskov and Voigt, 2018; McCannon and Hall, 2021) that appear rather contextual to the entire process. From this perspective, the continued and regular conducting of the MIP provides a unique and interesting opportunity to observe the revealed preferences of the EC and to infer which, if any, potential underlying factors are of particular importance during the assessment of countries.====Therefore, the main research question addressed by this paper is as follows: do considered weakly==== behavioral, political, or institutional factors outside the MIP Scoreboard affect the decisions of the EC to issue an IDR warrant? Put differently, this analysis endeavors to answer the question as to whether the EC is confident, autonomous, and unburdened by excessive institutional considerations in its decision-making process on IDR warrants with regard to the potential factors analyzed.====The results of the analysis presented here show that instances of a moderate number of alerts from MIP headline indicators are most likely to affect the probability of an IDR. Furthermore, the notion of state dependence within the decision-making process was confirmed by the vast majority of the models examined. However, the evidence is more ambiguous in cases of excessively high number of alerts, as their effect on the issuing of IDR warrants varies depending on the models used. Similar findings are reported in the case of each examined additional determinant. From the categories of weakly behavioral, political, and institutional factors, some evidence emerges in terms of affecting IDR-related decisions viz. the indicators of Economic Crisis, EU Positive Preferences, and Regulatory Quality. Despite this, the analysis was unable to conclusively demonstrate that any of these have a robust and systematic impact on EC decision-making due to the sensitivity of the estimates.====In light of the results obtained, the contribution of this study to the current literature in the field is threefold: (i) the analysis elaborates on the scarcely examined decision-making process prior to the issuing of a warrant for an IDR; (ii) the paper shifts the paradigm from static to dynamic as it explores the temporal state dependence within the process; (iii) most important of all, the approach used explores how the discretionary decision-making process that occurs before the issuing of IDR warrants is impacted by potential external factors, which can be deemed a unique framework given the current and historical focus in the MIP literature.====The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review of previous studies in the fields of political decision-making and MIP analyses. The relations of the research question, the methodology applied, as well as the models estimated to those used in other studies are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the data used and details their sources at the same time as justifying their consideration in the context of the decision-making process under examination. Section 5 presents and evaluates the results obtained. The sensitivity of the results with regard to various assumptions made throughout the analysis is examined in Section 6.

It empirically establishes that countries characterized by the prevalence of political instability are less likely to adopt progressive income redistribution. Employing data for up to 143 countries between 1996 and 2015, I consistently find evidence that political instability has a negative impact on effective fiscal redistribution, captured by the difference between market and net income inequality. Further analyses indicate that the economic and statistical significance of the redistributive impact of political instability is stronger in non-democratic and highly diverse societies, and low-income economies. Hence, the detrimental effect of political uncertainty on effective fiscal redistribution appears to hold only in non-democratic, fragmented and low-income countries. The findings imply that reducing political instability contributes to establishing an egalitarian redistribution of income, potentially leading to less income inequality.","A central line of thought in the comparative development literature attempts to investigate the relationship between political institutions and economic performance (Barro, 1996; Tavares and Wacziarg, 2001; Acemoglu et al., 2019). It is widely acknowledged that political instability or uncertainty is a major impediment to fostering economic development across the globe (Jong-A-Pin, 2009).==== More specifically, stable political systems play a key role in maintaining social order and implementing sound economic policies, thereby promoting investment and long-run economic growth (Azzimonti, 2011). Part of the explanation for this hypothesis holds that uncertainty associated with a country's political environment shortens policymakers' horizons, leading to sub-optimal macroeconomic policies. Furthermore, politically unstable economies are characterized by frequently changing policies, which induce greater volatility and retard economic growth. On the empirical side, many studies provide suggestive evidence that political instability hampers investment and economic growth (see, for instance, Alesina et al., 1996; Carmignani, 2003; Jong-A-Pin, 2009; Julio and Yook, 2012; Aisen and Veiga, 2013). Other scholars reveal that political instability is associated with various dimensions of socio-economic underdevelopment, including, but not limited to, financial backwardness (Roe and Siegel, 2011), environmental underperformance (Bohn and Deacon, 2000; Fredriksson and Svensson, 2003; Fredriksson and Wollscheid, 2014), increased public debt (Alesina and Tabellini, 1990), tax distortions (Battaglini and Coate, 2008; Yared, 2010), and inefficient tax systems (Cukierman et al., 1992).====This study aims to improve our understanding of the role of political instability in shaping economic performance across the world by investigating its influence on income redistribution. Empirical evidence of political factors shaping the extent to which a country can establish an egalitarian redistribution of income is relevant for combating income inequality, which remains a major social issue in many societies across the globe. Indeed, the main inquiry of the current study builds upon the well-established literature on the causes and consequences of income inequality (Alesina and Perotti, 1996; Berg et al., 2018; Furceri and Ostry, 2019). However, previous studies exploring the inequality-development nexus do not clearly differentiate between various types of inequality (Jäntti et al., 2020). For example, net inequality, which represents disparities in disposable income or consumption, is crucial for examining welfare policies. Meanwhile, the fraction of income accruing to the top percentiles of the income distribution typically reflects market-based inequality (Leigh, 2007). For this reason, it is important to consider the difference between market and net income inequality.====Achieving a more equal distribution of income critically depends on the government's ==== and ==== to implement progressive redistributive policies and measures, such as taxes, transfers and fiscal policies (Ravallion, 2010). Importantly, fiscal redistribution is a key instrument that helps reduce market inequality. There also exists substantial variation in the adoption of redistributive policies and measures around the globe. In addition, the influence of fiscal redistribution on income inequality differs remarkably between world economies. For example, redistribution has reduced income inequality by approximately 50% in Denmark, but the figures for the United States and Chile are roughly 20% and 10%, respectively.==== Indeed, previous studies have predominantly focused on understanding the influence of market inequality (Milanovic, 2000; Houle, 2017; Jäntti et al., 2020) and globalization (Gozgor & Ranjan, 2017; Pleninger and Sturm, 2020) on income redistribution. However, empirical evidence on the redistributive impact of political instability remains hard to find. Against this background, this paper attempts to examine whether uncertainty associated with a country's political regimes matters for progressive income redistribution.====A major challenge with identification of the influence of political instability on economic development relates to possible endogeneity concerns. In particular, political instability is interrelated with and jointly determined by development outcomes, making it difficult to isolate its contribution to driving worldwide differences in economic performance. To address this concern, a system GMM estimator developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) has been widely applied in the existing literature to draw statistical inference on the impacts of political instability on economic growth and development (Jong-A-Pin, 2009; Aisen and Veiga, 2013). This method employs internal instruments to address endogeneity issues.==== However, uncertainty associated with a country's political systems plausibly has a persistent influence on economic development (Vu, 2021a). This could invalidate the moment conditions that a system GMM estimator relies on for consistent inference (Vu, 2022). Furthermore, Bazzi and Clemens (2013) raise concerns about weak instrument bias in many studies in the empirical growth literature applying the system GMM estimator. In this regard, a key contribution of the current study lies in identification of the influence of political instability on income redistribution. In particular, I attempt to isolate a plausibly exogenous source of variation of political instability for each country in a given year based on the prevalence of political instability in geographically or culturally proximate economies. This empirical exercise is motivated by Grechyna (2018) who empirically establishes evidence of the cross-border diffusion of political instability. Specifically, Grechyna (2018), by using data for 140 world economies, indicates that the level of political instability in neighboring countries has a positive influence on a country's own political instability. Building upon Grechyna (2018), this paper exploits the prevalence of political instability in geographically or culturally proximate countries to generate the plausibly exogenous component of political instability that helps explain worldwide disparities in income redistribution. To achieve causal inference, I adopt numerous methods of constructing the instrumental variable to mitigate plausible concerns about weak instrument bias, and the validity of the exclusion restriction.====An additional issue is to obtain an internationally comparable measure of progressive income redistribution. To capture the worldwide variation in fiscal redistribution, previous studies have mainly employed welfare expenditure, including public spending on health and education, and welfare transfers. These measures, however, do not necessarily reflect redistribution of income from high- to low-income earners (Kenworthy and Pontusson, 2005).==== In addition, Ross (2006) indicates that social spending may fail to reach a country's impoverished groups. Consistent with previous studies exploring the causes and consequences of income redistribution, a final contribution of this study is to use a comprehensive dataset on income inequality provided by Solt (2020) to construct internationally comparable measures of redistribution (Houle, 2017; Berg et al., 2018; Jäntti et al., 2020; Pleninger and Sturm, 2020). A recent study by Berg et al. (2018) attempts to identify the impact of redistribution on economic growth across countries. This paper complements the empirical analyses of Berg et al. (2018) by providing a plausible contributory explanation for the variation in income redistribution across the world.====To preview the main findings, I consistently find evidence that countries with greater political instability are less likely to implement progressive income redistribution, holding other things equal. The results are insensitive to controlling for several potential confounding characteristics and using different methods of isolating the plausibly exogenous component of political uncertainty. Exploring potential heterogeneity in the core findings, I demonstrate that the negative influence of political instability on income redistribution appears to hold only in non-democratic and highly diverse countries, and low-income societies. The remainder of the study proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the main hypotheses. Section 3 presents data and methods of identification.

This paper revisits the design of the Stability and Growth Pact’s debt rule in the context of two debates on fiscal policies: first, the implications of the low interest environment for debt sustainability and the appropriate interaction of fiscal and ==== and, second, the reform of the EU fiscal governance framework. In both debates the choice of government debt anchor and the speed of adjustment take centre stage. The debt rule appears predestined to fulfil the role of debt anchor. However, our analysis shows that its existing design gives rise to a pro-cyclical bias that has hampered its implementation in a low-growth and ==== environment. We propose two parametric changes to better balance the objectives of ==== stabilisation and debt sustainability: first, accounting for persistent deviations of inflation from the central bank’s target; and, second, a reduced speed of adjustment. Putting a reformed debt rule at the centre of the EU fiscal governance framework would allow reducing the latter’s complexity without the need to revise the EU Treaties.","Government debt ratios are set to increase significantly in the wake of COVID-19. An intensified stabilisation-sustainability trade-off is therefore to be expected in the coming years – notably in countries with high government debt ratios – since fiscal policies will need to square the goals of supporting the post-crisis recovery while addressing debt overhangs.====) and scarce historical examples of debt adjustments based on persistent and very large primary budgetary surpluses (see, e.g., ====) suggest that feasibility constraints need to be reflected in the parametrisation of fiscal rules in order to ensure political implementability. At the same time, the literature on the political economy of budgetary institutions typically finds that stronger budgeting procedures and more stringent fiscal rules contribute to fiscal discipline and restrain government debt (e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====).==== recently argued that a longer-term outlook of (safe) interest rates below GDP growth rates implies that the issuance of public debt comes without fiscal costs. In the absence of a binding inter-temporal budget constraint welfare costs of issuing public debt may be low, calling for a reassessment of appropriate debt policies and fiscal frameworks (====). The theoretical literature in general suggests a low pace of debt adjustment is optimal in the absence of sovereign risk (see, e.g., ==== and ====). However, if public debt is perceived as risky, the presence of multiple equilibria and possible expectation-driven increases in interest rates may call for a relatively swift adjustment to prudent levels of debt (see, e.g., ====; ====; ==== and ====). This latter point is particularly relevant for European Monetary Union (EMU), where several countries have experienced significant and volatile spreads vis-à-vis the German Bund since the financial crisis, suggesting that sovereign risk considerations need to be factored in when designing optimal debt policies in EMU.====While there is thus a controversial debate in the theoretical literature on the optimal design of debt feedback rules, there is widespread agreement that debt rather than deficits should have the anchoring function in fiscal rules. Also, there seems to be an emerging consensus in the policy domain that a revised fiscal framework should be centred on such a debt anchor but combined with an operational target in the form of an expenditure rule (see, e.g., ==== and ====). At first sight, this would suggest that the EU fiscal framework’s debt rule introduced in 2011 should take centre stage in a reform towards simplification of the framework, which is widely seen as necessary (see e.g. ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ==== and ====), leading to complaints that strict implementation of the debt rule would be self-defeating (see e.g. ====, p. 15)==== from the central bank’s price stability objective. We show that the overshooting of inflation in a number of EMU Member States ahead of the financial crisis created a false impression of safety, while the undershooting of inflation after the crisis in several EMU Member States significantly tightened requirements under the existing debt rule. In both situations the existing debt rule was not consistent with an effective backing of fiscal policy for monetary policy in the latter’s pursuit of its price stability objective.====We propose a set of parametric changes to the SGP debt rule with a view to better integrating macroeconomic stabilisation considerations and longer-term fiscal sustainability concerns. The former are taken into account through a “nominal” cyclical adjustment which corrects for fluctuations of nominal GDP growth around a country’s real GDP growth potential and the ECB’s price stability objective.==== The proposed approach goes beyond the current method by not only removing the impact of the (real) cyclical components of headline budget balances but also adjusting the accumulation of debt for snowball effects related to nominal growth diverging from the real GDP growth potential plus a 2% trend inflation component. This serves two purposes. First, adjusting the accumulation of debt for positive and negative deviations from trend inflation reinforces the counter-cyclical modulation of adjustment requirements. Second, if implemented and adhered to, our approach would help to better align fiscal policies in euro area Member States with the ECB’s monetary policy objective to achieve price stability, thereby promoting a better macroeconomic policy-mix. Using a standard New Keynesian framework, ==== show that a fiscal policy rule that targets both output and inflation gaps counter-cyclically increases welfare by reducing the frequency of lower bound episodes and related economic distortions.====Simulation analysis for euro area countries suggests that the proposed “nominal” cyclical adjustment would significantly smoothen adjustment requirements compared to the status quo without impairing the debt sustainability objective. Our simulations also suggest that for countries with very high debt the “1/20” adjustment speed of the current framework becomes particularly demanding when growth is persistently low. Therefore, in order to avoid that fiscal adjustment becomes self-defeating, the speed of adjustment under the debt rule could be reduced from currently 5% of the distance to the debt reference value to, for example, 3%. In order to assess the sensitivity of our simulations to the underlying macroeconomic assumptions we show two “low for long” scenarios which assume that inflation and interest rates, respectively, remain at the presently low levels for an extended period of time. Given that our “nominal” cyclical adjustment approach filters out the cumulative impact of inflation differentials vis-à-vis 2%, the resulting adjustment requirements are insulated from inflation shocks.====Our paper offers the following lessons for the debate on reforming the EU fiscal framework. First, our proposal for a reform of the SGP’s debt rule offers a way to address its economic weaknesses and to put it at the centre of a revised EU fiscal framework. All other elements of the framework should be made consistent with the newly designed debt rule. For example, the so-called medium term objectives should be adjusted to be consistent with achieving the debt target at the recommended speed of adjustment, and the same applies for an expenditure rule should this be made the operational target. Our paper is agnostic on whether a structural balance rule or a expenditure rules should be made the single operational target under a revised framework; both would work in principle if aligned with the requirements of our debt rule proposal, which would provide the anchor.====Second, focussing the fiscal framework on the achievement of a debt target would create fiscal space compared to the current framework.==== and  ====), this would risk in a further complication rather than simplification of the framework. A symmetric treatment of the 60% of GDP reference level, by implying convergence towards the fiscal anchor also from below, may be an alternative way to create budgetary room for additional investment, and this without the need for special exemptions. Such symmetric treatment could also be useful in a situation where monetary policy reaches the effective lower bound and debt dynamics move towards an undershooting of the debt target as was the case in a number of euro area countries before the COVID-19 crisis. Fiscal policy would thus support monetary policy in such circumstances, allowing the latter to achieve its goal faster and with fewer side effects (====).====Third, our proposal does not require revisions of EU primary law. Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which focusses on the identification of “gross policy errors”, would not need to be amended, and the 60% of GDP debt reference value would be preserved. Instead, secondary ==== would need to be adjusted to give more prominence to the debt rule and to amend its parametrisation. In addition, the medium-term objectives – if retained – should be modified such as to ensure consistency with the desired speed of adjustment to the debt target, and the same would apply for the expenditure benchmark — again, if retained.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section ==== first discusses the economic literature on the optimal pace of debt adjustment and presents a stylised model that highlights the main economic trade-offs. These are then linked to the basic setup of the SGP’s debt rule. A description of the current framework is then provided in Section ==== before turning to our proposal for a “nominal” cyclical adjustment approach and comparing it to the status quo. Section ==== explains the simulation approach and presents backward- and forward-looking debt simulations for selected euro area countries, highlighting the impact of a number of changes both to the parametric settings of the debt rule as well as the underlying macroeconomic assumptions. Conclusions are drawn in Section ====.====See ====, ====, ====, ====.",Debt policies in the aftermath of COVID-19 — The SGP’s debt benchmark revisited,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268022000064,31 January 2022,2022,Research Article,85.0

I exploit the roll-out of three gender quota policies governing Italian municipal elections to answer this question. The quotas institute minimum legal levels of female representation in the lists of councilor candidates and in the municipal governments' executive bodies, but do not directly target mayoral positions. Therefore, their ability to promote female political leadership entirely depends on whether they induce a broader increase in female representation in municipal governments beyond that mechanically required by the law. Using event-study and regression discontinuity methods, I decompose the aggregate effects of the quotas into mechanical effects, driven by compliance with the law, and additional impacts, or “acceleration effects.” The reforms have increased the share of female politicians in the less senior government positions beyond the minimum legal level, but there is no evidence of effects on the mayoral position. I also find no evidence of effects on female mayoral candidacies or on electoral support for female mayoral candidates. I conclude that the acceleration effects produced by the quotas have been too weak to advance female political leadership in municipal governments.","Despite the popularity of gender quota systems for promoting female participation in local politics in most member countries of the European Union,==== as of 2021 just 17.4% of these countries' mayors and municipal-council chiefs were women (EIGE).==== This unsatisfactory outcome calls into question whether quota systems can effectively promote female political leadership in local governments.====Gender quotas reserve for women a certain share of the open posts in electoral lists of councilor candidates and government bodies. By design, they increase female representation in the bodies in which they are applied to the minimum legal levels they institute. Originally, gender quotas were thought of as temporary policies to be removed once political systems transitioned to an equilibrium with equitable political representation of men and women. To evaluate progress in this transition, it is essential to investigate whether the quotas increase female representation in municipal governments just up to the legal minimum level or beyond. I will distinguish between the “mechanical effects” of the quotas, generated by compliance with the law, and the spillover effects, or “acceleration effects”--following the terminology of O'Brien and Rickne (2016), generated by additional changes in the behavior of voters, female politicians, and male-dominated political elites. The quotas may break gender stereotypes and cultural norms about the role of women in society (Beaman et al., 2009; De Paola, Scoppa, and Lombardo 2010); create a critical mass of female politicians able to influence key appointments in governments; reduce the scope for political elites' discriminatory practices; attract highly qualified women to politics (Baltrunaite et al., 2014; Weeks and Baldez 2015; Besley et al., 2017); and encourage the use of gender-inclusive recruitment processes. As the typical gender quota systems in the European Union do not directly target top government offices, their ability to promote female political leadership entirely depends on the strength of the acceleration effects they generate.====This paper investigates the ability of gender quota systems to promote the election of female mayors. I exploit the roll-out of three gender quota policies, implemented in 1993, 2013, and 2014, respectively, governing Italian municipal elections that each instituted minimum standards of female representation in electoral lists of councilor candidates or municipal governments’ executive bodies. Using administrative data on politicians elected in municipal governments provided by the Italian Ministry of the Interior and using a combination of event-study and regression discontinuity (RD) approaches, I decompose the aggregate effects of the quotas into their mechanical effects–the minimum change in female representation in municipal governments induced by the quotas under perfect compliance–and, residually, their acceleration effects. Then, I evaluate the strength of the acceleration effects by investigating the causal effect of these policies on the probability that women are elected or appointed to a range of municipal government positions with increasing degrees of decision-making power and responsibility: councilors (least power and responsibility), executive councilors, vice mayors, and mayors (most power and responsibility).====I find evidence that the three policies increased female representation in the lists of councilor candidates and the governments’ executive bodies beyond the minimum legal level and that acceleration effects explain between 25% and 44% of the aggregate effects. However, acceleration effects are concentrated in less senior government positions: the quotas increase the share of female councilors and executive councilors, but the evidence of an effect on the probability to select a female vice mayor is mixed, and there is no evidence of an effect on the probability to elect a female mayor, although these estimates are imprecise and I cannot rule out the existence of sizable effects. I also find no evidence that the three policies have different effects in historically left- and right-wing municipalities, nor that the effect on senior government positions is more pronounced in municipalities with larger impacts on less senior government positions. Additionally, there is no evidence that the quotas incentivized females to launch mayoral candidacies or increased electoral support for female mayoral candidates. Overall, the evidence indicates that the acceleration effects produced by the three Italian quota policies have been too weak to break the glass ceiling for female politicians.====These results are consistent with previous studies finding that gender quotas applied to local elections in European countries boost female representation in local governments (Schwindt-Bayer 2009; De Paola, Scoppa, and Lombardo 2010; Baltrunaite et al., 2019; Bagues and Campa 2021) but do not affect mayoral positions (Baltrunaite et al., 2019; Bagues and Campa 2021====). However, my findings appear inconsistent with two studies finding a positive effect of the quotas on female political leadership in Italian (De Paola, Scoppa, and Lombardo 2010) and Swedish (O'Brien and Rickne 2016) municipalities. Compared to De Paola, Scoppa, and Lombardo (2010), which investigates the first Italian quota system, my study employs a different methodological approach and finds evidence against the existence of an effect on female mayors. I reconcile the apparent inconsistency with O'Brien and Rickne (2016) by discussing three potential explanations for the emergence of an effect in Sweden but not in Italy. First, female labor force participation rate in Sweden is 42% higher than in Italy (====), suggesting that Italian women face higher barriers to taking up high-responsibility jobs. Second, interest groups, including women's clubs, can attend and monitor the recruitment process of candidate politicians in Sweden (O'Brien and Rickne 2016), while in Italy the selection of politicians is highly informal and plausibly conducive to the persistence of discriminatory practices. Third, the Swedish quotas were spontaneously adopted by male-dominated parties facing the harsh competition of strong feminist movements demanding that half of all political power be allocated to women (O'Brien and Rickne 2016), which, in line with the interparty-competition theory described by Weeks (2018), gave them strong incentives to increase female representation in their ranks. By contrast, the Italian quotas were not demanded by bottom-up movements but were legislated by the parliament to align with international guidelines. This discussion sheds light on the necessary conditions for acceleration effects: a highly functional labor market for women, systems for monitoring prejudiced political actors, and a strong civil society engaged in defending gender equality. The low share of female political leaders in local governments in the EU27 countries suggests these conditions are rarely met.====This paper closely relates to the work of De Paola, Scoppa, and Lombardo (2010) and Baltrunaite et al. (2019), studying the first and second Italian gender quota systems, respectively. With respect to these studies, I use a different methodological approach and analyze how the effect of the quotas is distributed over the entire range of government positions, including the previously excluded yet prestigious office of the vice mayor. This inclusion also allows me to study two types of government offices (the vice mayor and the mayor) that are only affected by the acceleration effects of the quotas and not by the mechanical effects. Robust effects for these two positions would be evidence of strong acceleration effects.====More broadly, this study contributes to the literature on the effectiveness of gender quotas in three ways. First, I propose a simple yet rigorous test for acceleration effects based on the specific requirements of the three gender quota systems. Second, by analyzing how the effect of the quotas is distributed over a range of government positions in hierarchical order, I am able to characterize in detail the reallocation of decision-making power within municipal governments after these reforms. Third, I contribute to an open debate in the literature by providing additional evidence on the impact of gender quotas on female political leadership in municipal governments and offering insights about the conditions favoring the emergence of such impacts.====My findings suggest that gender quota systems which reserve to women open posts in electoral lists of councilor candidates and municipal governments’ executive bodies may not alone increase the probability that a woman will be elected as mayor. Countries interested in rapidly increasing their share of female mayors should consider implementing reservation policies directly targeting top municipal government positions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Using only parts of German research institutes’ business cycle reports that deal with economic policy advice as an example, we extract sections from these reports dealing with monetary and fiscal policy issues from 1999 to 2020. To these corpora, we apply methods of unsupervised text scaling (Slapin and Proksch, 2008; Lauderdale and Herzog, 2016), namely ==== and ","Economics as a social science rests inevitably on the normative preferences and political standpoints of the involved scientists and, consequently, research institutions like university departments and institutes. The factual or perceived political point of view of social scientists in general and economists, in particular, is of relevance for a couple of reasons: First, it may influence the research process itself. Economists might be more or less open to new ideas depending on who proposed them. For example, in an experimental setting, Javdani and Chang (2019) show, that economists’ agreement to a statement depends on whether they suppose it stems from a “mainstream” economist or not. Also, Kirchgässner (2011) argues that the interpretation of econometric results strongly depends on a priori beliefs from the respective research field: economists believe in a deterrence effect of capital punishment, whereas researchers from other fields do not. Second, economists still see themselves to a notable extent as part of theoretical or political schools of thought. In a survey among German forecasters, Döpke et al. (2019) find that a large fraction of the respondents subscribes to a school of thought that is often linked to particular political views, such as the “Keynesian”, “monetarist”, and similar ways of thinking. Recently, van Dalen (2019) surveyed Dutch economists and found that their personal values have an impact on their economic and methodological choices. Third, the ideology of an institution possibly influences how consumers or firms form their expectations. For example, based on a survey among consumers, Bachmann et al. (2021) show that their inflation expectations differ between U.S. states, according to changes in the White House occupant and depending on whether Republicans or Democrats dominate the state. More recently, it has become clear that this is not only the case for economic news: In the U.S., according to Cookson et al. (2020), Democrats have been much more concerned about the coronavirus than Republicans, and, therefore, the latter have been more bullish on U.S. stocks. Hence, if the public sees a particular institute at least partially as representing a certain political group or camp (Geiger et al., 2009), the expectations of economic agents will respond differently to the forecast or the policy advice of the institute.====Given the possible importance of the ideology of economists, the question arises, how to measure this concept to make it possible to test some hypotheses mentioned above empirically. To this end, we use computer-based text analysis methods that have recently been successfully applied to related problems in other fields like political science. In particular, we use ==== and ==== approaches.====We refer to institutes that forecast the development of the German business cycle. This choice is motivated by the possibility of forecasts as a tool to promote political beliefs: “The politics of expectations: Forecasts as politics” (Beckert, 2013 p. 237). In a broader perspective, Hirschman and Berman (2014) emphasize, among other aspects, the role of institutions in explaining the influence of economists on politics, which relates to our focus on the forecasting institutes. Furthermore, they note that reporting, for example, the Gross Domestic Product on a regular basis draws the public attention to certain aspects of social reality: “no equivalent device brings income inequality, for example, to the forefront of our minds each quarter” (Hirschman and Berman, 2014 p. 800). Therefore, the specific economic style of thinking helps to explain the alleged large influence of economics on the choice of policies. Saint-Paul (2013) provides reasoning on how forecasters with a given political agenda (i.e. being more “pro state/market” or “contra state/market”) may use models to influence macroeconomic outcomes according to their preferences. Also, from a sociological perspective, Reichmann (2018) analyses the distribution and communication of economic forecasts and its influence on, among other things, governments’ decisions and developments in a market economy. Saint-Paul (2018) elaborates on the trade-offs that forecasters with political preferences face: on the one hand, they intend to achieve properties of the model that matches their position. For example, a more left-leaning researcher may try to model the economy in a way that implies a large fiscal multiplier or a flat Phillips curve. On the other hand, the model still has to match the data. This leads to certain conditions a model has to match to be coherent.====We apply the selected text-minig methods to a sub-corpus of policy-related parts of business cycle forecast reports published regularly by five German economic research institutes plus the ones by a working group of so-called “leading” research institutes in a joint effort (“Joint Diagnosis”, ====). The analyses refer to those parts of the reports only, in which the institutes analyse monetary and fiscal policy issues, including advisory text passages and sections. We define a debate as all reports published in a calendar year by the research institutes and the ====. All business cycle reports have a very similar structure and all institutes discuss both policy fields in a macroeconomic context (the texts are parts of business cycle reports). Our identification framework, therefore, assumes that there is only one latent dimension by institute, which we loosely frame as “ideology”. Given this identification strategy, we analyse how certain debate-specific positions – a linear combination of debate- and institute-specific effects – evolve over time, and how this is related to the general policy environment and other factors.====From a methodological perspective, this paper aims at evaluating whether the ====/==== model provides information on the ideological position of institutes related to economic policy advice. Information on a possible ideological bias of economic policy texts, in turn, can provide valuable information on the influence of ideology on policy prescriptions (Jelveh et al., 2018). In this regard, the paper adds to the general research on the positions of economists regarding economic policy.====Based on reports from 1999 to 2020 provided by five institutes, we find that, on average over the entire sample, text mining results meet the conventional wisdom insofar as the Berlin institute (DIW) and the Kiel institute (IfW) are the institutes farthest located from each other on an imaginary one-dimensional ideological scale. Looking at the results in more detail, we find a large variation over time: the ideological sound of an institute changes, as the circumstances and debates change. Furthermore, the development of the debate-specific positions differs considerably between texts related to monetary and fiscal policy, respectively. Both results suggest that research relying on the assumption of an “once-and-forever” ideological tonality of an institute might be too simplistic. We find an increased polarization of the debate-specific positions over monetary policy, but not over fiscal policy, where the debates have always been quite polarized. During the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we observe a narrowing of positions with respect to fiscal policy but not necessarily with respect to monetary policy.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the measurement of ideology in economics and neighbouring fields and the role text-mining methods play in this context.

Most local leaders were reluctant to impose lockdowns at the beginning of the pandemic, because their ==== rely on posting strong numbers for economic growth in their region, while lockdowns can suppress growth. Once the nation's top leader warned that local leaders who failed to control the disease would be removed from office, many rapidly implemented resolute measures. However, we find that local leaders with larger promotion incentives were still more likely to downplay the virus by avoiding or minimizing lockdowns.","Local leaders in China play a central role in providing public goods, managing socio-economic affairs, and therefore in dealing with major crises. However, in many large-scale crises, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, even though resolute actions by local leaders, such as lockdowns, would create positive externalities for other jurisdictions and would benefit the nation as a whole, local bureaucrats in many countries were accused of being slow to act because of political career concerns.==== Despite the torrent of studies on the consequences of COVID-19 and the widely implemented lockdown policies (e.g., ====), research on the political economy of government interventions during the pandemic is still scant.====, the ==== probability of promotion predicted by using their inauguration age and political hierarchy level. We find that Chinese prefectural leaders with larger career incentives were more reluctant to implement lockdowns at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.====However, most prefectural leaders swiftly changed their stance after the nation's top leader, Xi Jinping, sternly warned that failure to control the disease could hamper their career advancement and potentially lead to their removal from office, making pandemic response a ==== “one-item-veto” task for their promotion.==== Most prefectural leaders quickly responded to Xi's warning by implementing resolute lockdown measures. Despite this general pattern, we document an interesting finding that prefectural leaders with larger career incentives were still more willing to put public health at risk by minimizing lockdowns. We construct prefecture-week-level panel data to unearth the interaction of Xi's warning and local Chinese leaders' career incentives on their anti-pandemic policy measures. On the extensive margin, we find that the pattern depicted in the cross-sectional regression remains: a one-standard-deviation increase in a prefectural leader's career incentive reduced the probability of locking down the prefecture after Xi's speech by over 11 percentage points during our sample period. On the intensive margin, using within-prefecture human mobility (offered by the Baidu migration index) to proxy for lockdown stringency as in ====, we find that a prefecture's lockdown measure was significantly laxer if its party secretary had a larger career incentive.====One rationalized explanation of Chinese prefectural leaders’ behavior is that they might have formed the belief from their experience with SARS that the importance of pandemic control to promotion, as emphasized by the central government, was only temporary, and that after the black swan event, economy-related factors would resume a decisive role in their career advancement. To investigate this, we first show that the tradeoff facing local leaders, between pandemic control and developing the local economy, also existed during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2003, where leaders with larger promotion incentives also tended not to order lockdowns. In addition, we find that prefectural governments were more likely to order looser COVID-19 lockdowns if their leaders had experienced lockdowns during SARS, which in general were substantially laxer than those imposed during COVID-19 due to the difference in infection rate and spreading speed of the two viruses. In addition, our data show that no prefectural party secretary incumbent during SARS was actually punished for imposing loose lockdown measures. The evidence documented above supports our interpretation that leaders who had experienced SARS lockdowns might have formed the belief that they could downplay this new virus, just as former prefectural leaders had done during SARS.====Our findings highlight the difference in crisis responses implemented in China and other countries. In democracies, local leaders might hesitate to take crisis-response actions if concerned that such actions would be unpopular to voters; in authoritarian states like China, where their evaluation by upper-level officials is based on KPIs, such as their jurisdictions’ economic growth (====; ====; ====; ====), local leaders can be reluctant to act if they fear that such policy changes would negatively affect their career advancement.====There has been debate over the uneven effectiveness of the provision of public goods and services in centralized vs. decentralized organizations (e.g., ====; ====; ====). The phenomenon exposed in our paper, where in order to compete with their peers for promotion, local Chinese leaders tended to trade public health for better economic growth to be promoted, sheds light on this by emphasizing the potential pitfalls of dealing with large-scale crises that have huge cross-regional externalities in a fully decentralized manner.====This paper joins the literature on the theory of self-interested bureaucrats (====; ====; ====; ====). Like most other people, bureaucrats pursue private interests, which can conflict with their role as public decision-makers to do a public favor. This situation would become even worse in the absence of local accountability and monitoring within hierarchies. We provide a novel empirical case to reveal local leaders' self-interest motivations in China.

Overall, this study sheds new light on the determinants of firms’ emissions behaviors in a typical emerging economy.","Over the past twenty-five years, one of China's most widely debated aspects has been environmental protection (Chen et al., 2013; Kahn et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2016). Given that pollution imposes substantial negative impacts on human health and various economic outcomes, such as shortened lives, infant mortality, production, and productivity (Greenstone, 2002; Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Ebenstein et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018), the importance of environmental protection has brought emission reductions to the awareness of policymakers and media worldwide. However, policies on emissions reductions usually bring short-term effects, and China's environmental problems have not been substantially improved (Chen et al., 2018). Therefore, in developing countries like China, where economic growth has been the focus, how can local bureaucrats be motivated to implement an emission control policy?====This study investigates how political incentives shape industrial firms' air pollution behavior. Although the literature has extensively documented the effects of political incentives on various economic outcomes,==== research on the environmental consequences of political incentives is still in its infancy (Jia, 2017; Chen et al., 2018). Given that the activities of industrial firms are the primary sources of pollution,==== an evaluation of the causal effects of political incentives on industrial firms’ pollution should be of particular interest to economists and regulators, who are concerned with how to reduce pollution emissions.====However, although anecdotal evidence suggests a potential link between political incentives and firm pollution,==== identifying the causal effects of political incentives on air pollution is challenging. The incentives of local governments on environmental protection and pollution are endogenously determined and unobserved in most cases. This study overcomes identification difficulty by introducing a quasi-natural experiment in China, in which the central government changed the rules of political promotion. It provided local officials with strong incentives to reduce specific indicators of air pollution in 2005 (which is the Eleventh Five-Year Plan [FYP], which will be discussed in detail in Section 2.1). Local officials, who sought to be promoted within the Chinese political promotion system, were motivated to make greater efforts to reduce air pollution and comply with these new environmental targets. Throughout this study, we refer to “political incentives” or “political promotion incentives” as political incentives related to environmental protection.====China is an ideal setting to conduct our study. First, China is one of the world's most populous countries and the leading manufacturing hub globally. Given the higher share in the manufacturing sector relative to the service sector, air pollution is substantial in China. Furthermore, pollution's social and economic consequences are also more severe given the limited health care resources and pollution regulation ability in developing countries. Thus, finding ways to control environmental pollution in developing countries such as China is urgent. Second, China has a complex system of formal and informal divisions of authority between the central government and various levels of local and regional governments. Although the central government maintains its political authority over environmental planning, most fundamental enforcement decision-making and responsibilities have been allocated to local and regional governments (Zhang et al., 2018). Thus, politicians under the authoritarian political system of China are strongly incentivized because official promotion is the only route available for elite politicians to reach the upper levels of the political hierarchy (Kong et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2020), providing an ideal scenario to examine the effect of political promotion incentives on environmental protection. Third, significant heterogeneity in air pollution is found across space and time in China, making it a good case to study pollution. For example, according to the official air quality level classification, the proportion of days with high air pollution in Beijing was more than 30% in our sample period. By contrast, this proportion was only approximately 2% in Shenzhen.====We measure toxic emissions (i.e., sulfur dioxide) at the firm level by obtaining a unique and comprehensive data set (i.e., Pollution of Industrial Firms Database [PIFD]) from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China (MEEPR) or the former Ministry of Environmental Protection. This data set includes the pollution information of all industrial firms monitored by MEEPR, which has conducted annual surveys of industrial firms in China since 1998. To the best of our knowledge, this data set is the most representative firm-level toxic emission data set in China. PIFD comprises detailed information on firms' toxic emissions, including industrial waste gas; industrial sulfur dioxide (SO====), industrial dust, and industrial nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions; and ammonia nitrogen emission. To obtain the firm-level control variables, we introduce the Annual Survey of Industrial Firms (ASIF), which is another industrial firm database in China and widely used in China-related studies, which is from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China.====By combining the unique data and the policy shock in China (i.e., the central government's regime shifting in evaluating local officials for promotion), we examine the effect of political promotion incentives on firms' toxic emissions based on a difference-in-differences (DID) approach with fixed effects at the firm, province, and year levels to control for the potential confounding factors. Our baseline DID estimation presents strong evidence that the changes of local political promotion incentives significantly decrease firms' toxic emissions, and the regression coefficient is significantly negative at the 1% level. That is, sulfur dioxide (SO====) decreased considerably after China's central government started to tie officials' promotion chances to this indicator of air pollution in 2006.====The validity of our DID estimation hinges on an important assumption that the treatment group (i.e., firms in high pollution reduction target provinces) would have followed the same trend as the control group (i.e., firms in low pollution reduction target provinces) without the policy change. We address this assumption by testing for the parallel pre-event trends in the outcome variables across the treatment and control groups using a dynamic DID approach. We find evidence consistent with the parallel trend assumption. In particular, we find that toxic emissions of firms in high pollution reduction target provinces (treatment) are insignificantly different from those in a low pollution reduction target province before the Eleventh FYP. Thereafter, we conduct placebo tests by randomly assigning a treatment firm or a year of shock and repeat the baseline results. The results are no longer significant based on the false DID specifications, thereby suggesting that the changes of local political promotion incentives reduce firms’ toxic emissions rather than other factors or noise.====We further conduct a battery of tests to check the robustness of our results, including the sub-sample analysis, using alternative measures and specifications, and controlling for omitted variables. Our results remain the same in all the robust tests, thereby further validating our main findings.====We next examine the possible mechanisms through which the changes of local political promotion incentives may lead to a decrease in toxic emissions. One potential possibility may be that the policy shock induced by the changes in local political promotion incentives may increase bank loans that firms can receive and a decrease in tax intensity. These effects will raise the firms' funds to control toxic emissions, leading to reduced toxic emissions. We test our conjecture by examining the impact of the changes of local political promotion incentives on these factors. We present strong results that these changes can lead to a significant increase in bank loans that firms can receive and a significant decrease in firms’ tax intensity.====Furthermore, meeting the central government's environmental performance standards may be more critical for local leaders who have a larger political ambition because China's central government has given considerable attention to environment protection. Thus, we test the moderating role of promotion pressures on our findings and show that promotion pressures significantly strengthen the negative effect in our baseline results. That is, local governments facing promotion pressures exhibit substantial incentives to enhance local firms' engaging in high-level environmental protection.====Lastly, we explore the heterogeneity in our baseline results. (1) We first examine the impact of firms' ownership. Previous studies (e.g., Allen et al., 2015) have argued one crucial institutional feature of the Chinese economy, which is the considerable number of government-owned firms (i.e., state-owned enterprises [SOEs]). We find that SOEs are more affected by the policy shock in their toxic emissions compared with non-SOEs. (2) Thereafter, we examine firms' financial constraints on the effects of local political promotion incentives on toxic emissions. Access to external finance is one of the most important determinants of environmental protection behavior, further affecting firms' toxic emissions. The estimated results show that our findings are more significant for firms with less financial constraints. (3) We then examine the moderating effects of industry characteristics on our baseline results. We show that the changes of local political promotion incentives have a greater negative impact on firms' toxic emissions in non-pollution industries. (4) As China is transitioning, the formal market system is still imperfect, and the degree of market-oriented development in various regions is highly uneven. Thus, we expect that the marketization level may moderate our findings. Consistently, we find that the higher marketization firms face, the more substantial impact of the changes of local political promotion incentives on firms’ toxic emissions.====This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we add to the literature on the effect of political promotion incentives on the environment using individual manufacturing firms' level data. Although research exploiting and correlating political promotion incentives to various economic outcomes has increased, little is known about the role of changes in local political promotion incentives in toxic emissions. Given data unavailability, several existing research has primarily relied on cross-region (such as province) variation in pollution levels to test whether local governments’ incentives affect environmental outcomes, thus focusing on the relationship between political incentives and aggregate pollution levels. Thus, we complement this line of studies using a unique firm-level data set. Our data provide some advantages for answering the research question over other studies: (1) The firm-level toxic emissions data set is large and largely unexplored. It includes a substantial proportion of industrial firms. It also covers all the regions of China, improving the representativeness of our overall sample. It is particularly relevant for studying the issue of pollution emissions. (2) The firm-level data also help explore the underlying mechanisms of political incentives on pollution emissions. For example, reducing pollution emissions at the province level may be because of the government closing down high polluting enterprises. In contrast, the pollution emitted by existing enterprises may remain the same. The province-level data cannot answer this question, whereas the firm-level data can.====Second, our study contributes to the extensive literature on the determinants of toxic emissions. Previous research has found that government regulations, economic institutions, and the law are part of the determinants (Albrizio et al., 2017; Anoulies, 2017; Forslid et al., 2018; Gutierrez and Teshima, 2018; Shi and Xu, 2018; Cordella & Devarajan, 2019; Schopf and Voss, 2019; and Zhang et al., 2019). In particular, our study differs from these studies as follows: (1) We focus on the impact of changes of local political promotion incentives, which is a fundamental but underexplored political factor that affects toxic emissions activity. (2) Our study is based on the unique setting of China's central government's regime shift in evaluating local officials for promotion as an exogenous shock. We also discuss possible ways by which the changes of local political promotion incentives can reduce firms' toxic emissions.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.

The available studies, however, are mostly based on cross-sectional data and thus rarely control for factors that simultaneously affect both variables. In this paper, using panel data on Poland, we check whether the relationship in question is robust to controlling for municipality-level fixed effects, time-fixed effects, and several time-varying factors. As a proxy for the level of religiosity we use data on religious observance, whereas as a proxy for civic participation we look at electoral turnout. Our results robustly show that municipalities with higher measures of church attendance exhibit higher ====. This, in turn, gives some credence that the relationship between religious commitment and civic participation might be causal.","Religiosity has frequently been recognised as an important driver of various individual and group behaviours (Iannaccone, 1998, Iyer, 2016). Furthermore, it has commonly been associated with many behaviours that are widely considered as prosocial: volunteering (Ruiter and De Graaf, 2006, Lim and MacGregor, 2012), charitable giving (Bekkers and Wiepking, 2011), altruism (Bulbulia and Mahoney, 2008), or cooperative behaviour (Xygalatas, 2013). In this context, much attention has been paid also to the relationship between a particular manifestation of religious commitment, church attendance, and voter turnout. Most of the existing studies point to a positive relationship between the two and suggest that regular churchgoers display higher voter turnout than people who are not involved in external religious practices or participate in a religious rite only occasionally (for recent reviews and evidence see: Smith and Walker, 2013, Ammann, 2015, Gerber et al., 2016, Moutselos, 2020).====That said, the question remains whether the documented statistical association between religious observance and electoral participation establishes causation. This is because the setup that most of the existing studies used to highlight the impact of church attendance on voter turnout creates severe concerns about both the accuracy and the interpretation of the obtained estimates. Indeed, much of the available literature is based on cross-sectional variation and thus suffers from econometric problems related to omitted variable bias and measurement error. In addition, it is often overlooked that the relationship between church attendance and going to the polls is likely to reflect a broader phenomenon, that is the relationship between religiosity and political participation. Accordingly, church attendance will be correlated with other aspects of religiosity, such as religious affiliation, frequency of external and internal practices, believing in specific faith elements, and importance of religion in everyday life (Esmer and Pettersson, 2007). Likewise, voter turnout will correlate with other components of political participation including the interest in politics, willingness to protest, or involvement in campaigning (in social media, election rally, etc.). As a consequence, identifying potential effects of church attendance itself, as a distinct channel of religious influences, is immensely difficult.====In this paper we seek to address these issues at least partly and investigate the relationship in question using municipality-level panel data for Poland, a country which for many reasons can be regarded as a natural setting for investigating the role of religiosity. The attractiveness of the Polish case stems from the fact that in Poland the religious market is dominated by one religion, Roman Catholicism, and about 96% of the adult population identifies as Roman Catholic (GUS, 2017). This feature presents an opportunity to overcome two important limitations that are likely to affect most of the analyses done until now. On the one hand, we can study the impact of religiosity in the society as a whole and not only in some minority group or other (Brady et al., 1995, Sobolewska et al., 2015). On the other hand, the Polish setting is free form the concern that different religions or denominations may have different effects on political participation, and for each of them different factors may potentially confound the effect of interest (Jones-Correa and Leal, 2001, Smidt, 2003). Furthermore, the focus on Poland allows us to highlight the relationship in question in the context of Central and Eastern Europe and thus to complement the existing studies which predominantly concentrate on the U.S. or Western Europe. This allows us also to have a deeper look at determinants of political participation in post-Communist region which has been found to differ from other regions as regards voter turnout dynamics (Kostelka, 2017).====We argue that religious people in Poland may have a higher standard voter turnout rate than non-religious people and that this difference can be explained in four ways. The first reason relates to the role played by the Catholic Church during the Communist dictatorship. As such this argument is very much in line with the argument advanced by Kostelka (2017) who argues that voter turnout in new democracies depends much more on what happened before and during regime change than after it. As widely acknowledged, the Church provided one of the very few opportunities for people to voice their opposition to the dominant order and offered resources for organising resistance to communist repression (Froese and Pfaff, 2001, Dudek and Gryz, 2003, Zieliński, 2003, Żaryn, 2003). Accordingly, religious people might have become more favourable to voting as their political activism was – in that way or another – related also to the Church. This view is in line with an extensive literature which relates the positive relationship between church attendance (religiosity) on the one hand, and voting turnout (political participation) on the other to the role of religion in social capital formation (Brady et al., 1995, Putnam, 2000, Smidt, 2003, Lam, 2006).====The second reason to assume that religious people in Poland might be more favourable to voting than non-believers directly refers to the teaching of the Catholic Church. The key in this context is the Church’s categorical affirmation that the duty of the lay faithful is to actively participate in social life and promote the common good. The strongest fundamentals for this attitude were declared at the Second Vatican Council. The encouragement for the lay person to live their life in service to others and society embraces also political engagement in democratic regimes. This has been repeatedly affirmed, among others, in the Catechism of the Catholic Church which states, that: “As far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life. The manner of this participation may vary from one country or culture to another (paragraph 1915)”. The adhortation Christifideles Laici (p.3) even warns that lay faithful should not “fail to become actively engaged in their responsibilities in the professional, social, cultural and political world”.==== Overall, therefore, the Catholic Church has been constantly emphasising a growing need for participation of lay faithful in the social and political field. In consequence, to the extent that church attendance reflects adherence to that Church’s teaching, religious observance might translate into an increased voter turnout. As regards the Polish context, it might be noted that the Episcopal Conference of Poland has been consistently encouraging the Poles to participate in elections, emphasising that this act is an expression of civic responsibility and care for the country and the common good.====The other two arguments that one can refer to when explaining the positive relationship between church attendance and voter turnout in Poland draw on the fact that religious observance and voting take place on the same day. This coincidence might systematically affect the difference in voter turnout between churchgoers and non-religious people in the following way. On the one hand, the faithful might be encouraged to participate in voting from the pulpit (for similar argumentation see Jones-Correa and Leal, 2001). In this case, churchgoers will be directly reminded about their civic duty on the election date. On the other hand, going to a church on the election day might considerably reduce the marginal cost of voting (see Brady et al., 1995). This should be especially the case when a church is near the polling location, and if other co-believers go to the polling stations right after participating in the liturgical prayer.====Below we confront the expectations on a positive relationship between religiosity and political participation in Poland with the data. Using information on people attending Mass and taking Holly Communion, we find that municipalities with higher measures of church attendance exhibit higher voter turnout. Importantly, this portrayal is supported not only by models exploiting between-municipality variation, but also by models exploiting within-municipality variation. Our findings hold also in a number of additional robustness tests. This in turn gives some credence that the relationship between religious commitment and civic participation might be causal.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.

Using a panel of 18 major ==== countries from 1980 to 2014, I find strong evidence that wage centralization is associated with lower budget deficits in the panel of industrialized economies. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model shows that this negative link is mostly in the long run and not in the short run. The empirical results suggest that this negative association cannot be explained by either wage coordination at national level or by formal/informal cooperation among industry-level unions. Instead, the paper introduces a political economy model that can be viewed as one potential explanation for the empirical results. The model argues that wage centralization interacts with the political economy of budget deficits, leading to a lower level of deficit bias. The suggested mechanism is based on sectoral wage inter-dependency that emerges from centralization of wage bargaining.","It is well documented that governments accumulate debts beyond levels that could plausibly be explained on the grounds of social optimization approaches to budget deficits (such as the tax smoothing model of Barro (1979)) or of Keynesian demand policies. This has motivated the profession to look for other possible explanations for budget deficits, notably the role of institutions and the political economy.==== This strand of the literature links fiscal outcomes to political and structural characteristics. The present paper contributes to this literature by focusing on the role of one aspect of the labor market structure, i.e. wage bargaining centralization.====Countries with different wage bargaining structures have experienced distinguishing fiscal outcomes. Fig. E.1 shows the relationship between decade-averages of the primary budget balance (==== GDP) and the decade-averages of wage centralization (measured by the ==== index) for 18 OECD countries from 1980 to 2014.====
 Fig. E.2 shows the binscatter plot for the relation between the same variables, with and without controlling for country fixed effects and for other determinants of budget balance. Both figures suggest a positive relationship between wage centralization and primary budget balance. The two panels in Fig. E.3 show the relation between the change in the decade-averages of primary budget balance and the change in the decade-averages of wage centralization. Panel (a) shows the changes from the first decade of the sample (1980s) to the second decade (1990s). Panel (b) shows the corresponding changes from the decade leading up to the financial crisis (1997–2006) to the period after (2007–2014).==== The two panels suggest that, on average, the rise in the decade-average of the primary budget deficits has been more pronounced in countries which have experienced a higher decentralization of wage bargaining.====Even though these figures seem motivating, there are surprisingly very few studies in the existing literature on the relation between the two variables. One exception is Roubini and Sachs (1989a), who suggest a U-shaped relation between wage centralization and budget balance. Their argument is based on the “hump-shaped” hypothesis proposed by Calmfors and Driffill (1988). According to this hypothesis, extensive wage indexation is prevalent in countries with labor markets that are characterized by a large number of powerful unions which bargain their wage in a non-cooperative way (intermediate level of wage bargaining), and it is not prevalent in countries with highly decentralized and, thus, weak unions or in countries with a corporatist wage bargaining structure (in which unions negotiate at national level).==== Roubini and Sachs (1989a) argue that this hump-shaped hypothesis can be translated into a U-shaped relation between wage centralization and budget balance. Their central idea is that government spending programs are the fiscal counterpart to wage indexation schemes and, thus, the political demand for government transfer programs is larger in countries with an intermediate level of wage bargaining, and lower in countries with highly decentralized or with corporatist wage bargaining structures. They consequently argue for a U-shaped relation between budget balance and wage centralization.====The empirical result of Roubini and Sachs (1989a) is based on cross-country comparisons of time-averages of wage indexation and budget balance. Appendix A shows that their result on the U-shaped relation is not robust when a panel data analysis is used. In addition to Roubini and Sachs (1989a), based on the hump-shaped hypothesis of Calmfors and Driffill (1988), one macroeconomic explanation can also be put forward on the relation between wage centralization and budget balance: Given the negative association between unemployment rate and budget balance, the hump-shaped hypothesis would imply that wage centralization will lead to higher budget deficits as long as wage bargaining is not coordinated (at national level). In other words, this macroeconomic explanation would also predict a U-shaped relation between budget balance and wage centralization. These two hypotheses between wage centralization and budget balance are explained and discussed in more detail in Section 2.====The present paper, using fixed-effects OLS and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) analyses on 18 major OECD countries (from 1980 to 2014), finds strong evidence that wage centralization has a significantly positive and monotonic relationship with budget balance. The baseline model finds that an increase in the Iversen index by one overall (within-country) standard deviation is associated with a 3.1 (0.81) percentage point increase in the budget balance, ceteris paribus. Several robustness checks show that the empirical results are robust to the inclusion of various economic, demographic, and political control variables in the model, as well as to the inclusion of time and country fixed effects. The ARDL method suggests that the positive relation is mostly in the long run, while in the short run there is no significant relation between the two variables.====Furthermore, the empirical study of the present paper suggests that this positive relation even holds among a sub-sample of countries with relatively decentralized wage bargaining system, where corporatist wage bargaining and inter-union cooperation cannot be assumed to exist. This result is in contrast with the two above-mentioned hypotheses. Moreover, it suggests that the positive association between wage centralization and budget balance cannot be explained based on wage coordination at national level or based on (formal or informal) cooperation among industry-level unions, or based on any other potential theoretical models that rely on the hump-shaped hypothesis of Calmfors and Driffill (1988).====To the best of my knowledge, in the existing literature there is no theoretical model consistent with the empirical findings of the paper. Therefore, in the next step, the paper introduces a political economy model that can be viewed as one possible explanation for the empirical findings. The mechanism relies on two well-established findings, one from the literature on the political economy of budget deficits and, the other, from the labor market literature. The former literature points to distributive effects of fiscal policies as one source of excessive budget deficits: when one or several fiscal policymaker(s) with redistributive aims (due to political incentives) have control over or can influence fiscal policy, incentives are distorted and a “deficit bias” emerges. One distributional effect of budget deficit is achieved by altering relative wages. For example, subsidy to or tax cuts for a sector or to/for intermediate goods that are extensively used in that sector, lead to an increase in the net profit and, thus, to an increase in net wages received by workers in that sector. A policymaker might have the incentive to favor workers of some specific sectors either because s/he is politically linked to those sectors or because her/his region(s) of interest intensively produce in those sectors.====The other fact of use, which is well established in the labor market literature, is ====, which emerges from the centralization of wage bargaining: the fact that when wage bargaining is more centralized, sectoral/local wages respond less to variations in sectoral/local conditions (i.e. prices, taxes, and/or productivity), since wages set by unions would depend more on conditions in other sectors.==== It is important to mention that sectoral wage interdependency emerges from ==== wage bargaining of unions which, independently from each other, bargain for wages vis-a-vis employers.====The mechanism suggested by the present paper links these two strands of literature: If the wage bargaining is more centralized, wages respond less to sector-specific fiscal tools. Consequently, wage centralization interacts with the political economy of budget deficits by mitigating the distributional effects of fiscal tools, leading to a lower deficit bias. The findings of this paper make an important contribution to the literature on the political economy of budget balance, by arguing that labor market structure can mitigate or intensify the distributive aims of fiscal policymakers as long as this distributive effect is achieved by altering relative wages in some sectors.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses briefly the two already existing theoretical links between wage centralization and budget balance. Section 3 provides a narrative discussion on the evolutions of wage bargaining structure and of budget balance in the Republic of Ireland. Section 4 is devoted to econometric analysis. Section 5 presents a political economy model linking wage centralization to deficit bias which emerges from the political distributive aims of fiscal policymakers.

Within a voters–politician interaction framework, I unravel these two effects of political tenure on voters’ welfare and examine how term limits affect these relations. It is shown that the key factors affecting the tenure–welfare relation are the learning curve of incumbents in conducting their regular task (public goods provision) and the learning curve of opportunistic incumbents in becoming effective embezzlers. I find that stricter term limits increase the frequency of ","Politics, like other trades, requires innate and acquired skills and the latter accumulate with experience. Political experience, however, is a double-edged sword: expediting and streamlining government’s performance (Alt et al., 2011, Dal Bó and Rossi, 2011), while at the same time increasing political power with potential corruption ramifications (Besley and Prat, 2006, Coviello and Gagliarducci, 2017). Balancing these conflicting effects is one explanation for limiting the number of terms of elected politicians (Adams and Kenny, 1986). I analyze these tradeoffs in the context of voters–politician interactions in which incumbents decide between seeking reelection or stepping down and voters choose between reelecting the incumbent or electing a new governor. Reelecting the incumbent entails a more experienced governor, which benefits voters when the incumbent operates on their behalf. But if the incumbent decides to step down at the end of the term, there are no apparent incentives (other than goodwill) that motivate him to be accountable toward the electorate (Barro, 1973, Ferejohn, 1986, Besley and Case, 1995) and he may choose to use the hard-won experience (also) for private gain.====Politicians, like other mortals, are what they are – some honest, some corrupt and some in between – and the main role of elections is to screen candidates and motivate incumbents to operate in the voters’ best interest. The screening role is limited because candidates present themselves (and their policies) so as to maximize the chance of winning election (Kartik and McAfee, 2007, Callander and Wilkie, 2007), and the accountability motive may not apply when incumbents decide not to (or cannot due to term limits) seek reelection. The second (lame duck) concern raises the risk of corruption with costs that increase with the incumbent’s tenure (experience).==== In this work I unravel the positive (more efficient government) and negative (corruption) effects of political tenure on voters’ welfare and examine how term limits affect these relations.====Within a voters–politician interaction framework, the reelection decisions of opportunistic (corrupt) incumbents depend on the sure private gain (graft) they can fetch by stepping down at the end of the current term relative to (the expectation of) the uncertain private gain that will be available if reelected. As reelection prospects and private gains change with tenure, so are the reelection decisions and the ensuing expected cost of corruption. Characterizing incumbents’ reelection strategy enables formulating the effect of political tenure on voters’ welfare and, in turn, explaining the role of term limits in this relation. The key factors affecting this tenure–welfare relation are the learning curve of incumbents in conducting their regular task (public goods provision) and the learning curve of corrupt incumbents in becoming effective embezzlers. I find that term limits increase the frequency of corruption incidents but reduce the expected cost per incident. I also show that the expected cost of corruption depends on three factors of which two are sensitive to term limits – a property that bears on the choice of counter corruption policies.====To allow a sharp focus on the efficiency-corruption tradeoffs, politicians appear in two incarnations (types): “socially oriented” or “opportunistic”. Socially oriented politicians always operate in the public (electorate) interest, while opportunists operate in the public interest only when seeking reelection, for otherwise they reveal their type and diminish the reelection chances.==== During lame duck terms (chosen by the incumbent or imposed by term limits), opportunists advance their private interest, deterred only by the threat of punishment (social and legal). The share of opportunists in the pool of candidates is ====, which is an exogenous parameter reflecting cultural norms, (behavioral) rules of conduct and law enforcement deterrence. While ==== is known to all, the type of any candidate or incumbent (assigned at birth) is private information.====However, each term the incumbent inadvertently emits a noisy signal, which voters observe (at no cost) and use to update their beliefs regarding the incumbent’s type when contemplating whether to reelect her (if she seeks reelection) or elect a new governor from the pool of candidates. These noisy signals, which consist, for example, of tweets and interviews with the incumbent, who the incumbent consults with and nominates for key positions, and frequency caught lying, are independent draws of a random variable with a distribution specific to the type of the prevailing incumbent. The incumbent’s decision (to seek reelection or step down at the end of the term) is made at the beginning of each term, before the signal is realized and observed, while voters’ choice is made at the end of the term, after the signal has been observed. A decision to seek reelection could also be interpreted as a signal that voters can use to improve the accuracy of their assessment regarding the incumbent’s type, and incumbents are well aware of this possibility when deciding whether to seek reelection.====Characterizing the Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBE) emanating from this voters–incumbent interaction allows identifying the positive (increased efficiency of the more experienced governor) and negative (larger expected corruption cost) effects of tenure on voters’ welfare, hence the net effect of tenure on welfare. The tenure–welfare relation constitutes an economic criterion (alongside political) for setting term limits. If welfare always increases with political tenure (because the efficiency effect dominates), there is no justification for term limits (vis-à-vis the welfare criterion). If welfare always decreases with tenure (because the corruption effect dominates), the optimal limit is one term. The intermediate case is where welfare as a function of tenure follows an inverted U-shape. Rapid learning-by-doing during early stages of an incumbent’s political cycle strongly improves the government’s performance, giving rise to the upward sloping part of the tenure–welfare curve. Corruption activities, as noted above, take longer time to become effective, hence the effect of corruption on welfare becomes stronger at later terms of an incumbent’s political cycle, giving rise to the downward sloping part of the tenure–welfare curve.====The introduction of term limits, say a limit ==== on the number of terms in office, implies that the ====’th term must be a lame duck term and distorts the voters–politician interaction also at the penultimate (====) term, affecting the ensuing PBE and the tenure–welfare relation. In particular, during the penultimate term voters will be more cautious in reelecting the incumbent to a last term (that must be a lame duck term), inducing opportunistic incumbents to step down earlier than they would without the term limits.==== A term limit, thus, tends to increase the frequency of corruption incidents, but at the same time reduces the per-incident cost because perpetrators have a shorter time to develop the network and connections needed to strike big. The corruption incidence–magnitude tradeoffs analyzed herein are key to understanding the effects of term limits on the expected cost of corruption.====The article draws on a number of literature strands. First is the literature on political and economic explanations of term limits. The political literature stresses the role of term limits in correcting political externalities and free riding problems. Democratic societies consist of many heterogeneous groups and participation in the political process requires appropriate representation of all groups, which in turn entails rapid turnover of (the limited number of) representatives and incumbents and this can be achieved by limiting the number of terms in office. Moreover, because tenure improves the ability of politicians to manipulate the system on behalf of their voters, it is disadvantageous to a certain group to replace its representative while other groups do not. Term limits correct these failures, explaining why voters overwhelmingly reelect incumbents while at the same time support universal term limits (López, 2003). This political explanation of term limits was advanced by Dick and Lott (1993) and Buchanan and Congleton (1994), and extended by Tabarrok (1996) and Glaeser (1997) to cases where term limits are self imposed. The economic (welfare) literature of term limits draws on Barro (1973) and Besley and Case (1995), which stress accountability and reputation building incentives associated with reelection and term limits (see the survey by Besley and Case, 2003). The present work contributes to this literature by incorporating explicitly the positive (improved government’s performance) and negative (corruption) effects of tenure on welfare within a voters–politician interaction framework and analyzing term limits implications. For example, it is well known that term limits reduce the accountability incentives associated with reelection, thereby tend to increase corruption incidents. But by depriving prospective embezzlers from developing the necessary network and connections needed to strike big, term limits mitigate the magnitude of the associated corruption cost. I unravel this frequency–magnitude tradeoffs and evaluate effects on desirable term limits.====The second strand is the large and growing literature on signaling in election, initiated by Banks (1990) and Harrington (1993). Notable contributions include Callander and Wilkie (2007), Kartik and McAfee (2007), Besley and Smart (2007), Acemoglu et al. (2013) and Smart and Sturm (2013). The present analysis continues along the line of Besley and Smart (2007) and Smart and Sturm (2013). In these works politicians can assume one of two types: good (public spirited) or bad (biased). The share of good politicians in the pool of candidates is known but the type of any politician is private information. When an incumbent seeks reelection, voters update the probability that he is of the good type based on his performance and reelect him if this probability exceeds the probability of electing a good type from the pool of candidates. The ability of voters to infer the incumbent’s type from observed outcomes is limited because of uncertain factors on which the incumbent possesses information advantages. Besley and Smart (2007) focus on the case of ==== term limits, while Smart and Sturm (2013) begin by analyzing the case without term limits and investigate effects of imposing term limits. The equilibria emanating from the voters–politician interaction in their setting give rise to various predictions regarding effects of term limits on incumbents’ performance and voters’ welfare.====Like Smart and Sturm (2013), I begin with the case without term limits and explore the effects of introducing term limits. My framework, however, differs in a number of important respects. First, the information available to voters in my framework consists of signals inadvertently emitted each term by the incumbent, consisting, e.g., of tweets, interviews, nomination of consultants or staff members and tendency to lie. A signal (which summarizes these observations) is a realization of a random variable with a distribution specific to the type of the prevailing incumbent (there are two such distributions corresponding to the ==== types of politicians). This form of information bears important implications for the interaction between voters and politician and the ensuing equilibria. For example, it implies that equilibrium strategies depend on the history of signals emitted by the same incumbent and this history changes with tenure. The second difference is the explicit effects of political tenure (experience) on government’s performance (in public goods provision and wealth redistribution) and on the efficacy of corruption efforts. The latter effect turns out to be instrumental in the reelection decisions of corrupt politicians. Thirdly, the voters–politician interaction and the ensuing equilibrium strategies in the present model evolves sequentially, where in each term the incumbent sets the reelection strategy by comparing the (sure) payoff available at the end of the current term with the uncertain next term payoff (if reelected). This sequential decision process stems from the view that “Politicians themselves have, for the most part, short time horizons. For most of them, each election presents a critical point, and the primary problem they face is getting past this hurdle”. (Buchanan and Wagner, 1977 p. 166), and allows a sharp focus on how tenure and term limits affect corruption. Finally, the present model lends itself naturally to the formulation of welfare (measured by expected voters’ payoff) as a function of political tenure, which can serve as a criterion for setting term limits.====The third literature strand deals with political corruption and its relation to reelection and term limits. Political corruption is a composite good that appears in various disguises (Svensson, 2005).==== It tends to trickle down and spread out to all sectors of society (Rose-Ackerman, 1999, Ajzenman, 2021), inflicting damage way beyond the direct cost of the malfeasance per se. A growing body of empirical research examines effects of reelection and term limits on the extent (frequency and magnitude) of political corruption (see, e.g., Persson et al., 2003, Campante et al., 2009, Ferraz and Finan, 2011, de Janvry et al., 2012, Ashworth, 2012, Coviello and Gagliarducci, 2017, Avis et al., 2018, Finan and Mazzocco, 2020). In the conclusion section I discuss the present model’s main properties in light of existing empirical evidence.====Section 2 presents the voters–politician interaction framework and characterizes the ensuing equilibria without and with term limits. Section 3 considers discrete (Bernoulli) signals and derives PBEs explicitly (via a numerical example), demonstrating their dependence on the aforementioned signals history and on the effect of tenure on the efficacy of corruption efforts. In Section 4, the tenure–welfare relation is derived and the expected cost of corruption is expressed in a way that allows comparing the effects of term limits with other counter corruption measures. Section 5 discusses the model’s main properties in light of empirical evidence and offers concluding comments.","Political tenure, term limits and corruption",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001348,4 January 2022,2022,Research Article,92.0

This paper investigates this mechanism, considering indicators of municipality spending in Italy as relevant policy outcomes. For identification, we rely on the time and geographic variation in the introduction of a gender quota reform by Law 215/2012. The reform affected gender composition of candidates in Italian municipal council elections, resulting in an increase of the share of female councilors of about 13.9 percentage points. Using the reform as an instrument, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in female participation in councils rises expenditure for local security by about 1% and reduces administration costs by a comparable amount, whereas evidence on the impact on other local expenditure items is mixed and not significant. Estimated effects are associated with compositional changes in terms of employment status of female councilors and are robust to endogeneity issues, to relevant sample selections and to the implications of confounding policies.","Gender inequality in politics is a well-documented phenomenon around the globe. The average share of women across parliaments worldwide is approximately 24.5%, and it is far below 50% in the majority of parliaments (Inter-Parliamentary Union Data, 2019). Similar figures are observed across Europe (28.5% on average), where gender balance is virtually reached only on a limited group of countries (e.g., France 49%, Sweden 48.2%, Spain 45.4%) (CEPR Report Women in Politics, 2019).====Female under-representation in political bodies is a relevant issue for at least two reasons. First, it portrays a clear violation of ==== of relevant population types (i.e., female citizens) in public institutions involved in policymaking. Second, an issue of ==== also arises if gender composition of political bodies influences policy implementation and public spending. There is, in fact, evidence that female politicians implement, more often than their male counterparts, policies in those areas of intervention that are traditionally seen as being women’s issues, such as childcare, health, environment and social services and, when they do it, they resort to larger budgets (Clots-Figueras 2011; Funk and Gathmann 2015). Moreover, the presence of more female politicians may prove beneficial to women's issues such as childcare investments even when women are not pivotal in the decisions, as they may acknowledge those issues more often in the pre-policy debate (Hessami and Baskaran 2019).====Women's presence affects policies and economic outcomes at every level of government. Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) show that Indian villages where the head of council is a woman invest more in those public goods which are more relevant for local females. Clots-Figueras (2011, 2012) shows that the presence of female legislators in India has a positive effect on expenditure on health and early education, as well as on the adoption of redistributive policies. Brollo and Troiano (2016) analyze the case of Brazilian municipalities and show that female mayors engage less in corruption. Svaleryd (2009) shows that the gender composition of municipal councils in Sweden influences the patterns of local spending, whereas Ferreira and Gyourko (2014) do not find any effect of female mayors on policy in U.S. cities. Contributions close to our work investigate the effect of increasing the share of female mayors and female councilors in Spanish municipalities, with ambiguous results. Some papers find that the gender of the mayor and the gender composition of the council influence municipal expenditure (Cabaleiro and Buch 2018, 2020; Hernández-Nicolás et al., 2018), while others do not find evidence that an increase in female representation affects the composition of municipal spending (Campa and Bagues 2021), nor that female mayors are more likely to implement gender sensitive policies (Gago and Carozzi 2021).====In this paper, we investigate and quantify the extent to which municipality-level policies are affected by the gender composition of elected municipal bodies in Italy. We use official municipality spending records, aggregated into spending indicators, to measure the budgetary size of relevant policies. Focusing on municipal governments is interesting for at least two reasons. First, at the municipal level there is a closer relation between citizens and elected politicians, which implies that prejudices should have a lower bite on elections and that elected women should help the electorate familiarize with the presence of female politicians. Second, political experience at the municipal level may be a first step toward a political career at the national level.====Estimates of the effect of improving gender balance in municipal councils on local spending may be contaminated by the presence of unobservable confounders (such as voters’ preferences, selection of candidates along unobservable traits, strategic interactions among candidates and parties and time-varying local heterogeneity) as well as measurement errors in observed expenditure data. To overcome these difficulties, we rely on the quasi-experimental nature of the change in institutional setting forced by Law 215/2012, which reformed elections of Italian municipal councils by introducing a gender quota on candidates. The reform introduced both a candidate gender quota and the possibility of expressing a double preference when voting, if the preferences expressed by the voter are for candidates of different gender. These specific features of the law were enforced exclusively in municipalities of size larger than 5000 residents, thus identifying a control and a treatment group of municipalities according to their size. Our empirical strategy exploits exogeneity in the geographic variability of implementation of the gender quota reform (by municipality size) and the timing of introduction of the reform (affecting only municipal elections taking place after 2012). For identification, we rely on the exogenous changes of female representatives in councils that are attributable to the introduction of the gender quota reform and explore the consequences of such changes on aggregate and disaggregate municipality spending.====In the first stage of our estimation, we look at the effect of quotas on the gender composition of councils. We find that the reform increased the percentage of women in municipality councils by 13.89 percentage points in our preferred specification. This figure is stable across specifications of the estimating model, and robust with respect to the selection of the sample. The increase in the share of female councilors has produced compositional changes among the group of elected female councilors. The gender quota reform reduces the share of employed female councilors but rises the share of students, unemployed and self-employed women, thus reducing the average age of female councilors. We do not detect effects in terms of education.====In the second stage of the empirical analysis, we investigate the effects of the gender quota on local spending. We find robust evidence that the introduction of the quota increases municipality spending in public security services of about 15% in treated municipalities (as opposed to expenditure in the absence of the reform) whereas it reduces administration spending by a comparable amount. Our identification strategy does not allow to disentangle whether the effects on spending are driven by changes in the (unobservable) traits of the council members that are strictly related to their gender, or rather by changes in the composition (along observable and unobservable traits) of the council elected under the quota. We can hence interpret the reduced form estimates as evidence that rising the chances of female candidates to be elected as councilors (through the introduction of a gender quota) affects local spending.====Using an instrumental variable strategy, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of elected female councilors induced by the gender quota reform rises expenditure in security services by 1% and reduces administration costs by a comparable amount. We show that such estimates are robust to endogeneity issues, to relevant sample selections and to potential confounding policies. Impacts on other expenditure items are either insignificant (for education and social services expenditures) or not robust across specifications (for urban management and productive services expenditures).====Our findings contribute both to the international literature investigating the consequences of the presence of females in elected bodies on local policymaking, as well as to the literature focusing on the effect of gender quotas on the Italian constituencies. Gender quotas in municipal elections in Italy were first enforced in 1993, when it was introduced the requirement of a minimum proportion of candidates of each gender in the ballot. This aspect of the 1993 electoral reform was then abrogated by the Constitutional Court in 1995, so that gender quotas were in place exclusively for three subsequent years. Most of the papers on gender quotas in Italy consider the 1993 reform, focusing on the impact of female politicians on public spending (Rigon and Tanzi 2012), on the ability to complete the electoral mandate (Gagliarducci and Paserman 2016), on the efficiency of politicians (Baltrunaite et al., 2014) and on electoral turnout (De Benedetto et al., 2014). The gender quota reform has been shown to carry long-term effects of gender composition in municipality councils (De Paola et al., 2010).====The closest contribution to our paper is Braga and Scervini (2017), which exploits the 1993 gender quota reform to identify the effect of rising the share of female councilors on the efficacy of local policies targeted to women and children (proxied by fertility rate) and the efficiency of the municipal administration (proxied by the size of the municipal executive). We extend Braga and Scervini (2017) in two directions: first, by evaluating the consequences of the latest available gender quota reform in Italy, introduced in 2012; second, by using spending items drawn from municipal balance sheets data as monetary outcomes related to relevant local policymaking.====Baltrunaite et al. (2019) use a regression discontinuity design to investigate whether the 2012 reform did increase the share of female councilors, and whether this is driven by the presence of quotas or by the presence of the double preferences system. Their results support the interpretation that the 18% increase in female councilors induced by the reform is mostly driven by an increase in the preference votes received by female candidates.==== Our identification strategy differs from theirs (and hence provides an additional validation for their results) insofar it exploits geographic variability across time in the adoption of the reform within a difference-in-differences framework.====The rest of the manuscript is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional characteristics of Italian municipal elections and of the reform (2.1) and the types of municipal expenditure we consider (2.2). Section 3 describes the data (3.1) and the identification strategy (3.2). Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5 concludes.","Women at work: Gender quotas, municipal elections and local spending",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001415,31 December 2021,2021,Research Article,93.0

We assess whether the ==== in the 2020 local government elections in Italy was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We do so by exploiting the variation among municipalities in the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak as measured by the mortality rate among the elderly. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the elderly mortality rate decreased the voter turnout by 0.5 percentage points, with no gender differences in the behavioural response. The effect was especially strong in densely populated municipalities. We do not detect statistically significant differences in voter turnout among different levels of autonomy from the central government.","In late December 2019 a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) was first identified in the city of Wuhan of the Republic of China and then rapidly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic known as COVID-19. It has radically changed the lifestyle of people forced to stay at home, to wear face masks, and to maintain social distancing. These are only some of the restrictions imposed by national governments to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Italy was the first European country to have been hard hit by COVID-19, with a significant increase in positive cases in March 2020. Italy immediately took draconian measures by stopping most economic activities, closing schools and universities, severely limiting the movement of people, and restricting social contacts.====Restrictive policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 have also led to a transformation of the political agenda by postponing the renewal of regional governments and of numerous municipal councils. Going to the polls to exercise the right to vote could indeed increase cases of virus infection among voters and the incidence of mortality from COVID-19, especially among elderly people (====, ====). Moreover, participation in assemblies and rallies during the election campaign may make gatherings risky and spread the virus infection among political candidates and participants (====, ==== show a significant decrease in electoral participation in those countries and regions where there have been a high number of deaths from COVID-19. Likewise, ==== find for the Basque regional election held in Spain on 12 July 2020 a reduction in voter turnout of between 2.6 and 5.1 percentage points in those municipalities which had experienced a positive number of COVID-19 cases.====The scientific literature dealing with the electoral consequences of a pandemic is scant. The main contribution of our study is therefore to fill this gap by analysing whether and to what extent voter turnout has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing at the time of writing, more than one year after its outbreak, and there are signs that it is not going to fade away soon (====). Understanding how electoral participation is affected is of utmost importance to prevent the eventual weakening of the democratic process, for example by designing different voting systems for the upcoming election or by making it easier to access already existing voting systems alternative to voting in person. Many countries decided to postpone elections to avoid low electoral participation, exposing themselves to criticism that such a decision would jeopardize democracy.====Our analysis is carried out on Italian municipalities holding elections in September and October 2020 and observed also in the previous electoral round of 2015. In a panel data framework, we estimate the differential effect of the mortality rate of elderly people on voter turnout after the COVID-19 outbreak, where the elderly mortality rate is a measure of the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak.==== The source of variation in the elderly mortality rate induced by the COVID-19 outbreak is plausibly exogenous with respect to unobserved determinants of the voter turnout, once one has controlled for the municipality fixed effects and a set of observed time-varying covariates. We will exploit this identification assumption to infer whether and to what extent the voter turnout has been affected by the mortality rate of the elderly since the COVID-19 outbreak.====We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the mortality rate of elderly people decreased the voter turnout by 0.5 percentage points. The effect was particularly strong in densely populated municipalities, where the decrease amounted to 1.2 percentage points: where the virus circulation was perceived as more likely due to lesser social distancing and the greater mobility of individuals, electoral participation may have been discouraged more. We find that the effect did not depend on the level of regional autonomy from the central government.====In the empirical analysis, we place especial emphasis on different gender behavioural responses. This is interesting for two main reasons. On the one hand, since there is emerging evidence that COVID-19 is deadlier for infected men (====),==== eligible male voters may be less willing to go to the polls and cast their vote, so as to avoid a situation that could expose them to a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, men and women differ in their risk aversion, with women being more risk averse: see e.g. ==== and the literature cited therein. There is also evidence that women are more aware of COVID-19 related risks (====) and have had more psychological reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak than men, with higher level of stress, anxiety, and depression (====). Since voting in-person entails a greater risk of COVID-19 infection and transmission (====, ====), and if women are more risk averse than men, the female voter turnout may have reacted to the COVID-19 outbreak more markedly than the male one. We empirically assess whether these gender related forces have been at work. Empirical analysis shows a significant reduction in both female and male voter turnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect is slightly larger in magnitude for men, although a formal test rejects the hypothesis of gender difference in the behavioural response.====This paper is organized as follows. Section ==== introduces the emerging literature on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on political attitudes and presents hypotheses on the impact of the pandemic intensity on voter turnout. Section ==== describes the data and the method used in our empirical investigation. Section ==== presents the main findings and a battery of checks to assess the robustness of our results.

It rests on a unique and comprehensive hand-collected firm-by-tender micro-level dataset that enables the assessment of partisan favouritism in procuring goods, services and work by the Croatian government in the 2012–2018 period. Main results show that (i) political donations pay off and a ten percent increase in political donations leads to an increase in public procurement revenues of 5.7%; (ii) political disloyalty, i.e. switching donations from centre-right to centre-left parties or vice versa, does not reimburse; (iii) big firms in Croatia are big enough to bid lower prices and/or contract better terms, such that they don't need favouritism in public procurement awards; and (iv) political contributions ex-post election (2016–2018) increase procurement revenues of donating firms by 27%, and firms connected to the losing party exhibit a drop in procurement revenues of more than 12% compared to the ex-ante elections.","Each government engages in public procurement tendering procedure to procure for goods, services and works. On average, the amounts of government spending allocated through public procurement contracts in Croatia, as well as across European Union members, stand at 14% of GDP or 29% of total general government spending annually. This makes public procurement a significant policy instrument, which, if used strategically, can help countries in boosting jobs, growth and investment, and create an economy that is more innovative, as well as resource- and energy-efficient (European Commission, 2017).====Although the core principles of public procurement are transparency, equal-treatment and non-discrimination, empirical evidence often indicates partisan favouritism in the allocation of public procurement spending. One strand of literature shows a high and positive correlation between political connections and firms’ (stock) values (Faccio, 2006; Faccio and Parsley, 2009; Cooper et al., 2010; Goldman et al., 2013; among others). Another strand of literature focuses on the relation between politically connected firms and prices they charge via the public procurement contracts, concluding that firms that contribute to political parties enjoy higher (inflated) contract prices often accompanied with low-quality procured goods, services or works (Çeviker Gürakar and Bircan, 2016; Palguta and Pertold, 2017; World Bank, 2017; among others). And, at last, there is a strand of literature that examines the link between specific political donations and public procurement awards, concluding that an increase in political donations increases the value of the awarded public procurement contracts and thus revenues for the donating firm (Boas et al., 2014; Titl and Gey, 2019; among others).====This paper tries to build on the latter strand of literature, by investigating the relation between public procurement contracts and political donors in Croatia. It tries to provide an answer to the following question: Do political contributions grant preferential treatment in the awarding of public procurement contracts in Croatia? If they do then an increase in (or an introduction of) political donations within firm's costs structure should result in an increase in (or an introduction of) public procurement specific revenues.====Main motivation of the paper lies behind three facts. First, according to the European Commission (2017, p. 2), improving public procurement can yield big savings in government spending and a one percent efficiency gain can save EU member states 20 billion euro per year. Second, Podumljak and Dávid-Barrett (2015, p. 81) conclude that a large share of contracting authorities in Croatia is highly vulnerable to political influence and outside the scope of many controls, which results in around 85% of the total value of procurement being carried out under weak control mechanisms enabling political leaders to extensively use their patronage powers. Third, although Podumljak and Dávid-Barrett (2015) build their conclusion on descriptive and event studies, empirical literature in this field focusing on the Croatian case is actually non-existent. Scarce empirical evidence in investigating the rent-seeking behavior of politicians in Croatia focuses on political business cycles and local budget data (Mačkić, 2014; Vuković, 2017; among others). Thus, partisan favouritism through the public procurement channel is left empirically unexplored to the best of my knowledge.====This study's discussion how political contributions influence public procurement contracting relies on a unique hand-collected firm-by-contract dataset, which matches data from different sources. I use the public procurement dataset, directly retrieved from the Directorate for the Public Procurement System within the Croatian Ministry of Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts, and match to winning firms three sets of data: (i) I hand-collect data on legal persons donating to political parties in Croatia in the 2012–2018 period, and match them to winners of public procurement contracts; (ii) I pair hand-collected firm-level data (such as size and age) to all (donating and non-donating) winning firms, and (iii) I also combine data about state-ownership with (donating and non-donating) winning firms. Such manually created cross-sectional firm-by-contract micro-level data is used in the empirical strategy on partisan favouritism that involves linear estimation, difference-in-difference and probit modeling.====Main results can be summarized as follows. First, political contributing firms in Croatia collect 35% more revenues from public procurement contracts compared to firms that do not donate to political parties. The log-log model shows that a ten percent increase in political donations leads to an increase in public procurement revenues of 5.7%. If this is related to mean values in my dataset, then an additional increase in donations of 8160 kuna increases revenues from public procurement awards of 108,247 kuna. Second, being politically disloyal in Croatia, i.e. switching donations from centre-right to centre-left parties or vice versa, does not pay off. Loyal firms exhibit significant and large increases in procurement revenues, compared to unfaithful firms. Third, Croatian big firms are big enough to bid lower prices and/or contract better terms, such that they don't need favouritism in public procurement awards, and the effect of an increase in political donation on procurement revenues in their case results being negative and statistically insignificant in all specifications. Fourth, political contributions in the ex-post election (2016–2018) period increase procurement revenues of donating firms by 27%. Moreover, although firms connected to the losing Social Democratic Party (SDP) exhibit a drop in procurement revenues of more than 12% compared to the period before the elections, most of the SDP donors are politically loyal and therefore share the same ideology of the party. Fifth and last, donating firms that contributed only once and to only one political party exhibit lower probabilities in winning the procurement contract compared to non-donating firms and compared to loyal firms with multiple donations. Moreover, firms that donate the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU) show higher probabilities of winning a procurement contract than SDP's corporate donors, but SDP contributors that continue to donate SDP also after the shift in power occurred in 2016 benefit from higher likelihood of winning, which again confirms that loyalty recompenses.====The relevance of the contributions of this paper needs to be highlighted through the lenses of the Croatian institutional setting. Results of partisan favouritism that lead to increase in public procurement revenues highlight the main shortcomings of the Croatian institutional setting. Many conducted surveys (before and after Croatia's EU accession) show that the vast majority of firms, as well as individuals, perceive corruption as a normal behavior in Croatia and its reporting being completely futile (Budak and Rajh, 2012; UNODC, 2013; Slijepčević et al., 2015). What created grounds for corruption entering in all pores of society is the lack of trust in institutions, coupled with insufficient transparency, political distortions, ineffective prosecution of perpetrators and media fails in reporting corruption.==== Accessing the EU and embracing its acquis, corruption levels in Croatia do not lessen and the institutional problems persist. Even the most recent report of the European Commission (2021) highlights that practices to combat corruption in Croatia remain relatively scarce and that corruption in public procurement is often discovered due to reporting of whistleblowers rather than due to the work of implemented oversight bodies. Additionally, the public procurement process in Croatia suffers from a large share of single bidders and low level of cooperative procurement (European Commission, 2020a), both indicating a potentially high risk of corruption.====Besides enriching the scarce empirical literature on the public procurement – political donations interplay on the Croatian case, this paper contributes to the broader political economy literature in two main ways. First, the significant and relatively large extent of partisan favouritism persist no matter the enacted reforms and legislative strengthening of the procurement process and its monitoring, implemented under the recommendations and supervision of the EU. This indicate that in societies that consider corruption normal, most of the enacted legislative changes remain insufficient and inefficient in assuring transparent and non-discriminatory practices in public procurement. Efficiency gains can be achieved only if (Croatia's) society exhibits a paradigm shift. Limiting the influence of political connections and imposing tighter restrictions on political donations may directly reduce the extent of partisan favouritism, but the full efficiency gains are possible only if such policy measures indirectly stimulate a positive shift in the perception of fairness within the public procurement process.====Second, this analysis shows how partisan favouritism in the public procurement channel can provide insights on the functioning of democratic regimes and governance. In Croatia the trust in political institutions, the evaluation of democracy and political support depend on partisanship rather than on socioeconomic status, income and employment (Henjak, 2017). Although corruption scandals that regularly hit Croatian politicians usually involve CDU party members, CDU remains the party that is ruling the Croatian government for 23 out of country's 29 year history. The finding that politically loyal firms exhibit significant and large increases in procurement revenues (compared to unfaithful firms) coupled with the result that CDU-donating firms show higher probabilities of winning a procurement contract (compared to SDP-donating firms) underpin the decline in democratic governance and a rise in electoral autocracy in Croatia. Autocrats are usually those that build support by providing distinctive advantages to politically loyal firms, even if that means investing inefficiently and/or in less competitive firms (Root, 2016, p.12).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a brief literature review. Section 3 briefly explains the institutional setting and introduces the data collection process along with the creation of the final dataset. Section 4 sets forth the theoretical background for the empirical strategy and displays all the implemented methodologies used in the analysis. Section 5 presents and discusses the results, while Section 6 is reserved for concluding remarks.",All you need is ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001373,28 December 2021,2021,Research Article,95.0

While it may seem simple, the process of developing fiscal capacity is often long and torturous. We explore the possibility that governments build this capacity in part by making a credible commitment to strong property rights under the rule of law. We identify large, sustained jumps in how countries score on both broad and narrow measures of legal system and property rights quality and investigate if these jumps produce increases in several measures of fiscal capacity. In a sample of 119 countries from 1970 to 2015, we find sustained improvements in property rights do not cause increases in any of our fiscal capacity measures. If the development of strong property rights is indeed necessary for developing fiscal capacity, it is evidently not sufficient.","It may be surprising to taxpayers of modern rich countries, but for most of human history, governments have had considerable difficulty levying taxes and achieving much compliance. It is a problem that still afflicts developing countries today. One reason it is so difficult is that state capacity itself is a conundrum. Rich countries clearly have higher levels of state capacity than poorer ones, but any state that has high levels of capacity is also one that could become predatory, acting against the interest of ordinary citizens. Thus, citizens may be hesitant to grant taxing power to the state for fear of being abused.==== This raises an interesting question: Beyond Charles Tilly's well-known maxim that “War made the state, and the state made war,” where does state capacity come from?====Credible commitments, such as secure property rights, can limit the scope of arbitrary government actions and help persuade citizens and investors to grant more fiscal power to the state.====All governments have a demand for fiscal capacity because providing governance requires resources. The supply of those resources comes from the citizenry and will be a function of the type of governance they expect. If citizens expect predatory governance, they can resist the government's efforts to extract revenues. For example, it is well documented that economies with good governance have relatively small shadow economies and incidences of tax evasion (Schneider and Enste, 2000; Dabla-Norris et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2010; La Porta and Shleifer 2014).====If a government can credibly commit to protective and productive governance, then extracting revenue from its citizens will be less costly.==== This logic has been used to account for governments building state capacity in medieval and early modern Europe (Dincecco 2015).==== Consider North and Weingast (1989) influential work on England's Glorious Revolution of 1688. They argue that the revolution settlement and Bill of Rights of 1689 shifted the balance of power away from the Crown and towards Parliament. With representation drawn from England's primary wealth holders – increasingly industrialists and colonial traders (Pincus and Robinson 2014) – a Parliament that met regularly with its hand firmly on the purse strings served to credibly commit the government to respecting its creditors and property rights generally. That commitment, in turn, allowed the English government to invest in state capacity through increased taxation and borrowing.====But is the relationship between property rights and fiscal capacity relevant to the contemporary era? There are theoretical arguments to suggest it is (e.g., Levi 1988; Besley 2020; Besley and Persson 2009, 2011, 2014, 2021; see section 2 below). However, to our knowledge there has been no compelling empirical test of this hypothesis.====In this paper we study this question from a modern empirical perspective (119 countries from 1970 to 2015) and answer the question in the negative. As a measure of the strength of property rights under the rule of law, we employ the legal system and property rights measure from the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) report (Gwartney et al., 2019). This measure is designed to capture the extent to which property rights are enforced under the law and, relatedly, the degree of impartiality and independence of the courts. It is constructed in large part from survey data that provide insight into how a country's actual market participants perceive property rights and rule of law. A credible commitment to property rights/rule of law should be reflected as an increase in this measure. We consider the relationship between the Fraser Institute measure and some basic indicators of fiscal capacity.====In our analysis, selection bias and, more generally, the endogeneity of legal system and property rights quality is of clear concern. Not only may higher fiscal capacity facilitate better enforcement of property rights, but there will likely be unobserved factors that correlate with both variables. To determine whether commitments to property rights/rule of law cause increases in fiscal capacity, we need to (i) identify meaningful increases in the former and then (ii) construct plausible counterfactuals against which to compare subsequent changes in the latter.====Given the necessity of (i) and (ii), we employ matching methods. We begin by identifying countries that experienced a large and sustained increase in their legal system and property rights score (the ====).==== We then use a range of covariates to match each of these country to a set of other countries that were not treated. This allows us to construct a plausible counterfactual for each treated country. Estimation of a causal effect is based on a comparison of treated countries and their matched counterfactuals. We follow An and Winship (2017) and focus on post-treatment ==== in fiscal capacity. By doing so, we difference-out any time-invariant unobservables. This gives us confidence that we are achieving unbiased estimates of average treatment effects.====We find no evidence that large and sustained increases in property rights/rule of law are associated with increases in fiscal capacity. This is true across a variety of matching specifications, different definitions of the treatment, and the exclusion of developed countries from the sample; it also holds regardless of whether we consider a 5-year or a 10-year post-treatment horizon. The point estimates are not even robustly positive; they are also always small (in absolute value).====These null conclusions hold when considering changes in the overall tax share of GDP or “fiscal capacity-intensive” types of taxes (e.g., non-resource taxes, (taxes on income, profits, and capital gains; non-trade taxes). They continue to hold when we consider debt as a share of GDP or tax levels as opposed to shares. On the treatment side, we also consider both a narrower measure of property rights/rule of law from the Fraser Institute as well as an alternative measure from the V-Dem dataset. The above conclusions still hold. This is also the case when, lastly, we report two-way fixed effects (TWFE) results as a robustness check on the matching methods.====In sum, we find no evidence that sizeable changes to government protection of property rights cause increases in tax shares (state capacity). Nor do they cause increases in debt shares, or even increases in revenue levels. We believe this finding to be important because it implies that a channel that existed historically may well not exist today.====We proceed as follows. In section 2 we elaborate on the underlying hypothesis in more depth. In section 3 we discuss our empirical methodology. The data that we employ in the analysis is discussed in section 4. In section 5 we present and discuss our results, including those associated with various robustness checks.

More specifically, we investigate the effect of unification on tax compliance by taxpayers who had been previously living in different institutional and economic environments.====The Kingdom of Italy was born in 1861 through the consolidation into a single political entity of those states that were part of the territory known as the Italian peninsula together with the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. This sudden and swift episode caught almost everyone by surprise, both in Italy and abroad (Cohen and Federico, 2001). Its main implication was the drastic change experienced by citizens of the newborn kingdom, whose everyday life was shacked by the application of new laws and rules. In particular, laws were passed that laid the foundations of public finance in Italy for many decades to come. Common tax rates and tax bases for the entire country were introduced in the mid 1860s determining a large increase in the tax burden which turned out to be highly differentiated among areas of the country, due to differences in the levels of taxation among pre-unitary states.====We collected province-level data on measures of tax compliance in the years 1868–70 and in the years 2008–10. The first measure is based on a novel data set, while the second one is based on information supplied by the Italian ====. Moreover, we used data in Zamagni (2011) to obtain an index of the intensity of the tax shocks determined by the adoption of the national tax code.====Arguably, one would expect that the institutions emerging from a state-unification episode should foster the diffusion of common behavioral norms. Indeed, a simple comparison of the historical and current indicators of tax evasion reveals a strong process of convergence. The standard deviation of the current measure is about one half that of the historical one, whereas the average is highly persistent at about 25%. Evidence from a convergence equation that takes into account differences in income across provinces at the time of unification or differences in culture originating well before the unification is similar. The convergence process preserves quite well the historical ranking of provinces in terms of compliance, whereby the current geographical distribution of tax evasion is still shaped by the historical one.====OLS estimates of the size of convergence could be biased if, for instance, provinces feature permanent differences in their economic, cultural, or social characteristics that are relevant for compliance decisions but are not well captured by the empirical specification. Our tax shock index provides a measure of the exogenous increment in the tax burden determined by the unification. We show that the indicator of the historical level of tax evasion turns out to be positively correlated with such index and that IV estimates of the convergence equation – by using the index as an instrument – are virtually the same as the OLS ones. This results suggest that the current variability in rates of evasion among Italian provinces can be, at least in part, traced back to the episode of the Italian unification which contributed to determine the initial wide historical variability and then the process of convergence.====The above mentioned evidence raises the challenging question as to why the historical variability in evasion has been only partially reduced by the process of convergence during a time span of one century and a half. Our conjecture is that the choice of a decentralized structure chosen to enforce the fiscal obligation in the Kingdom of Italy played a relevant role. In this regard, we share with Alessio (1883) the idea that the peculiar composition of the tax courts and the inadequate resources and inspection powers committed by the central government to local public officials – together with the heavy tax burden – are crucial to understand the behavior of taxpayers. In other words, under the assumption that the enforcement activity of the new kingdom was not targeted to specifically contrast noncompliance at local level, the tax shocks may have contributed to the emergence of long-lasting local norms in taxpayers’ compliance behavior. A simple dynamic model highlights the potential implications of the decentralized enforcement structure.====The result of historical persistence documented in this paper is qualitatively consistent with the main findings in Besley et al. (2019) who study the dynamic effects of the poll tax in England and Wales during 1990–93 and Alm and Yunus (2009) who investigate the geographical distribution of tax compliance in US. Our evidence also accords with the long-term effects of legal traditions on current outcomes and complements that on the persistence of cultural attitudes as documented by La Porta et al., 1998, Guiso et al., 2016b, respectively.====Our paper is also naturally related to the literature on the economics of state formation, or breakup, and integration processes (Bolton and Roland, 1997, Alesina and Spolaore, 2003). The role of common institutions and policies for integration processes is discussed by Bertola et al. (2014); the role of cultural differences for the adoption of efficient policies is analyzed by Guiso et al. (2016a).====A number of authors have investigated empirically the role of spillovers and enforcement externalities to explain tax compliance.==== As for Italy, Galbiati and Zanella (2012) show that during the 1980s congestion in the auditing activity crucially affected the size of the social multiplier whereas Battaglini et al. (2019) show that individual tax evasion from 2007 to 2013 was correlated with the average evasion of all taxpayers that cater to the same tax professional. Moreover, results in Drago et al. (2020) suggest that communication among neighbors affects the compliance decisions of Austrian households. The empirical evidence we provide is in line with these findings.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and provides evidence on the long-run dynamics of non compliance. In Section 3 we investigate the impact of the tax reform at the onset of the Italian unification while in Section 4 we develop a model whose predictions are coherent with our empirical strategy and useful to interpret the historical evidence.

However, the role of fiscal federalism is still disputed. Theoretical arguments highlight that fiscal federalism may be both a resource and a threat for economic performance. Given this ambiguity, a bulk of studies aimed at investigating the issue empirically. While the literature, to date, has failed to provide clear-cut results, recent contributions suggest that the measurement of fiscal federalism matters for the (divergent) results (see, e.g., Baskaran et al. 2016). In particular, the common approach of measuring fiscal federalism by just one variable (usually fiscal decentralization) or simply differentiating between unitary and federal states is insufficient. For Swiss federalism, the empirical evidence is remarkably scarce (see, however, Feld et al. 2005). This comes as a surprise given that Switzerland is a prime example of a federation.====This paper improves on a widespread shortcoming of previous research by taking into account the various institutions that constitute fiscal federalism, allowing for uncovering heterogeneous effects. In this sense, the paper is a methodological contribution emphasizing that fiscal federalism is not easily captured by only one aspect, namely decentralization, but that its different institutions, like the extent of fiscal competition, jurisdictional fragmentation, or the design of its grant or fiscal equalization systems, need to be taken into account properly. To this end, Switzerland provides for a laboratory, as its 26 cantons share a common framework while the extent of fiscal federalism varies between the cantons.====The results offer general insights beyond Switzerland. Inference can particularly be drawn for traditional federations that have similarly strong elements of competitive fiscal federalism such as the U.S. and Canada. However, Switzerland is relatively small in geographic terms when compared with those other two federations. Adverse effects of competitive federalism on economic performance should thus rather obtain in Switzerland than in the U.S. or Canada. Overall, the evidence for Swiss fiscal federalism allows for an inference as to how competitive elements of fiscal federalism may work, even if they are introduced in other institutional settings, e.g., without direct democracy as a distinguishing element of the Swiss framework.====The paper exploits this setting using a two-way fixed effects approach and differentiating between seven distinct instruments of federalism. The findings differ conditional on the measurement of the dependent variable and on the federal instrument under consideration. Overall, the paper suggests that instruments of competitive federalism rather improve economic performance of the cantons, while the effects of cooperative elements are not unambiguously identified. This particularly holds if the dependent variable maps cantonal economic performance as measured by real GDP per employee (i.e., labour productivity).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly summarizes the main transmission channels of fiscal federalism; Section 3 reviews the empirical literature; Section 4 identifies the federal institutions in the Swiss cantons; Section 5 presents the empirical strategy and the model; Section 6 shows the baseline results; Section 7 discusses the robustness of the results and Section 8 concludes.",Fiscal federalism and economic performance new evidence from Switzerland,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001300,10 December 2021,2021,Research Article,98.0

The contest is between government that has held legal rights and forest-dwelling communities whose traditional rights have not been recognised. However, in 2008 a legislative reform – Forest Rights Act (FRA) – was introduced that gave forest ownership rights to forest-dwellers. We study evolution of land-related disputes after enactment of FRA. Two opposing forces are expected. While provision of ","Restoration and enhancement of forest wealth is one of the stated goals of governments worldwide. The innumerable benefits that forest ecosystem offers to the environment makes it a critical resource for our survival. In addition to providing habitat to diverse plants and animal species, forests are home to millions of indigenous communities who derive livelihood sources from them. However, forest is a common pool resource that is used by many groups and it is hard to exclude any group from using it. Therefore, defining ownership and management rights over forests has important implications for its sustainable use. Property rights arrangements on forests have taken various forms in different parts of the world ranging from completely ill-defined rights to state ownership to joint ownership between state and community and to complete community ownership.====This paper focuses on forest land ownership arrangements in India where 22% of geographical area is covered by forest. India has a long history of contested land ownership over forest.==== The contest is between traditional forest dwelling communities most of which are ==== – indigenous communities of India also administratively referred to as Scheduled Tribes (STs) – and the government. STs have been living in forest areas for centuries without holding formal titles whereas the government has held legal rights over forest land since colonial times. In the pre-colonial period, local communities used and managed forest resources deriving their livelihood from it with little government control. However, colonial forest policy of 1865 brought a large part of forest area under government ownership rendering traditional claims of millions of forest dwellers illegal. Government control over forests was carried forward in the Indian forest governance after independence in 1947 without settling the rights of forest dwellers. Lack of formal titles coupled with growing industrial needs of the economy led to diversion of forest lands and eviction of millions of forest dwellers. This has led to protests and land disputes between government and forest dwellers over ownership of forest land in many cases. With this backdrop, this paper looks at a legislative reform that recognises forest land rights of traditional forest dwellers.====The legislative reform is Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) act (FRA from hereon) which got enacted in 2006 and implemented in 2008. FRA was introduced to recognise individual titles – to land that forest dwellers had traditionally been cultivating or residing over up to a maximum of 4 hectares – and community titles giving community the right to ownership of non-timber forest produce (NTFP) (which has the potential to significantly supplement their livelihood) as well as the right to manage and conserve forests. Since forest dwellers became the legal owners, they also got the authority to decide if forest land can be diverted for non-forest purposes as opposed to government holding the discretionary power. After over a decade of FRA implementation, this paper studies the evolution of land disputes in forest areas where land disputes are defined as conflicting claims to use/ownership over a piece of land.====FRA, being a property rights legislation, is expected to reduce the likelihood of contest over forests because it provides recourse to forest dwellers to establish their land rights. Studies and anecdotal instances==== have shown improvement in socio-economic condition of forest dependent communities in terms of increased income and employment opportunities from sale of NTFP as well as increased sustainable use of forests after recognition of individual and community titles (Sahu, 2020). Thus FRA has the potential to address grievances of forest dwellers. However, a number of challenges grapple its effective functioning. Existing forest conservation legislations have not been amended to recognise the rights of forest dwellers provided by FRA. Such conflicting legislations can be used to negate forest dwellers claims over forest land thus increasing competing claims. Additionally, provision of land titles and consequently title benefits may increase the value that forest dwellers place in land, as has been observed with forest title legislations in other contexts, thereby increasing their demand for titles in case of a contest (Alston et al., 1996, Alston et al., 2000). Therefore the direction of change in land disputes trend after FRA is apriori ambiguous. We empirically investigate this in the paper.====There are limited studies looking at land disputes in India probably owing to lack of data. But, being an important resource in the economy and a critical determinant of socio-economic prosperity, disputes over land can create distortions, stall important infrastructural and development projects ==== put huge investments at risk and affect livelihoods of many and thus demand attention (Muyanga and Gitau, 2014, Deininger and Castagnini, 2006, Yamano and Deininger, 2005, Ding, 2007). Additionally, disputes over forest land are more worrisome because of the many benefits that forest ecosystem offers for the environment. Studying a legislation that seeks to address contesting claims over forest land, therefore, seems relevant.====We use a recent database, Land Conflicts Watch (LCW), to get data on ==== land disputes in India. LCW database makes use of various sources like newspaper reports, public hearing records, village assembly resolutions to report an ongoing conflict. We consider land disputes at the district level from 2000 to 2017 for our analysis. The disputes covered in the dataset are not necessarily legal disputes and infact a large number of them, specifically pertaining to forest areas, are extra legal given lack of formal titles with forest dwellers (Wahi, 2017).====We use a difference-in-difference methodology to compare land disputes likelihood in high and low forest cover areas before and after 2008. We expect the difference-in-difference coefficient to capture the trend break in land disputes likelihood. Findings from our empirical analysis suggest that the likelihood of land dispute onset increases after 2008 and this increase is higher for high forest cover as compared to low forest cover areas. For the reported trend break to be indicative of change ==== FRA, we make sure that there are no differential trend in land disputes before 2008 in high forest cover areas as compared to districts with less cover. We also check robustness of our results to existing state policies, presence of minerals, intensity of Maoist insurgency and economic activity.====As explained above, there could be three reasons for increased disputes after FRA implementation. The first one relates to co-existence of a number of contradictory laws. Many provisions of existing conservation laws like Indian Forest Act of 1927, Forest Conservation Act (FCA) 1980 and Wildlife Protection Act 1972 contradict the rights provided to community under FRA. This creates legal ambiguity and consequently possibility of conflicting claims. We provide supporting evidence for this by exploiting variation in the amount of funds disbursed to states under compulsory afforestation mandate of the FCA. FCA requires entities diverting forest land for non-forest purposes to pay amount equivalent to net present value of the forest land to states (in a fund called “compensatory afforestation fund”). States have to use this fund for afforestation activity to compensate for the lost forest reserve. This mandate was however not amended after FRA to recognise that state cannot undertake afforestation activity without forest dwellers permission.==== We show that places with higher disbursement of afforestation funds are the ones experiencing larger increases in land disputes after 2008, suggesting higher instances of violation of FRA.====Second reason is that FRA might increase the value that forest dwellers place in land since it allows individual ownership and cultivation on forest land. Thus in case of a contest, as compared to before FRA, forest dwellers have added incentives to claim land titles (or ask for better compensation in case they hold titles) and participate in disputes. We provide preliminary but suggestive evidence for this. We look at how the association between forest cover and land disputes changes with distribution of titles and show that places that have distributed titles more see higher increase in land disputes as compared to average. This suggests that dispute for titles is more beneficial where title distribution rate is higher as gains from holding titles are easily observable.====In addition to these two reasons, we provide evidence of lax implementation of FRA which could increase disputes if genuine claims are rejected due to inefficient implementation. Progress reports of FRA show that of the total claims filed, on average only around 38% have been distributed.

As IDA aid is distributed only to countries that fall below an income threshold, we employ a (fuzzy) regression discontinuity approach to estimate the causal effect of aid on conflict. Our results suggest that IDA aid leads to a decrease in protest events, such as anti-government demonstrations, strikes, and riots, and in an increase in violent events that involve forms of aggression, like assassinations of political leaders, purges, and revolutions. Our results, as well as a series of robustness tests, are consistent with the view that foreign aid may increase popular support for the government, thus reducing protests, and at the same time increase conflict over lootable aid rents, and so increasing events of extreme aggression.","A voluminous literature analyzes the effect of foreign aid on the recipient economy. For example, Easterly (2003), Djankov et al. (2008), Doucouliagos and Paldam (2008), Dreher and Lohmann (2015), and Galiani et al. (2017), examine the effect of aid on growth. Similarly, Burnside and Dollar (2000), Bjørnskov (2010), and Askarov and Doucouliagos (2015) examine the effect of aid on institutional quality. In the present paper, we examine the effect of aid on domestic conflict in the recipient country for 198 countries over the period 1989–2016. This issue has been examined in several other contributions (Bluhm et al., 2021; Collier and Hoeffler, 2002, 2000; Crost et al., 2016, etc.) with contradicting findings. In contrast to these studies, we exploit the GNI threshold that the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) uses to distribute aid among recipient countries as an identification strategy to examine the causal effect of aid on conflict. Even though other studies have used the same framework to examine the effect of aid on growth (see e.g., Dreher and Lohmann, 2015; Galiani et al., 2017), to our knowledge the present study is the first to estimate the effect of foreign development assistance on conflict using this strategy.====We rely on IDA aid as it has a clear methodological advantage: Aid provided by the IDA is distributed according to a simple rule. Specifically, countries that are eligible for IDA aid must fall below a GNI threshold level, which is defined by the World Bank and revised every year. Then, countries that have a GNI lower than the threshold two years before IDA aid allocations are made are eligible for aid. However, this is not the only condition for IDA aid allocation. According to the World Bank, in addition, to receive IDA aid, a country must be considered uncredit worthy for IBRD borrowing (Galiani et al., 2017). However, the latter condition of creditworthiness is based solely on confidential reports by the World Bank, rather than a clear-cut policy rule. Given the above, we use a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (fuzzy RDD) to exploit both the GNI cutoff rule of the IDA program and deal with the problem of some countries being deemed creditworthy and therefore excluded, even though their GNI falls below the threshold.====By estimating a local fuzzy RDD, we identify the effect of aid on conflict for countries which are just above and just below the cutoff. Hence, our quasi-experimental design treats threshold crossings as random arbitrary events. In other words, being on either side of the threshold is attributed to randomness rather than particular macro or institutional characteristics.==== This allows us to examine the causal effect for similar countries, in general, but with the only difference being their eligibility for IDA aid. Then, fuzzy RDD addresses the issue of endogeneity which plagues the standard fixed effects OLS regressions (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). Moreover, in contrast to matching techniques (Austin, 2011), it does not depend on the assumption of conditional independence and overlap, which are only satisfied within the limit of an ==== framework (Heckman et al., 1999). Finally, the inclusion of fixed effects as additional moderators removes any confounding effect of crossing the threshold on other variables that also affect conflict.====Most studies that examine the effect of aid on conflict, typically focus on one type of conflict (see e.g., Azam and Thelen, 2008; Berthélemy, 2006; Findley et al., 2010; Strange et al., 2017; Wood and Sullivan, 2015; Young and Findley, 2011) or treat various types of conflict events as substitutes. Recently, Bluhm et al. (2021) examined the effect of aid on both major and minor conflict events and showed that minor conflict events might fuel armed conflicts. In the present study, and this is our second major contribution, we follow the latter rationale and assume that aid does not affect all conflict events equally.====As we expect that conflict has a multidimensional character, our first step, in the empirical section of the paper, is to categorize various conflict events using dynamic factor analysis. The set of conflict events is taken from the Banks and Wilson (2021) database. Our analysis, then, concludes that conflict events have two different dimensions – what we call, using the same terminology as Klomp and de Haan (2009), protest events (i.e., anti-government demonstrations, riots, strikes), and aggression events (i.e., revolutions, purges, and assassinations of political leaders). Therein, our findings show that IDA aid receipt leads to a differential effect on conflict depending on the specific type of conflict under consideration. We find that aid leads to a decline in events related to social unrest and protest while it has a positive effect on major conflict events that are associated with forms of aggression.====These results are consistent with several theoretical contributions in the aid-conflict nexus, as summarized in the following section 2. If aid creates a “winning the hearts and minds” effect, i.e., it improves economic performance and increases the support to the government, it is expected to reduce conflict (Collier and Hoeffler, 2002). And low-intensity conflict events of protest are typically considered to be fueled by discontent. Hence, this view is consistent with our finding of a negative effect of IDA aid on protest events. At the same time, however, aid creates rents for those that hold political power (Angeles and Neanidis, 2009). As several agents and groups that stand to gain from a change in the political regime try to increase their political power, in an attempt to expropriate the aid rents, aggression events of violence are expected to increase. After all, the literature suggests that major conflict events are spurred by the existence of private gains. This, then, can be considered to be the driving force of the positive effect of IDA aid on aggression events.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we present the existing literature and then provide our main testable hypothesis. In section 3 we discuss our data and our empirical specification. In section 4 we present our results while section 5 holds the robustness checks. Finally, section 6 concludes.",The effect of international development association's (IDA) aid on conflict.

We estimate an extended random utility model of migration using pooled OLS, fixed effects, 2SLS, and PPML estimators. Our findings indicate that institutional quality plays a significant role in bilateral migration between the OECD countries. Political institutions are found to play a more important role compared to economic institutions. We also examine the moderating role of migration policy in fostering the nexus between the quality of institutions and bilateral migration, using three measures: the Migration Policy Index (MPI), and sub-sample analyses using both top OECD to OECD migration destinations and Schengen area countries. The Schengen country specific sub-sample analysis shows that if migration barriers are withdrawn, bilateral institutional quality differences lead to higher migration. However, estimated results based on the MPI and top OECD to OECD migration destinations do not show a significant role for pro-migration policy in strengthening the relationship between institutions and migration. The results are robust to different estimation methods, sub-sample analyses, and alternative specifications of the empirical model.","The number of foreign-born people (15+) in OECD countries reached 120 million in 2015/16, compared to 78 million in 2000/01, representing 54% of the world immigrant population and 12% of the population living in OECD countries (d'Aiglepierre et al., 2020). Of the total immigrant population living in OECD countries, 38% were born in another OECD country with wide variations in shares from less than 10% in Slovenia, Chile and Estonia to over 70% in Ireland, the Slovak Republic and Luxembourg (d'Aiglepierre et al., 2020). d'Aiglepierre et al., 2020 further note that in 2015/16, a third of all adult immigrants in OECD countries had a tertiary education with the share being higher for countries with selective migration policies, for example Canada (60% of immigrants had tertiary qualifications) and Australia (47%). The average level of education of recent immigrants from OECD countries is also observed to have has risen at a faster pace compared to non-OECD countries signifying perhaps the increase in temporary migration of highly educated people between the Schengen area. Hence, a better understanding of North-North migration is warranted.====In view of this, we aim to answer the following questions. What motivates people from OECD countries to migrate to other OECD countries? Do political and economic institutions play a significant role in this respect? Does pro-migration policy catalyze the flow of migration between OECD countries? We contribute to the literature by: (1) focusing on reasons for North-North bilateral migration; (2) examining the role of institutions as the primary factor influencing North-North bilateral migration; (3) we also consider the moderating role of migration policy in bilateral net migration. Only a small number of studies examining South-North, North-South, and South-South migration consider institutions, and here too, institutions are considered as one factor, among many in determining bilateral migration. Moreover, these studies employ only a limited number of political institutions. Ariu, Docquier, and Squicciarini (2016) examine the influence of the quality of institutions on skilled migration, but do not differentiate between poor and rich countries. Bertocchi and Strozzi (2008) use political regime and the fraction of registered voters as proxies for political institutions and observe a significant role for institutions in attracting migrants over the period 1870–1910 in 14 OECD countries. Their study, however, examines migration from poor to rich countries, and does not capture different aspects of political institutions. Cooray and Schneider (2016) find that corruption acts as a push factor for high-skilled migrants from both poor and wealthy countries. Thus, studies that estimate the impact of institutions on migration focus mainly on South-North migration. Existing studies moreover, pay attention to one-way migration.====Empirically, there is no consensus on the best set of institutional variables that should be used to capture all forms of political and economic institutions. Taking into account a historical dataset of 19th century migration, Bertocchi and Strozzi (2008) argue that the quality of institutions including political rights, democracy, and institutions such as citizenship laws, land distribution, public education policy, and immigration policy, determine the flow of international migration. Rowlands (1999) observes that governance is likely to be an important factor for emigration from poor to wealthy countries. Studies also use corruption as an indicator of political institutions and examine emigration due to corruption (Dimant et al., 2013; Ariu and Squicciarini, 2013; Cooray and Schneider, 2016; Poprawe, 2015). Wong and Celbis (2015) use the level of human rights protection as an indicator of institutions and report that an increase in human rights increases migration by more than fifty percent. Ashby (2010) claims that political freedom has a negative impact on migration flows. Karemera et al. (2000) find that limited civil and political freedom in the country of origin deters outward migration. Nejad and Young (2016) find that economic freedom affects migration significantly. This is supported by Ashby (2010), who reports that economic freedom has a positive impact on migration flows while political freedom has an insignificant effect. We, therefore, use a range of political and economic institutions to capture the influence of institutions on migration including the control of corruption, government effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, voice and accountability, and economic freedom. We additionally construct a composite index for political institutions using the principal component analysis (PCA).====A factor that could constrain a migrant's decision to emigrate, is migration policy in the destination country. The Schengen area is an exception. If individuals from a Schengen country wish to move to another Schengen country, they face fewer constraints than those from non-Schengen countries. A less restrictive immigration policy in a destination country would reduce migration costs and make it easier for people to emigrate to a destination country and vice versa (Mayda, 2010). Although immigration policy is the same across Schengen countries, this policy varies for countries outside the Schengen area. For example, Switzerland has a more restrictive immigration policy compared to Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States for residents from non-Schengen countries. However, only a few studies capture the influence of immigration policy in determining bilateral migration flows. As with the indicators for institutions, there is no standard variable used to capture migration policy. Studies have used various indicators to control for migration policy including VISA waivers (Bertoli and Moraga 2013), VISA policies (Bertoli and Moraga, 2015; Beine and Parsons, 2015), multilateral agreements such as Schengen (Beine et al., 2013), refugee and asylum policies (Grogger and Hanson, 2011), and immigration reforms (Ortega and Peri, 2013). Studies show mixed results for the effect of migration policy on international migration. Ariu et al. (2016) find that differences in immigration policy (restrictive or easy) do not lead to a difference in bilateral migration flows. Bertoli and Moraga (2013) claim that migration policy plays a larger role in determining migration flows compared to income differentials. Ortega and Peri (2009) and Mayda (2010) observe that in the presence of a less restrictive immigration policy at the destination (as opposed to a tight migration policy), migration is higher. Therefore, we use three different immigration policy proxies to examine how immigration policies (restrictive vs liberal) could influence the flow of migrants.====A large literature shows that income disparities lead to emigration, particularly, between rich and poor countries (Stark and Taylor, 1991; Rowlands, 1998, 1999, 2004; Ortega and Peri, 2013; Docquier et al., 2014; Mayda, 2010; Karemera et al., 2000). Some studies find a “migration-band curve” where migration increases with income, reaches a peak and eventually falls (Olesen, 1995; Rowlands, 1999). First-generation migration studies (Harris and Todaro, 1970; Greenwood, 1975; Borjas, 1989; Massey et al., 1993), explain rural-urban migration in terms of expected earning differentials between rural and urban areas. Grogger and Hanson (2011) claim that the difference in per capita income explains 58 percent of the variation in the stock of migrants between two countries.====Second generation migration studies emphasize economic and demographic factors such as income, wages, employment, better living conditions, diaspora, the quality of life among other variables as key determinants of migration (Jenkins, 1977; Massey and Basem, 1992; Curran and Rivero-Fuentes, 2003; Mayda, 2010; Beine et al., 2011; Cooray, 2014; Ivlevs, 2015; Nikolova and Graham, 2015).==== Borjas (1989) argues that there exists an immigration market whereby individuals decide on whether to migrate or not, based on the principle of utility maximization. According to these theories, individuals compare the income stream from countries and opt for the country with the highest level of net expected income. Empirical research supporting the utility maximization principle of migration, suggests that the utility of migrants depends on expected wages, income, employability, and/or the overall standard of living in the destination country. Studies also pay attention to the importance of demographic factors such as distance between host and home countries, transportation costs and population size (Karemera et al., 2000; Ortega and Peri, 2009; Beine et al., 2016). Ortega and Peri (2009) find that colonial ties have a positive effect on migration. Karemera et al. (2000) in a study of migration from 70 countries to North America, find that distance impairs migration flows to North America due to high costs and logistical needs. The studies of Lewer and Van den Berg (2008), Clark et al. (2007), Pedersen et al. (2008), Mayda (2010), McKenzie et al. (2014) confirm this.====Economic rather than non-economic factors are likely to play a greater role in migration decisions from low to high-income countries.==== While income no doubt plays an important role in determining migration decisions, when income reaches a certain threshold, individuals may trade-off wage and non-wage income for the quality of institutions to maximize their wellbeing. Other things being equal, weak institutions could push migrants out of a source country to a destination country with strong institutions. The quality of institutions has some intrinsic value that positively contributes to future income growth (Acemoglu et al., 2005). Thus, the importance of the quality of institutions in international migration should not be overlooked (see, Borjas, 1989; Rowlands, 1999; Karemera et al., 2000; Bertocchi and Strozzi, 2008; Ashby, 2010; Hatton and Williamson, 2011; Cooray and Schneider, 2016; Ariu et al., 2016).====Our study covers the period 1996 to 2016. As in several international migration studies (see, for example, Ariu et al., 2016), a modified variant of the random utility model is employed in this study. According to this model, an agent makes a migration decision based on the differences in utility derived from benefits and costs at home and host countries. Our model reflects that the net migration in OECD countries is likely to be influenced by the differences in various political and economic institutions between source and destination countries. We employ a number of econometric methods including Pooled Ordinary Least Square (POLS), fixed effects, two stage least squares (2SLS), and Poisson pseudo maximum likelihood (PPML) for estimation.====The estimated results show that institutional variables have a highly significant effect on net bilateral migration flows between OECD countries. The results are consistent irrespective of different model specifications, various estimation methods and sub-sample analyses. The stock of immigrants (differential) plays a significant role in net bilateral migration. The bilateral differential in unemployment rate, rate of inflation and income are also significant determinants of migration. The results clearly indicate that people in wealthy nations consistently value the quality of institutions more than other economic and non-economic factors. Finally, the results show no significant moderating role of migration policy in fostering the relationship between institutions and net bilateral migration among OECD countries. Our results are largely robust to different estimation models and methods.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

After describing the current French legal context, it shows how a mechanism design approach can explain the factors that theoretically justify such practices, potentially including favoritism and rent-seeking. An empirical analysis is then carried out on the French public procurement data set for the year 2017. It illustrates the weight of political preferences in the choice to resort to social clauses and the weight of the preferences of the local chief executive to explain the use of environmental clauses. It also highlights that social and environmental clauses do not seem to be used as a tool for favoritism.","Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) is a process by which public authorities seek to achieve the appropriate balance between the three pillars of sustainable development – economic, social, and environmental – when procuring goods, services, or works at all stages of a project. Many public authorities in the world are implementing Green Public Procurement (GPP) as part of a broader approach to sustainability in their purchasing, which also addresses economic and social issues.==== The idea of entrusting to the public commissioning of social policy objectives is older. McCrudden (2007), for example, relates past experiences that punctuate public authority contracts around the world: minimum wage clauses as early as 1891 in the United Kingdom and 1899 in France, social integration clauses from 1938 in the USA for the blind, etc.====An immediate question to ask is whether public procurement works as an effective policy instrument to achieve these issues. The arguments to settle this debate can be of two kinds:====Firstly, it is a question of evaluating the potential benefits of such public procurement rules on environmental or social aspects. Investigating e.g. the extent to which procurement policies actually improve the environment is not such an easy task since it depends on the market response to GPP procedures (see e.g. Marron, 1997, Lundberg et al., 2012). The same is true for social aspects since a non partial analysis must be conducted. In this paper, we do not address the issue of evaluating the potential benefits of such clauses on environmental or social aspects.====
      ====The second argument does not address the effectiveness of environmental or social clauses but rather the “sincerity” of the objective pursued. Indeed, there is a fine line between targeted procurement (i.e., favoring a firm because of the social or environmental benefits it provides) and favoritism (i.e., favoring a firm for less avowed reasons). In this article, using a political economy approach where procurement policy is delegated to elected representatives or bureaucrats (public buyers), we analyze the reasons for the use of social or environmental (hereafter S.E.) clauses in public procurement contracts. In particular, what does the use of such clauses reveal about the preferences of public buyers? May these clauses being used as a tool for favoritism?====We first try to answer this question from a theoretical point of view. After determining the main properties of the public buyer’s objective function, we highlight the benefits of including S.E. clauses in different benchmark cases. We also compare the optimal procedures from the point of view of social welfare and from the point of view of the public buyer to whom the implementation of the procedure is delegated. In particular, using the framework of the theoretical mechanism design literature, we derive the conditions under which the clauses chosen by the public buyer also maximize the social welfare. Beside, we provide the concrete forms of these clauses (scoring rules, set-asides, discriminatory rules). However, we show that it is difficult to answer our question from a theoretical point of view, since the same type of clauses can be used to satisfy multiple objectives (reflection of the preferences of the median voter for a type of firm or for a level of S.E. quality, rent-seeking, bribes). So, the mere observation of S.E. clauses does not allow to infer the real motivations of a public buyer.====An empirical analysis is, therefore, required to explain what the use of clauses reveals about public buyer preferences. To do this, we use an original data set of 58,402 French public procurement contracts awarded in 2017, highlighting the marked diversity of practices for the inclusion of S.E. clauses. Then, restricting attention to a sub-sample of only the contracts awarded by the Departmental Councils, in order to study a homogeneous set of 4378 markets and identify the political hue of these local authorities, we perform three series of econometric tests.====The first one explains the probability of having a social clause in departmental public procurement contracts. The second one explains the probability of having an environmental clause in these contracts. Our analysis highlights the diversity of objectives that may justify such clauses. Social clauses seem to reflect political preferences, as well as the proportion of individuals who can benefit from these clauses in the jurisdiction. If environmental clauses seem to be explained less by considerations of partisan politics (studied on a left/right axis), the weight of the environmentalist electorate on the local executive appears to be decisive for such clauses. From this analysis, we cannot reject the hypothesis that S.E. clauses simply reflect differences in the median voters preferences of the jurisdictions studied.====Then, using local buying as a proxy for favoritism, the third test analyzes whether S.E. clauses appear to be a significant factor in order to help a local firm to succeed. We find that the inclusion of S.E. clauses significantly decreases the likelihood of local purchasing in public procurement. This result suggests that the use of S.E. clauses can rather be explained by welfare consideration and political affiliation than by a favoritism of specific firms (and not at a specific category of firm). The risk of favoritism may, therefore, be through the various methods of awarding markets (choice of awarding method, degree of publicity of the call for tenders) and/or the lack of mandatory method to compute scoring rules.====This article is organized as follows.

Among the several consequences of the expansion of monetary policy tools, central banks’ recent actions have revived the debate about the relationship between independence and accountability (de Haan et al., 2008, McPhilemy and Moschella, 2019, Tucker, 2019). Indeed, central banks’ responses to the financial and economic crises of 2008 and 2020 have raised important questions on whether central banks’ accountability frameworks “are well adapted to the new era of highly interventionist central bank policies” (Braun and Hoffmann-Axthelm, 2017) and adequate to the challenge of ensuring that independence does not stand in the way of “the normal public conflict and institutional checking before policy is made” (Jacobs et al., 2021).====The debate on the relationship between independence and accountability is not new in central banking scholarship. Given the consolidated and still growing literature on central bank independence (see Hayo and Hefeker, 2002, Demertzis et al., 2004, Berger and Kißmer, 2013, Reinsberg et al., 2021 among others), the recognition of accountability as the “moral corollary” of independence has been one of the hallmarks of modern central banking and the basis upon which central banks have increased disclosure and accountability to the public (De Haan, 1997, Blinder, 1999, Masciandaro et al., 2008). While an extensive literature in economics and political science exists on the procedures and mechanisms through which central banks account for their actions (see Morris et al., 2004, de Haan et al., 2005, de Haan et al., 2007, Crowe and Meade, 2008, Hasan and Mester, 2008, Waller, 2011, Masciandaro and Quintyn, 2016, Moschella et al., 2020), far less attention has been devoted to the other side of the accountability relationship, namely the political voice through which policymakers keep the central bank accountable (notable exceptions are Schonhardt-Bailey, 2013, Collignon and Diessner, 2016, Fraccaroli et al., 2020, Fraccaroli et al., 2021. In other words, while the literature has extensively focused on the agent’s accountability practices, a systematic examination of the principals’ behaviour in keeping the agent accountable has thus far eschewed systematic attention.====This neglect is not without consequences. A limited understanding of the standards against which policymakers consider the central bank accountable risks obscuring the informal channels through which politics exerts influence on monetary policy despite the de jure statutory arrangements in place to safeguard central bank independence. This is especially the case at a time when independence looks particularly vulnerable because of populist politics, rising public debt, and dwindling public support for central banks, at least in advanced economies (Goodhart and Lastra, 2018, Rodrik, 2018, Jones and Matthijs, 2019, Masciandaro, 2019, Peia and Romelli, 2019). In fact, it has been argued that the rise of populism is likely to be negatively correlated with the consensus in favour of central bank independence (see Buiter, 2014, De Haan and Eijffinger, 2017, Agur, 2018, Goodhart and Lastra, 2018, Masciandaro and Passarelli, 2019 among others). This paper contributes to the existing scholarship on central bank governance and accountability by asking a key question: what are central banks held accountable for by elected officials? This question calls for a systematic examination of politicians’ voice as articulated in formal settings and over a long-time span. In carrying out this examination, the article sheds light on the salience attributed to different policy issues by the elected officials responsible for holding central banks accountable. Our analysis uncovers the domestic macroeconomic roots of issue salience in articulating political voice on monetary policy.====In order to investigate politicians’ voice on accountability, the analysis focuses on the hearings of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the European Parliament in the framework of the quarterly Monetary Dialogues between the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the President of the ECB. Studying elected officials’ accountability practices towards the ECB offers a number of important empirical advantages for the purposes of the analysis. First, as a supranational central bank, the ECB performance is subject to the scrutiny of politicians whose preferences vary along different country and political dimensions. Thus, zooming on the political voice articulated within the European Parliament allows us to address the blind spots in the scholarship on accountability by studying a setting characterized by high economic heterogeneity among the different constituencies represented by elected officials. A further advantage of studying the ECB stems from the fact that the institution has a primary mandate that singles out price stability as the central bank’s primary objective and subordinates the pursuit of other objectives. These governance features allow us to clearly ascertain whether politicians emphasize the principal or secondary objectives in keeping the central bank accountable.====Our empirical analysis of political voice relies on a novel dataset of the ECB’s Monetary Dialogues and state-of-the-art quantitative text analysis techniques. Two major findings derive from the analysis. First, we show that political voice on central bank accountability significantly varies over time and across policymakers. In particular, we find that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) do not always keep the central bank accountable for the primary objective of price stability that has been delegated to the ECB. European politicians also attempt to keep the central bank accountable for a broader set of issues that are connected with, but distinct from, the central bank’s primary goal. Second, employing panel data, we provide evidence that MEPs react to differentials in unemployment in their constituencies: the higher is the domestic unemployment rate in the country where they have been elected, the lower is policymakers’ attention to price stability. These results reveal the existence of a “political” Phillips curve reaction function that enriches our understanding of the principal–agent accountability relationship between politicians and central bankers. Specifically, our results suggest that elected policymakers are less likely to hold the central bank accountable for its primary objective of price stability when labour market conditions are worse in their home country.====The paper develops as follows. In the following section, we review the debate on central banks’ accountability to shed light on the contribution of the paper, namely its focus on politicians’ voice in keeping the central bank accountable. In Section 3, we present the data and method employed in the analysis. In Section 4, we provide a systematic examination of MEPs’ voice on monetary policy between 1999 and 2019 and analyse its macroeconomic determinants. In Section 5, we perform several robustness tests. Finally, we conclude by exploring the implications of our findings for the future of central bank independence.",Political voice on monetary policy: Evidence from the parliamentary hearings of the European Central Bank,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001178,20 November 2021,2021,Research Article,103.0

Adopting reliable and objective measures is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of corruption in public procurement and examining how corruption impacts the misuse of public funds. Hitherto, a relative dearth of studies has attempted to measure the risk of corruption at the procurement level.==== Notwithstanding the complexity of the phenomenon, the chief reason for this lacuna is that scholars only incidentally produce indicators, opting instead to use specific datasets and corruption proxies to estimate specific underlying patterns inherent to public procurement. In contradistinction to extant measures, this paper aims to develop a novel corruption risk indicator (CRI) at the procurement level, underpinned by a sound methodology that is replicable across time and space and proven robust to several validation tests.====The methodology underpinning the CRI is predicated on a two-stage “residual approach”. First, from a set of input-output variables, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) procedure estimates the potential waste score for each contract. The scores are obtained on a set of planned targets and actual project resources. A potential mismatch between resources and targets yields waste, such as the incapacity of achieving the targeted results with the actual resources. Second, since waste in public procurement is predominantly driven by both inefficiency (e.g., inaccurate cost forecasting, poor contract design, inadequate monitoring in the implementation of the contract, organizational deficiencies and poor levels of human capital) and corruption, we expunge the inefficiency component that is not correlated to corruption in order to isolate the corruption component and obtain a corruption-risk score at the procurement level. For this study, we apply this methodology to Italian public works data, encompassing a wide array of governmental activities and pertains to a country subject to extensive investigations on corruption and its measurement.====This approach is consistent with three strands of literature. The first strand corresponds to an established body of literature, which utilizes the DEA technique to measure waste in contract management deriving from cost overruns and time delays (Guccio et al., 2012; Finocchiaro Castro et al. 2014, 2018; Cavalieri et al., 2017).==== However, corruption in public procurement constitutes only one of the sources of waste in public work contract execution. Consequently, we draw on a second strand of literature concerned with the distinction between active and passive waste (Bandiera et al., 2009), which frames corrupt transactions as one of the two determinants of waste along with mere inefficiency. While these two determinants of waste are sometimes intertwined, and both contribute to undermining the efficient allocation of public resources, separating them would have valuable policy implications. Most notably, dealing with corruption or inefficiency requires implementing wholly different strategies in terms of education, training, sanctions, and incentives. The third strand of literature takes recourse to accounting and finance studies. Typically, in accounting or finance, estimating the discretionary components of accruals or book-tax differences, the unexplained parts of audit fees, the exceeding parts of compensation, and abnormal stock returns can all be of critical relevance, especially when testing hypotheses about their determinants. These abnormal, discretionary, or unexplained components are extracted as residuals from an ordinary least squares regression, in which the predicted values represent the normal, nondiscretionary, or expected components. In a subsequent step, the residuals are ordinarily used as dependent variables in a further regression that is designed to examine their determinants.====Our methodology aids the development of an indicator that overcomes some of the limitations of current measures. From reviewing the literature, we have identified three different approaches that have produced some measurements of corruption in public procurement. These focused on (====) the adoption of red flags, (====) the discrepancy between actual and estimated costs, and (====) crime statistics on corruption and other related crimes in public procurement.====The red flags pertain to specific features of procurement that provide warnings about the risk of corrupt activities.==== However, single red flags only capture some of the manifold traces that corruption leaves in its wake across all the stages of public procurement. To capture more information, Fazekas and Kocsis (2020) developed a composite indicator with equally weighted red flags (i.e., no call for tender published, restricted procedure, a very brief advertisement period, hard-to-quantify evaluation criteria, length of time spent deliberating over the submitted bids). Another approach consisted of identifying the missing expenditure with respect to the actual expenditure. In a randomized, controlled field experiment in Indonesia, Olken (2007, 2009) measured the discrepancy between official project costs and independent engineers’ estimates of costs for a set of public works. The missing expenditure was classified as unaccounted labor expenditures or materials. Similarly, Golden and Picci (2005) estimated the difference between the value of physically existing public infrastructure and the money allocated by the government to these public works in Italy. The higher expenditures could be attributed to both inefficiencies and corruption. Finally, through recourse to confidential data on employees of public authorities and either owners or top managers of winning bidding firms suspected of engaging in corruption-related crimes, Decarolis et al. (2020) designed a binary (0/1) indicator of corruption at the public contract level.====Each of these aforesaid approaches has its limitations. While the red flag approach is promising, it is weakened by the degree of subjectivity involved in both the choice and combination of red flags, requiring a rigorous robustness analysis. With respect to measures of discrepancy, they are not originally conceived as indicators at the procurement level and, as such, are incapable of distinguishing between active and passive waste, thereby potentially overestimating the extent of corruption. At the other end of the spectrum, the approach that uses crime statistics may underestimate the presence of corruption, cannot provide an intensity scale of the phenomenon and is conditioned by the penal context.====Our approach is distinct from both these efforts and other general measures of corruption in several respects. The red flags that capture economic patterns in the bidding process or atypical behaviors among suppliers and contracting authorities are combined in the DEA approach by using the output and input channels of the corruption process. Specifically, the approach provides a risk-based indicator that allows a score to be assigned to each contract. In contrast to other measures of corruption that are predominantly based on crime statistics, the CRI suffers neither from the problem of underreporting nor the potential bias deriving from different investigation efforts or conviction rates across a given country. Similarly, the CRI circumvents the subjectivity bias that is typical of perception measures. Finally, unlike other measures, we aimed to develop a flexible and replicable methodology that could be reproduced in a broad range of institutional contexts.====We caution the reader that the index produced by our procedure cannot be considered a standard and direct measure of corruption risk. Being a residual, the CRI may represent “a measure of our ignorance” – in the words of Abramovitz (1956) in reference to the unexplained component of growth – with no guarantee that it captures corruption exclusively. As discussed in the following section, the precision and performance of the CRI are highly dependent on the availability of data and the accurate identification in the second stage of all significant inefficiency-related factors.====The paper is organized as follows. The following section delineates the methodological approach that underpins the construction of the indicator. The subsequent section presents an application of the approach to Italian data: the first-stage non-parametric DEA procedure estimates the waste scores, the second-stage parametric analysis separates mere inefficiency from corruption. Finally, a set of validation tests corroborates the robustness of the indicator.

We exploit the dissolution of city governments for presumed mafia infiltration as an exogenous shock to the presence of organized crime in local politics. We implement a difference-in-differences methodology to test whether organized crime discourages qualified individuals to run for elections. Our results indicate that the active presence of organized crime does not prevent highly qualified candidates from running but does induce citizens to vote for less qualified ones. The identification of the channel through which organized crime influences local politics is important to better direct public intervention against mafia infiltration.","In recent years scholars have begun to investigate the link between criminal organizations and politics, finding evidence that mafia infiltration of the body politic lowers the quality of politicians (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2013, Baraldi et al., 2020, Daniele, 2019, Daniele and Geys, 2015). Thus, where criminal organizations are influential, low quality politicians are more likely to enact poor policies that prevent the flourishing of the economy (e.g., Pinotti, 2015, Fenizia and Saggio, 2021). This paper intends to explicate the mechanism underlying the impact of organized crime on politicians’ quality.====Political economic literature refers to two main channels through which organized crime can affect politics. First, the recorded negative effect of mafia activity on politicians’ quality may reflect a change in self-selection that discourages qualified men and women from entering politics. Or organized crime can influence voters’ behavior, redirecting their votes to less qualified candidates.====Our contribution is to determine which of these two channels is the more likely driver of the effect of organized crime on politicians’ quality. Our empirical analysis is based on the following logic. If organized crime induces self-selection of politicians, then we ==== find a deterioration in the quality of the people running for public office. If such a decrease in candidates’ quality ==== found, then we can most likely exclude self-selection and assess the influence of mafia activity on voters’ behavior.====The strand of literature supporting the self-selection hypothesis refers to the model in Dal Bó et al. (2006), where pressure groups aiming to reap public resources corrupt public officials through bribes and credible threats of punishment. Hence, when a pressure group is active, the costs of corruption (e.g. the risk of the politician being detected) and punishment (e.g. legal harassment and physical violence by a pressure group) decrease the official’s payoff. This makes a political career unattractive to highly qualified individuals whose opportunity wage in different job sectors is higher.==== In this setting, better law enforcement makes punishment more costly to the pressure group, which reacts by increasing bribes inducing self-selection of the well qualified.====Few empirical analyzes offer evidence for this hypothesis. Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) clearly shows that higher remuneration for politicians induces significantly higher education levels for both mayoral candidates and elected mayors in Italy. Further studies provide evidence of this remuneration effect in different countries (Ferraz and Finan, 2008, Kotakorpi and Poutvaara, 2011, Dal Bó et al., 2017). To the extent that organized crime can affect politicians’ expected payoffs, this evidence means that pressure groups may influence the quality of candidates. Accordingly, Alesina et al. (2019) interprets the evidence of a spike in violence against politicians in the pre-electoral period (i.e., a year before the elections) as a signal from organized crime scaring off candidates of the opposing party. Moreover, Daniele (2019) finds that murders of local politicians by mafia-type organization in southern Italy lowers the quality (as measured by years of education) of elected politicians, possibly because violence deters qualified individuals from running. Similarly, the recent literature on organized crime in developing countries (e.g., Melnikov et al., 2020, Sviatschi, 2020, Sviatschi, 2019, Blattman et al., 2019, Daniele et al., 2020), documents how in El Salvador, Mexico and Colombia an increase in the number of criminal gangs and of related violence in the territories under their control, determines, among other things, a dramatic decrease in the level of human capital as well as an increase in out-migration of the population exposed to criminal violence. Arguably, this can be deemed as a mechanism explaining the (self-)selection of low-quality politicians in municipalities also in developing countries.====This empirical evidence, however, does not rule out the possibility of pressure groups using the “bribe and threat” strategy to influence the electorate. As the seminal contribution of Gambetta (1996) points out, mafias tightly control the territory through credible threats of violence, inducing widespread fear of reprisal. This means that mafias can control citizens’ votes and sell them to the preferred party in exchange for public funds and lenient legislation. Building on this intuition, Acemoglu et al. (2013) provides and verifies a probabilistic model where paramilitary forces — a kind of pressure group — control votes in specific regions of Colombia and sell them to parties in line with their political preferences. In the same spirit, Buonanno et al. (2016) finds that the vote share of the Italian center-right party ==== significantly correlate with gauges of the presence of mafia in southern municipalities. De Feo and De Luca (2017) extends the model of Acemoglu et al. (2013) to find that the old Christian Democratic party (====) captured more votes in the Sicilian municipalities where mafia were strongly active.==== Since several studies show that citizens respond positively to candidates’ competence (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2011, Butler and Powell, 2014, Kendall et al., 2015, Galasso and Nannicini, 2015), mafia control of a territory is likely to induce them to cast their preferences for less qualified ones.====We build a dataset on the quality of mayoral candidates and mayors in the southern Italian municipalities of Calabria, Campania, Puglia and Sicily, where organized crime has been traditionally concentrated. We measure politicians’ quality with the years of completed education, a widely recognized proxy for human capital and a driver of good economic performance.==== Indeed, Fenizia and Saggio (2021) argue that the election of more educated politicians is the most likely driver of the persistent 10% increase in the revenues generated by local taxes and of the 7% increase in the public expenditure for roads, infrastructure, sanitation, and local administration observed in southern Italian municipalities.====We exploit the enforcement of Law 164/1991, which empowers the national government to decree the dissolution of a city council where there is evidence of linkage local government members with criminal organizations. Thus, since local government dissolution stems from a national-level investigation (kept secret until its implementation), it can be deemed as good as exogenous to local politics. This allows us to identify a group of municipalities that experienced the dissolution of the local government due to mafia infiltration (the treatment group) and a group of never dissolved municipalities (the control group). Since city council dissolutions took place at different points in time, our identification strategy is based on a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) design and we employ, in our baseline analysis, a two-way fixed effect (====) panel estimator.====Our main contribution is the falsification of the self-selection hypothesis as the mechanism behind the negative effect of organized crime infiltration on politicians’ quality. Indeed, we document that the mean education level of the pool of mayoral candidates does not differ significantly between treated and control municipalities before or after the dissolution of the city council. However, the education level can be endogenous since it could be affected by the number of candidates, which in turn might be affected by organized crime infiltration. To address this issue, we also use the years of education of the most and least educated candidate as dependent variables and our main result is confirmed. Furthermore, we show that organized crime infiltration does not affect the share of university graduate candidates.====The ==== panel estimator offers unbiased estimations under the assumption that, controlling for fixed effects and control variables, the trends in the outcomes would be the same in untreated and treated municipalities in the absence of the treatment. Firstly, we check this assumption by using an event study approach to visualize graphically the dynamic of the treatment effect on the outcome variables over the entire time span under analysis. Next, we formally test it, checking the robustness of our estimates to the inclusion of a broader set of trends (Button, 2019) and by implementing a propensity score matching analysis (Daniele and Geys, 2015, Fenizia and Saggio, 2021). We also test the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption — i.e., treated units do not affect outcomes of control units — by excluding from the control group municipalities neighboring the treated ones.====Recent studies have underlined that the ==== estimator is not robust to potential treatment effect heterogeneity due to negative weights attached to the average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs). Thus, in order to take into account this possible source of heterogeneity, we employ the novel empirical methodology proposed by De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020).==== The results obtained with the standard methodology of the ==== are confirmed when we use their novel estimator. Overall, our evidence robustly documents that organized crime infiltration does not discourage qualified individuals from running for election.====Having found no evidence for the self-selection hypothesis, we try to assess the influence of mafia activity on voters’ behavior using data on both mayoral candidates and elected mayors. Initially, we use as dependent variable the distance between the education level of the elected mayor and the average education level of the pool of candidates. We find that when organized crime is not active, voters choose a candidate with an education above the average of the pool, whereas when organized crime infiltrates local government, they vote for one whose education is closer to the mean of the pool of candidates. Specifically, the active presence of organized crime decreases the difference in education level between mayors and candidates by about 1.4 years. Also, we show that the influence of criminal organizations on voters increases (decreases) the educational difference between the most highly (the least) educated candidate and the elected mayor by about 1.4 (1.6) years, and it lowers the probability of electing a mayor with a university degree by about 41 percentage points. Overall, with due caution as to the validity elsewhere of our results on southern Italian municipalities, our evidence indicates that the active presence of organized crime does not discourage qualified individuals from running for election, but it does induce citizens to vote for less qualified candidates.====Finally, to shed some light on the mechanisms behind the reported measures of the influence of organized crime on voters’ behavior, we offer suggestive evidence consistent with the hypothesis of Gambetta (1996) that mafias affect electoral outcomes through coercive acts or vote buying. The identification of the channel through which organized crime influences local politics is important to better target anti-mafia policies.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

So far, under complete information, this has been shown assuming that the contest is based on a specific contest success function (CSF) and the designer resorts to two specific instruments of favoritism. This paper generalizes these results by establishing them for any ==== CSF augmented with a differential taxation mechanism allowing the equilibrium conditions to exist. In contrast to the conclusions derived thus far, in our general setting, the maximal revenue can be achieved not only at corner but also at interior equilibria with full participation. Our study brings to a closure the longstanding effort to clarify the maximum attainable revenue and how it can be achieved within a very general framework. It explains, in particular, that neither an all-pay-auction (APA) nor any other particular CSF is superior for generating revenue based on favoritism and that a tradeoff between revenue and the extent of participation is avoidable.","An important old question in the economic literature asks how the designer of a competition can maximize his or her revenue. Under complete information about the contestants’ prize valuations, the simplest solution is to apply the logic of ""divide-and-conquer"". To this end, the designer may use a two-element policy that involves exclusion (dividing a group of agents into those excluded from and those remaining in the game) and a mechanism that extracts the consumer surplus from those who take part in the game. Such a policy is not easily justifiable in view of the prevailing moral, democratic, and economic norms regarding the public interest.====Therefore, many researchers of contests have tried to propose alternative mechanisms, again based on the presumption that the contestants' prize valuations are known, that would maximize the contest designer's revenue.==== Optimal contest design focuses on three types of discrimination/favoritism that may be used to increase revenue. The first is ====, which affects the contestants' probability of winning by assigning higher or lower weight to their efforts (Epstein et al., 2011, Lien, 1990; Clark and Riis 1998; Franke et al. 2013, 2014, 2018; Fu and Wu 2020). In the second type, ====, contestants' incentives are affected by a direct change in their rewards in the event that they win the contested prize, thereby widening or narrowing the gap between their anticipated prize valuations. Such a policy is usually based on a subsidy or tax that is applied only in the case of winning. This form of discrimination, introduced by Mealem and Nitzan (2012, 2014), focuses on its application in a lottery contest, jointly with structural discrimination, and in APA, disregarding the possibility of structural discrimination. An important disadvantage of direct discrimination is that it cannot ensure a positive surplus budget; it can only guarantee that the ==== necessary for (positive and negative) changes in the prize valuations is zero, so that only the expected net budget (surplus) is positive.==== In the third type of discrimination, a ==== exists: one contestant enjoys an advantageous position in the sense that her or his rivals must first surmount the (additive) head start in order to be eligible to compete on an equal footing.==== For recent surveys of discrimination/favoritism in contests, see Chowdhury et al. (2020), Fu and Wu (2019), (2020) and Mealem and Nitzan (2016).====Focusing on revenue maximization, it has been shown that dual discrimination is the most effective way to attain this objective, provided it is based on the appropriate structural bias and head starts in an all-pay auction contest (Franke et al., 2018) or on the appropriate structural bias and direct discrimination in a simple lottery contest (Mealem et al. (2021) .==== In both cases, the mechanism applied by the designer is extortionate as only one player makes an active attempt to win the prize and his or her surplus is extracted by the use of an implicit “take it or leave it” offer.====So far, the problem of revenue maximization under complete information in contests has been analyzed and resolved in specific settings that assume specific CSFs and use two of the instruments of favoritism presented above. Our paper consists of two parts. The first part contains a comprehensive illustration of our main results. The objective of the illustration is to facilitate understanding of the general results obtained under differential taxation mechanisms. The illustration is based on the assumption that the CSF is a simple Tullock lottery. We begin with the two-player case and then extend the illustration to the n-player case. In this illustration, the optimal mechanism takes the form of differential expenditure floors and subsidy/tax rates, assuming that the efforts are verifiable in order to allow the expenditure floor and taxation system to be implemented.====The second part of the paper presents a general Proof, which is valid for any mechanism under complete or partial information, of the necessary requirements for revenue maximization and the necessary features of the mechanism the designer applies for any ==== contest (which meets the conditions for equilibrium, see Fu and Wu (2020)).==== To ensure an optimal corner equilibrium, the mechanism must be able to control the winning probabilities of the contestants such that the winning probability of the contestant with the highest prize valuation is 1, it is possible to tax almost all the prize he wins and it is possible to award the other contestants a very small amount. It can be argued that these requirements are trivial, but sometimes the triviality of the requirements does not obviate their presentation. The reason is that it may lead to the proposal of a new simple operative optimal mechanism. All the proposed mechanisms to maximize revenue are based on the proof that these requirements are necessary. This is true with respect to the complicated mechanism proposed in Frank et al. (2018) and the specific simple mechanism proposed in the first part of the paper (Section 2). Our main objective is to propose a simple new differential taxation mechanism that maximizes the designer's revenue for any ==== contest that has either a corner or an interior equilibrium. Our approach is based on preliminary identification of the designer's potential sources of revenue and the necessary characteristics of the mechanism that the designer seeks.====Our paper sheds light on the attempts to propose a mechanism that maximizes the designer's revenue, making three contributions: (i) It clarifies why the designer cannot secure the maximal potential resources of his or her revenue, viz., the highest valuation of the contested prize, ==== and must give up some positive amount ==== (ii) It shows that, in terms of allowing maximal revenue to be attained, all regular CSFs are equivalent. (iii) It establishes that two types of equilibria exist in any contest with equilibrium: a corner equilibrium, where only one player takes part in the contest, and an interior equilibrium, where all players participate in the contest and make positive efforts to win the contested prize. By (ii), no particular CSF is superior for generating revenue and the APA is no exception. By (iii), the option of resorting to an extortionate mechanism based on a “take it or leave it” offer to the contestant with the highest prize valuation always exists, regardless of the CSF. The more interesting news is that, again, regardless of the CSF, the designer can construct a mechanism that induces the equilibrium with the more desirable property of full participation. The possible existence of a viable contest in which all contestants voluntarily participate implies that, in equilibrium, a tradeoff between revenue and the extent of participation is not necessary, contrary to the conventional wisdom thus far. Obviously, it is still interesting to explore how a specific contest can be designed with more limited freedom of the contest designer, under an alternative set of instruments or under a constrained set of instruments, as is commonly done in the literature. Our focus, however, is on the almost maximal revenue that can be achieved under the common assumption of complete information and the uncommon assumption of a non-specific contest success function.",Optimal favoritism and maximal revenue: A generalized result,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001130,28 October 2021,2021,Research Article,108.0

Fiscal outcomes are certainly important but they may overlook the knowledge that policymakers had on the economic and financial environment at the time of their decisions. As a matter of fact, fiscal outcomes are potentially blurred by posterior data revisions that do not give a clear picture of the set of information at the disposal of policymakers. In contrast, policymakers’ decisions under the real-time set of information at their disposal give insight on the real-time priorities of policymakers and, for countries facing fiscal rules, on their compliance with these rules.====Building on earlier studies on real-time fiscal reaction functions (Cimadomo, 2016, Giuliodori and Beetsma, 2008 among others), we investigate whether fiscal policy reacts pro- or counter-cyclically to changes in output gap and public debt-to-GDP ratios by extending the analysis to the years following the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. Hence, this paper updates earlier studies on real-time data in a more unstable macroeconomic environment, in which fiscal policy’s macroeconomic stabilization role has been crucial. In particular, the timing of fiscal consolidation during bad times has been much debated during the European crisis of 2011–2012. To our knowledge, we add to the literature in testing for the hypothesis that fiscal consolidation (i.e. the specific response of cyclically-adjusted primary balance to the level of public debt) is procyclical. We also study whether EMU membership introduces any modification in the results. In this respect, we complement Reuter (2019) who studies the real-time compliance of euro area countries to the fiscal rules. In contrast but still in real-time, we question whether EMU countries do actually follow the debt sustainability objective of the rules.====Main results are threefold. First, we confirm that a symmetric fiscal policy rule is unlikely to be an accurate representation of real-time fiscal policy. In particular, the response of fiscal policy to the output gap is weakly significant, if not absent. Second, we also confirm that the impact of the output gap on the reaction function is non-linear; however, we add a new though expected result. Actually, testing for asymmetric reaction functions delivers contrasting results along the business cycle but it is noteworthy that it contradicts the conclusions of former papers. Fiscal policy ==== appears to be procyclical in downturns and a-cyclical in upturns. Furthermore, procyclicality in downturns appears to come mainly from EMU countries. Sturm and Bohn (2020) find a different though related result. With a panel of 74 advanced and developing countries, they show procyclical fiscal behaviours when expected downturns occur during an election year. In contrast, we use real-time, not ex post, fiscal data; we focus on cyclically-adjusted primary balances, not primary balances; and we find no significant impact in ==== of election years on fiscal decisions. Third, we find that fiscal policy is sustainable in the OECD, as it satisfies a standard debt-stabilization criterion (Bohn, 1998, Daniel and Shiamptanis, 2013). Yet, our results do not support the claim that fiscal consolidation was specifically procyclical: we do not find a larger response of cyclically-adjusted primary balance to public debt in downturns, which looks at odds with the criticisms against the application of fiscal rules, at least in European countries. Quite interestingly, this latter result works for EMU countries as well.====Our results are not sensitive to alternative estimator and specifications. The introduction of an Instrumental Variable General Method of Moments estimator to check for a possible endogeneity bias in the baseline estimations does not modify the results. We also check whether evidence of procyclical ==== discretionary fiscal policy is robust to an alternative measure of economy’s position in the business cycle. Indeed, output gap forecasts tend to be negative on average, which mechanically reduces observations of positive output gaps and may bias our estimates of the asymmetric fiscal reaction specification. In addition, discrete dummy variable are likely to be too discrete and too simple to capture an economy’s position in the business cycle. Hence, we use a simple calibrated logistic transition function that addresses these two caveats. Our transition function takes into account the negative average of output gap forecasts, using a country-specific normalized output gap forecast measure, and allows for smooth-transition between upturns and downturns. Using this alternative measure of business cycle stance confirms the baseline findings. We also investigate whether our result of a procyclical bias in fiscal policy is driven by the years following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC): we find that fiscal policy is strongly procyclical during these years, while most probably a-cyclical the rest of the time. Finally, results related to procyclicality of fiscal policy do not seem to be driven by a single country, as estimates are fairly stable and robust to country exclusion.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on real time fiscal reaction functions. Section 3 provides a description of the dataset. Section 4 presents the empirical methodology and the results. Section 5 proposes the robustness checks.

This one-way nature may induce the current generation to take advantage of resources without considering future generations, which we refer to as intergenerational sustainability dilemma (ISD). While deliberation is known to bring a change in individual opinions and to lead to a good decision in some intragenerational problems, little is known about how intragenerational deliberation affects individual opinions and collective decisions for intergenerational problems, such as ISD, in societies. An ISD game (ISDG) along with interviews and questionnaires are instituted in rural and urban societies of Nepal. In ISDG, a sequence of generations, each of which consists of three people, is organized, and each generation chooses either to maintain intergenerational sustainability (sustainable option) or to maximize his or her own generation’s payoff by irreversibly imposing a cost on future generations (unsustainable option) under an intragenerational deliberative process. Our results demonstrate that urban subjects have a wider variety of individual initial opinions and support an unsustainable option more often than rural subjects do. It also shows that individual opinions change through deliberation when subjects in a generation do not share the same initial opinion, reflecting that urban subjects change opinions as compared to rural subjects. Such opinion changes are identified not to work in the direction to enhance intergenerational sustainability for urban generations. Overall, our experiments suggest that intragenerational deliberation does not necessarily influence individual opinions for resolving ISD.","While the current generation affects future generations, the opposite is not true. This one-way nature may induce the current generation to decide to take advantage of resources without considering future generations, which we call the “intergenerational sustainability dilemma (ISD)” (Kamijo et al., 2017, Shahrier et al., 2017, Shahen et al., 2021). The literature defines sustainability as a minimum condition to be satisfied, that is, maintaining the welfare of successive generations (Dasgupta and Mitra, 1983, Howarth and Norgaard, 1993, Weitzman, 1997), and there are no mechanisms for every generation to be able to ensure and enjoy equal welfare (Dao et al., 2017). Financing and/or resource conservation are tools for the current generation to make an intergenerational transfer for intertemporal efficiency and sustainability. Unfortunately, future generations cannot have binding contracts with the current generation (e.g., transferring future resources into the present time to compensate the generation for conserving resources now).==== In such a situation, the current generation tends to excessively use financing schemes and/or make resource extractions for their benefit, leading to many ISD problems, such as climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss and long-term public debts. Since these problems are considered to occur across multiple different generations in the long run, this research seeks to address ISD problems by conducting field experiments under nonoverlapping generations.====Over the last few decades, several studies have used an experimental approach to examine people’s preferences and behaviors regarding intergenerational sustainability. [47] show that people become less motivated to exploit resources due to the existence of an “intergenerational link” in an intergenerational common pool experiment. [63] demonstrate that democracy or majority voting tends to promote the sustainability of intergenerational goods when a majority of people are prosocial. [113] analyze the level of difficulties in maintaining dynamic externality by implementing laboratory experiments of a dynamic game under two types of settings: (i) infinitely living decision makers and (ii) multiple generations. They find that strategic uncertainty makes it difficult to retain dynamic externalities. [75] design and implement a laboratory experiment of ISD game (ISDG) with a subject pool of university students by introducing the treatment of an “imaginary future generation (IFG)” as a negotiator for future generations, claiming that the negotiators improve intergenerational sustainability. [112] conduct ISDG field experiments with a subject pool of general people and analyze generation decisions in rural and urban societies of Bangladesh. They find that rural people are more prosocial and choose a sustainable option more often than urban people.==== [48] find that subjects are prudent and fair for an intrageneration allocation but show few concerns for intergenerational fairness in a laboratory experiment. They also claim that the current generation maximizes its payoff by shifting the burden of debts to future generations.====Many political scientists and psychologists study deliberation to understand the processes of collective decision making (Rawls, 1993, Chambers, 2003, Niemeyer and Dryzek, 2007).==== Several experimental studies, such as [114], have analyzed the role of deliberation in relation to equity and sociodemographic backgrounds, concluding that deliberation can bring about fair and equitable outcomes for intragroup members. [57] also conduct deliberation experiments under different institutions of majority and unanimity, reporting that deliberation promotes fair outcomes across institutions. [3] use field data from south India, suggesting that, even in heterogeneous societies, deliberation can induce long-term agreements about priorities of providing several public goods. [83] analyze deliberative data, showing that deliberation can help resolve salient issues. Overall, theories and empirical studies suggest that deliberation is effective in many collective decision environments.====Group behaviors have been intensively studied to understand how communication influences people’s behaviors through social interactions (Dawes et al., 1977, Isaac and Walker, 1988, Bornstein and Ben-Yossef, 1994, Kugler et al., 2012, Charness and Sutter, 2012, Cooper and Kuhn, 2016, Meub and Proeger, 2017, Crawford and Harris, 2018, Carbone et al., 2019, Vollstadt and Bohm, 2019). Intragroup communication makes groups competitive and self-regarding in a socioeconomic context, such as market competition, tournament and bargaining (Kugler et al., 2012, Charness and Sutter, 2012). [17] use a dictator game allowing for intragroup face-to-face communication in a noncompetitive and nonstrategic environment and claim that such communication induces intergroup fairness. On the other hand, [84] conduct a dictator game to re-examine group behaviors by letting subjects make not only individual but also group decisions using electronic chats as a medium of communication. They find that groups are more selfish than individuals, and that the most selfish group member has the strongest influence on group decisions.==== Overall, how intragroup (intrageneration) face-to-face communication (deliberation) affects intergroup (intergenerational) fairness in economic decision-making is an important area to be explored and analyzed.====Whether or not people care about others and future generations depends on the degrees of their prosociality, trust and fairness, which are affected by cultures, the economic environment and institutions in societies (Ockenfels and Weimann, 1999, Henrich et al., 2005, Wilson et al., 2009, Henrich et al., 2010, Brosig-Koch et al., 2011, Leibbrandt et al., 2013, Shahrier et al., 2017). It is argued that as societies become capitalistic and competitive without any intergenerational linkage, the current generation tends to become proself, compromising sustainability (Fisher et al., 2004, Shahrier et al., 2016, Shahrier et al., 2017, Timilsina et al., 2017). Social devices, such as communication, discussion and deliberation in collective decision making have been demonstrated to resolve some class of intragenerational problems, such as the prisoner’s dilemma, public goods provision and common pool resource utilization (Cardenas, 2000, Cardenas et al., 2000, Cason et al., 2012, Ghate et al., 2013). However, little is known about how intragenerational deliberation affects people in different types of societies to discuss and decide on intergenerational problems, such as ISD.====This research examines how and whether intragenerational deliberation changes individual opinions and hence resolves ISD, considering two types of societies with different cultures, economic environments and institutions, i.e., rural and urban areas. To this end, we design and institute a series of new procedures for ISD game (ISDG) field experiments. In ISDG, we organize a sequence of generations (one generation of three subjects) and each generation in the sequence is asked to decide between maintaining intergenerational sustainability (sustainable option) and maximizing its own generation’s payoff by irreversibly imposing a cost on future generations (unsustainable option) through deliberation. As a new element of our ISDG experimental design, we conduct individual interviews after subjects finish making their generation’s decision. In the interviews, we elicit each subject’s “individual initial opinion” about which option she supported before and “individual final opinion” after her generation’s deliberation as a personal opinion. This interview process enables us to clarify whether each subject changes her opinions over the course of deliberation. To better characterize the role of deliberation on ISD in different types of societies, we conduct experiments and questionnaire surveys for subjects’ sociodemographic and psychological information in the rural and urban societies of Nepal.==== With this approach, we specifically answer the following open questions: (i) Does intragenerational deliberation change the individual opinions of rural and urban subjects for an intergenerational problem, such as ISD, in a different manner? (ii) Do such changes in individual opinions induce generations to resolve ISD in rural and urban societies?",Intragenerational deliberation and intergenerational sustainability dilemma,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001099,23 October 2021,2021,Research Article,110.0

We test whether people are less likely to purchase equality with their own money versus transferring someone else’s money to a low-income group member which reduces ,"In modern democracies, individuals often face choices that involve redistributing income. These choices may involve giving up some of their own income or redistributing income among other people. For example, a policy that redistributes from the upper-income population to lower-income earners might not affect the middle class, and might decrease total income in a society (Browning and Johnson, 1984, Lee, 1987). We implement an experiment to determine whether such policies are consistent with individuals’ preferences.====Previous research indicates a significant proportion of people value equality, and are willing to forego their own income, and/or the income of others, in order to increase equality. We designed a discrete-choice experiment that analyzes distributional preferences in groups of three. Our experiment allows us to compare individuals’ willingness to purchase equality with their own income and their willingness to purchase equality with the income of others. We vary the price of purchasing equality to analyze the strength of preferences for equality and assess whether subjects respond to prices when redistributing money among others.====Our experiment is designed so that subjects face three distinct types of trade-offs: between their own income and equality; between their own income and efficiency; and between equality and efficiency. We measure equality using the absolute mean difference of the three payments associated with the outcome of a ballot. We measure efficiency using the sum of the three payments. The price of increasing equality in terms of foregone income, the price of increasing efficiency in terms of foregone income, and the price of increasing equality in terms of foregone efficiency are varied from ballot to ballot. This allows us to measure the strength of preferences for equality and efficiency.====In our experiment, subjects make choices in a majority-rule voting environment and as dictators because the expression of preferences for equality may depend on the institutional environment in which choices are made (Bolton and Ockenfels, 2006). Preferences for equality are often expressed at the ballot box in democratic societies but many economic experiments apply dictatorial rules. Our experiment is the first to compare preferences for equality under these two choice rules, to our knowledge. We do not find significant differences in choices between the dictating and voting environments, indicating that people tend to vote for the option they would have selected as a dictator.====Our results indicate that the primary factors affecting the probability of buying equality are the price of equality and who has to pay for it. In our experiment, income can be redistributed to increase equality in two ways. For some choices, the decision maker gives up their own money and sometimes their own income is held constant. Subjects are less likely to redistribute money to increase group equality when they pay with their own income. The probability of purchasing equality is 20% larger when equality comes at the expense of others instead of from the income of the decision maker. We find, like Andreoni and Miller (2002), that prices matter when people are choosing to send money to others. Some subjects want to reduce inequality, but equality is not a good they will buy at all prices. This is true when subjects are spending their own money, and it is also true when equality comes at the expense of group efficiency. Individuals are sensitive to costs of redistributive policies, even when they do not have skin in the game. We also find, like Engelmann and Strobel (2004), that subjects will forego efficiency to increase equality when their own income is held constant. Subjects are less likely to purchase equality when they have to pay for it out of their own income, even if the price is low.====Our results indicate that redistributive policies that come at the cost of some economic efficiency are consistent with many individual’s preferences, especially to the extent that individual’s own income is shielded from such policies. A very high cost per unit of equality in terms of efficiency will erode this political support.",Other people’s money: Preferences for equality in groups,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021001051,30 September 2021,2021,Research Article,111.0

To this end, we combine different sources of postelection survey data covering more than 300 Swiss referenda and four decades. Young voters are more likely to support initiatives that favor their own generation in the present, e.g., a lower retirement age or increased unemployment benefits, or in favor of all generations in the future, e.g., environment protection. To estimate the causal effect of aging on political attitudes, we propose a novel unconstrained panel rank regression approach that separately identifies age and cohort effects. The aging effect on political attitudes is robust for controlling for arbitrary cohort effects and appears to be driven by expected utility maximization and not by habituation-induced status-quo bias.","Popular voices argue that the generation gap in voting today is wider than it has been at any time since the 1960s (The New York Times, 2012). Some economists attribute the rise of a “New Generation Gap” to intergenerational injustice (Stiglitz, 2016). Against this background, some political scientists predict that population aging will lead to a democratic crisis owing to an increasing resistance to plan for the future (Runciman, 2018). From a normative economics perspective, there is a problem if future generations belong in the social welfare function, but their interests are not represented by a non-altruistic, aging median voter with limited exposure to the long-run benefits of “reform projects” (Messner and Polborn, 2004). Whether or not the median voter is non-altruistic and there is a causal effect of aging on attitudes toward reform projects, however, is a non-trivial empirical question as any generation gap may originate from age ==== cohort effects (Ryder, 1965).====We provide the first systematic documentation of a generation gap in direct democracy across a broad range of topics, and the first econometric analysis of its origins. To this end, we use a large micro data set covering postelection surveys for 305 federal referenda held between 1981 and 2017 in Switzerland. The long time period that is covered by this unique data set allows us to estimate the causal effect of aging on political attitudes conditional on arbitrary cohort effects, a challenge that the related literature has long faced. One of our central findings is that as voters of the same cohort age, they become less politically liberal and less supportive of policies that seek to protect the environment, support young workers and families, or redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. This within-cohort aging effect empirically substantiates the concern expressed in social science and political economy literature that population aging may lead to a “gerontocracy” in which adopting forward looking economic, social, or environmental policies will prove difficult (Galasso and Profeta, 2002; Holtz-Eakin et al., 2004; Montén and Thum, 2010; Preston, 1984; Sørensen, 2013; Tepe and Vanhuysse, 2009).====In a theoretical piece, Messner and Polborn (2004) argue that many “reform projects” share similarities with investments in that they require some initial expenditure and pay dividends over a long period. Rational voters of all ages will maximize their individual expected utility conditional on their stage in the lifecycle accordingly; i.e., they weigh the expected costs against the discounted benefits expected over their remaining lifetime. As voters age, the period over which they expect to receive the benefits decreases so that they become less inclined to support projects with long-run returns. Therefore, a generation gap may imply that collective decisions are likely to deviate from decisions that would maximize the net present value (NPV) for subsequent generations. Moreover, in an aging society, projects with long-run returns and short-run costs will have declining chances of winning majorities.====However, there are competing explanations for a generation gap. From a theoretical perspective, a status-quo bias is a frequently documented feature of political, economic, and social behavior (Ciccone, 2004; Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991; Hessami and Resnjanskij, 2019; Kahneman et al., 1991; Meier et al., 2019). Theoretically, older voters could prefer the status quo because they have experienced it over a longer period. As voters age, they could become more averse to reform projects simply due to habituation (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). This hypothesis is consistent with the empirical observation that individuals become more risk-averse as they age (Dohmen et al., 2017). While population aging would still affect a society's ability to respond to changing circumstances, a status-quo bias would not necessarily affect policies that benefited recent or future generations more than older generations. From an empirical perspective, a generation gap that is observed at any given point in time may equally be attributed to cohort effects because differences in age directly map to differences in birth years. Individuals with similar birth years, often referred to as birth cohorts or social generations, live through their “impressionable years” in similar social and political environments. Consequently, values, attitudes and orientations tend to be similar within cohorts and different across cohorts (Krosnick et al., 1989; Mannheim, 1952). A generation gap that originates from cohort effects is unlikely to interact with population aging because today's young will maintain their political attitudes and orientations as they age. If cohort effects follow a random walk, the generation gap could even shrink or reverse, irrespective of whether the population ages.====To document the generation gap and analyze its origins, we collect and process comprehensive micro data from Swiss post-election surveys. We use the individual yes vs. no voting decisions recorded in the data and a referendum-specific mapping that we overlaid on the official documentation to encode two binary outcome variables: status-quo orientation and political attitude. With the status-quo orientation, we distinguish between a voting decision that supports the legal status quo and a vote for a change in legislation. To encode the political attitude, we use 24 officially defined topical themes to categorize the 305 referenda into four policy areas: regulatory, environmental, generational, and public finance. Consistent with conventional definitions in the US political science literature, we define votes as left-wing if they correspond to positions that can be considered politically liberal (e.g., in favor of international integration), pro-environmental protection (e.g., in favor of climate change mitigation measures), in the interest of younger generations (e.g., supporting families with dependent children), or pro-progressive redistribution (e.g., favoring state revenues via income tax over user fees) (Budge et al., 2001; Neumayer, 2004; OECD, 2009).====With this data set at hand, we first document the existence of a generation gap in direct democracy across a broad variety of outcomes. Younger voters are more likely to vote for change and support reform projects which can be associated with the political left. Younger voters attach a higher priority to protecting the environment and are more supportive of policies that benefit the young. Voters in their 30s and 40s, more than those in their 20s or at later stages of the lifecycle, tend to support policies that have progressive redistribution consequences.====Next, we proceed to separating age and cohort effects by tracking how the attitude of voters belonging to the same cohort towards similar reform project changes over time. In doing so, we face the problem that an individual's age is a linear combination of its birth year and the year in which it is observed. It is thus impossible to identify age, period, and cohort (APC) effects without constraints on the functional form, a problem that is known as the APC conundrum (Fienberg and Mason, 1985). A novelty of our study is that we estimate an unconstrained rank model to distinguish between age and cohort effects in a flexible manner. We remove period effects by computing the rank a cohort occupies in the distribution of attitudes within a period. Conditional on this transformation, we can separately identify age and cohort effects on attitude ranks non-parametrically and without imposing any constraints on functional form. The estimated age parameter in this rank regression approach has convenient bounds of positive and negative unity: If attitudes strictly and monotonically changed in age, all cohorts would move along the rank distribution by one step each year they aged as a new cohort entered the data at the top or the bottom of the distribution.====As a central quantitative result, we find that the political attitude rank increases by, on average, 0.62 each year a voter ages (1.00 is the theoretical upper bound), on a scale that ranks political attitudes from left-wing to right-wing. Political attitudes change strongly around the retirement age, where estimated aging effects are near the theoretical upper bound. This pattern is fairly generally and shows up consistently in distinct categories of referenda that relate to, e.g., political ideology, the environment, or intergenerational transfers. The age effects are not driven by turnout (we find a similar age effect on attitudes reported by non-voters), altruism (we consider voters without children), and fuzzy measurement of political attitudes (we exploit political party recommendations and self-reported political attitudes). The estimated within-cohort aging effects are quantitatively relevant as they imply that five referenda since 2004 would have had a different outcome, had the population distribution remained at 1981 levels.====Cohort effects are also a prominent feature of the data. After controlling for arbitrary age effects, we find that baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) are more inclined to support environmental protection, policies that benefit the young, and progressive redistribution than other generations. Recent generations (born since 1965), in terms of political preferences, are more similar to prebaby-boomers (born up to 1945). The age-adjusted difference in political attitudes between cohorts born from 1935 to 1939 (more right-wing) and baby boomers born from 1955 to 1959 (more left-wing) is equivalent to the estimated effect of an individual aging by 32 years.====Turning to a potential status-quo bias, we generally find much smaller effects of aging on status-quo orientation than on political attitudes. Significant within-cohort effects of age on political attitudes persist if we control for status-quo orientation. Thus, over their voting life, cohorts shift from the political left to the political right in a manner that is not determined by an increasing tendency to favor the status quo. Overall, with regard to rationalizing the generation gap, there is more support for the utility-maximization than the habituation hypothesis.====Our study connects to several strands in the economics literature. One strand concerns how age shapes socio-economic and political attitudes and behaviors (Chetty et al., 2014; Costa and Kahn, 2011; Ermisch and Francesconi, 2000; Fisher and Gervais, 2011; Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2013; Kong et al., 2018), particularly in the context of population aging and the resulting intergenerational conflicts (Baltrunaite et al., 2015; Galasso and Profeta, 2004; Profeta, 2002; Rattsø and Sørensen, 2010; Tepe and Vanhuysse, 2010). Specifically, we add to a literature summarized by Ahlfeldt et al. (2019) that has considered age as an explanatory factor in cross-sectional referendum analyses and a literature that seeks to separate age and cohort effects on political outcomes such as attitudes to public spending (Fullerton and Dixon, 2010; Sørensen, 2013), political parties (Tilley and Evans, 2014), and European integration (Eichengreen et al., 2018).====We also relate to a political economy literature on the nature of democratic decision-making (Castanheira et al., 2006; Deacon and Shapiro, 1975; Feld, 2006; Hodler et al., 2015; Mueller and Stratmann, 2003; Osborne and Turner, 2010) and specifically how interest groups seek to influence political outcomes (Ahlfeldt et al., 2017; Feinerman et al., 2004; Giger and Klüver, 2016). In analyzing the determinants of age-related opposition to reform projects, we connect to studies that distinguish between utility maximization and other determinants of socio-political behavior that lead to status-quo bias (Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991; Hessami and Resnjanskij, 2019; Kahneman et al., 1991; Meier et al., 2019; Stutzer et al., 2019). Our analysis is also connected to economic research on various types of publicly provided goods on which voters often decide directly, such as education (Bearse et al., 2013; Cattaneo and Wolter, 2009; Plutzer and Berkman, 2005), infrastructure and public transportation (Ahlfeldt and Maennig, 2015; Meya et al., 2020), and the protection of health and the environment (Bornstein and Thalmann, 2008; Pampel and Hunter, 2012; Thalmann, 2004). Relevant to the wider social sciences literature, our unconstrained rank models used to separately identify age and cohort effects are a methodological contribution to a broad literature concerned with the analysis of APC effects (Fu, 2016; Giuliano and Spilimbergo, 2013; Luo and Hodges, 2015; Sørensen, 2013).====Section 2 introduces our empirical strategy against the background of the challenges to the identification of APC effects. In Section 3, we discuss the Swiss context and our data. We document the existence of a generation gap in referenda on a wide range of subjects in Section 4 before we separate age and cohort effects in Section 5.

This paper examines how an information shock about the acceptance of xenophobic positions spurs an increase in far-right protests in more liberal areas in Germany. Using staggered state elections between 2014 and 2017 as a quasi-natural experiment and leveraging novel data, I show that far-right protests are unleashed in more liberal areas which were “shocked” by the surprising state-level results of the newly emerging right-wing populist AfD party (“Alternative für Deutschland”). The effect is sizeable, but depends on surprise. When success of the populist party is severely underestimated, a municipality with a populist vote share 10 percentage points below state average faces a roughly 30 percent increase of the mean likelihood of an additional far-right protest. The effect materializes only after the rightward shift of the AfD and vanishes when polling institutions correctly estimate the populist party’s success.","Recent work in economics has found that beliefs and information play a crucial role for individual decision-making. Building on early publications by Elster (1989) and Akerlof (1980), the notion of social norms as important drivers of individual behaviour has been developed further. Social norms derive from beliefs about other people’s attitudes. Thus, social norms can change when new information about others becomes available, for example after elections. As a consequence, information shocks can have impacts on various dimensions. This paper examines how electoral information shocks about the success of a xenophobic populist party can propagate far-right extremist political activity.====Beliefs about other people’s attitudes can be pivotal for political protests to take place, or not to take place at all (Leon-Ablan et al., 2020, Cantoni et al., 2019). Information shocks which lead to updates of such beliefs could impede or induce protest behaviour, for example by overcoming pluralistic ignorance (Kuran, 1991, Enikolopov et al., 2019, González, 2020, Manacorda and Tesei, 2020). In an experiment, Bursztyn et al. (2020a) show that after a surprising populist electoral success, xenophobic individuals act more openly upon their beliefs and attitudes. Some studies have also documented this propagation effect in non-experimental settings (Schilter, 2018, Müller and Schwarz, 2018, Müller and Schwarz, 2020, Kuipers et al., 2019). This paper contributes to and extends this young literature in three respects. First, I use novel data on far-right extremist political activity (far-right protests). Second, I document propagation effects in the specific setting of Germany. Finally, I provide a rich picture of the notion of surprise underlying the propagation phenomenon.====I find that populist electoral success leads to more far-right protests when the success is surprising. My interpretation is that if populists win unexpectedly, the social stigma cost associated with far-right protests decreases, and especially so in areas where stigma was high before elections. In this paper, I offer a theoretical conceptualization of the propagation phenomenon and employ several strategies to capture surprise. First, on the aggregate level, populist success is surprising if polls severely underestimated the populist party’s vote share. Vote shares of Germany’s recently established right-wing populist AfD party (“Alternative für Deutschland”) were underestimated by more than 20 percent in six state elections between 2014 and 2016. Second, at the municipal level, I capture surprise by the difference between populist support in a federal state and populist support in a single municipality. The underlying assumption is that, in absence of electoral or reliable polling information, xenophobic individuals might have more precise knowledge about other people’s attitudes in their municipality than about other people’s attitudes in the broader society.====When success of the populist party is severely underestimated, a municipality with a populist vote share 10 percentage points below state average faces a roughly 30 percent increase of the mean likelihood of an additional far-right protest. The effect materializes only after the rightward shift of the AfD and vanishes when polling institutes correctly estimate the populist party’s success. Including municipality, month, and election date-relative month fixed effects allows me to rule out that the effect is driven by unobserved heterogeneity with respect to each of these dimensions. My data also allows me to proxy for time-varying presence of refugees at the municipal level and to exploit the staggered timing of state elections to come closer to a causal estimate of the propagation effect. A placebo regression before 2013, i.e. before the AfD was founded, suggests that I do not pick up general patterns of far-right protests around elections, but rather the effect of a populist party’s surprising success. Further robustness checks indicate that the effect is not driven by differential responses to the so-called refugee crisis or by clusters of far-right extremist networks.====The association between surprising populist success and far-right protests would be spurious if organizers of far-right protests strategically target municipalities with below-average populist vote shares. Moreover, were organizers more inclined to do so when polling institutes underestimated the populist vote share, strategic targeting would be able to explain my results. To rule out this alternative explanation, I test whether the additional far-right protests after surprising elections tend to be initiated by formal or non-formal organizers. The intuition is that strategic targeting would be used by formal organizers, if at all. I find that bottom-up far-right protests initiated by non-formal organizers respond heavily to the information shock, suggesting that the effect is not due to strategic targeting.====The results are consistent with a theoretical conceptualization in which latently xenophobic individuals choose to join far-right activities as long as the benefit of participation is not outweighed by perceived social stigma costs. In my framework, social stigma can be local or global. In absence of electoral or reliable polling information, latently xenophobic individuals face some uncertainty about global social stigma. However, they might use availability heuristics and estimate global social stigma with the observed local social stigma in their immediate surroundings (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973). Populist electoral success will thus lead to a greater reduction in social stigma cost for latently xenophobic individuals who live in more liberal places with higher social stigma attached to far-right activities.====A valid question concerning the propagation effect is about its reach. Can information shocks from elections in other states impact behaviour? Further, is the effect specific to far-right extremism, or does it also impact antisemitic incidents? I shed light on these questions by leveraging data on antisemitic incidents and attacks against refugees from the Amadeu Antonio Foundation.==== Although there have been some individual cases of antisemitism within the AfD, the party’s main political target does not seem to be the Jewish population, but rather Islam in general and asylum seekers in particular (Arzheimer and Berning, 2019). Consistent with this observation, I find no effect of surprisingly high populist vote shares on antisemitic incidents, but significant effects for attacks against refugees. I find no evidence that electoral information shocks translate into more far-right protests in other states. If anything, smaller but insignificant propagation effects can be found in neighbouring municipalities.====To substantiate my interpretation that the propagation effect works through reduced social stigma, I test whether patterns of heterogeneity associated with this interpretation hold. According to my interpretation, the information shock induces far-right protests because xenophobic individuals realize that more people share or at least tolerate their views than previously thought. If this is the case, one can expect that the following patterns of heterogeneity arise. First, the propagation effect should be more pronounced in areas where people care more about other people’s opinions. Second, the effect should come from latently xenophobic individuals who care to some degree about results of democratic elections. Third, the effect should be strong in areas where attitudes associated with the support for the AfD are weak. I obtain restricted-use access to the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and present evidence that these patterns of heterogeneity seem to hold.====One might argue that polling forecasts for the populist party could also be information shocks. If polls report higher support of the populist party, people might update beliefs about social acceptability and act accordingly. I compare the effect of polling releases with the effect of state election results. To this end, I collect polling data on the AfD from 21 different polling institutes covering the time between September 2013 and September 2017. Consistent with an interpretation of increased social acceptability I find that polling releases increase pro-AfD tweets in the same month as the release. Polling releases seem to impact the number of far-right protests only with a lag of two months, and with roughly half the effect size in terms of standard deviation as information shocks from state elections.====I find the propagation effect is asymmetric in the sense that positive election shocks rather than negative shocks seem to drive results. It seems plausible that information shocks about acceptance of xenophobic attitudes might be more “encouraging” for latently xenophobic individuals in liberal places than “discouraging” in places with already relatively low stigma of far-right activities. The reason is that xenophobic individuals in the latter places might attach less weight to global social stigma. Moreover, unexpectedly high populist success is followed by more far-right activity such as demonstrations, but not more arson attacks or physical assaults. This pattern is consistent with my theoretical conceptualization in which the propagation effect comes from marginal xenophobes, and not from hard-core xenophobes.====This paper contributes to the literature in several respects. While existing research into the origin of populism is abundant, less attention has been paid to the implications of populism (Guriev and Papaioannou, 2020). Several studies point to a simultaneous increase in populist success and occurrences of hate crime (Jäckle and König, 2017, Bursztyn et al., 2019, Rees et al., 2019). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper that examines the impact of populist success on far-right extremist political activity in the form of far-right protest marches. Work on the consequences of populist success often has remained purely correlational and unable to address identification challenges of reverse causality and endogeneity. Protests could  – in theory – be both cause and consequence of populist success. Staggered state election results in Germany between 2014 and 2017 allow me to exploit a unique quasi-natural experiment and address these challenges.====Previous literature evaluating the consequences of populist electoral success has almost exclusively focused on the nexus of populism and hate crime: Bursztyn et al. (2020a, p.5) note that, after Donald Trump’s election, reports about hate crimes against immigrants increased.==== In another paper, Bursztyn et al. (2019) establish a link between votes for a nationalistic party in Russia and hate crime in areas with higher social media usage. Schilter (2018), Albornoz et al. (2020), and Carr et al. (2020) study the relationship between the Brexit vote and hate crimes. Müller and Schwarz (2018) examine how tweets from Donald Trump spur increases in hate crime against Muslims. Romarri (2020) shows that the presence of extreme right-wing mayors is associated with more hate crimes in Italy. Finally, in the German context, Jäckle and König (2017) document a correlation between the AfD’s vote share in German districts and the number of attacks against refugees. More relatedly, Müller and Schwarz (2020) provide empirical evidence of a relationship between anti-refugee Facebook posts from the AfD and hate crime in Germany.====Previous literature has also found a link between unexpectedly high populist vote shares and changes in reported attitudes. Giani and Méon (2019) show that reported racist attitudes increased after Donald Trump’s election. Using a similar set-up as this study, Gerling and Kellermann (2019) argue that high AfD vote shares reduced social desirability bias and increased individuals’ likelihood to report intending to vote for the AfD. Their results are compatible with mine and support my proposed interpretation of the propagation effect via a change in social stigma. However, this study is distinct from Gerling and Kellermann (2019) in several regards. First, I go beyond “soft” outcomes of reported voting intentions and study far-right extremism via far-right protest marches, attacks against refugees, antisemitic incidences, and geolocalised tweets. Second, whereas Gerling and Kellermann (2019) examine attitudes of individuals outside the state holding an election, I construct a treatment shock variable which allows me to examine reactions to information shocks within the state holding the election.==== Thus, the present study can highlight in which municipalities information shocks lead to changes in behaviour of the far-right.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the right-wing populist AfD party and far-right protests in Germany. Section 3 provides a theoretical conceptualization of the propagation mechanism. Section 4 outlines the data and Section 5 the econometric setting. Section 6 presents and discusses the results and Section 7 provides robustness checks.

Inspired by the works suggesting that the costly punishment would sustain the contribution level in public goods experiment, we compare the economic behavior of Mongolian- and Han-Chinese and investigate how ethnic diversity would affect contribution, punishment, and the marginal effect of punishment on contribution. We find that the association between ethnic diversity and pro-social behavior is not a simple negative relationship but rather depends on both cultural traits and ethnic fusion when we take punishment opportunity into consideration. Ethnic diversity may help promote contribution, alleviate the punishment level, and increase the efficiency of introducing a punishment mechanism in some circumstances.","Enhancing ethnic cooperation is vital to all countries with ethnic diversity. There has been extensive political economics literature that links high levels of ethnic diversity to low levels of public goods provision, altruistic cooperation, and pro-social behavior (Habyarimana et al., 2007) since the groundbreaking work of Alesina et al. (1999). For example, Miguel and Gugerty (2005) find that ethnic diversity is associated with lower primary school funding and poor maintenance of water well in Kenya. The experimental result from Ferraro and Cummings (2007) reports a higher minimum acceptable offer and hence lower cooperation preference in the Ultimatum Bargaining game session with ethnic composition.====To our knowledge, there has not been literature taking punishment level into consideration. However, punishment is found to be a vehicle for sustaining contribution in the laboratory experiment of Fehr and Gächter (2002). The field experiment by Falk et al. (2019) finds that while poor cooperation of farmers threatens the sustainability of public investment in the rural water infrastructure, a sanctioning mechanism with communication and coordination could support cooperation. Meanwhile, factors such as the potential ethnic fusion developed from Han and Mongolian lived together for long, and the ethnic traits whereby different ethnicities may react differently to the punishment mechanism would both potentially reverse the negative association.====In this paper, we compare Mongolian- and Han-Chinese economic behavior in the public good game experimentally and investigate how ethnic diversity would affect contribution, punishment, and the marginal effect of punishment on contribution between the two ethnicities. Punishment opportunity in the public goods game has long been used to capture the tension between personal and social interest since Fehr and Gächter (2000, 2002) first highlights its importance. More importantly, though voluntary contribution reflects cooperation well, the welfare loss from punishment might offset the welfare gain from higher contribution, where the welfare is calculated using cumulative earnings (Nikiforakis and Normann, 2008). To manipulate the ethnic diversity, Han Chinese and Mongolian Chinese are randomly assigned into three treatments. There are thus all-Han Chinese group, all-Mongolian Chinese group, and Mixed ethnicity group that contains half of the subjects from each ethnic group in our implementation of the game.====We find that the association between ethnic diversity and pro-social behavior is not a simple negative relationship. Rather, it depends on the ethnic traits, despite that the negative association does exist in the all-Han treatment, consistent with the prediction from ingroup bias in the existing literature. In our experiment, Mongolian Chinese contribute more and punish less when there is ethnic diversity in the group. An ethnic diversity also boosts punishment efficiency for both ethnic groups. All the above evidence shows that the negative association between ethnic diversity and pro-social behavior does not always hold and highlights the importance of cultural idiosyncrasy when dealing with ethnic diversity-related issues.====Several mechanisms may explain our results.====First, ethnic diversity reduces punishment level in the Mongolian group. In our experiment, Mongolian Chinese have higher expectation on others’ contribution and punish harsher at and only at their same-ethnic fellow. This behavioral pattern seems very close to the spirit of the “Anda” tradition. In turn, the introduction of the punishment mechanism to the all-Mongolian group is the least efficient in our experiment.====Second, some ethnic fusion has developed between the two ethnic groups. Cultural fusion refers to the bilateral process where the minority group adopts behaviors of the dominant culture. The dominant culture is also transformed by the minority elements of culture (Croucher and Kramer, 2017). Mongolian Chinese's understanding of Han's culture boosts their contribution in the mixed-ethnic session. We could not validate the bilateral effect of cultural fusion due to the lack of Han Chinese with Mongolian culture in the population and hence the sample.====Both discrepancies point out that ethnic diversity and pro-social behavior are never a simple negative association in a public goods game. Rather, it depends on multiple factors such as cultural traits (e.g., “Anda” tradition) and the extent of interactions between different ethnic groups. Our evidence suggests that instead of treating ethnic diversity and pro-social behavior as a simple negative relationship when dealing with multi-ethnic related issues, the policymakers should have a deep understanding of different ethnicities and implement the measures to create an opportunity for ethnicities to build fusion.====Our study contributes to the existing literature in two ways. We are the first to experimentally investigate the association between ethnic diversity and prosocial behavior by taking the punishment opportunity into consideration. Our result shows that the association between pro-social behavior and ethnic diversity is culturally dependent and can be affected by the long-term interactions between the two ethnicities. Meanwhile, this paper answers Schlee's (2008) questions of whether ethnic affiliation is the factor that causes conflict or political fragmentation. Succeeded on but not limited to Algan et al. (2016), which suggests that ethnic diversity prevents the creation of strong social norms to punish and revenge.

We find evidence that a substantial share of Russian firms prefer risky investment climates, which we interpret as evidence of rent-seeking strategies. This pattern is most pronounced for large state-owned firms. State-owned firms are responsive to the Russian foreign policy agenda, while privately-owned firms appear to be more autonomous. The evidence suggests that Russia deploys state-owned firms to extend its influence and exerts influence to make their investments profitable.","Multinational firms from authoritarian countries are reshuffling the politics of foreign direct investment (FDI), seeking footholds in other authoritarian countries and projecting the power of their home states.==== State-owned firms are the leading players, investing in the riskiest neighborhoods and responding most directly to state guidance (Stone et al., 2021). Russia is a prominent example, whose state-owned multinationals have become important global and regional actors. Influence between firms and states runs in both directions, however, and Russian firms' influence at home plays an important role in Russia's relations with its closest neighbors. The downward spiral in Russia's conflict with Ukraine began when Ukraine sought to integrate with the European Union in 2013, which was expected to disadvantage Russian investors. We leverage new transaction-level data on Russian foreign investment in the countries of the former Soviet Union to investigate what the decisions firms make about investment locations reveal about their relationship with the state.====Our first argument is that Russian firms generally prefer to invest in countries with ==== and correspondingly ====, because they can rely on their political connections at home to make these investments profitable. We find robust empirical evidence that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the quality of political institutions and the likelihood of investment, which implies a pattern of rent seeking.====Next, we argue that the relationship between Russia's leader and its leading industrialists is one of ====. On the one hand, the leader of an authoritarian state is the agent of a coalition of regime insiders, who exercises authority on their behalf as long as they receive sufficient private benefits (Bueno De Mesquita et al., 2003). On the other hand, the owners and managers of firms are agents of the leader who hold their positions on good behavior and are expected to show loyalty in return for largesse. In an agency relationship, principals pay informational rents to agents that have information advantages, and in a relationship of reciprocal agency, we expect the rents to flow in both directions.==== Leaders allow foreign policy to be captured in order to promote firms' interests abroad because they are unsure how loyal their lieutenants are, and the lieutenants comply when the leader assigns them political tasks because they are unsure how risky it would be to resist. We use hosting Russian military bases and signing Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) treaties as proxies for countries' affinity for Russian foreign policy and find that they strongly predict investment decisions.====Finally, we rely on firm-level variation to draw inferences about the reach of ====. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) flourish in authoritarian countries, and Vladimir Putin pursued an aggressive policy of renationalizing key industries as he consolidated power. Control is a leading motivation for nationalization: SOEs can be used to pursue objectives such as industrial policy or power projection abroad that would be unprofitable for private firms (Clegg et al., 2018; Cuervo-Cazurra et al., 2014). Consequently, if investment in countries that are aligned with Russia is driven by state influence, the effects should be strongest among state-owned enterprises. At the same time, SOEs are key mechanisms by which authoritarian states distribute patronage to their coalition members and put core supporters in charge of resources that can be used for clientelism. In Russia, for example, the managers of the leading SOEs are extraordinarily wealthy oligarchs in their own right and are close members of Putin's coalition (e.g. Igor Sechin of Rosneft and Aleksey Miller of Gazprom).==== Therefore, if the tendency to invest in countries with weak institutions reflects rent seeking, that tendency should also be strongest for state-owned firms.====Firm size, measured as a count of a firm's foreign affiliates, plays a similar role to state ownership in our analysis. Large firms are subject to less agency slack than small firms because the state has stronger incentives to monitor their behavior. Consequently, investment decisions by large firms should respond most strongly to Russian foreign policy priorities. In addition, the owners and managers of large firms are regime insiders, at least after Putin consolidated control in the early 2000s, because allowing powerful organizations to escape the orbit of close allies is risky. Therefore, the tendency of Russian firms to seek rents by investing in countries with weak institutions should be intensified for large firms.====We present evidence that state-owned and large firms respond more strongly than private and small firms to countries’ alignment with Russia and to weak political institutions. Indeed, these firms are largely responsible for the patterns of investment that follow Russian foreign policy objectives and are concentrated in risky environments. We are cautious about making causal claims based on observational data, but these results are consistent with the reciprocal agency hypothesis.====Our paper contributes to research on the link between the interests of foreign investors and foreign policy. Aidt et al. (2021) survey a detailed literature on foreign interventions and suggest that they are driven by the interests of investors in some cases. Foreign investment is likely to be broadly linked to foreign policy (Krasner 1978; Gertz 2016), but the econometric evidence is largely limited to democratic countries and the prominent authoritarian case of China.==== Firm-level data allow us to study the interplay between foreign policy interests and FDI empirically, and we show that Russian FDI and foreign policy are strongly connected.",Russian power and the state-owned enterprise,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626802100104X,16 September 2021,2021,Research Article,115.0

Yet, during a pandemic, the risk that electoral campaigns would enhance the spread of the disease is substantive. In this paper, we estimate the causal impact of electoral campaigns on the spread of COVID-19. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in the schedule of local elections across Italy, we show that the electoral campaign preceding this latter led to a significant worsening of the epidemiological situation related to the disease. Our results strongly highlight the importance of undertaking stringent measures along the entire electoral process to minimize its epidemiological consequences.","Elections represent a primary tool for legitimating governments’ mandate (====, ====). This legitimization is crucial for the correct functioning of any democracy and becomes even more needed during a pandemic when decisions that limit individual rights substantially are taken. Yet, holding elections during a pandemic might be problematic for a number of reasons.====First, the fear to get infected may increase the cost of voting, especially for individuals more at risk of developing a severe disease (====, ==== thus reducing the actual government legitimization through elections (====).====Second, the possibility for all candidates to run a proper electoral campaign is essential for providing the government a legitimate mandate (====, ====). However, restrictions imposed by health authorities to curb the epidemic or fear to get infected may limit candidates’ opportunities to campaign and to inform voters correctly about their platform (====, ====).====Last but not least, holding elections during a pandemic might worsen the general epidemiological scenario by further enhancing the spread of the disease. On the election date, the epidemic may easily spread if many voters find themselves simultaneously at the polling station (see, e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====). Moreover, during the electoral campaign, candidates and their staffs meet voters, shake their hands, and take pictures with them in several in-person gatherings in inside or outside venues, assemblies in local communities, and receptions (====, ====) where social distancing measures are challenging to enforce.====In this work, we identify the causal impact of electoral campaigns on the diffusion of COVID-19 by exploiting a natural experiment taking place in Italy at the beginning of the ==== of the pandemic. Regional elections in Italy usually take place every fifth year, with different regions voting at different points in time because of past shocks. According to this schedule, thirteen out of twenty regions had their last regional election before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while regional elections took place in the other seven regions during September 2020, on the same day as a national referendum to amend the constitution. This plausibly exogenous variation to the intensity of the electoral campaign allows us to compare, in a Difference-in-Differences setting, the epidemiological outcomes in areas with and without regional elections before and after the start of the campaign.====We find that the electoral campaign preceding the regional elections did lead to a significant increase in new infections (7%), percentage of positive tests (15%), ordinary hospitalizations (24%), entries in intensive care units (5.3%), and deaths (0.6%) related to the disease. Trends in all epidemiological outcomes begin to diverge before the election date, suggesting that our results are mainly driven by contagions during the campaign. To strengthen our interpretation of the findings, we document that individuals were more likely to attend gathering venues such as public parks and squares in the treated regions during the weeks ahead of elections.====We also find that the campaign induced a significant reduction in the number of test for detecting the disease (8%). We investigate whether reduction in the number of performed tests is driven by a reduction in demand for testing (i.e., individuals’ willingness to get tested) or by a reduction in supply of tests (i.e., regions’ propensity to provide COVID-19 tests to citizens). We provide suggestive evidence that the negative impact of the electoral campaign on the number of performed tests is mainly driven by a reduction in regional testing capacity. Indeed, treated regions do no show differential trends in searches on Google for COVID-19 tests during the electoral campaign, thus narrowing the relevance of the demand-related explanation. Instead, they are less effective in tracing and testing the close contacts of positive individuals and are less likely to give private healthcare providers allowance to perform COVID-19 tests.====Taken together, our results inform the debate on how managing elections at the time of COVID-19 in three critical manners. First, they point towards the existence of a substantive impact of elections on the spread of COVID-19, thus proving the necessity to enforce a strict safety protocol to minimize such impact. Second, they show that a large portion of the epidemiological risk connected to elections is concentrated during the electoral campaign preceding the vote when sanitary precautions are more difficult to enforce than at the polling station. Lastly, by showing the significant negative impact of electoral campaigns on testing, our work discloses a further channel through which campaigns can ease the spread of the disease. Failing to promptly test and isolate positive individuals may as well worsen the epidemiological situation if these individuals infect others. This latter channel is consistent with recent developments in the literature on ==== according to which cycles have, in turn, a direct impact on individual outcomes.====Testing in Italy is mainly conducted within the public healthcare services, which is area regional responsibility under the responsibility of the regional government. There are five main reasons why a person might get tested.====First, if the person has been recognized as a “close contact” of an individual who got tested positive. The national ministry of health specifies the criteria for being considered a “close contact”, but it is the healthcare provider’s responsibility to trace and evaluate the contacts of all positive individuals. Regions have discretion over the decision on whether a positive’s contact is to be considered a “close contact”, and therefore is subject to compulsory test and precautionary isolation or not. Moreover, reports that regions present to the national government document a non-negligible variation in the proportion of positive individuals for whom the region had effectively conducted a contact tracing.====Second, an individual who has symptoms that are potentially related to COVID-19 should get tested. In this case, the individual receives from her doctor the authorization to book an appointment for free at the public healthcare provider.====Third, an individual may need a test for professional or travel purposes. For instance, professional sports require athletes to be subject to tests regularly. These tests are usually conducted by private labs and are added to the aggregate figures if the health ministry recognizes the performed test. Until January 2021, only PCR Covid-19 tests (the traditional molecular tests) were computed in the official figures. However, private testing provision was a limited market during summer 2020. According to “Corriere della Sera” (the most popular and acknowledgeable newspaper in Italy), as of October 2020, only seven regions had allowed private sector healthcare providers to supply PCR Covid-19 tests.====Fourth, regions have the faculty to propose special testing days in which a significant fraction of citizens who live in a limited area are tested after a surge of contagions in that area.====Fifth, and individual who had previously tested positive needs to take other tests (the first of which not earlier than ten days from the positive test) until a negative result allows the person to leave from her isolation.

Who decides to vote is pushed by intrinsic motivations, preferences and interests. Indeed, Lijphart (1997) points out that in the US, the more privileged, those with higher incomes, greater wealth and better education vote more.====The extent of self-selection into voting affects one tenet of democracies, its representativeness. Typically, higher voter turnouts are associated with a wider representation of interests, while lower turnouts are a symptom that institutions are captured by specific constituencies. The degree of representativeness, in turn, affects the democratic decision making: Mueller and Stratmann (2003) find that higher voter turnouts promote income redistribution and less inequality; similarly, Fumagalli and Narciso (2012) document that higher turnouts are associated with larger spending in welfare; Glaeser et al. (2007) show that higher turnouts lead to better governance.====Among the possible determinants of voting, education has received particular attention. Milligan et al. (2004) and Dee (2004) hypothesize that the more educated individuals vote more because they are better aware of the issues at stake in an election, they are more informed, they better understand voting and registration procedures and they may have attended courses of civics at school. Overall, the most recent literature which estimates causal effects, only partially confirms this hypothesis (see, among others, Milligan et al., 2004, Dee, 2004, Siedler, 2010, Sondheimer and Green, 2010, Pelkonen, 2012, Croke et al., 2016).====We re-examine the causal link between education and voter turnout in Italy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on Italy, a large democracy, where the traditionally high levels of turnout have significantly declined in recent years and where citizens’ trust in the government and the political parties are among the lowest among the OECD members (OECD, 2013, OECD, 2019).====While the empirical literature has typically relied on individual self-reported data on voting, our paper takes a broader perspective. We also start by analysing the relationship between voting and education using individual self-reported data, but we note that self-reported voting may suffer from reporting bias, which itself may depend on education. For instance, the more educated might be more tempted to falsely report that they voted if they think this is what they are expected to do according to commonly accepted social norms (Silver et al., 1986). If so, the estimated effect of education on self-reported turnout may be a poor indication of the effect of education on (actual) voting. Moreover, the latter is not identified even if education is properly instrumented. Instrumentation addresses the other typical problem in this kind of analysis, omitted variables, which confound the effect of education with that of other individual characteristics. To isolate the effect of education on voting and have a benchmark against which judging the extent of misreporting, we exploit accurate administrative data on voter turnout in two Italian parliamentary elections, held more than ten years apart, in 2001 and 2013, and we regress voter turnout on average education, by municipality.====To address confounding factors, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy, which relies on a series of reforms that extended compulsory education for the younger cohorts. Our instrument exploits the joint variation in the length of compulsory education across cohorts and the variation in the population age structure across municipalities.====Contrary to the evidence from other developed countries, we find a negative effect of schooling on voter turnout, stronger when administrative data are used. This pattern suggests that the more educated over-report their voting participation, and this can partly explain the mixed results that we find in the literature, which rely on individual self-reported data.====To investigate why education discourages voter turnout in Italy, we explore whether there are heterogeneous effects by area and political orientation, social capital, politicians’ conduct, and quality of institutions. We find that the negative effect of education is stronger in the South and more generally in the areas traditionally supporting the parties more involved in the scandals of the early Nineties, in areas with lower social capital, or which experienced political misconduct, or that have poorer institutional quality. The latter findings are compatible with a theory according to which the most educated people, who are typically better informed and more aware of the prevailing political practices, abstain from voting as “a way to express dissatisfaction with the [...] candidates or [...] the entire political system” (Hayden, 2010). This conjecture is supported by the evidence that education is positively associated with higher proportions of blank votes, a typical form of protest voting (Alvarez et al., 2018).====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the relevant literature. Section 3 briefly describes reforms on compulsory schooling in Italy. Section 4 introduces our data. Section 5 presents our empirical strategy.

While general distaste for taxation may explain low support for Pigouvian taxes,==== an important feature of climate change related taxes, compared to other environmental taxes,==== is that their benefits (e.g. clean air) are only experienced some time after the tax is paid. Tiezzi and Xiao (2016) provide experimental evidence that consumers are generally less willing to support a taxation policy aimed at reducing consumption externalities when the latter occur sometime after consumption (i.e. when the benefit of tax is delayed). In that study, the tax was imposed on the demand side. In practice, however taxes can be levied on both consumers and suppliers. For example, while resource production taxes in China and taxes on coal production levied in Australia are implemented upstream (Richter et al., 2018), carbon pricing schemes are often imposed midstream, on large industrial point sources of emissions as in the European Union (EU) Emission Trading System (ETS). In countries such as Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, The Netherlands, Ireland, Great Britain, these taxes tend to be levied downstream under the “polluter pays principle” with exemptions and allowances for specific household types (Zhang and Wang 2017). This raises the question whether the delay effect persists when the tax is levied on the supply side.====The Liability-Side Equivalence (LSE) Principle establishes that the economic incidence of a tax, i.e. who ultimately bears the burden of the tax, is independent of the side of the market the tax is levied on, implying that public attitudes towards taxation should not be affected by the side of the market that is taxed. The violation of LSE, however, has been observed in market experiments with negative externalities (Sausgruber and Tyran, 2005 and Sausgruber and Tyran, 2011). In such context consumers seem to suffer from a tax-shifting bias, i.e. they are more likely to support taxes levied on the supply side than taxes levied on the demand side. This experimental literature has considered only static environments without any time delay of the negative externality. It is possible that the violation of LSE as a framing effect is not sufficient to overcome the negative delay effect on support for taxation.====The delay of the negative externality is not a simple change of frame. With delayed externalities, the decision to support the tax becomes an intertemporal choice rather than a static one. Tiezzi and Xiao (2016) show that the intertemporal structure of the externalities increases the perceived complexity of decision-making in the market and leads to narrow bracketing, i.e. basing today's decisions mainly on today's payoffs with little regard for future payoffs (Rabin and Weizsäcker 2009). The reason is that in the delay condition decision-makers’ current consumption choices affect each other's current and future payoffs and, as a result, the intertemporal trade-off of one's decision making is not that clear. This is in contrast with simple individual intertemporal decision-making, where one's future payoffs depend on one's own decisions only.====Indeed, while experiencing the tax leads to more consistency with LSE (Sausgruber and Tyran, 2011), the delay effect remains even after individuals have experienced the tax institution (Tiezzi and Xiao 2016). Thus, the delay effect may persist when the tax is levied on the supply side of the market.====To examine whether the delay effect varies based on the side of the market the tax is levied on, we conduct an intertemporal market experiment on public support for taxes (Kallbekken, Kroll, and Cherry 2011; Sausgruber and Tyran, 2005; Cherry, Kallbekken, and Kroll 2014, 2017; Tiezzi and Xiao 2016). Participants can earn money by purchasing a hypothetical consumption good in the market. Consumption, however, imposes a negative cost on everyone in the market. We manipulate the timing of the externality and introduce opportunities for buyers to vote on whether to introduce a tax on consumption. The experiment adopts a two-by-two design, which manipulates whether the externality is delayed (No Delay vs. Delay) and whether the tax is levied on the demand or on the supply side of the market (Buyer tax vs. Seller tax).====We first replicated the delay effect observed in Tiezzi and Xiao (2016) when the tax is levied on buyers in the No Delay conditions. When we examine the treatments where the tax is levied on sellers, we find that the delay effect remains significant. The difference-in-difference test shows that the size of the delay effect does not differ between the Buyer tax and the Seller tax treatments. Our findings highlight the importance of the timing of the tax benefits in attitudes towards taxation irrespective of the statutory incidence of the tax.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some background to the choice between demand side versus supply side environmental taxes and a review of previous experimental papers on LSE. Section 3 describes the experimental design and procedures. Section 4 reports on the presence of tax-shifting bias and delay effect.

When states are rank-ordered by average ====, a 0.5 percent increase in income inequality will typically result in a two-position decline in state ranking.","Since the 1970s, income inequality has steadily risen in the United States (Frank 2009; Piketty and Saez 2014). While this alarming trend has received considerable press coverage and great interest among economists, little consensus has emerged regarding the underlying causes of the increase in inequality, much less a suitable policy response. Over the same period, the number of federal regulatory restrictions has also sharply increased (McLaughlin and Sherouse 2019). Though a rapidly growing strand of the literature now documents the unintended and regressive effects of regulation, the link between regulations and inequality has been generally neglected by economists. This paper contributes to the literature on the regressive effects of regulation by studying the relationship between federal regulations and income inequality in US states.====Our thesis is that regulations can exacerbate income inequality by generating compliance costs that disproportionately impact small businesses and low-income households while giving rise to costly regulatory barriers to entry, which shelter incumbents and inhibit competition. If true, the concomitant rise of both federal regulations and US income inequality over the past 40 years was no coincidence. Some regulations may serve the public interest, increase welfare and even reduce income inequality. However, on net the accumulation of even well intended regulations can have unintended consequences that fall disproportionately on low-income households.====Evidence indicates that regulations disproportionately impact small businesses and stifle entrepreneurship. Looking at all forms of business regulation across a wide array of industries, Crain and Crain (2014) estimate that small businesses faced 29 percent higher average per-employee compliance costs than large firms ($11,724 versus $9083). At the US state level, Bailey and Thomas (2017) find that entry regulation is associated with fewer firm births and slower growth in employment, whereas Goldschlag and Tabarrok (2018) do not find evidence that industry-specific regulations are associated with measures of dynamism. The competing results are reconciled by Cambers et al. (2020) who show that regulation is associated with less dynamism using the assumption that the change in the number of newly formed firms is proportionate to the change in regulation.==== Chambers et al. (2018) find that an increase in industry-specific regulations is associated with fewer small firms and reduced small-firm employment. Similarly, Gutierrez and Philippon (2019) demonstrate that regulations have reduced small firms’ market entry and growth relative to their larger competitors. Chambers and Guo (2019) empirically test the dynamic general equilibrium model of Dhawan and Guo (2001) and demonstrate that more industry-specific federal regulations reduce both the output share and employment share of small firms in the US economy. Apart from acting as a costly barrier to entrepreneurs starting new businesses (Klapper et al. 2006), regulation impacts income inequality in other ways.====Regulations may also increase inequality in the labor market. Occupational licensure increases the cost of entering a profession and tends to increase the wages of license holders (Kleiner and Krueger 2013; Kleiner and Park 2010). Kleiner and Vorotnikov (2017) find that occupational licensure increases wages of license holders and exacerbates wage inequality in the United Sates. Others (Bailey, Thomas, and Anderson 2019; Mulholland 2019) provide industry level evidence that federal regulation in the United States may lead to greater wage inequality between occupations and within occupations. We build on this industry level evidence by testing if income inequality is higher in states exposed to more federal regulation due to their industrial composition.====Because changes to regulation are one aspect of broader economic liberalization, our empirical results also contribute to the literature studying the distributional effects of economic liberalization and globalization (Bergh and Nilsson 2010). Cross-country evidence suggests that the distributional effects likely depend on the type and the context of liberalization or globalization. For instance, the effect on the distribution of income may depend on the level of income (Bergh and Nilsson 2010) and the degree of financial development (De Haan et al., 2017), while redistribution in these contexts may depend on the degree of fractionalization (Pleninger and Sturm 2020). Unlike cross-country studies, we are better able to hold the context constant both by focusing specifically on the regulation (rather than various types of liberalization) and by testing the effect of federal regulation on the distribution of income within one country.====To the extent that regulation reduces entrepreneurship, slows employment growth, exacerbates wage inequality, and increases poverty in the United States, regulation should be associated with aggregate measures of the distribution of income. Indeed, Chambers et al. (2019b) find that states exposed to greater federal regulation because of the composition of industry in that state tend to have higher poverty rates. Using the Federal Regulation and State Enterprise (FRASE) index of state-level regulatory burden, they find that a 10 percent increase in regulatory burden increases the poverty rate by 2.5 percent. Therefore, it is not surprising that our empirical results indicate that the regulatory burden, as measured by the FRASE index (see Fig. 1), is associated with higher income inequality in a panel of US states between 1997 and 2015. Specifically, we find that a 10 percent increase in the exposure of a state to federal regulatory burden (based on the industrial composition of the state) is associated with a half a percent increase in state level income inequality.====This study does not replace cost benefit analysis or other welfare analysis of specific regulations. Though other studies have used the FRASE index to study aspects of welfare, including health outcomes (Broughel and Chambers, 2021). Rather, our results highlight the importance of considering the distributional effects of regulations, even if cost benefit analysis finds that a regulation has a positive net present value.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we briefly review the literature regarding the determinants of income inequality, with an emphasis on the relationship between regulations and inequality. Second, we provide a description of the data and describe our empirical model. Next, we discuss the estimation results, including several robustness exercises, followed by the conclusion.",Regulation and income inequality in the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000872,1 September 2021,2021,Research Article,119.0

With this IV, we capture the relative attractiveness of FDI in host countries. Our results indicate that increased FDI causes an increase in vote shares for right-wing parties. We also find suggestive evidence of increased left-wing support in developing countries and legislative elections. We show that more moderate parties, specifically center-right parties, generally lose vote shares as FDI increases.","Over the past 30 years foreign direct investments (FDI) has grown substantially due to deregulation, decreased communication costs, financial investment incentives, and international agreements. Total FDI inflow in the world increased by nearly 300% in that time frame with a large portion of this increase going to emerging economics. In 2018, low and middle income countries saw over half of all inward FDI while in 1990 only 8.7% of FDI went to these countries.==== Much of the research on FDI focuses on the determinants of these inflows (Jadhav and Katti, 2012, Desbordes, 2010, Busse and Groizard, 2008, Bénassy-Quéré et al., 2007, Loree and Guisinger, 1995, Chakrabarti, 2001). There is much less research on the effects of FDI. This paper examines the effects of FDI on party vote shares in 149 countries between 1990 and 2017. We construct a database that catalogs political parties into specific political positions. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive election dataset dealing with elections across the world. Using this dataset, we are able to analyze the political impact of increased globalization in both the developed and developing world.====We differ from previous studies that explore the role of globalization through imports and exports by examining the role of FDI directly. FDI is distinct from other forms of globalization. While FDI has been shown to be influenced by political factors, including corruption (Egger and Winner, 2005), government budgets (Wisniewski and Pathan, 2014), economic freedom (Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles, 2003), and degree of democracy (Jakobsen and De Soysa, 2006, Adam and Filippaios, 2007), no previous study has shown the role FDI has on national political parties. As foreign firms invest in a host country, they also begin lobbying the government of the host country for more favorable policy. FDI brings positive benefits to the voting population in the form of employment, higher wages, and product variety. The negative effects of FDI include increased competition for existing domestic firms. These real effects to the lives of the host country’s population causes changes in their political preferences.====Using evidence from Blanc-Brude et al. (2014), who shows that FDI location depends on proximity to other alternative FDI locations, we argue that a host country competes with its surrounding region for FDI. We build a novel IV that measures the attractiveness of the surrounding region as a possible FDI location. To build this IV, we use two variables. First, we use the average exchange rate of each country in the surrounding region to major countries from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Second, we additionally use the linguistic distance to these OECD countries to construct our IV.====Our results indicate that a one-percent increase in FDI leads to a roughly 3% increase in right-wing votes and a roughly 2% decrease in center-right votes. The right-wing results seems to be most pronounced for legislative elections (as opposed to presidential). Increasing FDI in the developing world results in increases in both left-wing and right-wing votes while center-right parties lose vote share. These results suggest that FDI may have led to increasing polarization during the time period of our study. Our findings are robust to alternate specifications as well as different IVs. Our method of using regional activity to create an IV for FDI introduces a novel, tractable, and effective way to analysis broader effects of FDI and globalization across the world despite limited data in developing countries.====As the world becomes more globalized, our results imply that trade policy, social policy, and Intellectual protection rights (IPR) policy will be affected. Specifically, we expect less social policy, more anti-immigration policy, stronger IPR-protection, and more trade policy to be enacted as right-wing parties gain more votes than any of their counterparts. The results of this paper indicate a pressing need to better adjust for endogeneity when studying multinational activity abroad. Likewise, policy makers must understand the possible political ramifications of increasing FDI. The increased polarization from FDI could cause a political party to lose a majority or even destabilize the country. Increasing FDI might then result in increasing risk that deters future multinational investment.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature.

Using a sharp ==== in close mixed gender races for the election of mayors in Italian municipalities in the period 2000–2015, we find no significant differences in policies implemented by male and female mayors. We explore whether the result masks heterogeneity by gender composition of the local government and by electoral rules according to which a mayor is elected. We find some evidence that female mayors devote a larger share of spending to the environment when there are more women in the municipal council, whereas they reduce the amount of resources going to social spending under the run-off relative to the single round system.","Gender gaps in political empowerment are wide. According to the Global Gender Gap Index (World Economic Forum, 2020), the world has closed only 25 percent of the gender gap in politics. Academic research has investigated the causes of this gap, focusing on women’s willingness or interest to run as candidates (e.g., Schlozman et al., 1994, Fox and Lawless, 2004, Júlio and Tavares, 2017), parties’ selection of candidates (Kunovich and Paxton, 2005) or voter bias (Black and Erickson, 2003, Schwindt-Bayer et al., 2010), and policy measures to strengthen women’s political empowerment (e.g., Baltrunaite et al., 2019, Baltrunaite et al., 2014). Besides equity reasons as rationales for reducing the gaps, the expectation that women could have different characteristics as policy makers compared to men and behave differently in policy setting choices has been prominent both in the academic and policy debate, although there is no conclusive evidence on whether gender matters in policy making.====In this paper, we contribute to this debate by investigating whether male and female politicians take different decisions on the level and composition of local public spending and revenues, and by studying the conditions which may favor the emergence of different policy outcomes depending on gender. We consider the election of mayors in Italian municipalities in the period 2000–2015 and adopt a sharp regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal impact of gender on local public finance. We focus on mixed gender elections and use the margin of victory as a forcing variable in the RD design. We find no significant difference in the level and composition of local public spending and revenues in Italian municipalities depending on the gender of the mayor.====To investigate whether the null result at the mean masks important heterogeneity, we identify two key dimensions along which to explore gender differences: the share of women in the local government (i.e. municipal council and executive committee) and the electoral rule according to which a mayor is elected (i.e. single round versus run-off system). We find some evidence that the gender composition of the municipal council, as well as the electoral rule matter for gender differences in policy outcomes. In particular, in municipalities run by female mayors a higher female share in the municipal council is associated with higher spending on the environment. In addition, female mayors elected under a run-off system devote a lower share of expenditure to social services. They also collect a lower share of revenues from fees.====Several recent studies have investigated the relationship between female political leadership and policy decisions (for a recent survey, see Hessami and da Fonseca, 2020).==== To appropriately test this relationship requires an institutional setting in which the gender balance of policy makers is exogenously determined. Exploiting random allocation of women-reserved seats, Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) find that female leaders in India allocate more resources to investments that are more relevant to their own gender. Using close mixed gender races, Clots-Figueras (2011) finds that the gender of politicians impacts on policy decisions, with social position mediating the effect. In particular, female legislators coming from lower castes favor women-friendly laws and redistributive policies, whereas female legislators coming from higher castes have no effect on women-friendly policies or redistribution. Brollo and Troiano (2016) use a regression discontinuity design in close mixed gender races to show that, in Brazil, cities run by female mayors have better health indicators, receive more federal transfers and are less prone to corruption in public tenders. Baskaran and Hessami (2018) show that in Bavarian municipalities a higher share of female council members has a positive causal impact on the availability of childcare, whereas Baskaran et al. (2018) show that Indian constituencies that elect women have higher growth rates compared to others. Exploiting direct democracy in Switzerland, Funk and Gathmann (2015) show that in Swiss referenda women support the allocation of resources to health, environmental protection, defense and welfare. In contrast to these contributions which testify to the importance of gender in policy choices, Ferreira and Gyourko (2014) find that female mayors in US cities have no impact on municipal spending, employment and crime rates. A similar result is obtained in Carozzi and Gago (2020) for Spain, where the gender of the mayor shows no correlation with policy decisions, whereas party affiliation does. Bagues and Campa (2021) find that the gender of Spanish municipal councilors does not bring about more expenditure on issues women care about the most.====Our research brings new causal evidence to this literature and digs into the analysis of the processes and the conditions, which may favor gender differences in policy making to emerge. In particular, we investigate whether the gender composition of the local government and the prevailing electoral rules mediate the impact of gender on policy outcomes.====As to the first issue, decision-making at the local level involves two further actors, besides mayors: the municipal council and the executive committee. The mayor is responsible for the budgetary policy, together with the executive committee, and can perform a proactive role in taking decisions about expenditures and revenues. The municipal council has to authorize the mayor and executive committee to undertake the proposed budgetary policy. Although the mayor plays a major role in local public finance decisions, the final policy outcome also depends on the ability and room to build consensus. If women and men have different policy priorities, a female (male) mayor may be able to implement the desired policy only if she (he) finds enough support, and this may be conditioned by the gender composition of the overall political body, in particular of the municipal council, which has to authorize the mayor’s proposals. As women in political decision-making may care more than men about specific categories of public spending, such as environment and social services (Hessami and da Fonseca, 2020, Funk and Gathmann, 2015), we expect this difference to appear in one of these categories. The literature lacks comprehensive evidence on gender interactions in public finance decisions at the local level. An early paper by Gagliarducci and Paserman (2012) analyzes the probability of early resignation of female mayors in Italian municipalities as the proportion of women in the municipal council changes and provides evidence on a set of local public finance outcomes for the period 1993–2003. We extend this analysis using a wider set of local public finance outcomes; we focus on a longer and more recent time period (2000–2015), when female presence in local governments has become more widespread, and we analyze separately the effect for members of the municipal council and of the executive committee, which might have a different impact on local public finance decisions, given their different roles. From the methodological point of view, we study gender interactions through a difference-in-discontinuities methodology, which allows us to rigorously control for the different dimensions of heterogeneity at the threshold.====As to the second issue, we explore heterogeneity according to the prevailing electoral rule, i.e. whether the mayor is elected in a single round or whether a run-off system is in place. According to Law 81/1993, mayors of Italian municipalities are directly elected by citizens under plurality rule, with a single round for municipalities with less than 15,000 residents and a run-off system in municipalities with more than 15,000 residents. We know from the literature that electoral rules matter for fiscal policy outcomes (e.g., Ferraresi et al., 2015, Cipullo, 2018), as well as for electoral incentives faced by local politicians and for political selection (e.g., Barone and De Blasio, 2013, Bordignon et al., 2016, Bordignon et al., 2017). None of these papers focuses on the gender dimension, though.==== Thus, we investigate whether any of the two electoral rules favors the emergence of gender differences in policy implementation. Run-off systems are characterized by a higher number of candidates running for the mayoral position and require the support of higher shares of voters to win (Bordignon et al., 2016). Both characteristics can be interpreted as signaling a higher degree of competition in this type of elections. Since competitive environments are less favorable to women (Bertrand, 2011, Iversen and Rosenbluth, 2010), we expect that in the more competitive run-off system it is more difficult for women to show their preference for spending in the categories they care about the most (environment and social services). Research also shows that run-off systems are likely to display convergence of the policy by the two competitors (Bordignon et al., 2017). Such convergence could imply that gender matters less as a determinant of policy outcomes when the competition is stronger, i.e. in run-off rather than single round elections. Overall, our hypothesis is that we will find a null effect, or a negative one on spending categories women care about the most.====Results partially support our first hypothesis of complementarity across political bodies: female mayors in municipalities with a larger female share in the municipal council spend more in environment, but not in social services. They also show partial support of the second hypothesis: in run-off systems, male and female mayors do not allocate expenditure differently, which is in line with competition drawing candidates towards more similar platforms, with the exception of a lower expenditure share in social services in municipalities run by female mayors, which is consistent with women having to compromise more in competitive environments. We also find a decrease in the revenues from fees in municipalities under the run-off system, which are run by female mayors.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional setting; Section 3 describes the data; Section 4 introduces the empirical strategy; Section 5 presents our causal estimates of the gender of mayors on local public finance and the heterogeneity analyses; Section 6 concludes.",Women and local public finance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000835,26 August 2021,2021,Research Article,121.0

Finally, having connections with district leaders is more important than connections with district officials.","There is an emerging body of literature that examines political connections in the context of economic development (Caeyers and Dercon, 2012; Markussen and Tarp, 2014; Do et al., 2017; Lehne et al., 2018). Poor levels of governance and financial accountability in developing countries can lead to resources flowing to a privileged few. While having political connections is crucial in providing information to policymakers, government officials using their resources to serve their own self-interests will reduce the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs. Decentralised local governments in developing countries may more efficiently elicit people's preferences than a centralised government, but they may also be subjected to the local political capture of public goods (Panda, 2015). While a substantial literature has examined the influence of political connections on the allocation of welfare programs, very few studies have been undertaken to understand the impact of such connections on post-disaster assistance (Takasaki, 2011; Caeyers and Dercon, 2012; Atkinson et al., 2015). Understanding how resources are distributed after a disaster is increasingly important. Populations in developing countries are becoming increasingly concentrated in vulnerable areas and extreme weather events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity (Solomon et al., 2007).====In this study, we examine whether lower level governments with greater political connections are more likely to receive support programs from the central government following natural disasters. We use Vietnam as a case study. The country is one of five to be deemed most-affected by climate change and has been suffering from a high frequency of natural disasters. Even though, Vietnam remains solidly authoritarian, since its reforms in the mid-1980s it has adopted a process of political decentralisation (Malesky and London, 2014). Combining decentralisation and authoritarianism allows public officials to distribute funding and political rents without public scrutiny. In the context of post-disaster assistance programs, local leaders and government representatives select recipients without necessarily considering which communities have been worse affected. Local elites might therefore favour communes in which their friends or relatives reside, which results in a lack of legitimacy and reduced efficiency of assistance programs.====Most previous studies on political connections and resource allocations focus on democratic regimes, where political capital could be gained in exchange for disaster relief or other forms of support (Dasgupta and Beard, 2007; Besley et al., 2011; Panda, 2015). In the context of an authoritarian regime, however, political capital is an unlikely goal of public officials. We therefore investigate the role that relationships can have in determining support outcomes. We differentiate ‘family ties’ and ‘social ties’ to shed light on the mechanisms that drive resource allocation in authoritarian regimes. We use broad measures of political connectedness identified as: (i) households with members as public officials; (ii) households with relatives as public officials living outside the household; and (iii) households with friends or acquaintances as public officials. Our paper thus departs from most previous studies that use a simple definition of political connections, such as whether households are politically connected or that examine the share of households that have connections (Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Caeyers and Dercon, 2012; Panda, 2015; Alatas et al., 2019). We focus on connections at the district level given that post disaster funding decisions are made at the province level and the district leaders have direct authority to allocate resources.==== We hypothesise that communes with more political connections will receive greater support since district officials are likely to favour the communes in which they have connections.====We use data from the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS). The existing literature has been constrained by the paucity of data on the ranking of officials in authoritarian countries which are often too sensitive to obtain. The VARHS provides unique information on public officials at the household level. They are matched with the data on receiving support in the post-disaster period at the commune level which are available for the years 2012 and 2014. We estimate the probability that a commune receives support from the government following a disaster, subject to its political connections at the district level. We use different model specifications including conditional fixed-effects logit models and linear models with fixed effects. This approach has been widely used in studies examining the probability of participating in poverty alleviation programs (Panda, 2015) and receiving government credit (Markussen and Tarp, 2014).====Our findings stress a significant role of political connections on the allocation of disaster assistance in the context of climatic shocks. We show that communes with higher levels of connections at the district level are more likely to receive disaster support in a post-shock period. Specifically, we find that an increase in the number of connections for the average household by 1 unit in a commune increases the probability of receiving support after a natural disaster by approximately 30.7 percent. There is strong and robust evidence of ‘family ties’ acting as a mechanism. We find no evidence of a ‘social ties’ channel. We also uncover evidence suggesting that support is more likely to flow when household political connections are with younger family members. Finally, we show that having connections that are district leaders is more important than having connections as district officials. Overall, our findings suggest that political connections influence disaster assistance which might therefore reduce the effectiveness of such programs. Findings from this study, although focused on Vietnam, may also provide insights on resource allocation in other socialist economies.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief summary of previous studies and highlights the contributions of the paper. Section 3 presents a background of political connections in Vietnam and what they might mean for communes in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

We study this in the context of the German debt brake, which became a constitutional provision in 2009 but is binding for the sub-national states from 2020 onwards only. Via a unique survey, we analyze compliance expectations of parliamentarians of all 16 German state parliaments. A strong incumbency effect is identified from parliamentarians who move in and out of government, showing that politicians from the governing coalition are more optimistic than those from the opposition. A negative fiscal shock has little effects on the former, but a strongly negative one on the latter. We offer a theoretical model that is consistent with an increasing incumbency effect over time, as the result of wishful thinking by politicians concerning their reelection chances and a dynamic reputation effect for policymakers when compliance with the fiscal rule is achieved.","Over the past two decades, governments have increasingly used numerical fiscal rules to constrain public debt and support the sustainability of public budgets (Lledo et al., 2017; Yared 2019). The wave of new rules has peaked in the years following the economic and financial crisis of 2008–9 (Schaechter et al., 2012) and has inspired a large and growing literature assessing the effectiveness of fiscal rules. A common approach of this literature is to estimate in cross-section or panel models the ex post effect of fiscal rules on fiscal outcomes in jurisdictions.====Our analysis contributes to the literature on fiscal rule effectiveness but takes a novel avenue. An effective numerical rule should be reflected in positive compliance expectations of those players who are to be constrained by the rule. Therefore, we analyze a fiscal rule's effectiveness ex ante and look at the rule's effects on compliance expectations. We study the German constitutional fiscal rule based on a unique survey among individual members of all 16 state parliaments in Germany with two survey waves covering two legislative terms before the fiscal rule became binding in 2020. In each wave we had a response rate of more than one third with a non-response analysis indicating no serious selection bias. This provides us with a total of 1302 responses and a considerable overlap of respondents in both waves that we exploit in our identification strategy.====The institutional features of the German fiscal rule (the so-called Schuldenbremse, “debt brake”) allow us to study expectation effects over time before the rule became legally binding. Germany implemented the debt brake in its constitution in the year 2009 in the middle of the deep recession caused by the financial crisis. Given the difficult financial conditions in that year and due to political resistance, Germany opted for a model of ‘lagged implementation’ (Buchanan 1994): The debt brake was phased in over more than a decade with the rule for the sub-national states (Länder) becoming effective in the year 2020. Starting with the budget 2020, German state parliaments are obliged to adopt at minimum a structurally balanced budget with narrowly defined exceptions and escape clauses.====In the years before 2020, we asked the parliamentarians at two different times, how likely it is that their state will comply with the requirements of the constitutional debt brake (i.e. have a cyclically adjusted balanced budget from 2020 onwards). In the analysis of responses, we pay particular attention to the role of political competition for the heterogeneity of expectations within one parliament. It has been frequently shown in other contexts that a blame game has the consequence of strongly contradicting signals on a country's performance (Hansson 2018; Weaver 1986): Opposition representatives typically perceive the incumbents' performance in darker colors, whereas incumbent politicians put current data and trends into a much brighter light.====Our panel data allow us to precisely test for this government-opposition effect using “within person” variation: we exploit cases of individual parliamentarians who change the roles between government and opposition between the two survey waves. We make use of eight changes in the composition of state governments that switched the role of some parliamentarians from opposition to being part of the governing coalition, and for others in the opposite direction. The debt brake was not a key item in any election campaign and the change in political majorities is therefore likely to be exogenous with respect to the expectations of policymakers. With this design, we are able to distinguish between two fundamentally different reasons why parliamentarians can have a pessimistic compliance expectations for the debt brake even in an environment of improving fiscal fundamentals. First, this pessimism could directly reflect the weakness of a rule that inherently lacks credibility, e.g. due missing sanctions or other deficiencies. Second, and very differently, it may reflect a regular feature of political competition in which opposition parliamentarians have a strong incentive to denounce the competence of the government. This second explanation for the observable compliance pessimism does not necessarily signal a low inherent rule credibility but rather mirrors the opposition perspective. Hence, it is important to disentangle the heterogeneity in compliance expectations that is a natural outcome of political competition from the more worrisome heterogeneity that is unrelated to the government-opposition contest. Based on this setting we make an empirical and a theoretical contribution.====Our empirical results show that fiscal fundamentals - such as budgetary balance, level and change of government debt - have little relevance on average. Somewhat surprisingly, we do not observe significantly more optimism in compliance expectations related to an improvement of these variables. If anything, such optimism based on better fiscal variables is confined to government politicians while overall expectations remain fairly pessimistic.====The results do confirm the relevance of the government-opposition effect. Looking at the full sample including both waves, members of incumbent government parties are significantly more optimistic than members from opposition parties. This effect is measured controlling for individual socio-economic characteristics and party affiliation. Surprisingly, the positive average effect is the result of an increasing incumbency effect over time: the effect in wave 2 is about three times as large as the one in wave 1. We demonstrate this finding by comparing sets of politicians who have the same role in wave 1 (being both in government or both in opposition) but different roles in wave 2. There is no comparable effect when the two sets of politicians have a common role in wave 2, and a different one in wave 1.====We also show that the government-opposition asymmetry is reflected in the response of expectations to an unexpected change in the information environment. For this test, we make use of the arrival of almost 1 million refugees in Germany in 2015. The event serves as a natural experiment to study the impact of an information shock on compliance expectations. The magnitude of the arrival was largely unexpected and was at the time considered to initiate a significant negative fiscal shock with estimated additional government spending of 0.5 % of GDP in the following year (Independent Advisory Board of the Stability Council, 2015). We exploit the fact that during the second survey wave some states were randomly surveyed before and after the peak of the refugee arrival. We compare the expectations of politicians surveyed later with those earlier, and study whether differences depend on being a member of the governing coalition. We find that politicians were significantly more pessimistic when surveyed after the peak of the refugee arrival in 2015. Again, the effect appears to be mainly driven by members of opposition parties who adjusted their compliance expectations downwards, not by incumbents.====In the second part of our analysis, we provide a theoretical explanation for the novel empirical finding of a noticeable government-opposition divide in compliance expectations that is increasing over time. In our modelling assumptions on politicians' expectations we focus on election perspectives as an important driver of political motivation and take up insights from the literature on wishful thinking and overoptimism (Krizan and Windschitl 2009; Rabin 1998). Wishful thinking (‘desirability bias’) exists if the desire for a certain outcome inflates optimism about that outcome.==== A particular example of wishful thinking has been documented for voters' election forecasts. Voters tend to overestimate the winning chances of preferred parties or candidates (Meffert et al., 2011). Obviously, politicians' wishful thinking on election outcomes is closer to overconfidence than in the case of voters, as candidate effort in election campaigns influences the election outcome. Reflecting these insights from behavioral research, our model rests on two key assumptions: First, policymakers suffer from an optimism bias regarding their subjective election winning probability. The second assumption is that voters attribute the benefit of compliance (or the cost of non-compliance) with the fiscal rule not only on the current incumbent government, but to some extent also to its predecessor who is partially responsible for the later (non-)compliance. Under these assumptions, our model predicts a pattern of expectations that is consistent with our key empirical findings of a positive incumbency effect that is increasing over time.====Our paper contributes to the literature on fiscal rule effectiveness, in particular to that strand of the literature that focusses on expectations (e.g. reputation effects of fiscal rules on risk spreads, see Feld et al., 2017; Heinemann et al., 2014; Iara and Wolff 2014). A common feature of this literature is the aggregation of expectations at the level of the jurisdiction. In such a research design, it is not feasible to uncover heterogeneity of individual compliance expectations both in the cross-section and over time. Our micro-level panel data of compliance expectations allows us to investigate these areas in particular detail. Our interest in the formation of compliance expectations in the presence of fiscal shocks is related to Burret and Feld (2018) who find that Swiss cantons adjust quicker to revenue shortfalls or sudden spending increases if a fiscal rule is in place.====Heinemann et al. (2016) use a different question of the first wave of our survey to examine cross-sectional variation in compliance expectations of parliamentarians with regard to their own state as well as other states (with a binary answer option only). In the present study, we significantly extend this research using two survey waves in a panel structure to identify incumbency effects of compliance expectations from within-parliamentarian variation driven by exogenous changes in the composition of government coalitions. This allows us to account for parliamentarian specific factors via fixed effects. Moreover, observing compliance expectations over time, we are able to examine the dynamics of the incumbency effect. Another advantage of the panel structure is that we can exploit variation in fiscal fundamentals across both states and time. Finally, the second wave used in the present paper comprises an exogenous information shock with respect to the fiscal environment to which some parliamentarians were randomly exposed to.====We also contribute to the literature on political overoptimism that has studied biases in government growth, deficit and tax forecasts (Bischoff and Gohout 2010; Buettner and Kauder 2015; Heinemann 2006; Lehmann and Wollmershäuser 2020; Picchio and Santolini 2020). This literature has provided evidence that governments tend to produce over-optimistic economic and fiscal projections in order to convince voters about their positive performance, whereas finance ministers may use overly pessimistic forecasts as a strategy to promote consolidation (Chatagny 2015). Our theoretical analysis highlights the effect of such an optimism bias on politicians’ expectations with regard to compliance with a fiscal rule.====Furthermore, we expand the literature on partisanship. Differences between governments and oppositions have been emphasized in the literature on political competition (Alcañiz and Hellwig 2011; Heinkelmann-Wild and Zangl 2020). Opposition representatives denounce incumbents' performance in order to erode the credibility of those in power and commend oneself as the superior alternative in the next election (Hansson 2018). Government politicians defend themselves by emphasizing favorable indicators and trends and by developing strategies of blame avoidance (Weaver 1986) such as scapegoating external constraints (e.g. the European Union) for unpopular developments (Hobolt and Tilley 2014; Traber et al., 2020). The blame game is a result of voters’ inability to observe the causes of disputes. By contrast, the partisan divide in expectations with regard to fiscal rules in our theoretical and empirical analysis arises from the dynamics of elections, fiscal efforts, and reputation sharing.====Our theoretical analysis also complements existing literature on dynamic decision-making and political conflict. The temptation of a government to deviate from its previously determined optimal policy path was recognized in the seminal work by Kydland and Prescott (1977). In democracies, however, the identity of the incumbent government may change regularly and the achievement of long-term objectives such as compliance with a fiscal rule in the future thus rests on the persistence of policies across electoral cycles, complicating matters further. Nordhaus (1975) argues that election cycles may be a significant obstacle to achieving long-term policy goals. Tabellini and Alesina (1990) show theoretically that voter disagreement about the composition of government spending translates into excessive deficits when government majorities change over time.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide detailed information about the survey design and look at the descriptive evidence for compliance expectations. In Section 3, we consider the changes in the economic, fiscal and political environment. The econometric approach is described in Section 4 followed by the results Section 5. In Section 6 we describe the theoretical model that offers an explanation for our key empirical results.

Hence, misguided central bank decisions may trigger large costs (Orphanides and Williams, 2013).==== Preempting potential sources of error and ensuring the highest possible quality of monetary policy decisions in terms of achieving the chosen macroeconomic targets therefore constitute fundamental concerns in central bank design.==== In this paper, I update and extend existing surveys on the economics of monetary policy decision-making by focusing on two key determinants of the quality of monetary policy decisions: the process and the structure of monetary policy decision-making. I define the term “decision-making” to encompass both the deliberation phase and the actual decision-taking phase, including voting. Throughout the paper, I specifically concentrate on monetary policy decision-making ====, because governments around the world following current best practice endow expert groups, rather than individuals, with the power to take monetary policy decisions (Blinder, 2007).====The academic motivation for this paper is threefold. First, the wealth of novel contributions on monetary policy-making by committee over the last decade lends itself to an update of earlier surveys which were mostly written before 2010. Second, due to their dated nature, previous surveys faced a macroeconomic context which seems radically different from today’s environment shaped by the Global Financial Crisis, unconventional monetary policies and rising political pressure on central banks (Binder, 2021). Hence, today’s perspective may also shed a new light on previously surveyed studies. Third, several major central banks have recently committed to review their monetary policy strategy on a regular basis in the future (e.g. the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve). The present article takes stock of the most recent literature on monetary policy decision-making by committee with a view to informing these processes.====This paper also differs from the existing literature in several other respects. First, in contrast to previous studies by Blinder, 2004, Blinder, 2007 and Gerlach-Kristen (2006), the focus of this survey is not so much on the – by now well-known – rationale for monetary policy decision-making by committee ====.==== Instead, I concentrate on the (pre-)conditions under which this form of decision-making can work well, and on the risks as well as the trade-offs that arise once central banks have adopted this form of decision-making. I also update earlier work by Sibert (2006) by critically reviewing potential remedies for the pitfalls involved in committee decision-making. Second, although I draw on insights from the growing literature on central bank communication as summarized ==== in Blinder et al. (2008) and Siklos and Sturm (2013), I analyze the role of communication and transparency efforts not primarily as a tool related to the transmission mechanism and monetary policy effectiveness, but as a means for increasing decision-making quality. Hence, the paper constitutes an (non-exhaustive) attempt to bridge the latest advances from the literature on central bank communication on the one hand, and monetary policy decision-making on the other hand. Third, this survey aims at combining the theoretical perspective and a more empirically oriented practitioner’s view of the topic at hand. While the paper builds on work by Gerling et al. (2005) and others as a point of departure, its goal is to tie the more general theoretical literature on decision-making by committee to the empirical evidence from the specific field of monetary policy as it emerged over the last 20 years. For this purpose, I also complement existing surveys by providing an up-to-date discussion of the trade-offs involved in monetary policy decision-making by committee in the concrete case of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council. My case study of the ECB puts a spotlight on some more recent phenomena, such as open dissent and majority decision-taking, less well captured by the literature on the euro area so far.====While this paper’s explicit emphasis on monetary policy decisions ==== serves to harness the present survey of an already vast literature, I do not wish to convey the impression that other core competencies of modern central banks are isolated from the monetary policy-making process, and vice versa. On the contrary: decision-making committees of many modern central banks are involved in a wide range of topics including financial stability, macro- and microprudential supervision.==== In some cases, this reciprocal influence of central bank’s core monetary policy tasks and their other responsibilities is even institutionalized — for example, in the form of the creation of a specialized financial stability committee alongside the standard monetary policy committee.==== Moreover, this paper’s focus on monetary policy decisions ==== must not be interpreted to suggest that monetary policy decisions should, or even can, be treated in isolation from either fiscal and other re-distributive policies or politics more generally. Although I do not explicitly discuss concrete cases of political influence, I highlight several channels put forward in the relevant literature through which committee members could shape agendas and decisions by appealing to considerations which are not, or only less obviously, related to the technical realm of monetary policy and its pre-defined targets.====Even absent any direct political interference with the monetary policy deliberation phase or the decision-making process, the central bank’s success in achieving its macroeconomic targets ==== depends on the actions of other political stakeholders in the economy. For example, partisan fiscal policy and wage-bargaining always have the power to derail prices and real economic developments after politically independent monetary policy decisions are taken (Adolph, 2013). As a corollary, even a hypothetical, politically perfectly independent central bank cannot escape the sway of politics. The present survey will focus on the bargaining processes ==== to monetary policy decision-making, following an approach that could be described as a “micro-institutional” perspective. Yet, to form an encompassing picture of the intricacies of monetary policy decision-making, the micro perspective taken in this paper ultimately needs to be complemented by its “macro-institutional” counterpart. The collective decision-making games among institutions which shape eventual economic outcomes would warrant more attention in future surveys.====This paper mainly refers to the quality of monetary policy decisions narrowly conceived. Implicitly, I simply consider the quality of decision A as superior to decision B if the former does a better job in achieving the central bank’s macroeconomic targets. For the purpose of generality, the paper thus remains intentionally abstract when defining the term “higher quality decisions” in the context of monetary policy-making.==== It should be noted, however, that committee structures may also provide benefits that go beyond enhancing the central bank’s ability to take high quality decisions in terms of achieving its macroeconomic targets. Hence, this paper explicitly acknowledges that a committee decision-making structure could be defended on the basis of governance arguments which are perhaps not (exclusively) economic in nature, but can be crucial nevertheless.==== For example, accountability concerns related to geographic representation may constitute an important rationale for preferring committees over individual decision-makers in larger monetary zones.==== Similarly, committees featuring members from diverse social and educational backgrounds may foster the acceptance, credibility and longer-run independence of monetary policy decisions in the eyes of the wider public relative to a situation with a single policy-maker. Indeed, these “non-economic” arguments may gain in importance in the current “low-for-long” environment, in the context of rising populist pressures and lower public trust in central banks (Goodhart and Lastra, 2018, Agur, 2018, Masciandaro and Passarelli, 2020). While an encompassing discussion of these points awaits more research on the link between committee composition and these various non-economic outcomes, I touch upon some of these political economy aspects in my ECB case study below.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief recap by surveying an earlier literature on the advantages of decision-making by committees relative to single decision-makers. Section 3 introduces the core part of this paper. It delves into the trade-offs and risks which can arise if monetary policy is discussed and decided by committee. The section highlights how free-riding, groupthink and interactions between members may affect information production and information processing in the committee setting. It also discusses why decision-taking by committees can be fraught with inertia, and suffer from the negative consequences of informational cascades and strategic voting. In Section 4, this paper reviews potential remedies for the risks and trade-offs involved in monetary policy-making by committee. It analyses mitigating measures for free-riding, surveys innovations designed to preempt groupthink and looks at possible solutions to forestall cascading. Moreover, Section 4 explains why deliberative and voting transparency can constitute powerful – albeit sometimes costly – tools to address free-riding, moral hazard and groupthink by increasing the level of effort exerted by individual committee members.====Although the present paper draws on empirical insights from the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the ECB’s Governing Council, Sections 2 to 4 intentionally abstract from concrete cases where possible. They do so to provide a list of discussion elements relevant and necessary for a broad understanding of the main arguments in the recent literature. In contrast, Section 5 represents a case study of the current decision-making environment characterizing the ECB’s Governing Council. Rather than summarizing all procedural and institutional details,==== the aim of Section 5 is twofold. First, it contrasts the “conventional view” of how monetary policy is decided in the euro area with recent developments that are only partially reflected in the existing literature. Second, it discusses the potential challenges (including thoughts on possible solutions) the ECB’s Governing Council is likely to face going forward, given its current institutional design. Section 6 briefly concludes by summarizing the main points of this paper. It also condenses some initial ideas for future research on monetary policy-making as practiced by the ECB’s Governing Council.","Monetary policy decision-making by committee: Why, when and how it can work",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626802100080X,5 August 2021,2021,Research Article,124.0

The flows are analyzed by a literature of about 600 papers, with a wide range of results reported.==== This paper deals with the aid allocation literature, the AAL, which looks at three main motives for allocating aid: donor interests, recipient economic development, and recipient behavior, especially human rights and democracy.

In most of the conflicts in the world, at least one of the sides and their US ‘lobby’ wants the US to do something. In addition, people around the world often have strong positive or negative feelings towards the US. Even if the US gave aid out of pure altruism, many people would still think that the aid was due to self-interests, so we are dealing with a complex and controversial field.====A recurrent theme in the literature is that the two political parties in the US may support different mixtures of the three aid giving motives. While it is easy to theorize about the preferred mixture, it is less easy to find a clear empirical pattern. The difference between individual administrations may be larger than the difference between the two parties. In addition, the international political situation is ever changing, notably during the realignment of countries after the Cold War, and during the War on Terrorism. Furthermore, most recipient countries have mixed political systems that allow different assessments of their level of democracy. This allows US-decision makers some leeway of judgment that enables partisan preferences to play a role.====One case is the US aid to the continent of Latin America, where substantial economic volatility has been driven by populism fueled by nationalism that often sees ‘Gringo Imperialism’ as a main problem. This has led to the claim that the USA supports right-wing dictators in Latin America.==== At the same time, the Hispanic population in the USA has grown to 60 million.==== Thus, it is emotional and politically important what motivates US aid to Latin America, and researchers do find different results.====Another equally controversial, but different, case is the war-ridden region of the Middle East, where the USA has fought several wars, and been close to others fought between regional combatants. Aid to this region has often been used to buy peace, with some, but not great, success. Here the US seems to reward peace more than democracy and human rights.====Our literature search identified 58 empirical studies with 284 estimates of the importance for US aid of democracy or human rights (see details below). The reported results scatter over a wide range. The models used to untangle the motives are also rather different, and so is the econometric sophistication applied. We apply meta-regression analysis which is well-suited to making sense of this heterogeneity in reported findings. Recent meta-analyses include: Alptekin and Levine (2012), Colagrossi et al. (2020), Heimberger (2020), Heimberger (2021), and Philips (2016).====The following section discusses some of the theoretical issues.

Second, how much does the choice of the econometric model matter for the results?

One of these factors is Hawala, a vast informal funds transfer system providing speedy, untraceable funding and money laundering for global terrorism. This issue is quite relevant given the rise of terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State, with vast and difficult to track cash earnings.====We also quantify how specific changes in one country may affect the extent of terrorism in that country and how it spills over neighboring countries. Somewhat surprisingly, our results suggest that these terrorist ==== are positive in some cases, while in others, they are negative.","In this paper, we specify a spatial model which describes fundamental factors which lead to terrorism, as well as to spill-overs of terrorism between countries. One of these fundamental factors is Hawala, which is an illicit system of informal funds transfers. The practical working of the Hawala system is outlined in the appendix. This factor is important given the rise of terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State, which has vast and difficult to track cash earnings (Laskmanan and DiPaola, 2014). Hawala is also a traditional informal funds transfer system that provides speedy, easy, and untraceable financing and money laundering conduits for global terrorism (Looney, 2003, 2005; Jost and Sandhu, 2000; El Qorchi et al., 2003; Schramm and Taube, 2003).====Tracking funding sources of terrorism has always been a challenge. It is the lack of data and a paper trail that makes Hawala attractive to terror groups. The benefits of understanding links created by the flow of funds into terrorist groups and how this may influence unrest in a region could prove invaluable in saving civilian and military lives.====Hawala thrives in countries with under-developed financial markets (Jost and Sandhu, 2000; Looney, 2003). These countries regularly use the Hawala system to transfer funds within family and friends or in market transactions. Our unique approach is to leverage this information by tracing the Hawala system in a region through its financial development. We use theoretical results from our research in the field of spatial econometrics (Kelejian and Mukerji, 2011) to create maps of terrorism spill-overs, through Hawala networks, across regions.====In our paper, we account for the effects of Hawala in terms of its consequences. For example, ====, countries with low levels of financial development, as measured by the private sector credit to GDP ratio, are more likely to have a well-developed Hawala network. In these cases, terrorist groups can more easily transfer needed funds to carry out attacks. In our modeling, we account for this in two ways. First, we use a private debt to GDP ratio variable as one of the regressors in our model. Secondly, we construct links between all of the countries in our sample based upon the extent of their financial development. Among other things, these links are such that the strongest Hawala connections between countries are when they both have low levels of financial development. Our calculations of spillover effects are based upon these links, which are not symmetric between countries. We also describe how a terrorist attack on one country emanates out to other countries, as would the waters in a calm lake ripple out when a pebble is tossed into the lake. In addition, we describe the impact of Hawala funding on international stability and security by ranking countries in terms of their potential to spread terrorism to other countries.====Our results illustrate the complex nature of global connections through illegal funds transfers. For example, we find that as Hawala links grow weaker due to rising financial development in Iran, our model predicts that there will be greater terrorism spillovers from Iran into the neighboring countries of Israel and Jordan and some more distant countries as Pakistan and Bangladesh. On the other hand, our model indicates that terrorism spill-overs from Iran to several countries in Europe and Latin America would decline.====This study will also provide a basis for weighing the potential impact and policy implications of financial innovation, such as digital currencies and mobile money, which increase the coverage of formal financial systems to larger parts of the population and transactions. Interestingly their impact can go either way since these financial innovations are attractive due to low costs and ease of conducting transactions. There is a potential that these financial innovations will make informal funds transfers through the Hawala system much less attractive and eventually render it obsolete in countries that adopt digital currencies and develop mobile money. However, it is equally conceivable that digital currencies could complement and add a low-cost additional layer of security/anonymity if funds transfers occur within the Hawala system via digital currencies.","Causal factors of terrorist attacks on countries, and corresponding spill-overs between them",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000811,5 August 2021,2021,Research Article,126.0

Most separatist movements overlap with violent ethnic tensions and are associated with economically destructive outcomes. In this paper, we consider a (largely) peaceful separatist movement. Specifically, we use the synthetic control method to study the economic consequences of the surprising victory of the Parti Québécois in Quebec in 1976 and the subsequent referendum on Quebec's independence in 1980. We find that, relative to our control, the election of separatists had a small positive effect on economic activity until 1980 after which a small negative effect appears. We find similar results following the 1994 election that returned the Parti Québécois to power. We further find that the size of the provincial government (relative to GDP) constantly and significantly exceeded the counterfactual. We argue that the economic costs of separatist movements may arise from the frequently associated violence and not be intrinsic to any sort of attempted political disintegration.","Is separatism costly? The political disintegrations desired by separatist movements are often deemed detrimental to economic growth (Alesina et al., 1996; Alesina and Perotti, 1996). Even when these movements are unsuccessful, they are seen as generating political instability that slows down growth. However, separatist movements often (but not always) rely on violent means to achieve separation (Fearon 2004). As such, violence could be driving up the costs of separatism rather than political disintegration (or the threat thereof).====In this paper, we ask whether a peaceful separatist party (even if it is ultimately unsuccessful in securing independence) generates the same economic costs. Using the case of Canada's second largest province, Quebec, which is home to the vast majority of Canada's French-speaking minority and a peaceful separatist movement, we argue that the role of violence is underappreciated.====We use the method of synthetic control to assess the effect of the separatist party, the Parti Québécois (PQ), being elected in 1976 and 1994. We find that its 1976 electoral victory had a small positive effect (4 %) on economic activity until 1980 after which a small negative effect (3 %) appears so that the net effect appears to be zero. The 1994 electoral victory is associated with no statistically significant differences between the counterfactual and the actual level of income per capita in the years after the election. We also investigate the possibility that Quebec separatism dragged down Canada as a whole in terms of GDP per capita. We find that the counterfactual scenario following the first electoral victory of the PQ do not significantly differ from the actual levels of per capita income in a statistically significant manner. Thus, it appears that Quebec's separatist movement had no lasting and significant effect on economic activity.====This is instructive as to the role of violence to the costliness of political disintegrations. Quebec's separatist movement, while peaceful after 1970, was unsuccessful as both referenda on state independence, in 1980 and 1995, had voters opt to remain within Canada. Separatist movements who embraced violence but who were, like Quebec, unsuccessful in achieving independence generated large negative effects on economic activity. Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), who also use synthetic control, found that the violent Basque separatist movement reduced GDP by 10 %. Similarly, Bilgel and Burhan (2017a, 2017b) found that the provinces of Eastern and Southern Eastern Anatolia, where Kurdish separatist terrorism is most prevalent, experienced around a 7 % reduction in per capita income relative to a counterfactual based on the rest of Turkey while the country as a whole experienced a 21.6 % reduction in per capita income relative to a counterfactual scenario based on other countries. Tibetan separatist unrest between 1987 and 1989 and the Chinese's government forceful responses reduced GDP per capita by 27 % relative to its synthetic control (Sun and Yu, 2020). In contrast, the equally unsuccessful Quebec separatists yielded no lasting economic consequences.==== This suggests that violence could be underappreciated in terms of its importance in determining the costs of disintegrations.====In the process, we also generate findings of relevance to Canadian economists and policymakers who have attempted to grapple with the economic costs of separation. The rapid rise of the separatist movement in Quebec, some argue, generated important economic uncertainty that deterred economic growth.==== Surprisingly, there are very few studies regarding the extent of the economic consequences from the rise of separatism in Quebec. Most of those that do are concerned with yields and prices of government bonds or they employ OLS strategies relying on the ratio of Quebec to Ontario incomes per capita. One reason for this is that it is hard to draw a counterfactual scenario of Quebec's economic growth “without separatism”. The method of synthetic control that we use is ideally suited for robustly answering this question. Developed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010; 2015), this method uses a donor pool of areas that fail to receive a treatment (in our case this would be the first separatist government elected in 1976) during the pre-treatment period to generate a “synthetic” measure of what the treated unit would have looked based absent the treatment. Any difference between the synthetic and the observed measures in the post-treatment era can thus be attributed to the effect of the treatment.====As such, our findings provide the first causal estimation of Quebec's separatist movement on economic activity. We also extend our approach to the size of government in order to see if Quebec separatists permanently grew government.==== We find that they did after the 1976 victory but not after the 1994 victory. This finding regarding the size of government is suggestive of a political business cycle that helps why our GDP per capita counterfactual from 1980 to 1985 shows a reversal of the modest gains in GDP per capita from 1976 to 1980. We also replicated our results, in appendix, for Canada as a whole to see if the Quebec separatist victory in 1976 dragged the entire Canadian economy.====We organize our paper as follows.

We contribute to the growing research by examining the hypothesis in which capital rents are the underlying cause of income inequality resulting from financial openness, through changing the relative market power of capital and financial market structure, which affects investment activities. We find that i) in a closed economy, income inequality rises as capital rents decrease; ii) in a ","The early 1980s is viewed as a watershed period in the orientation of the world economy and financial markets. The failure of legitimacy experienced by Keynesian economic solutions and the installation of the neoliberal policy model led to massive economic mobilisation. Financial openness reforms were promoted by subsequent developments (Mckinnon, 1973; Shaw, 1973; Harvey, 2005). Such reforms are now regarded as essential for an economy, as they are known to promote competition, investment, and economic growth (De Haan and Sturm, 2000).====However, considerable empirical evidence demonstrates an increase in inequality in many countries across the development spectrum in recent years. The negative effects of rising income inequality include reductions in the pace of economic growth stemming from a decline in the marginal propensity to consumption and the accumulation of financial capital (Atkinson and Piketty, 2007, 2009; Piketty, 2014; Atkinson, 2015) as well as relevant socioeconomic effects in terms of unequal opportunities (Franzini and Pianta 2015; Ramos and Van de Gaer, 2012). In addition, a high level of income inequality has been shown to reduce overall happiness (Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Ramos, 2014). Rising awareness of negative economic and societal consequences has drawn attention to investigate the effects of financial openness on income inequality, as reducing income inequality poses one of the greatest challenges for economists and policymakers.====Most contemporary studies seeking to identify the impacts of financial liberalisation on income inequality and the main channels involved start with a focus on capital rent and wage remuneration (Aghion et al., 1999; Piketty and Saez, 2003). Financial reforms and neoliberalism have contributed to a fall in the labour share and sharply increased capital rents, mainly through changes in the balance of power between capital and labour (Stockhammer, 2015; Brueckner, 2017; Barradas, 2019). Capital rents have a central influence on income inequality, particularly when rents and a system of accumulation dominated by financial interests have become the most common form of gauging social value (Andreucci et al., 2017; Purcell et al., 2019). As a theory of inequality, capital rents can be contrasted with an alternative, which can be called the “poverty trap”.====What is the effect of financial reforms on capital rents? How do financial openness reforms affect income inequality through capital rents? What roles do institutional quality and technology play? To answer these questions and endeavor to resolve some existing disputes, this paper constructs a dynamic overlapping generations model with the objective facts of imperfectly competitive financial markets based on institutional analysis and rent theories. The model demonstrates that capital rents are the underlying cause of the effect of financial openness on income inequality, and financial reforms alter capital rents and domestic income inequality by affecting the relative market power of capital and financial market structure, which influences investment activities. This study reveals that income inequality increases as the capital rents of entrepreneurs decrease in a closed economy, while income inequality decreases when the ratio of the capital rents of each entrepreneur and investor increases in a small open economy.====Moreover, financial reforms exert differing impacts on capital rents and income inequality in creditor and debtor economies, which are determined by the direction of capital flows. Subsequently, countries with less developed economies are shown to benefit more from financial reforms, in terms of both economic development and income equality. More specifically, our findings indicate that financial openness raises the unit capital rents of investors through deregulation, which improves capital production efficiency and capital market power but increases income inequality.====Finally, our results are mixed regarding the intensity of technological change. Technological changes lead to a rise in capital rents and, consequently, a fall in income inequality in highly developed economies. Financial openness can amplify the effect of technological change on income inequality. The ultimate effect is determined by a comparison of the effect of technological change on factor productivity and the crowding out effect of innovation costs on the economy.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature. Section 3 constructs an overlapping generations model under an imperfect financial market. In Section 4, we separately assess the distribution of income in a closed economy and in a small open economy to explain the main channels by which inequality emerges among agents. Section 5 describes the dynamics of the simulations of the equilibrium model on economies. We draw our conclusions in the final section. Equilibrium model derivations and equations of second-order importance are presented in the Appendix.","Financial openness, capital rents and income inequality",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000677,17 July 2021,2021,Research Article,128.0

In this paper, we offer an empirical test of a popular idea that authoritarian governments use elections to engineer overwhelming victories with electoral fraud thus deterring potential opposition from challenging the regime. Using the data from the Russian Parliamentary elections in 2011 and a regionally representative public opinion survey, we find that the geographical allocation of electoral manipulation was the opposite of what the theory would imply: more manipulation happened in the areas where the regime was more popular. We also find that higher margins of victory for a pro-regime party failed to deter subsequent mass protests. We argue that these empirical patterns could be better explained by other mechanisms, such as ==== persuasion, efficient allocation, and information gathering.","Many authoritarian countries today have institutions that are commonly associated with democratic governments: multiple parties, parliaments, and elections.==== Elections in autocracies are highly unfair to the opposition: it is outspent, harassed by the authorities, and often lacks access to media and other resources. The results of the elections themselves are also manipulated even though, given all the other restrictions, pro-regime politicians can often win without electoral manipulations (Simpser, 2013, Rundlett and Svolik, 2016).====What role does electoral manipulation play in nondemocracies? Scholars often argue that the regime needs overwhelming victories – often helped by outright manipulation of results – to convey its strength. According to Simpser (2013, p. xv): “...Manipulating elections excessively and blatantly can make the manipulating party appear strong, while failing to manipulate in this manner can convey weakness”. Relatedly, Magaloni (2006, p. 46) writes, describing Mexico under the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI): “Ballot stuffing ... was intended to create a signal to elites that defection would be punished and that there was no hope in defying the party because it would use everything at its disposal, including fraud and force, to prevent opponents from winning”. Such manipulations are used to achieve supermajorities, because, as Geddes (2005) points out, “High turnout and supermajoritarian election outcomes signal that citizens remain acquiescent”.====In this logic, because only regimes with high capacity to reward loyalists and punish dissenters are able to organize a widespread effective electoral manipulation, such manipulation is interpreted by regime’s audiences (people, bureaucracy, potential defectors within the elite, or powerful stakeholders within civil society) as evidence of its invincibility. In this sense, a high level of electoral manipulation ==== strength: strong regimes are able to demonstrate their high capacity in a way that weak regimes are unable to emulate.====While this family of ideas (hereafter, the intimidation theory) is prominent in the literature, the empirical evidence in favor of them remains thin. It has been demonstrated that authoritarian survival is correlated with the existence of quasi-democratic institutions (Geddes, 2005) and with electoral fraud (Simpser, 2013). However, there is no empirical evidence that authoritarian regimes implement electoral manipulations because they want to signal their strength to their population. Most importantly, current literature is silent on two critical questions that have to be answered to test the empirical validity of this theory. First, do regimes try to engineer – through electoral manipulations – higher margins of victory when the perceived threat is higher? Second, do higher margins of victory deter subsequent political contestation?====Our paper answers these two questions in the context of Russian Parliamentary elections. The intimidation theory would predict that voter fraud happens in places where it is costly to conduct — otherwise, even a weak regime will be able to implement it, and no signaling goal will be achieved. In addition, conditional on the popularity of the regime, electoral fraud should deter post-election protests. The Russian institutional setting and unique combination of electoral and protest data allow us to reject the intimidation theory and provide evidence in favor of alternative theories.====First, we estimate the region-level amount of electoral manipulation in Russia in the 2011 Parliamentary election as a function of the pre-election protest sentiments (measured by a regionally representative survey and by actual incidences of public protests). We find that the relationship between electoral manipulation and protest sentiments is the ==== of that which would be consistent with the intimidation theory. While the intimidation theory implies a positive relationship between the protest sentiments and the electoral manipulation, we find the relationship to be negative. This relationship holds regardless of the measurement of electoral manipulation, the inclusion of controls (urbanization, regional autonomy, various socioeconomic indicators, ethnic republics, etc.), and the measurements of protest sentiments (survey-based measures or actual pre-electoral protest behavior).====Second, we look at whether higher margins of victory for the winning party deter future protests (conditional on the support for the regime and the amount of electoral manipulation). If the intimidation theory is empirically relevant, we would expect fewer protests in places with higher margins of victory. However, we find no discernible relationship between higher margins of victory for the ruling party and post-election protests.====We use the case of Russia for several reasons. First, Russia’s political regime is classified as competitive authoritarianism. It regularly conducts elections, but de facto rules in those elections are unfair to the opposition: it is outspent, faces various administrative obstacles, and lacks access to major state-controlled media outlets. Still, the opposition is often able to run political campaigns and mobilize its audiences. So, we would expect the intimidation theory to apply to Russia based on its regime type.====If the intimidation theory does not explain the pattern of electoral manipulation, then what does? Our results are consistent with three other related theories: (i) the Bayesian persuasion theory, (ii) the efficient allocation theory, and (iii) the information-gathering theory. The Bayesian persuasion theory (elaborated in Gehlbach and Simpser, 2015, Little, 2015, Rozenas, 2016, and Egorov and Sonin, 2021) states that given the uncertainties involved in the process, even if the audiences are rational and understand that the government can implement manipulation, government can still improve the perception of its popularity by producing electoral manipulations.==== The efficient allocation theory is a simple idea that given the need to show supermajorities, the fraud will happen where it is easier to conduct. Finally, the information-gathering theory is a direct corollary of a view that authoritarian governments use elections to collect data on the locations of the loyalists and the dissidents as well as on the performance of local officials (Gandhi and Lust-Okar, 2009).==== If election results reveal that information, then they should stay relatively clean of manipulation in places with high ex-ante uncertainty. In principle, the observed negative association can be compatible with any of these theories (or all of them since they do not contradict each other).====Because electoral manipulation is a covert activity, measuring it can be challenging. For our empirical evaluation, we rely on a set of statistical “fingerprints” of electoral manipulation calculated using precinct-level data. None of those indicators is conclusive by itself but, taken together, they elucidate the geographical distribution of electoral manipulation. We use indicators based on (i) the prevalence of integer proportions in turnout and vote proportions for the main pro-regime party (Rozenas, 2017); (ii) a model-based approach that distinguishes between incremental fraud and extreme fraud (Klimek et al., 2012, Mebane, 2016); (iii) deviations of the distributions of digits per Benford’s Law (Kalinin and Mebane, 2011); (iv) share of precincts where voter turnout is larger than 90% for an additional suggestive measure of electoral manipulation. For our baseline specification, we use the first principal component from the PCA decomposition of the indicators, but we also demonstrate that our result – the substantive and statistically significant negative correlation between the perceptions of discontent and indicators electoral manipulation – does not depend on which of the methods we use. We also confirm that our results remain the same if we use a measure of workplace mobilization as a dependent variable.====Our main contention is that our results are inconsistent with the intimidation theory but can be consistent with Bayesian persuasion, efficient allocation, or information gathering. The main challenge to our interpretation of the results is that they might capture not the regime’s desire to manipulate elections, but the actual outcome of the manipulation that could be contaminated by other factors. For example, one might argue that the intimidation considerations would drive the allocation of the desired levels of the manipulations, but because it is harder to manipulate in the areas where many people are against the regime, the allocation of actual manipulation turns out to be the opposite of what the regime wants. To address this concern, we control for the actual popularity of the regime, measurements of social capital, and the presence of electoral observers.====One of the potential alternative explanations is that regimes tries to signal strength, but its actions get distorted because, as Rundlett and Svolik (2016) demonstrated, field agents of manipulations are likely to be overzealous if the government is popular.==== We address this explanation by controlling for the regime’s popularity. It is also possible that field agents come from the same population as people in a regionally representative survey, they might share the same grievances as the general population and thus can be more reluctant to implement manipulation. Hence, we control for the wages of those agents (teachers and administrative personnel) as a way to capture their potential grievances as well as potential rewards from the regime. Inclusion of these controls; however, does not substantially change the estimates of the effect of perceptions of discontent. We also show that our results are not driven by pre-election day manipulations.====We see the main contribution of our paper in applying a theory-motivated empirical test that can probe one of the major theories of electoral manipulation in autocracies. We also believe that such test is informative for a broader question on the role of elections in autocracies. Our results show that achieving supermajorities by demonstrating the muscles through manipulations might not be the best explanation for their use. The role of elections might be better explained by other theories.====Our paper is also relevant to the literature on the determinants and motivations of electoral fraud. In particular, Chaves et al. (2015) theorize about a trade-off between public good provision and incumbent’s survival through electoral manipulation. Rundlett and Svolik (2016) offer a model, based on a global game, where field agents, implementing electoral fraud are more likely to engage in electoral manipulation if they know that the regime is more popular and that they are less likely to be punished. We complement this approach by exploring if electoral fraud can be a explained by an attempt of the regime to signal high capacity. Our findings are also consistent with Rozenas (2016), who shows, using cross-country panel data, that relatively clean elections are likely to follow the events of crises interpreted as events when an incumbent is weak. Looking at the regional data from one country we show that relatively clean elections happen in places with high levels of discontent. The strength of Rozenas (2016) is that he is able to use the panel structure of the data. The strength of our analysis is that we (i) conduct regional analysis with the country-level institutions and cultural factors being fixed, (ii) use a set of behavioral measures to quantify discontent (survey responses and actual protests), and (iii) test whether electoral manipulations are related to post-election protests.====Our results also pertain to the theory of “informational autocracy” (Guriev and Treisman, 2015, Guriev and Treisman, 2019), which postulates that modern authoritarian regimes survive not by mass repressions, but by controlling information flows and selective cooptation. Our results also contribute to the literature on the role of electoral fraud in autocracies. Gehlbach and Simpser (2015) offer a theory that incumbents manipulate elections to signal their strength to the bureaucracy, while Luo and Rozenas (2018) offer a theory of a trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post election rigging.==== Literature on authoritarian backsliding (Nalepa et al., 2018, Svolik, 2020) emphasizes that political polarization allows incumbents to subvert democratic procedures. Consistently with these findings, our paper explores a role of heterogeneity of political preferences in the strategic allocation of electoral manipulation.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the context of our study: the 2011 Russian parliamentary elections.

We examine the upstream effects of this downstream quota on female political participation at the state and national level. Our results show that the introduction of the quota had significant positive impacts on the political participation of women both at the national and the state level, though the patterns of effects are quite different. Our results indicate that different mechanisms are driving more women running for office at the national and state levels.","While the second half of the 20th century has witnessed an increased presence of women in leadership positions, the raw numbers present a disturbing picture, with women continuing to be severely under-represented.==== When given the opportunity, women leaders often make different policy decisions. For example, firms with a greater proportion of women on their boards are less likely to enact policies that result in workforce reductions even at the cost of reduced short run profits (Adams and Ferreira, 2009, Ahern and Dittmar, 2012, Matsa and Miller, 2013, Eckbo et al., 2019, Bertrand et al., 2019). Female leaders are more likely to prioritize spending on vulnerable sections of the population including women in both developed and developing countries (Lott and Kenny, 1999, Edlund and Pande, 2001, Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004, Pande and Ford, 2012, De Paola et al., 2014, Braga and Scervini, 2017). Increasing the level of representation of historically under-represented groups, including women, is therefore not only a moral imperative, but has the potential for substantial economic and social benefits. The preferred approach across the world has been to use affirmative action policies for women (that has taken the form of quotas or reservation of seats for women) in leadership positions.====This paper examines the potential upstream effects of a downstream quota in an environment where there are no quotas for women at the upper level. Using a gender based affirmative action policy enacted in India in 1993, where quotas were introduced for women at lower levels of the political hierarchy (rural local government), but not at higher levels, we examine the impacts of this policy on political engagement of women in spheres not directly affected by the policy. We conduct a panel analysis at the state-constituency level that allows us to exploit the variation in state-level timing in the introduction of reservations for women in rural local governments. We find that in national parliamentary (or ====) elections, assuming a linear exposure effect, on average, 10 years of exposure to local-level reservations results in a 5 percentage point (or 143%) increase in the proportion of candidates that are women. In the state legislative assembly (or ====) elections, while there was a jump in the proportion of candidates that are female at the time of the introduction of the affirmative action policy, there has been no significant change over time that can be attributed to the local-level reservation policies. The jump was also quite large: on average the proportion of female candidates is higher by 1 percentage point (32%) over the pre-reservation mean. These findings are consistent with the expected timing of upstream spillover effects: if, as one would expect, women move up the political hierarchy, female reservations for local government should first affect state elections then only later have substantial effects at the national level. There is also a detectable effect of female reservations on women winning elections, at least in the state assembly elections.====The 73rd Constitutional Amendment of India, signed into law in April 1993, introduced and legislated a uniform structure of local governance in the rural areas across the country.==== This amendment established a pyramid structure of rural local governance with the village council or the ==== (henceforth GP) being at the bottom of the pyramid. The other two levels of the pyramid were the ==== (association of village councils, i.e. sub-district council) and the ==== (district council).====The 73rd amendment to the Indian constitution specifies that each village in India is to be governed by a village council (or GP). Members of the GP are to be democratically elected with local government (Panchayati Raj or PR) elections being held every five years. Through this amendment, the Indian government also introduced reservations for disadvantaged groups including women. Specifically in each village council, at least one-third of the councillor positions were to be reserved for women (in these reserved seats or wards only women could stand as candidates, both men and women would vote). Across all GPs in the state, at least one-third of the head of the village council would be women. Similar patterns of reservation were introduced for sub-district and district level councils, which formed the other two layers in the PR system. Higher levels of legislature (national parliament and state assemblies) were exempt from such a gender based quota.====Concurrent with gender based reservation, a specific proportion of seats were also reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), the two most disadvantaged population groups in the country. Over time reservations were also introduced (at the PR level) to Other Backward Classes (or OBCs). The proportion of seats reserved for SCs, STs and OBCs depended on the relevant proportion of these groups in the district. The caste based reservations were orthogonal to gender based reservations. So in local government elections, seats could be categorized into the following groups: Open for all caste and gender; Open for all caste but reserved for women; SC Reserved; Female SC Reserved; ST Reserved; Female ST Reserved; OBC Reserved; Female OBC Reserved. Again higher levels of legislature (national and state) were exempt from OBC reservations, though seats have been reserved for SCs and STs in both national and state elections, since the early 1950s.====
      ====The states had the responsibility of implementing the constitutional amendment, which meant it was not implemented uniformly and at the same time across India. Part of this variation was due to some states already having reservations for women and other states challenged the law in court or for other reasons, such as particularly bad monsoons, that delayed implementation. Section 2 presents more details on differences in implementation across states. This variation in the timing of the first post-1993 Panchayat election led to considerable differences in the cumulative exposure to reservations across different states. We use the plausibly exogenous differences in the timing of the implementation of the local-level female reservation policy to test whether the presence and length of exposure to these reforms had any effect on upstream election participation and outcomes. Our empirical strategy follows Iyer et al., 2012, Ghani et al., 2014 and Kalsi (2017) and uses differences in the timing of the implementation of reservations across Indian states to obtain causal effects of the impact of affirmative action policies on political participation of women higher up the ladder.====The effects of this gender based affirmative action policy on local-level outcomes in India have been well studied. There is considerable evidence that female politicians have beneficial effects on the society as a whole. These include increased government spending on female friendly investments (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004), more reporting of crimes (Iyer et al., 2012), a reduction in the adolescent gender gap in aspirations (Beaman et al., 2012), improved voters’ perceptions about female candidates (Beaman et al., 2009), increases in the number of new women owned establishments (Ghani et al., 2014), increases in the number of births in government and private health facilities and lower child mortality rates (Kumar and Prakash, 2017) and an increase in the survival of higher order girls (Kalsi, 2017).==== The effects are, however, temporally non-monotonic. Deininger et al. (2015) find that in the short-term, residents of reserved constituencies have a more negative view of the quality of the head of the village council (or the Pradhan) and the value of public goods. However, in the longer term they find that these constituencies have higher female political participation and feel that they are better able to hold their leaders accountable. Field experiments in India by Gangadharan et al. (2016) show that there may be an initial backlash by males in response to female Pradhans, but this decreases over time.====How influential has this policy been in encouraging women to participate in politics? Banerjee et al. (2013) investigate the 2010 village council elections in Rajasthan and find that incumbent women from the previous election had a low probability of running in 2010 if their seats were not reserved for women that cycle. These findings are in contrast to Bhavnani (2009), who analyzes what happened to female incumbents in Mumbai after their reservations ended and finds that they are substantially more likely to win than if the seat had previously been reserved for a woman. Maitra (2020), using data from the universe of wards in GPs in West Bengal shows that while more women are likely to run for election in seats that were previously reserved for women, the magnitude of the effects are modest. O’Connell (2018) finds that female reservations in India increase the number of women running for office at the state and national level.====Evidence from developed countries on the effect of gender quotas on female political engagement is mixed. O’Brien and Rickne (2016) examine the effects of the 50–50 quota imposed by the national board of the Swedish Social Democratic Party’s municipal branches on women’s selection to, and survival in, top political posts. They find that the quota increased the number of women perceived as qualified for higher positions and argue that quotas can accelerate women’s representation in leadership positions. Bagues and Campa (2020) examine short- and medium-term effects of gender quotas in candidate lists using evidence from local elections in Spain. They find that quotas increased the share of women in candidate lists; though over three rounds of elections, there is no evidence of an increase in the probability that women reach powerful positions such as party leader or mayor. They argue that quotas in the lower level of the organizational hierarchy (in this case quotas in candidate lists) are unable to remove the barriers that prevent women from playing an influential role in politics. Lassébie (2020) using data from France obtains a similar result. She finds that a gender quota law resulted in an increase in the share of female candidates and the share of female elected politicians, but there is limited evidence of women being promoted to leadership positions despite the gender quotas having been in place for more than a decade. Lassébie (2020) argues that this is primarily driven by the fact that women are more likely to resign and leave politics than men. De Paola et al. (2010) examine the effects of the gender quota in place in municipal elections in Italy between 1993 and 1995 and find that women’s representation in politics after the reform increased significantly more in municipalities that were affected by the reform than in municipalities that were not affected (this that did not actually have an election during the period the gender quota was in place). Using data from the same reform, Baltrunaite et al. (2014) show that quotas lead to better quality of politicians (both men and women) being elected to office, which naturally has positive effects on the quality of debates and design of policy.====There is now a broader literature on how the presence of elected female legislators affects the political engagement of women. Bhalotra et al. (2017) examine state elections in India, where there are no reservations for women, and find that incumbent women are more likely to run again. In addition, they find that in constituencies with a female incumbent, other women are less likely to run in the next election. Ladam et al. (2018), using data from the US, find that high-profile women exert substantial and positive effects on female candidates and conclude that women in major offices are crucial for women’s representation. Brown et al. (2017) find that in India, the more state-level female winners, the greater the number of female national-level candidates. Results from other countries is mixed. Brollo and Troiano (2016) using data from mayoral elections in Brazil find that while the election of female mayors leads to better outcomes, they are less likely to be re-elected than their male counterparts. Ferreira and Gyourko (2014) using data from US mayoral elections find that the election of female mayors has very little effect on outcomes as they do not implement different policies. More importantly they do not find any evidence of political spill-overs: in particular, electing a female mayor does not change the long run political success of other female mayoral candidates in the same city or of female candidates in local congressional elections. All these papers used a regression discontinuity design to address the issue of endogeneity of female candidacy and reservations for women had no role to play.====Our research is complementary to that of O’Connell (2018), who also finds that the female reservations in India increase the number of women running for office at the state and national level. Although the general research question is similar, the empirical approach is very different: his estimation strategy and sample frame differ from that of ours in several ways. First, O’Connell (2018) uses variation within a sample of ten states based on the timing of district-level reservations, comparing districts with and without a reserved district-level female chairperson. Recall that the 73rd amendment established a three-tiered local governance structure, with representation at the village, sub-district, and district levels. All three levels reserve a minimum of one-third of seats and chairpersons for women. We, instead, focus on the timing of the introduction of female reservations for local governance in general as we believe that the timing of reservations for a state as a whole better reflects exposure to female representation in government. For example, within districts without a female district chairperson, on average (at least) a third of the villages would have been affected by female reservations for village council chairpersons (and more would have been affected if one includes sub-district reservations). Moreover, one-third of ==== seats at every level were reserved for women. Thus, focusing only on the district-level reservations might miss any effects from (and may be biased by) reservations at the two lower levels of rural local government. Second, we explore the effects of reservations on the full sample of national and state elections starting from the 1970s until constituency boundary changes in 2008 (through the Delimitation Commission), allowing us to take into account time-trends in political changes across India and can examine, for example, pre-trends and control for lagged effects. Hence we are able to provide evidence on longer time patterns. In contrast, O’Connell (2018) only examines the most recent elections prior to 2008 for state elections and the 2009 Lok Sabha election. O’Connell (2018), however, goes one step beyond the scope of our analysis by algorithmically tracking specific candidates over time and finds that women are moving up the political ladder: from local government to state government and from state government to national government. Our analysis, on the other hand, estimates the aggregate upstream effects of the 73rd amendment across India and the changes in these effects over time. That our results are consistent with each other with very different approaches is of great value to getting at a true understanding of the spillover effects of increased female political representation.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Tamai Toshiki,"Graduate School of Economics, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8601, Japan","Received 3 August 2020, Revised 27 April 2021, Accepted 21 June 2021, Available online 1 July 2021, Version of Record 25 February 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102068,Cited by (5),This study examines the government policy of public goods provision and its effects on economic growth and welfare under intergenerational ,"This study examines the government policy of public good provision, economic growth, and social welfare under intergenerational altruism. The formal analysis of public goods originated from Samuelson (1954), who derived the optimal rule of public goods supply. In the static model, the Samuelson rule requires that the sum of marginal rates of substitutions (MRS) between the public and private goods must be equal to the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) between the two goods.==== Numerous studies have examined the optimal rule, and the dynamically extended Samuelson rule is also along with its original one under certain conditions (e.g., Myles, 1997).==== The optimal provision of public goods will not affect the capital accumulation and therefore economic growth if the government implements its public goods policy throughout the time period (e.g., Turnovsky, 1996, Tamai, 2010).====In reality, the government policy is democratically determined by the people who have finite lifetime. Intergenerational conflicts occur and influence the provision of public goods. For example, existing generations have a concern about the health care and welfare programs that they can enjoy. At the same time, they will not care about these programs in the past and far future without altruism to the ancestors and descendants. Diamond (1965) proposed the overlapping generations model, which has the potential inefficiency in a dynamic sense. With public goods, the overlapping generations economy on the growth path that deviated from the modified golden rule path will be inefficient if only the Samuelson rule is satisfied (Batina, 1990). However, these issues may be solved through intergenerational transfers such as bequests. With the intergenerational altruism, operative bequests connect the resources of different generations and enable them to have infinite lifetime like infinitely-lived households. Therefore, intergenerational altruism may internalize such conflicts and neutralize their effects on dynamic resource allocation although each generation finitely lives (e.g., Barro, 1974).====On the other hand, numerous theoretical studies showed that intergenerational altruism generates ==== and some kinds of ==== related to time preferences (e.g., Strotz, 1956, Phelps and Pollak, 1968, Gonzalez et al., 2018).==== Then, democratic governments elected by the biased people have also the same bias and face ==== for fiscal policy (e.g., Krusell et al., 2002). Some experimental studies found evidence for ==== (Sayman and Öncüler, 2009, Takeuchi, 2011, Takeuchi, 2012). The future bias indicates that people tend to undervalue the current benefit and leads to ====; they tend to postpone taking a reward until the future. For instance, Gonzalez et al. (2018) theoretically proved that the intergenerationally altruistic preferences exhibit future bias in an overlapping generations model (Kimball, 1987, Hori and Kanaya, 1989). They also showed that future bias creates incentives to legislate and sustain a pay-as-you-go pension system. The reason is that the future-biased people prefer to receive transfer benefits in the future rather than do in the present.====These theoretical and experimental findings suggest the importance of studying government policy under future bias. Naturally, the present study focuses on public goods; for example, health care and welfare programs will work as effective redistributive policy instruments for democratic governments. For instance, to prevent the spread of diseases, health care programs should be nonrival and nonexcludable.==== This case benefits all existing generations regardless of paying the supply cost. Moreover, in general, the retired (old) generation obtains more benefits than does the working (young) generations because aging people are more liable to diseases. By contrast, private consumption allocation of rivalrous and excludable goods is defined as reconciliation of intergenerational interests, leading to intergenerational inequality. The current young generation may want a low level of health care to consume more private goods, but they may worry about the low level of health care when they get old. In practice, once health care and welfare programs are provided, we wish to support the system. However, we sometimes tend to favor economic expansion at the expense of health care and social welfare expenditures. Hence, as a political solution, democratic governments may continue to designate high or low levels of health care through a self-enforcing commitment mechanism. This case will decrease the loss from misallocation involved with future bias and may affect intertemporal resource allocation.====This study aims to examine the optimal provision of public goods under intergenerational altruism that emerges future bias to understand why democratic governments continue to choose high or low levels of public goods supply in reality. Moreover, we investigate how this provision affects the long-term economic performance, such as economic growth and welfare. This study is helpful to theoretically explain the coexistence of a high-benefit welfare system and high economic growth or, inversely, the trade-off between both. To address these issues, the present study incorporates public goods into an endogenous growth model with altruistic overlapping generations. In this study, one-period lived governments are obliged to supply public goods to maximize their democratic objectives. Such democratic governments are delegates of the coexisting generations, such as the young and the old, and therefore, they are future-biased.====With the future-biased governments, the present study derives the extended Samuelson rule from the dynamic model. Results show that the sum of MRS between the public and private goods must be weighted by the preference parameters. Such parameters represent the elasticity of marginal utility (the degree of inequality aversion), the taste for public goods (the efficiency of the public sector), and the degree of altruism for its ancestors and descendants. The rule under future bias is sub-optimal because it differs from the optimal rules, which should be satisfied in the near future. The weight for the old in the present time is lower than that in the future. Hence, the current consumption allocation (income distribution) becomes more disadvantageous to the old than does the desired allocation in the future. As public goods are means to improve the income distribution, the current government determines the supply level of public goods depending on the inequality aversion and the current and anticipated income distributions that the current government faces. Moreover, the current government expects that the future governments will also do the same. Undesirable allocations from the current government’s perspective will be chosen in the future by the future governments. Hence, the current government strategically chooses the investment level to compensate for the misallocation of consumption resources.====Considering that the old are more weighted than are the young in the democratic decision, the current income distribution is more equal than is the desired income distribution in the future. If the society is strongly inequality averse, satisfying that the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is less than unity,==== then the current government prefers low public goods provision today but high in the future. Moreover, the current government anticipates that the future governments have the same preferences, and therefore, they will choose low public goods provision in the future. For given allocation, the resource misallocation lowers future welfare (====) and transferring the resource to the future decreases the return to investment (====). In the strongly inequality-averse society, the latter effect dominates because people are reluctant to accept swings in intertemporal/intergenerational consumption. The current government strategically chooses to invest more for future generations to compensate for the future low public goods provision. Then, improving the efficiency of the public sector enhances economic growth because it enables the current government to save resources for providing public goods and obtain the resource for more investment. Naturally, these outcomes are reversed in the weakly inequality-averse society.====If the old are less weighted than are the young in a democratic decision, then the anticipated future income distribution could be more or less equal than the current distribution. In particular, focusing on one of the insightful cases, the results indicate the coexistence of a high-benefit welfare system and high economic growth. If the old are more weighted than the young in the future, with smaller weight for the old today, then the current young’s consumption share overweighs that of the current old. However, the future old’s consumption share overweighs that of the future young with larger weight for the old in the future. This situation means that the current income distribution is nearly even and more equal than the anticipated future distribution. If people are willing to allow the dispersion of consumption, then the non-rivalrous public goods are more weighted relative to the rivalrous private goods in a more equal distribution case. Hence, the current government chooses low public goods provision today compared with in the future but may be higher than the first-best. The future public goods allocation chosen by the future government is a bit large for the current government. The presence of public goods more weakens the substitution effect and more strengthens income effect. More the important public goods cause more investment. Consequently, the government size and the log-run growth rate are positively correlated.====Our theoretical findings imply the coexistence of a high-benefit welfare system and high economic growth, similar to the trade-off between a high-benefit welfare system and economic growth. In particular, the relationships between economic growth and government size explain the controversial empirical findings.==== A high-benefit welfare system does not necessarily impede the dynamic performance of the economy although it has been suspected. The high-benefit welfare system can be viewed as a result of a self-enforcing commitment mechanism to increase future benefits under future bias. The overall implication of the presence of public goods under future bias has also nontrivial consequences of the welfare properties. The present study numerically shows that the welfare levels in the administration of the democratic governments are superior to that of the planned economy with a non-biased planner. To study the details, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the settings of our theoretical framework. Section 3 derives the equilibrium policy determined by future-biased authorities and characterizes the equilibrium outcome. Finally, Section 4 concludes the study.","Economic growth, equilibrium welfare, and public goods provision with intergenerational altruism",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000628,1 July 2021,2021,Research Article,131.0
"Born Andreas,Janssen Aljoscha","Spotify, Sweden,Singapore Management University, School of Economics, 90 Stamford Road, 17890, Singapore,IFN, Sweden","Received 4 June 2020, Revised 22 June 2021, Accepted 25 June 2021, Available online 29 June 2021, Version of Record 25 February 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102070,Cited by (0),"In most democracies, members of parliament (MPs) are elected either through a party list or by a district. We use a discontinuity in the German electoral system to investigate the causal effect of a district election on an MP’s conformity with the party line. A district election does not affect roll-call ==== causally, possibly due to overall high adherence to party-line voting. Analyzing the parliamentary speeches of each MP allows us to overcome the high party-line discipline with regard to parliamentary voting. Using textual analysis and machine learning techniques, we create two measures of closeness of an MP’s speeches to the party line. We find that district-elected members of parliament do not differ, in terms of speeches, from those of their party peers who have been elected through closed party lists. However, both speeches and voting correlate with district characteristics, suggesting that district elections allow districts to select more similar candidates rather than changing MPs’ behavior.","Plurality voting and proportional representation are the two most common electoral systems through which western democracies determine their members of parliament (MPs). The choice of system is relevant not only for political process but also for its influence on the economic outcomes of the country (Lizzeri and Persico, 2001, Persson et al., 1997). For example, research suggests that public spending, rent seeking, size of the government, and redistribution vary to a large degree with the electoral system (Milesi-Ferretti et al., 2002, Mueller, 1997, Persson and Tabellini, 1999, Persson and Tabellini, 2004). In particular, previous literature predicts that district-elected MPs act in favor of their district whereas MPs elected on a closed party list are more closely aligned to the general interest of a party (Carey, 2007, Depauw and Martin, 2009).====This article examines if the behavior of district-elected and party-list-elected MPs differs. In a mixed-member proportional system, MPs who are elected through a party list coexist with MPs who are elected via a district vote. Our analysis makes use of the fact that most German politicians run both in a district and on a party list at the same time (dual candidacy strategy) but enter parliament through only one of these. This allows us to employ a regression discontinuity design to quantify the causal effect of a district election on the conformity to the party line in roll-call elections as well as parliamentary speeches. Considering parliamentary speeches, we use text analysis and machine learning to investigate whether parliamentary speeches of district- and list-elected MPs differ systematically. These methods allow us to assess speeches in a reproducible and objective way that does not rely on human coding of language. We base this analysis on two criteria: the type of words and word combinations used in the speeches and the similarity of the language in the speeches to that of the other speeches of the party.====Using data from three legislative periods (2005–2017), we show that district- and list-elected candidates do not differ significantly at the margin in terms of voting. Thus the data do not support the hypothesis that winning a district mandate causes MPs to deviate more or less from their party’s voting. Yet, data on voting are limited, the majority of votes are not roll-call votes, and party discipline is very high.==== Hence, voting might not express an MP’s actual actions behind the scenes. To address this concern, we analyze parliamentary speeches. Here too we find that MPs who won a district marginally and would otherwise have been elected over a party list do not differ in their parliamentary speeches compared with MPs who marginally lost a district and enter parliament over a party list. Neither do they use wording closer or further away from the party’s. Thus, we do not find evidence that winning a district has a causal effect on deviations from the party line, either in terms of roll-call votes or in terms of speeches being further away from the speeches of that party or the party’s manifesto. This result is robust to several specifications of the discontinuity regression.====It may be possible that our non-result of differences in speeches is due to a selective choice of parliamentary speakers. Indeed, Proksch and Slapin (2012) show that the party leadership controls speakers. Also, Bäck and Debus (2017) show that parties selectively exclude speakers on economic topics from districts with worse economic situations. The selection of speakers could ensure a speech close to the party line, thereby explaining the similar speeches. That concern is somewhat dispelled when considering that a deviation in a speech can be much less obvious than a deviation in voting. A deviation in speech can be done, for example, by carefully selecting the topic to speak on or by avoiding a contentious issue by omission. On the empirical side, deviations in voting and speeches do correlate with economic and social characteristics of the district in which the politician was elected. Thus speeches do differ systematically, which suggests that they are informative about the policy position of the MP. In particular, the share of unemployed people and the share of inhabitants without a secondary degree correlate highly positively with roll-call vote deviations and negatively with the similarity of speeches to party speeches. Note that our observation does not necessarily contradict the finding of Bäck and Debus (2017), as we do not incorporate the speaking time or frequency of speeches. We conclude that there is no causal effect of a district election on an MP’s voting or speeches; instead, our results suggest that different districts elect politicians who are already different before their election.====We rule out a possible alternative explanation for the non-result that could confound our analysis, which could be that district-elected MPs experience faster career progression (Folke et al., 2016, Meriläinen and Tukiainen, 2018) within a party, which incentivizes conformity with the party line.==== This might offset the effect of a district mandate at the margin.==== We explore this relationship by investigating whether district-elected MPs have a higher probability to increase their positioning in the closed party lists over election periods. Exploiting the same discontinuity, we find that district-elected MPs do not experience better list positions than list-elected MPs. The finding suggests that career progression due to winning a district is not confounding the results.====We rationalize the results in a stylized framework based on electoral competition in the flavor of Downs (1957) between the major two parties (here conservatives and social democrats).==== The intuition is that candidates who follow a dual candidacy strategy face two objectives. On the one hand, politicians face a distribution of voters in their district. On the other hand, national parties decide about the party line based on accumulated distributions of voters across all districts.==== A politician in a district has to decide between focusing on the median voter in the district, which may increase the probability of election, or focusing on the median voter on the national level to maximize within-party career progression and achieve a higher position on the list. The basic setup explains observations of our empirical analysis: Winning a district is not directly associated with a higher position on the party list. In districts in which the national median voter is closely aligned to the median voter of a district, politicians position themselves close to the party line and their opponent. In those districts, we observe neither deviations nor large voting margins in elections. However, in districts that are very different, we may see politicians who deviate from the party line to focus on the district election and those who may deviate less to concentrate on the list position and party. Therefore we observe higher vote margins and higher deviation in districts very different from the national average. We show that low margins are associated with low deviations in districts close to the average. Further, districts very different from the average in terms of their socioeconomic characteristics are correlated with higher margins and higher deviation.====Previous research in the political science literature has investigated differences between district- and list-elected candidates. Within the German federal parliament, Sieberer, 2010, Neuhäuser et al., 2013, Ohmura, 2014, and Sieberer (2015) explore relations between list and direct elected MPs and voting behavior.==== Sieberer (2010) compares roll-call voting of district and list MPs between 2005 and 2009. The author finds that district MPs are significantly more likely to deviate from a party line than MPs who are elected via a party list. Neuhäuser et al. (2013) confirm the findings of Sieberer (2010) for the same period of time. Further, they show that the results are robust when controlling for MPs’ characteristics. The authors argue that directly elected MPs’ probability of reelection is less dependent on the party. Therefore, direct MPs are less reliant on their standing within a party. Sieberer (2015) extends his previous finding by analyzing MPs’ explanation of votes. He shows that district MPs are more likely to voice reservations about the party line. However, Sieberer (2015) also concludes that dual candidates (MPs who were candidates on the list as well as in a district) do not differ in their explanation of votes. Ohmura (2014) challenges Sieberer (2010) and Neuhäuser et al. (2013) by investigating not only how district and list MPs differ but also whether dual candidacy plays an important role. Ohmura (2014) analyzes roll-call votes from MPs between 2002 and 2013 and shows that dual-candidate MPs do not significantly differ in their rate of deviation from the party line. However, Ohmura (2014) shows that pure district MPs are more likely to deviate from the party line. She argues that the candidacy strategy (i.e., pure district or dual) and reelection probability, instead of the mandate itself, determine the voting of MPs. Sieberer (2014) confirms these results by analyzing deviations from the party line by MPs with a dual candidacy strategy between 1949 and 2013. Recently, Sieberer and Ohmura (2019) use roll-call votes between 1949 and 2013 to show that MPs are more likely to deviate from a party line if they rely on a district. Thereby the authors support evidence from Stoffel (2014).====Our research extends the literature in several dimensions. We employ a discontinuity design to evaluate the causal effect of mandate type on the deviation from the party line in voting and speeches in parliament. Thereby, we add to recent work in political science that uses the regression discontinuity design in election outcomes to establish causality.==== The regression discontinuity design allows us to draw conclusions about the causal effect of a district election. We establish that being voted into parliament by a district instead of via a party list has no causal effect on voting in roll-call votes.====Due to our discontinuity design, we analyze roll-call votes and speeches of MPs that win or lose a district marginally but are elected through the party list. Thus, we are testing a generic effect of winning a district on the behavior of MPs, i.e., the effect of winning a district rather than being elected from the list, independent of overall electoral marginality. We do not contradict previous findings, as our sample of interest does not include MPs with a large vote margin in a district and those dependent on winning a district. However, our analysis shows that we do not find a generic district effect.====An additional contribution is that we analyze parliamentary speeches in Germany. These can potentially inform about MPs’ actions in committees behind closed doors and inform about MP behavior in non-roll-call votes, which constitute the majority of all votes in the German parliament (Sieberer et al., 2018). The use of speeches also addresses the concern that roll-call votes are a selected sample of votes (Carrubba et al., 2008). Parliamentary speeches are one of the most visible activities through which MPs express their policy positions. For example, the works of Maltzman and Sigelman (1996) and Proksch and Slapin (2012) underline the importance of speeches for MPs and political parties. However, also, speeches are not an unbiased overview of all preferences within parties. Party leaders have an incentive to protect the party label and therefore control speakers and individual speeches (Proksch and Slapin, 2012). Within Germany, speeches have been analyzed in political science and computer science literature. Bernauer and Bräuninger (2009) show that there is substantial intra-party heterogeneity in parliamentary speeches. Proksch et al. (2019) provide a sentiment approach that recovers government-opposition dynamics. Similar to our study, Bäck and Debus (2017) compare district-elected MPs’ speeches. They find that district-elected MPs deliver fewer speeches in economic debates if the economic situation in their district is worse. We therefore add to the literature of German parliamentary speeches by connecting two approaches. First, we use speeches as a measure of intra-party differences. Second, we use the measure as an outcome variable within a discontinuity design to evaluate whether a district election affects conformity.====The analysis of parliamentary speeches connects to a growing literature of textual analysis of political speeches based on machine learning mechanisms; see, for example, Grimmer and Stewart, 2013, Martin and Vanberg, 2008, and Quinn et al. (2010). Note especially Gentzkow et al. (2017) for a review of methodologies and different usages in economics.==== Using these mechanisms provides us with a objective way of comparing speeches rather than an approach that involves hand-coding speeches according to some criteria. Moreover, this method can readily be extended to new data.====We use approaches from computational linguistics and computer science that examine text documents such as speeches to analyze MPs’ positions. Our textual analysis is related to previous work from Laver et al. (2003) and Slapin and Proksch (2008), who estimate political positions using word frequencies in party manifestos. Further, Biessmann et al., 2016, Diermeier et al., 2012, and Peterson and Spirling (2018) use machine learning methods to predict party affiliation. In this paper we make use of term frequency in MPs’ speeches to estimate the distance measure between speeches. Further, we use machine learning methods to evaluate how well one can predict party positions from speeches. In comparison to previous literature, we use the estimates as an outcome within our regression discontinuity analysis. The connection of machine learning and methods of causal inference is part of an emerging econometric literature (see, e.g., Athey, 2018, as well as Mullainathan and Spiess, 2017).====Our study also relates to the literature on the effect of political competition. Examples include Strömberg (2008), who evaluates how competition affects campaign spending in U.S. presidential elections, and Dal Bó et al. (2009), who show that increased political competition is associated with a lower probability of political dynasties. Using German data, Bernecker (2014) shows that district opposition party MPs who expect a tight race are less absent from parliament beforehand. We show that MPs’ competition not only in their district but also within their party may play an important role.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the electoral system in Germany. Section 3 summarizes the predictions from theory. In Section 4 we present our data sources and our data manipulation and information retrieval methods. Section 5 shows descriptive statistics, and Section 6 describes our identification strategy. In Section 7 we present the results, and we rationalize the results in a model in Section 8. Section 9 concludes.",Does a district mandate matter for the behavior of politicians?

Empirically, however, many coalitions and distribution decisions seem rather stable. While traditional explanations for the empirical stability of coalitions refer to institutions, more recent theoretical developments argue that behavioral traits like actors’ strategic sophistication and prosociality have stabilizing effects. In this study, we provide a first empirical test of this theoretical claim. In a laboratory experiment, we measure subjects’ strategic abilities and their revealed ====. Then subjects are matched into three-person groups and play a real-time coalition formation game. Our data show that strategic subjects form more stable coalitions than myopic subjects. Prosocial subjects are more likely to agree on even allocations, and those allocations are more likely to last. Our results indicate that kind and strategically sophisticated people do not need institutions to reach stable coalitions that distribute resources evenly.","If politics is about “who gets what, when, how” (Lasswell, 1936), then distributional conflicts form the very center of most political decisions. By definition, ==== decision making implies that these conflicts cannot be decided by a single individual, but some kind of collective agreement has to be reached that usually includes the support of at least a simple majority of the involved actors. Hence, in order to further their own interests, individual actors have to form and maintain coalitions with other actors in democratic decisions. In this paper, we focus on coalition building under majority rule and examine how the personality traits of decision-makers influence the stability of coalitions. The majority rule is arguably the most important democratic decision-making mechanism (Dahl, 1989; McGann, 2006), and questions concerning the formation and stability of coalitions under this rule have far-reaching normative implications for democratic theory.====From a traditional rational choice perspective, coalitions under majority rule are inherently unstable in distributional conflicts. Consider a group consisting of three individuals that have to divide a dollar among themselves in a free-form bargaining environment. The game lacks a unique equilibrium, as any three-way split of the dollar benefiting a majority can be supplanted by an alternative distribution of benefits which is preferred by a different majority.==== Coalitions in the ‘divide-the-dollar game’ (DD-game) are generically unstable because some members of the current coalition have incentives to break the coalition and form a new one with some of the former losers. The instability problem also emerges in spatial voting models. When the policy space contains at least two dimensions, Condorcet winners or equilibria such as the core either do not exist or are highly fragile (Davis et al., 1972; Plott, 1967).==== The so-called ‘chaos theorems’ demonstrate that, absent an equilibrium and given the appropriate voting agenda, majority rule may lead to any possible outcome and is, therefore, theoretically indeterminate (McKelvey, 1976; Schofield, 1978).====As Austen-Smith and Banks (1999, 184) note, the chaos theorems do not necessarily imply that “anything can happen”. In particular, the theorems do not directly predict unstable majorities with group decisions cycling over all alternatives. They rather identify several structural and behavioral factors that affect the probability of the occurrence of majority instability. Contemporary research predominantly focuses on the structural conditions of coalition building (for an overview see Strøm et al., 2008). The literature is dominated by institutional and game-theoretic approaches that consider coalition building as a game being played between strategic actors (Humphreys, 2008; Riker, 1962). The most important examples are rules of government formation, the scheduling of elections, and the assignment of agenda-setting power within the government (e.g. Laver and Schofield, 1998; Laver and Shepsle, 1996). Another line of research relaxes the assumption that voting is costless. Bräuninger (2007), for example, introduces decision costs in the theoretical analysis and examines the effects thereof on the stability of majority coalitions, which can guarantee stable majority decisions near the center of the policy space.====In this paper, we focus on another important but mostly neglected aspect, namely, the ==== for the instability of majority rule. The chaos theorems make two assumptions about individual behavior that possibly impact the volatility of coalitions. First, individuals exhibit only limited strategic sophistication and ==== between alternatives at each stage of the decision process. Thus, they do not consider the long-term consequences of their choices but vote for the alternative that offers them the highest immediate benefit. Second, in most empirical applications of the theorems, individuals are assumed to be ==== and strictly aim to maximize monetary payoffs (e.g. Riker, 1982). Hence, fairness, justice, or efficiency are not included in the analysis as decision motives.====We report results from a laboratory experiment in which we first measure subjects’ strategic sophistication in a guessing game and their level of prosociality in a dictator game. Afterwards, subjects are placed in three-person groups to play a real-time coalition formation game developed by Tremewan and Vanberg (2016). The game introduces only a minimal institutional structure and thus offers an ideal setting for investigating the effects of strategic abilities and prosociality on the stability of coalitions. We find that subjects’ strategic ability and their distributional preferences have a systematic effect on the stability of coalitions and the distribution of payoffs. In groups consisting of predominantly myopic and self-interested group members, subjects continuously form and dissolve new coalitions that are scattered across the whole policy space. However, when group members are more strategically sophisticated and prosocially motivated, coalitions become more stable. The coalitions concentrate on focal points representing even distributions. While sophisticated and self-interested players are more likely to form stable majoritarian two-person coalitions that share the payoffs equally between themselves, prosocial players are significantly more likely to agree on coalitions that distribute payoffs equally among all three group members.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the following section, we review the related theoretical and empirical literature. Section 3 describes our experimental design and section 4 presents the experimental results.

This paper sheds light on the political determinants of non-tariff protection using a rich empirical setting in Morocco. Taking advantage of a bilateral EU-Morocco trade agreement that resulted in an across-the-board tariff cut and a subsequent rise in NTMs, we use a difference-in-differences regression framework to show that sectors with close prior political connections to the royal family received disproportionately higher levels of non-tariff protection after the EU Agreement than unconnected sectors. We also demonstrate that, in the wake of the EU-induced tariff cut, connected sectors were mainly compensated through technical barriers to trade that depend on administrative oversight and are vulnerable to political influence.","With applied tariff rates falling by 66 percent since 1996, developing countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction in tariff barriers over the last two decades.==== As tariff levels fell to a historic low, non-tariff measures (NTMs) have emerged as a potent substitute to become the most dominant form of trade protection today. NTMs are a broad set of policies, such as restrictions on hormones in meat products, labeling requirements or pre-shipment inspections, that can have an economic effect on the prices and quantities of internationally traded goods.==== While the intent and impact of tariffs are clear and tangible, the effects of NTMs are more difficult to analyze. Unlike tariffs, NTMs can be imposed without an obvious protectionist intent and for legitimate reasons such as environmental, health and safety considerations. Their introduction is also linked with greater harmonization of trade standards triggered by international trade agreements.====Recent evidence has, however, begun to establish that NTMs can cause substantial trade frictions. A recent study demonstrated that NTMs added an average of 87% to the trade restrictiveness imposed by tariffs, and for almost 50% of countries the restrictive impact of NTMs on trade is higher than that of tariffs (Kee et al., 2009). A more systematic analysis of the impact of NTMs has so far been hindered by the absence of credible and comparable information on laws and regulations that define these non-tariff measures. Using newly compiled and fine-grained data on NTMs, a recent report has tried to uncover the “unseen impact of non-tariff measures” and showed that they impose significant trade costs in developing countries (World Bank and UNCTAD, 2018).====How can NTMs that are sometimes introduced for supposedly non-discriminatory objectives end up causing trade frictions and undermine market access? One reason is that “the effects of NTMs are largely dependent not only on NTMs per se, but also on implementation procedures and administrative mechanisms” (UNCTAD, 2012b). NTMs can prove complex and burdensome for firms to conform to, and for governments to implement. Inconsistent and selective enforcement can increase the costs of compliance for firms that lack both the capacity and resources to meet these trade requirements.==== This can cause a disjunction between the ==== intent and ==== practice along the lines demonstrated by Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett (2015) in their work on World Bank’s Doing Business indicators. The gap between intent and practice can be especially large in countries that suffer from weak governance capacity and a discretionary enforcement environment. In such institutional contexts, even the most innocuous rules can become “deals” that privilege politically connected businesses.====This raises an important question for the political economy of trade policy. Can non-tariff protection in developing countries be considered as endogenous and dependent on institutional and political determinants similar to those governing tariff protection? Specifically, can the growing usage of NTMs be explained in part by the interests of politically connected actors looking for substitutes in the wake of externally-induced tariff liberalization? To evaluate this claim, we use a major shock to Morocco’s trade regime that resulted from the country’s Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) – Morocco’s largest trading partner. The agreement, which came into force in 2000, was driven by geopolitical objectives, with the main impetus coming from the EU attempting to link “security and stability in the Mediterranean” with trade cooperation as part of its Barcelona process. The Agreement triggered an across-the-board tariff cut and was followed by a wave of non-tariff measures.====To explore the politics of this policy instrument substitution, we set up a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis and empirically examine whether sectors with greater prior exposure to politically connected businesses were more likely to receive higher NTM protection after the EU Agreement. To conduct this analysis, we constructed a novel dataset providing fine-grained information on the presence of politically connected businesses in all manufacturing activities classified along the four-digit ISIC sectors. In the most extensive exercise carried out for Morocco to date, we mapped political connections of over 1500 firms using an array of hitherto untapped sources, and following closely the commonly used definition of politically connected firms proposed by Faccio (2006). We then combined this dataset on politically connected firms with detailed product-level data on the incidence and type of non-tariff measures recently made available by the World Bank and UNCTAD (MAST).====Our results provide strong evidence that sectors in which politically connected businesses were active prior to the Agreement received substantially higher levels of non-tariff protection after the EU agreement. The effect of cronyism on trade policy is quantitatively large. On average, the politically connected sectors ended up benefiting from an NTM coverage ratio that was between 9 and 11%pts higher compared to unconnected sectors. The size of this effect becomes clear when comparing it to an average NTM coverage ratio of 24% in unconnected sectors in 2009, at the end of the post-period. Recognizing that not all types of NTMs impose trade restrictions of a comparable scale and that the preference of cronies could vary across NTM types, we disaggregate our empirical analysis by different NTM types. We show that our results are principally driven by technical barriers to trade (TBTs) that require administrative oversight, are susceptible to selective enforcement, and can favor politically connected actors. Given that the royal family has a dominant stake in the economy, we disaggregate the effect of political connections between royally-owned firms and non-royal cronies. Our results suggest that the effect of cronyism on trade policy substitution is mainly driven by firms owned by advisors, confidants, and politicians rather than royally-owned firms.====Our empirical strategy addresses the concerns arising from a DID analysis in this setting. Here, we highlight the three most important ones. Firstly, a possible endogeneity concern is that cronies might have self-selected into sectors that were predisposed to receiving more NTMs in the wake of EU Agreement. To address this, we take advantage of the temporal dimension of our database on cronies and treat sectors as politically connected only if they had crony presence seven years before the EU Agreement came into force (and several years before it was negotiated). In an institutional context defined by policy uncertainty and centralized decision-making, it is highly unlikely that political cronies could have anticipated the trade agreement this early. Furthermore, we show that the trajectory of NTMs for politically connected and unconnected sectors was fairly similar prior to the EU Agreement. The difference only emerges after the Agreement. Since sectors with initially higher tariff levels were more likely to receive NTM protection after the EU agreement, we ensure that all our specifications control for average MFN tariffs. Lastly, controlling for sector and year fixed effects allows us to account for any unobserved time-invariant sector-specific characteristics and any temporal shocks during the period of investigation that commonly affect all sectors.====A second concern is that part of the correlation we are documenting between the presence of political cronies and NTMs may result from broader regulatory harmonization with the EU. To the extent that such harmonization operates at a broad industrial level (ISIC-2) we account for it by including group-specific linear time trends. A third concern relates to the relevance of other variables previously found to be determinants of trade policy, and that may be correlated with both the sectoral exposure to politically connected actors and NTM incidence. To address this, we controlled for several determinants that were flagged by previous literature (Lee and Swagel, 1997), including industry employment, value added, output, and number of establishments. The effect of political connectedness still turns out to be larger than any of these traditional drivers of endogenous protection.====This paper contributes to the nascent literature on the politics of trade protection in authoritarian regimes (Galiani and Torrens, 2014, Zissimos, 2017).==== All authoritarian rulers face a perennial challenge of survival in the face of threats, including ones posed by elites. Unable to rely solely on repression, rulers seek to ensure the continued support of elites by granting privileges and sharing rents (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003, Gandhi and Przeworski, 2006, Svolik, 2009). From the autocrat’s perspective, such rent sharing can be particularly important for securing commitments from a subset of elites, typically described as the “selectorate”, who hold the potential to overthrow the ruler and install a new one (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003). The literature suggests formal institutions (e.g., parties and legislatures), informal institutions (e.g., clientelism and patronage), and economic policy (e.g. subsidies and tax policies) as possible mechanisms for co-opting elite actors (Wintrobe, 1998, Gandhi and Przeworski, 2006, Gerschewski, 2013). Our contribution is to demonstrate the relevance of trade policy for such authoritarian power sharing. In the Moroccan context, the royal family lies at the center of the concentric circle of power while other royals, government ministers, and advisors form part of selectorate whose support is deemed crucial for regime survival. Extending greater NTM protection to politically connected sectors after the EU-induced tariff cuts can thus be viewed as a means of ensuring continued protection in the context of overall declining barriers to trade.====We also offer complementary evidence for Zissimos (2017) who theorizes the conditions under which dictatorial regimes can manipulate trade policy in the wake of permanent global price shocks. Zissimos shows how the ruling elite can forestall democratization by using trade policy to make transfers to the rest of society, thereby affording them a higher level of income than after a costly transition to democracy. While this approach is grounded in the problem of authoritarian control where the regime faces a threat from outside the elite, the same logic can be extended to the use of trade policy to reward elites. While Zissimos (2017) discusses the theoretical applicability of this framework to contexts in which trade policy can facilitate authoritarian power sharing, our paper offers the first systematic evidence on this account.====Our research also complements the more well-established literature on the politics of trade protection that has overwhelmingly focused on democratic contexts where trade protection is typically exchanged for lobbying contributions by special interest groups (Grossman and Helpman, 1994). The theoretical predictions of the Grosmman–Helpman type models have been empirically affirmed using industry-level data from the United States (Goldberg and Maggi, 1999, Gawande and Bandyopadhyay, 2000), Turkey (Mitra et al., 2002) and India (Bown and Tovar, 2011). The study on India is closest in spirit to our work, since it demonstrates how exceptional non-tariff measures, such as anti-dumping and safeguarding measures, were used to substitute for tariff reductions in politically organized sectors in the wake of 1990–91 IMF agreement.==== Our analysis relates to an authoritarian context where business lobbies are generally weak and ineffective, and the regime has greater bargaining power vis-à-vis domestic economic actors.==== Compared to extant research, we develop a more precise and direct proxy of politically connected sectors that is based on granular information on the presence, number, and type of political connections. By contrast, previous studies have used relatively indirect proxies for sectoral exposure to special interest groups.====In addition, this study makes a distinct contribution to the nascent literature on politically connected firms in the Middle East and North Africa (Rijkers et al., 2017), Egypt (Diwan et al., 2020), and Lebanon (Diwan and Haidar, 2020). We complement this literature by probing the role of politically connected firms in a major episode of trade policy substitution. In this regard, we supplement recent studies in establishing greater incidence of NTM protection in politically connected sectors in Mubarak-era Egypt (Diwan et al., 2020, Eibl and Malik, 2016). Finally, our work carries important implications for a separate strand of literature on the political economy of international trade agreements. Studies in this tradition have argued that democratic countries are more likely to join global trade agreements than authoritarian regimes (Maggi and Rodríguez-Clare, 1998), and that these agreements serve as a commitment device for rulers who can use these agreements to “foreclose political pressures at home” and neutralize politically influential business lobbies (Maggi and Rodríguez-Clare, 2007, Mitra et al., 2002, Baccini and Urpelainen, 2012, Limão and Tovar, 2011, Rodrik, 2018). The question then arises why some authoritarian regimes commit to tying their hands by signing free trade agreements (FTAs) at the expense of losing control over tariffs that can be used to reward politically influential sectors. Our evidence offers a potential explanation for this puzzle that revolves around the ability of these regimes to neutralize the effect of tariff reductions through compensatory non-tariff protection. This would make FTA-induced trade liberalization less threatening and more politically palatable to authoritarian regimes.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief overview of the connection between business and politics in Morocco, and describes the main features of the Morocco-EU trade Agreement.

Thommen Yann,"CNRS, BETA, Université de Strasbourg, Université de Lorraine, 67000 Strasbourg, France","Received 16 November 2020, Revised 22 April 2021, Accepted 15 June 2021, Available online 18 June 2021, Version of Record 25 February 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102066,Cited by (0),This paper investigates whether flexibility-enhancing reforms of national ,"During the Great Recession, many European labor markets were reformed with the aim of maintaining price competitiveness to limit unemployment. The reforms mainly facilitated workforce management, by weakening job protection (facilitating adjustment by quantities) and increasing the flexibility of wages and employment conditions (facilitating price adjustment). Many of these reforms were prioritized by European economic governance (the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, European Commission and national governments) both in the European Semester, through their inclusion in the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, and by setting them as conditions for financial assistance (Leonardi and Pedersini, 2018).==== As a result, collective bargaining institutions have undergone major changes, as pointed out by Visser (2016) and illustrated in Fig. 1. Structural reforms, especially in the labor market, are generally aimed at positive effects in the medium to long term (Boeri et al., 2015). On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that if policy makers implement reforms during a recession, it is because they hope for positive effects in the short term. Did these reforms of collective bargaining carried out during the economic crisis enhance employment? This paper provides some evidence to answer this question.====Collective bargaining refers to negotiations between workers’ representatives, usually organized in trade unions, and employers on several aspects of employment contracts, such as wages, overtime pay, bonuses, working hours, and health and safety rules in the workplace. Political considerations notwithstanding, the trade unions’ main objective is to defend the interests of their members, or of all workers when the agreements they negotiate apply to the whole workforce through administrative extension procedures. This objective leads to a compression of nominal wages and therefore to real wage rigidity (Holden and Wulfsberg, 2008, Babecky et al., 2010, Guimaraes et al., 2017). It is this rigidity that motivated the collective bargaining reforms undertaken during the Great Recession, namely ==== reducing the scope of collective bargaining (e.g., ending the mandatory extension of collective agreements to non-organized employers, reducing the length of agreements and their validity beyond expiry); ==== decentralizing bargaining by moving it closer to the firm-level (e.g., abolishing the favorability principle, allowing derogation, developing temporary clauses to renegotiate higher-level agreements at a lower level, or simply removing higher levels of bargaining) ==== reducing the influence of trade unions (e.g., restricting the right to strike, tightening representativeness criteria or limiting the voice of trade unions in national tripartite councils).====It is far from clear however that shifts from inclusive to more exclusive collective bargaining systems are beneficial, especially during economic recessions. Several arguments can be made that changing the structure of collective bargaining during a recession does not necessarily yield the expected outcomes in the short term. As argued by Brandl and Ibsen (2017), the institutional stability of collective bargaining is needed to moderate unit labor cost growth. Their theoretical argument, which motivates my research question, comes from the literature on institutional economics (Knight and Jack, 1992, Hall and Soskice, 2001, Baccaro and Simoni, 2010, Pierson, 2011). Changing the way institutions work alters the distribution of power between the main protagonists, who struggle to retain as much of it as possible. These struggles reduce the capacity for collective action and the ability of institutions to function as they should. More specifically, reforms of collective bargaining institutions alter horizontal arrangements (between bargaining units at the same level) and/or vertical arrangements (between different levels of bargaining) and thus alter power relations within the system itself, with workers’ representatives given new missions and responsibilities. As a result, they have only a very vague idea of the potential gains and losses of signing agreements, which sometimes involve significant transaction costs. In the end, workers’ representatives struggle to fulfill one of their main roles, which is to reduce uncertainty by negotiating stable agreements that ensure stable labor cost growth, stable agreements being crucial for employers’ workforce planning (Zagelmeyer, 2005). This argument gains even more weight when placed in perspective with path dependency theories. Indeed, according to neo-institutionalist thinking and historical dependence, wage bargaining institutions should be characterized by inertia, i.e. not change much. However, they are often altered by rather abrupt reforms, sometimes imposed by supranational institutions, which amplify institutional instability and its potentially adverse effects (Marginson, 2015).====Taking prevailing economic conditions into account, the timing of the reform is crucial in this context, mainly because trade unions’ objectives vary over the business cycle. Unions are more aggressive during recessions, which explains why wage premiums are countercyclical (Freeman and Medoff, 1984, Bratsberg and Ragan, 2002, Blanchflower et al., 2004). As outlined theoretically by Morin (2017), the cyclicality of trade unions’ objectives is also driven by the trade-off they face between employment and wages. The trade unions’ marginal rate of substitution fluctuates endogenously. When unemployment is low, unions focus on wages because the marginal utility of increasing wages is high. This arbitration remains when a recession hits. However, once the shock has spread and unemployment is high, trade unions focus on employment.====While the literature on the effects of trade unions and collective bargaining on economic performance is extensive, there is still very little evidence on the short-term economic effects of collective bargaining reforms, and even less with the timing of the reforms taken into account (see Addison, 2016 for a recent survey). Yet this is a key issue in the shaping of economic policies during economic crises.==== Exploiting data on reforms of collective bargaining institutions implemented by EU countries since 2000, this paper evaluates their employment outcomes, depending on whether they were implemented in a period of recession or a period of expansion. The paper approaches the question from a macroeconomic perspective by analyzing the short-term effects on the employment – the aggregate value, and by age, level of education and type of contract. For this purpose, I built an original database of all the reforms of national collective bargaining systems carried out between 2000 and 2018 in EU countries and classified them using a typology that allows their effects to be analyzed in detail. I assess their impacts on employment using local projections (LP) (Jordà, 2005), an approach that is robust to misspecification, very flexible by allowing the addition of multiple control variables and the use of instrumental variables, and that addresses uncertainties on possible interactions between the reforms considered and the macroeconomic environment. I explore the sensitivity of the results to alternative empirical strategies, including unemployment rate as a dependent variable, additional control variables, changes in lags and system-GMM estimates. Finally, although endogeneity does not seem to be an important issue in this study, I present instrumental variable (IV) estimates as a precaution, using original instruments based on geographically close reforming countries and how minimum wages are set in the domestic country.====The main findings are that reforms to make wage bargaining institutions more flexible should not be introduced during an economic recession, as these types of reforms have either no effect or a detrimental effect on employment in the first few years after their implementation.====The results also suggest that the most affected groups are 25–54 year-olds and low-educated workers, by the negative effects of reforms that decentralize bargaining closer to the firm-level. Also, reforms that decentralize bargaining tend to increase the share of temporary jobs in total employment a few years after the reform. Older workers are those who suffer most in terms of employment from reforms that weaken unions.====My work has implications for economic governance in the EU. When policy-makers request collective bargaining reforms from national governments, a crucial consideration is the timing of these reforms. Indeed, when they are implemented during an economic downturn, they do not have the expected beneficial effects on employment and may even be detrimental. It might be worth considering a “positive conditionality” mechanism, as suggested by Boeri and Jimeno (2016).====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 outlines the literature related to my research question. Section 3 presents the data used in the empirical investigation. The empirical methodology is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 presents the robustness checks and discusses the issue of endogeneity. Section 7 concludes.","Reforms of collective bargaining institutions in European Union countries: Bad timing, bad outcomes?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000616,18 June 2021,2021,Research Article,135.0

In only a short period of time, major economies around the world have faced mass unemployment risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain difficulties, growing inequality, the great resignation, and most recently, escalating energy, food, and housing costs.====Most important for central banks, inflation in many advanced economies is now at a 40-year high causing concerns to peoples’ livelihoods and to central bank credibility. Looking ahead, how can modern central banks manage accountability and legitimacy concerns that may arise from these unprecedented economic times? What tools do central bank have at their disposal? How are these tools deployed and to what effect?====Fortunately, recent empirical research contained in this special issue demonstrates the multitude of ways central banks can manage legitimacy and accountability. Many of the papers contained here are therefore useful for understanding the future of central bank policy making as we enter more challenging economic times. In order to broadly organize the findings presented, we adopt terminology from previous literature on “input” and “output” legitimacy (Scharpf 1999, 2009; Burgoon et al., 2012). Input legitimacy implies that the interests of those for whom decisions are being made should be ==== in the decision-making process and involved in the feedback and scrutiny processes to which decisions are subjected (Scharpf 2003). Central bankers can increase input legitimacy by ensuring representation in decision-making bodies and subjecting decisions to outside scrutiny from a variety of different sources and perspectives. Output legitimacy, by contrast, focuses on the ==== of the policy choices made by central banks in the eyes of those for whom the decisions are made (Scharpf 1999). Central bankers can increase output legitimacy by following their mandates and/or meeting their targets, or clearly communicating the reasons why this may not be possible. These terms provide a useful yardstick against which to assess how trust in central banks might come under pressure as well as how it might be managed and repaired to strengthen the legitimacy of central banks in the eyes of the public (Jones 2009; Macchiarelli et al., 2020; Bergbauer et al., 2020).",Special issue: Central banking in the 21st century - A crisis of accountability?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626802200091X,1 September 2022,2022,Research Article,137.0

I propose a model where agents’ redistributive preferences are determined by their income and cultural beliefs about public spending, which vary across nationalities. I show that under some conditions, low-income natives can gain politically from enfranchising foreigners that are richer than natives on average as long as these foreigners have sufficiently liberal beliefs towards public spending. Moreover, I establish that natives’ support for foreigners’ enfranchisement is a non-monotonic function of these foreigners’ income and cultural beliefs. Rather, these variables influence attitudes towards enfranchisement based on foreigners’ relative taste for the private and the public good. I also provide empirical results in support of my theory using a municipality-level dataset of Swiss referenda about non-citizen voting rights.","Recent history suggests that immigration plays a crucial role in the politics of modern welfare states. An important, yet commonly overlooked aspect of this matter regards foreigners’ enfranchisement. When foreign residents are granted the right to vote, they have the potential to directly shape the future tax and transfer systems chosen by governments, which in turn face key political decisions about these voting rights. Against this backdrop, a quick look at the data reveals that while improving from a historical perspective, foreigners’ political participation remains an area of weakness for integration policy. Only a handful of countries grant foreigners the right to vote in national elections, while residence requirements to become eligible for naturalization in OECD countries ranges from 3 years in Canada to 15 in Lithuania, leaving a large share of the population fully or partially disenfranchised in countries where many residents are non-citizens.==== Given the potential economic and social consequences of granting political representation to non-citizen taxpayers, it is important to understand the conditions under which they may obtain voting rights.====In this regard, the aim of this paper is to study theoretically the extent to which fiscal concerns drive native attitudes’ towards the political integration of foreign residents. The economic literature already provides a rich theoretical insight into the relationship between redistribution and immigrant voting (see for instance Razin et al., 2002, Dolmas and Huffman, 2004, Mayr, 2007, Ortega, 2010, Mariani, 2013). However, those works suffer from either of two limitations.====First, they assume that the implications of foreigners’ political rights are limited to matters of income redistribution, and therefore fail to account for the fact that political choices may reflect individual preferences about both the size and the composition of public spending. Indeed, public social spending and income redistribution – individual cash benefits, direct in-kind provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes – represent less than 40% of EU government expenditures on average, while a more significant share of these expenditures finances public goods and services that benefit the society as a whole, or large parts of society. While preferences about the composition of public spending is absent from the theoretical literature on immigrant voting, I distinguish in the paper between public spending on private and public goods to understand how the enfranchisement of foreign residents can influence a country’s spending policy.====A second major assumption of my theoretical analysis which is absent from previous studies is that individuals’ redistributive preferences are largely determined by cultural beliefs about public spending. The empirical literature has showed that economic welfare alone cannot explain individual preferences for redistribution and that culture plays a very significant part in driving these preferences (see for instance (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005) and (Alesina and Giuliano, 2011)). More specifically, immigrants’ views about public spending are strongly affected by preferences in their country of birth, regardless of the economic context and sometimes decades after individuals emigrated to their residence country (Luttmer and Singhal, 2011). In this context, a political economy approach to the enfranchisement of foreign-born residents should look into the redistributive implications of immigrants’ cultural beliefs.====In the model, I use a probabilistic voting model to determine the size and composition of public spending under exogenous immigration, where the redistributive equilibrium depends on voters’ average wealth and cultural preferences towards public spending. I first characterize this equilibrium in the absence of immigrant voting when only natives have the right to vote and then look at how equilibrium policies change when immigrants have political rights. Because immigration is exogenous, immigrants’ enfranchisement only affects the equilibrium through the political influence of immigrants that are already present in the country. I can therefore explicitly determine the conditions under which natives benefit from their enfranchisement.====In this setup, I confirm the rather intuitive result that a poor native majority is more likely to enfranchise low-income immigrants. However, contrary to a commonly held view that poor natives typically benefit politically from granting immigrants or the children of immigrants the right to vote only if those immigrants are poorer than natives on average (see Mayr, 2007, Ortega, 2010), I find that they are willing to enfranchise immigrants that are relatively richer than the domestic population under some conditions, as long as these immigrants have sufficiently liberal beliefs towards public spending. Moreover, I establish that the level of political integration that natives are prepared to grant to immigrants is a non-monotonic function of immigrants’ income level and cultural preferences for public spending. Rather, the way natives’ attitudes towards political rights vary with immigrants’ average income and cultural beliefs depend on immigrants’ relative preferences for the private and the public good. The last section of the paper contains an empirical illustration of some of the predictions of the model. Using a municipality-level dataset of Swiss referenda about non-citizen voting rights, I find that municipalities where a greater share of natives received social transfers were more likely to support the enfranchisement of foreigners, and that this effect was greater where foreigners were relatively poorer and emigrated from less economically conservative countries.====This work is related to four strands of literature. First, it contributes to the theoretical political economy literature on redistribution pioneered by Meltzer and Richard (1981). Recent work in this field presents various models linking immigration and income redistribution. In some of these models, redistribution is endogenously determined while immigration is taken as exogenous. Immigrants then influence redistributive outcomes through economic channels such as labour market competition or fiscal leakage, and by adding to the size of different interest groups, changing the political constituency of the native population (See Razin and Sadka, 2000, Razin et al., 2002, Dolmas and Huffman, 2004, Roemer and Van der Straeten, 2006, Ortega, 2010). For example, Ortega (2010) presents a dynamic model where voters choose the degree of income redistribution in addition to immigration policy under three citizenship regimes, and find that income redistribution can be sustained indefinitely under permanent migration and ====, where children of immigrants’ are granted citizenship unconditionally. Iturbe-Ormaetxe and Romero (2016) investigates the attitudes of natives with different skill level towards immigrants based on their impact on wages, tax collection and the quality of the public good. They find that the higher the political weight of the rich, the less tolerant the poor and the middle-class are towards immigration and the more demanding they are towards increasing public spending. Closer to my work, Mayr (2007) examines the effect of immigration on income redistribution via majority voting where the skill composition of immigrants is endogenous and depends negatively on the income tax, and Mariani (2013) enquires about the timing of naturalization policies for immigrants whose values and political preferences are different from natives.====My paper is also related to the broader political economy literature studying enfranchisement. The issue of franchise extension has received considerable attention, with theoretical contributions by Acemoglu and Robinson (2000), Lizzeri and Persico (2004), Llavador and Oxoby (2005), and Jack and Lagunoff (2006). An interesting empirical counterpart to these works is Bertocchi and Strozzi (2010), in which the authors assemble a large, comprehensive cross-country panel of citizenship laws and estimate the determinants of whether a country grants citizenship based on bloodline (====), birth place (====), or has a mixed regime. Within this body of research, my paper is most related to the recent attempts to measure the consequences of enfranchisement on redistribution and the size of the welfare state. In this regard, recent work by Bertocchi (2011) finds that women’s suffrage increased the size of government over the 1870–1930 period in non-catholic countries, while Abrams and Settle (1999) arrive to the same conclusion in Switzerland. Further analysis by Funk and Gathmann (2006) reveals larger differences regarding the scope rather than the size of government at the cantonal level in Switzerland as a result of gender-specific preferences for redistribution.====To the best of my knowledge, few empirical papers investigate the causes and consequences of franchise extension towards foreigners. One exception is Vernby (2013), who shows that the effect of local enfranchisement of non-citizens on public spending policy was large, causing spending on education and social and family services to increase substantially in Swedish municipalities. Another notable work by Stutzer and Slotwinski (2020) looks at power-sharing in the Swiss cantons of Grisons and Zurich. They show that enfranchisement is less likely in municipalities with larger shares of resident foreigners and a large language or cultural minority. Their findings is corroborated by Koukal et al. (2021) using a similar although more exhaustive dataset on Swiss referenda than the one I use in this paper.====Third, my paper is related to the empirical literature studying the role of immigration in politics. A first strand of this literature explores individual attitudes towards immigration based on theories of labour market competition (Mayda, 2006, Scheve and Slaughter, 2001, Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2007) and fiscal leakage (Facchini and Mayda, 2009, Hanson et al., 2007). It provides mixed evidence for both of these theories and suggests that the relative skill level of immigrants does not necessarily play out in the direction predicted by political economy models. Another series of papers focus on the effect of the size and skill composition of immigrant flows on electoral behaviour Otto and Steinhardt, 2014, Barone et al., 2016, Brunner and Kuhn, 2018, Edo et al., 2019. While their findings vary according to specific national contexts, a recent paper by Moriconi et al. (2019) generalizes voting responses to immigration at the European level and finds that larger inflows of highly educated immigrants are associated with European citizens shifting their votes towards parties that favour expansion of the welfare state while immigration of low skilled individuals pushed political party agendas to reduce support for the welfare state.====Finally, because culture plays a crucial role in my theoretical and empirical analysis, my paper speaks to the literature on the impact of culture on redistribution Bisin and Verdier (2000), and Benabou and Tirole (2006). My work also builds largely on the findings of Luttmer and Singhal (2011), who shows that immigrants’ preferences for redistribution are strongly affected by preferences in their countries of birth, and in particular that immigrants from high-preference countries are more likely to vote for more pro-redistribution parties.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the model and solves the political equilibrium with and without foreigners’ voting rights.

Among non-tenured researchers, publication selection bias and research ==== are increasing with age, on average. This bias is highest among older non-tenured researchers. In search for channels, we find suggestive evidence that a portion of the preferential reporting in favour of aid effectiveness is associated with non-tenured authors’ links with aid agencies.","In this article, we explore the economics of economics. Are researchers altruistic truth seekers striving to maximize social welfare through science, or are we rational humans concerned with the broader good but also seeking to advance our careers? The results of empirical studies in economics often fail to replicate and they often suffer from publication selection bias, with preferential reporting of statistically significant results and inflation of estimates of parameters of interest (e.g., Camerer et al., 2016; Ioannidis et al., 2017; Christensen and Miguel, 2018; Andrews and Kasy, 2019).==== Such biases emerge when authors engage in data mining and specification search designed to achieve statistical significance, when some empirical studies remain unpublished and unavailable to the public (Franco et al., 2014), or when results are reported only when they are consistent with researchers’ priors. Tullock (2005: 124) argues that “scientists are not much better than other men”. Frey (2003) points out that success and survival in academia depends on publishing and that authors are tempted to give into the demands of referees to secure publication. Paldam (2018) shows how rational economics researchers distort the research record. Moreover, industry links and funding may affect reported outcomes. For example, industry sponsored research on drug effectiveness tends to be more favorable to the sponsor than non-industry sponsored research (Baker et al., 2003; Lundh et al., 2017). Improving research quality and credibility requires collective action with all the difficulties that it entails (Blanco-Perez and Brodeur, 2020).====The objective of this article is to investigate some of the individual researcher career characteristics that may affect the prevalence and magnitude of publication selection biases. We augment the existing meta-data on aid effectiveness on economic growth (Doucouliagos and Paldam, 2015) with information on the individual authors’ careers. At the foreground of our interest is the effect of career age and academic tenure (hereafter tenure) on publication selection bias. Researchers are rational and will seek to achieve their objectives in the best possible manner. Incentives to engage in specification search might be higher for younger researchers as they are under greater pressure to publish to move their academic careers forward. The “publish or perish” literature in different fields discusses the potential harmful effects of this pressure (e.g., see De Rond and Miller 2005). Publication bias is one of these effects. On the other hand, established senior researchers might use their skills to find a specification that looks credible, is in line with expectations of the scientific community and thus, is easier to publish, rather than to show the specification which genuinely reflects the data at hand. Moreover, there are tradeoffs between incentives to conform to established scientific consensus versus the rewards of innovation and original findings (Thomas and Thomas, 2020). These varying effects suggest that the ==== effect is an empirical matter. It is this net effect that we investigate here.====Our study contributes to the literature on the determinants of publication selection bias, by studying the role of age and tenure in generating publication selection bias and artificial heterogeneity in reported results. The effects of these biases is to create artificial heterogeneity in the evidence base, suggest poor replication of results, and typically inflate estimates of aid effectiveness, potentially distorting public policy in terms of funds allocated towards aid. Past studies have identified several individual and institutional variables that affect the degree of publication bias. For example: Jarrell and Stanley (2004) on authors’ gender, Costa-Font et al. (2013) on journal impact factors, Doucouliagos and Stanley (2013) on theoretical contests and bias, Fidrmuc and Lind (2020) on the type of institution the authors are affiliated with, and Blanco-Perez and Brodeur (2020) on the impact of journal editorial policies. To our knowledge, Brodeur et al. (2016) is the only study to examine academic age and tenure with respect to publication bias. Investigating the statistical properties of estimation results on the population of studies from three top economics journals across seven years, these authors find that non-tenured or younger authors are more likely to inflate their results. Unlike Brodeur et al. (2016), we are able to study the role of age and tenure in a multivariate context and we investigate the role of institutions the researchers are affiliated with. That is, we model the distribution of reported aid effectiveness results and investigate how career considerations impact reported findings. Moreover, compared to Brodeur et al. (2016) who can only study publication selection bias, we investigate bias due to selection, heterogeneity, and exaggeration of the research record.====Our case study is the enormous aid effectiveness literature. Aid allocations totaled $160US billion in 2018,==== with practically all countries involved as either donor or recipient. The effectiveness of aid is debated by scholars (Askarov and Doucouliagos, 2013; Young and Sheehan, 2014; Arvin and Lew, 2015; Askarov et al., 2015). This literature offers an interesting case study. A wide range of conflicting results have been reported and reports often fail to replicate (e.g., see Jia and Williamson, 2019). According to Doucouliagos and Stanley (2013), there will be greater publication bias in research areas where there is broad theoretical agreement. In contrast, in areas such as aid effectiveness, where there is strong theoretical disagreement, referees and journals make space available for a wide range of empirical results. There is relatively small overall publication bias found in this literature (see discussion in section 5 below). Nevertheless, there may be pockets of bias, within an overall relatively low bias literature. Studying the process by which research is conducted in the aid effectiveness literature is not merely an academic exercise. To the extent that policy decisions regarding aid allocations are made on the basis of evidence, then understanding the way in which research is produced and distributed and revealing biases within, are also critically important for ‘evidence based policy’. Some of the research effort may be directed at lobbying governments to allocate resources towards aid, or not to allocate, depending on the direction of the bias.==== Our study focuses on differences in publication bias between tenured and non-tenured and between younger and older researchers. Moreover, given the specificity of the aid effectiveness field, we additionally explore authors' links with aid agencies as an additional driver of these differences.====In the next section we provide an overview of the literature on publication bias in empirical economics and discuss the role academic career and tenure could exert on publication bias. In Section 3 we discuss the data on estimates of aid effectiveness and authors’ career characteristics. In Section 4, we review the meta-regression methodology. The publication selection bias findings are presented in Section 5. In Section 6 we explore the interactions between careers and aid industry links. Robustness checks are reported in Section 7.

Equilibrium policies become further polarized with greater partisanship as those voters with the same climate change belief hold similar ideologies.,"The environmental policy positions of the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S. have steadily become more polarized during the past decades. According to data from the League of Conservation Voters, while Republican and Democrat members of the House of Representatives voted pro-environment for related legislation respectively 30 and 60 percent of the time in 1970, these figures have been reported respectively as 5 and 94 percent in 2016.==== A similar trend can be observed in the executive branch: Recent environmental initiatives of the Trump administration include dismantling the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, which was signed into law by another Republican president in 1973, and proposals by the Environmental Protection Agency to lower vehicle and power-plant emissions standards enacted under President Obama.====In this paper, we study the electoral drivers of environmental policy polarization with a focus on the partisan divide between believers and deniers of climate change. More specifically, we ask “Which factors lead to more pro-environment or pro-industry environmental policies?”, “How do the parties' socioeconomic ideologies and heterogeneity of the voters' ideological preferences affect their choices?”, “Does income inequality play a role?”, and “Can partisanship pertaining to climate change explain the polarization observed in Congressional votes?” Our goal is to understand how various electoral trends have shaped the two parties' environmental policy proposals and starkly pushed them in opposite directions. The model we introduce offers one possible explanation for the observed environmental policy polarization. Our main results, which naturally rely on the assumptions we make about underlying fundamentals such as the marginal benefit and cost of environmental regulations, point to ideological sorting by climate change believers and deniers as a driver of policy polarization.====We model an election between two candidates who compete for the support of an electorate that is divided into four voter groups based on the amount of assets they own (high or low) and their climate change beliefs (believer or denier). Candidates are defined by their fixed socioeconomic ideologies, which may represent their stands on traditional electoral issues such as redistribution. Accordingly, we label the candidates as right and left-wing, with the latter socioeconomic ideology favoring greater redistribution. In addition, each candidate strategically chooses an environmental policy in order to maximize her vote share. Based on the candidates' platforms consisting of their socioeconomic ideologies and environmental policy proposals, voters vote sincerely for their preferred candidate.====To capture the possibility that the voters' evaluations of environmental policies might be candidate-specific, we assume that voters view the candidate with the relatively left-wing socioeconomic ideology as more effective in addressing environmental challenges due to her closer ties to environmental advocacy organizations and hence the greater enforcement expected of her. On the other hand, the right-wing candidate is the better candidate to mitigate the economic cost of regulations through relatively lax enforcement due to her proximity to the fossil fuel industry. Overall, such differences in the candidates' enforcement zeals for environmental policy imply that they affect voters' policy utilities differently on the margin. This aspect of our model builds on the differentiated candidates framework of Krasa and Polborn (2010, 2012, 2014) as it introduces a connection between the candidates' socioeconomic ideologies and their environmental policies. More specifically, our model assumes a correlation between whether a candidate is left- or right-wing and her environmental policy's effect on the voters.====We assume that high-asset denier and low-asset believer voters are hyper-partisans such that they always vote respectively for the candidate with the relatively right-wing and relatively left-wing socioeconomic ideology regardless of their policies. This is in contrast to high-asset believer and low-asset denier voters who may be swayed by the candidates' policies. When evaluating the impact of a proposed environmental regulation, such non-hyper-partisan voters face a trade-off between a more sustainable environment and higher incomes. However, while all voters enjoy environmental benefits equally, climate change believers have a higher belief compared to the deniers in human activity-induced climate change so that environmental regulations can deliver the benefit of a better environment. At the same time, high-asset voters are affected by the economic cost of regulations more than the low-asset voters, since we assume reductions in output as a result of environmental regulations would be proportional to voters' asset ownership. Thus, the income-environment trade-off a voter faces is specific to the voter group he belongs to.====The reasonable correlation of the voters' socioeconomic ideologies with their assets and beliefs in human-caused climate change motivates our assumption that high-asset denier and low-asset believer voters are hyper-partisans who always vote for a given candidate: High-asset voters are more likely to be opposed to greater redistribution as they benefit more from lower taxes, and therefore to have socioeconomic ideologies closer to the right-wing candidate. Under this condition, a combination of high-asset status and low belief in human-caused climate change results in a vote for the right-wing candidate regardless of her policies. On the other hand, low-asset believer voters with their likely preference for greater redistribution and greater belief in human-caused climate change would always choose the left-wing candidate over the right-wing one.====In equilibrium, candidates propose different policies since they impact the voters' income-environment trade-offs differently on the margin. Specifically, while a marginally stricter environmental regulation implies a greater increase in environmental utility when proposed by the left-wing candidate due to stronger enforcement, it also implies a greater decrease in economic utility. We assume that the left-wing candidate's advantage in delivering greater environmental benefits dominates her opponent's advantage in mitigating economic costs so that the left-wing candidate's policies imply a greater net marginal benefit for the voters. In turn, this implies that the left-wing candidate always proposes the relatively pro-environment (and the right-wing candidate always proposes the relatively pro-industry) policy in equilibrium. As each candidate maximizes a weighted sum of support from the two non-hyper-partisan voter groups in the electorate, the incentive to capitalize on their respective advantages with the voters leads them to resolve the income-environment trade-off in the direction of their own competency.====After characterizing the candidates' equilibrium policies, we perform comparative statics exercises to gauge the effects of various electoral trends that can be captured by the model's parameters. Our results indicate that how equilibrium policies respond to shifts in the ideological homogeneity among low-asset climate change deniers or high-asset climate change believers depends on the exact income-environment trade-off voters face from each candidate: As long as the candidate's equilibrium policy is more pro-industry than the non-hyper-partisan group's optimum, greater ideological homogeneity moves her policy in a pro-environment direction. Otherwise, the policy moves in a pro-industry direction.====We show that a positive shock to the non-hyper-partisan voters' assets always leads to more pro-industry policies as their economic concerns gain prominence vis-a-vis environmental ones. This finding implies that how greater asset inequality, that leaves the total value of the non-hyper-partisan voters' assets intact, affects environmental policies depends on the relative ideological homogeneity of high-asset believer to low-asset denier voters: When the former are ideologically more dense than the latter, greater asset inequality leads to more pro-industry policies in equilibrium.====With regards to the effects of partisanship, ideological sorting by which each climate change belief group becomes ideologically more homogeneous can account for the above-discussed evidence on environmental policy polarization. In particular, an increase in the ideological homogeneity of either non-hyper-partisan voter group can generate the observed polarization as long as candidates are sufficiently different in their enforcement effectiveness. This is consistent with evidence that is discussed in more detail during the analysis that indicates a concentration of Democratic voters in the camp of climate change believers and Republican voters in the camp of climate change deniers. This implies that climate change deniers are becoming more similar in their socioeconomic ideologies, and so are the believers, leading to an increase in the homogeneity of their socioeconomic ideologies. In turn, the candidates respond to such an increase by changing their policies in a way that is consistent with their inherent competencies, leading to further policy polarization.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We discuss the related literature in the following section, followed by the presentation of the model in Section 3. Section 4 contains the main equilibrium characterization. Based on this characterization, Section 5 presents our results on the policy effects of various electoral trends, including partisanship.

In Brazil, federal audit reports found that 79% of audited municipalities had at least one incident of corruption, and that on average 8% of the resources audited were involved in irregularities such as over-invoicing, illegal procurements, and direct diversion for private gains (Ferraz and Finan, 2011a). Such pervasive practices are not harmless and indeed have important adverse consequences; for example, Brazilian students score lower on standardized tests and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates when municipal funds destined to education are diverted away from computer labs, teaching supplies, and teacher training (Ferraz et al., 2012).====The political institutions governing a country are expected to be among the most important determinants of corruption levels (Fisman and Golden, 2017). A country can rely on its judiciary system to detect corruption and punish the responsible actors, and on citizens not to re-elect exposed corrupt politicians (Ferraz and Finan, 2008). While the threat of judiciary or electoral punishments may play a substantial role in corruption deterrence (Barro, 1973; Ferejohn, 1986; Barnett et al., 1993), it is generally a prerogative of legislatures to prevent corruption by overseeing and imposing limits to the executive power, as well as enhancing judicial accountability by denouncing episodes of corruption as they happen.====This paper studies whether legislatures indeed affect political corruption. In particular, using data from Brazil, it provides novel evidence about the impact of the number of legislators composing the city council on the extent to which politicians in the executive power engage in corrupt activities.====In Brazilian municipalities, city councilors are explicitly in charge of monitoring the use of public resources by the mayor and taking action in case of misconduct. In line with this, ==== – the largest media conglomerate in Brazil – reports the case of councilors from the municipality of ==== who denounced the mayor for over-invoicing in 2015. Another episode is the case of ==== where the city council decided to suspend the mayor in 2011 due to corruption charges.==== By exercising their duty to monitor, councilors have the potential to promote judicial accountability and impose effective limits to the executive power, which in turn may reduce political corruption. Such a mechanism should be particularly stringent for councilors from opposition parties (Poulsen and Varjao, 2019).====Nevertheless, legislators themselves are self-interested political actors who may participate in the diversion of public funds for their own private gain and/or allow the executive power to do so: either because fighting corruption is not the main priority in their political agenda or in exchange for bribes and political favors. For instance, in 2008 the ==== – a state newspaper from Paraná – reported the arrest of two councilors from the municipality of ==== for extorting money from the mayor in exchange of support for the approval of a budget increase. A different example reported by ==== is the case of a councilor's spouse from the municipality of ==== who was found to have illegally received benefits from ====, a federal cash transfer program administered at the municipality level.====As a consequence, it is difficult to predict ==== if a larger legislature would cause corruption levels to increase or decrease. Because of the ==== of councilors, the addition of an extra seat to the council could reduce corruption. On the other side, because of the ==== of councilors, an extra councilor could worsen corruption outcomes. It remains an empirical question whether the quantity of legislators plays a relevant role in the determination of corruption levels.====We approach this question in the context of Brazilian municipalities and evaluate for the first time the effect of legislature size on corruption outcomes. Moreover, based on an analysis of heterogeneity, we provide suggestive evidence on some of the underlying mechanisms. The Brazilian setting allows us to overcome two fundamental challenges related to this exercise, namely concerning measurement and identification. First, measuring corruption is problematic in many settings. On the one hand, indices of perceived corruption do not necessarily align with real corruption levels (Olken, 2009). On the other hand, judicial data on observed corruption cases conflate underlying corruption levels with the detection ability and monitoring efforts of those who denounce such cases. The Brazilian context is ideal because it allows one to build objective measures of corruption based on audits conducted by an independent federal authority, which inspects randomly-selected municipalities and adopts a set of common standard investigative procedures across municipalities. For these reasons, the reports of Brazilian federal auditors are considered highly reliable and have been widely used in the recent literature (Avis et al., 2018; Brollo et al., 2013; Ferraz and Finan, 2008, 2011a; Ferraz et al., 2012; Muço, 2017; Zamboni and Litschig, 2018). In particular, they detect a wide range of illegal practices. The most common reported irregularities are related to the spending process: illegal procurement practices, diversion of funds, over-invoicing of goods and services, as well as fraud. In this study, we use the report-based corruption measures as coded by Brollo et al. (2013).====Second, identifying the causal impact of legislative features on any type of political outcome is challenging because these features are set endogenously, usually by the legislative power itself. In fact, prior to 2004 Brazilian city councils had the power to regulate their own size facing only very broad limitations. In such a context, it would be difficult to argue that such choice is exogenous to existing corruption levels. For example, a positive correlation between council size and corruption could arise if corrupt mayors favor larger councils with the purpose of offering positions to their political affiliates. In a spirit similar to Egger and Koethenbuerger (2010) and Pettersson-Lidbom (2012), we overcome this challenge by exploiting a source of exogenous variation in council size: in 2004, a judgement by the Brazilian Supreme Court set the number of councilors in Brazilian municipalities as a deterministic and discontinuous function of population size. The decision was immediately followed by an act from the Superior Electoral Tribunal and became effective for the nationwide elections taking place in the same year. We take advantage of this rule to implement a sharp regression discontinuity design and study how an additional elected councilor affects corruption.====We estimate that a larger council size strongly increases the corruption detected in the federal audits as measured by the probability that at least one episode of corruption is found in the municipalities, indicating that the rent-seeking effect of an extra councilor dominates the monitoring effect. While the relatively limited sample does not allow the precise quantification of the effect size, our empirical design leaves little doubt about the positive direction of the effect. Indeed, these results are robust to i) polynomial and ii) bandwidth choices, iii) bias-corrected RD estimates and robust confidence intervals as proposed by Calonico et al. (2014, 2018), iv) the inclusion of a rich set of covariates, v) the use of finite-sample randomization-based inference methods, vi) permutation tests, and vii) the random exclusion of observations near the cutoff, indicating that the results do not rely on a few specific observations. Moreover, a placebo test indicates that these differences in corruption levels at the population threshold are not present for audits undertaken prior to the Supreme Court decision, when council size was essentially freely chosen by each city council independently of population size. These findings establish that, at least in the Brazilian context, legislators play a prominent role in determining the level of rent extraction imposed by a political administration.====Having established that on average the rent-seeking effect of an extra councilor dominates the monitoring effect, a remaining question is whether the latter mechanism plays a role at all, at least in some specific context. In other words, do legislators foster judicial accountability to some extent? To investigate this question, we rely on the assumption that councilors from opposition parties should play the leading role in monitoring the mayor. Clearly, they are the most interested actors in the punishment of corrupt activities carried out by the executive. As a result, enlarging the council where the opposition is typically weak should have a larger potential to increase legislative oversight and to possibly attenuate the rent-seeking effect reported above.====This is because opposition parties are underrepresented in this context and legislative oversight is likely low: the addition of an extra councilor who makes an otherwise weak opposition stronger should then have a large monitoring effect on the executive. Conversely, legislative oversight should already be high in places where the opposition is typically strong, leaving limited space for the extra councilor to contribute much to monitoring. This motivates a heterogeneity analysis where we split our sample between municipalities where mayors typically face a strong and weak opposition, as defined by the share of seats belonging to the opposition parties (rather than the mayor's coalition parties).====We provide three sets of results based on this heterogeneity analysis which support the idea that opposition councilors play a role in monitoring the executive, being able to attenuate to some degree the detrimental corruption effect of increasing council size. First, we find that the total number of parties and coalitions represented in the council increases in municipalities where the opposition is typically weak, while these figures are not affected where the opposition is typically strong. Hence, based on our assumption that legislative oversight is mainly carried out by the opposition, one should expect corruption to increase less with the addition of a council seat to an otherwise weak opposition. ==== Second, in line with this prediction, we show that council size has a large and statistically significant impact on corruption where the opposition is already strong, while it has a lesser effect - not statistically significant - where the opposition is weak. This is consistent with the idea that effectively empowering opposition parties has the potential to increase legislative oversight and to attenuate the detrimental effect of larger councils on corruption.====Finally, we provide more direct evidence that opposition parties play a role in fostering judicial accountability. We do so by studying the heterogeneous effects on the probability that mayors are sentenced for misconduct in office, which we interpret as a proxy for oversight over the executive. This measure is available for all municipalities, and not only those selected for random auditing: hence this analysis also alleviates possible concerns about the reliability of results based on a small number of audited municipalities. Consistently with the results presented above, we show that council size does not affect the probability that mayors are sentenced where the opposition is typically strong and unaffected in size by the additional of a seat in the council. Instead, the addition of a councilor increases the likelihood that mayors are sentenced in municipalities where the opposition is typically weak and strengthened by the enlargement of the council. This suggests that increasing the representativeness of opposition parties effectively fosters judicial accountability over the executive.====As an alternative channel for the effect on corruption, we also analyze whether observable characteristics of elected councilors are affected by council size. Council size does not affect average councilors' characteristics such as years of schooling, age, professional background, political alignment, and political experience. We can only find some mild evidence, not very robust across RD specifications, that larger councils have a higher probability to be composed by at least one woman (while the share of female councilors is not significantly affected).==== Overall, we interpret these results as evidence that political selection is not significantly affected by the size of the council (if anything, changes seems very mild). Nevertheless, we test whether political selection can explain the surge in corruption at the threshold by including the full set of councilors’ observable characteristics as controls in the main RD regression. We find that results virtually do not change, supporting the idea that the political selection of councilors is not a main driving force explaining the surge in corruption levels.====Given the importance of mayors in Brazil, we also check for differences across the threshold for a rich set of mayors' characteristics. Mayors' characteristics are generally balanced, with the only exceptions being that mayors in larger-council municipalities are more likely to have served as public employees and to have retired from the labor force in the past. Again, we assess whether the effect of council size on corruption works through political selection by including in our RD regressions mayors' characteristics. The results on corruption remain essentially unchanged when these controls are included. Based on this evidence, our interpretation is that effects on mayors and councilors’ attributes are unlikely to explain the strong results on corruption incidence.====Another important aspect that is possibly related to council size and could play a role in explaining the positive effect on corruption is the size of the public budget. The “law of 1/n” predicts that public spending will increase as the legislature becomes larger if legislators consider only the benefits brought by public projects to their own constituents, but do not internalize the costs which are borne by all taxpayers (Weingast et al., 1981). In turn, a larger budget could leave more room for politicians to extract personal rents (Brollo et al., 2013). However, in our context we find that council size affects neither the total revenues nor the total spending of the municipalities. Given the Brazilian context, one possible explanation for this result relates to the fact that most municipal revenues derive from transfers set at the federal level and the fact that spending is severely constrained by a budget law which imposes penal responsibilities for mayors not respecting the budgetary limits. As a result, municipalities have relatively low levels of freedom to raise resources or increase spending through debt.==== Therefore, the public budget and spending does not seem to be part of a relevant channel explaining the surge in corruption levels.====This paper contributes to the broad literature on the determinants of corruption, and more specifically to the research estimating the effects of political institutions on corruption. Seminal studies providing both the theoretical foundations and the first observational cross-national and sub-national evidence on the role of electoral rules on corruption (Chang, 2005; Chang and Golden, 2007; Kunicová and Rose-Ackerman, 2005; Persson et al., 2003) have been complemented by more recent studies employing quasi-experimental methods, which have focused on electoral accountability (Ferraz and Finan, 2008), re-election incentives (Ferraz and Finan, 2011a), differences between electoral systems (Mignozzetti, 2019; Rudolph and Däubler, 2016), and tenure in office (Coviello and Gagliarducci, 2017).====This study also adds evidence to the literature on legislature size and government spending. A significant strand of theoretical literature investigates how legislature size affects public spending (Primo and Snyder, 2008; Weingast et al., 1981). At the same time, only few studies have been able to credibly assess this relationship empirically, reaching mixed results. On the one hand, Bradbury and Crain (2001) and Egger and Koethenbuerger (2010) find support for the “law of 1/n” based on cross-country data and a regression discontinuity design with German data, respectively. ==== On the other hand, Pettersson-Lidbom (2012) finds an opposite effect employing a regression discontinuity design based on data from Finland and Sweden. ====Methodologically, our study adds to a long list of papers using regression discontinuity designs based on population thresholds to study the effect of different features of municipal governments on political and economic outcomes, such as the effect of politicians wage on performance (Ferraz and Finan, 2011b; Gagliarducci and Nannicini, 2013; van der Linde et al., 2014), of proportionality, ballot structure and other electoral rules and procedures on voter turnout and voting (Barone and de Blasio, 2013; Eggers, 2015; Fujiwara, 2011; Gulino, 2020; Hopkins, 2011; Pellicer and Wegner, 2013; Sanz, 2017), of gender quotas on women representation in politics (Bagues and Campa, 2020; Casas-Arce and Saiz, 2015) (see Eggers et al. (2018) for more examples and a recent methodological discussion). In particular, beyond the studies of Egger and Koethenbuerger (2010), Hirota and Yunoue (2012), Höhmann (2017), Koethenbuerger (2012), Lewis (2019), and Pettersson-Lidbom (2012) mentioned above on the size of the public budget, several other papers are closely related to our study in that they use population cutoffs to document the effect of council size on other municipal outcomes such as the efficiency of public-goods delivery (Chacón and Garbiras-Diaz, 2017), welfare as measured by education and health outcomes (Mignozzetti and Cepaluni, 2019), voter turnout because of changes in pivotality (Lyytikäinen and Tukiainen, 2019), ideological cohesion between same-party candidates because of effective differences in electoral rule proportionality (Matakos et al., 2018), and the political representation of non-traditional parties with paramilitary links and its effect on conflict-related violence (Galindo-Silva, 2019).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the institutional background. In Section 3, we describe the data and empirical strategy.

More importantly, I show that the role of trust has been overlooked since high levels of trust do not always enhance desirable economic outcomes. Trust helps individuals to participate in economic exchanges aligned with social welfare, but it also facilitates individuals to cooperate for the achievement of corrupt deals. Under this more general view of trust, the model generates a non-trivial new prediction at the individual level. Specifically, the individual-level relationship between honesty and trust changes depending on the institutional quality of a country. Dishonest individuals are the more trusting individuals in countries with poor institutions, and the less trusting in countries with good institutions. Using individual-level data of 80 countries from the World Value Survey and the European Values Study, I present empirical evidence in support of this prediction.","Trust towards strangers is associated with a number of socially desirable economic outcomes.==== At the aggregate level, it is positively correlated with income, growth, financial development, a good performance of larger firms, the quality of institutions, and low corruption (Putnam, 1993; La Porta et al., 1997; Knack and Keefer, 1997; Zak and Knack, 2001; Guiso et al., 2004, 2010; Tabellini, 2008, 2010; Algan and Cahuc, 2010). At the individual level, it is correlated with income, education, and entrepreneurship (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002; Guiso et al., 2006; Batsaikhan, 2017).====One possible interpretation of these links is that there is a causal effect of trust towards strangers on economic outcomes (Algan and Cahuc, 2010; Tabellini, 2010), since trust might assist individuals in achieving socially desirable economic exchanges with strangers in the presence of asymmetric information. At the same time, there is also the view that trust is shaped by the current environment (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002). For example, individuals may trust strangers if current institutions successfully enforce the law. In this paper I show that trust towards strangers may indeed be a channel through which institutions determine economic outcomes. However, this paper highlights an ambivalent role for trust that has often been overlooked in the existing literature: trusting strangers might not only facilitate cooperation for the pursuit of socially desirable economic exchanges, but it might also promote cooperation for the achievement of illegal transactions.====I focus on the dimension of trust towards strangers that concerns to economic exchanges in which an individual ==== does not completely know if a non-personally known individual ==== is going to provide what individual ==== expects. For example, in the market of second-hand cars, a buyer trusts a seller when the buyer believes that the seller is not providing lemons. On the other hand, in the market of illegal drugs, a buyer trusts a seller when the buyer believes that the seller is supplying high-quality drugs. Certainly, trusting strangers might bring about economic exchanges which are socially desirable but also some others which are not. Given the structure of these situations, I define the ability of an individual ==== to trust a stranger ==== as a situation in which an individual ==== believes that a non-personally known individual ==== will do something that is exactly what ==== is expecting.====Undoubtedly, there are more dimensions and interpretations of trust towards strangers that one can think of. Nevertheless, the considered interpretation of this paper is a natural one in the specific context of economic exchanges with asymmetric information, and it fits to the standard view on trust discussed in the literature. For instance, in his seminal work, Gambetta (2000) defines trust as “a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent assesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action, both before he(/she) can monitor such an action (or independently of his(/her) capacity ever to be able to monitor it) and in a context in which it affects his(/her) own action”. Moreover, he adds that when we trust someone, “we implicitly mean that the probability that he(/she) will perform an action that is beneficial or at least not detrimental to us is high enough for us to consider engaging in some form of cooperation with him(/her)”. Note that this last statement implies that the ability of an individual ==== to trust a non-personally known individual ====, in the presence of asymmetric information, can generate beneficial results for both of them. Nevertheless, it is not necessary that the consequences that derive from ==== trusting ==== need to be also beneficial for the rest of society. Precisely, this latter result is the extra assumption that previous literature has also implicitly made. On the contrary, in this article I do not impose any effect of trusting on the rest of society, which is literally what allows me to analyze from a theoretical and an empirical point of view this “dark side” of trusting strangers.====Accordingly, in order to study these two sides of trusting strangers, I introduce a model with two markets, a legal and an illegal one, in a context of asymmetric information. In the model, institutional quality determines the individual levels of trust towards strangers, and those levels of trust affect the following two economic outcomes: entrepreneurship and corruption. In particular, trusting strangers is used for cooperation in economic exchanges in which individuals do not completely know if the other part is going to provide what they expect. These economic exchanges can take place in the legal market or in the illegal one. Whereas trust always assists individuals to bring about transactions that are privately beneficial for them, institutional quality determines whether these exchanges have desirable or undesirable consequences for the rest of society. Individuals willing to engage in lawful transactions trust strangers only when institutions successfully enforce the law. However, individuals who are ready to commit illegal exchanges trust strangers to reciprocate their deals only when institutions cannot enforce the law.====More specifically, I propose a model in which the population is divided into desirable producers, undesirable producers, bureaucrats and consumers. I assume that individuals in the model do not know each other. Desirable and undesirable producers need to decide whether to engage in a home activity where they produce for personal consumption or to become entrepreneurs and sell goods to consumers. However, undesirable producers make useless goods when becoming entrepreneurs, and there is a problem of adverse selection since consumers cannot observe if an entrepreneur is a desirable or an undesirable producer. In order to prevent consumers from buying useless goods, there is a regulatory agency composed of bureaucrats. They can distinguish between the two types of producers and are supposed to issue required licenses for becoming an entrepreneur, the purpose of which is to screen out undesirable producers. However, bureaucrats endogenously choose whether to be honest and act in the public interest, or whether to be corruptible and issue licenses to undesirable producers in exchange for a bribe. For simplicity, I assume that desirable producers can always obtain a license without needing to offer a bribe, and that only undesirable producers have to bribe to obtain the required license. There is also asymmetric information between producers and bureaucrats since the former do not observe if the latter have endogenously chosen to be corruptible or not. Thus, this is a model of asymmetric information with a final goods market and a market for bribes.====The effects of bureaucrats allowing the entry of undesirable producers into the entrepreneurial activity are a reduction in the average quality of goods sold on the market and, as a result, a decline in the equilibrium price. Consequently, desirable producers and consumers are not keen on corruption since it is detrimental for them. For its part, undesirable producers are better off with corruptible bureaucrats, since it is precisely what enables them to become entrepreneurs and does not negatively affect them. Thus, desirable producers and consumers do not tolerate corruption, whereas undesirable producers always tolerate it. Finally, I also assume that there is a positive probability that a corrupt deal between a bureaucrat and an undesirable producer is discovered and, in such a case, the bureaucrat is fired and the undesirable producer cannot sell the good on the market. This probability is a proxy for the institutional quality of a country. In the model, institutional quality, the bureaucrats’ wage and the proportion of desirable producers are exogenous, and constitute the current environment; while trust towards strangers, the decision of becoming an entrepreneur, and corruption are all endogenous.====As discussed above, an individual ==== has the ability to trust a non-personally known individual ==== when ==== believes that ==== will do something that is beneficial for ====. Hence, in the context of the model, trusting strangers is defined as the individual ===='s belief that a stranger ==== will do something that is beneficial for ====. Correspondingly, consumers' trust towards strangers is modeled as the belief that a stranger (an entrepreneur) is a desirable producer and sells high-quality goods. That is, consumers trust strangers when they expect a stranger to do something that is good for themselves. Likewise, desirable producers' trust towards strangers is the belief that a stranger (a bureaucrat) is honest and does not allow the entrance of undesirable producers into the entrepreneurial activity through corruption, since this lowers the equilibrium price and therefore the profits of desirable producers. Finally, undesirable producers' trust towards strangers is the belief that a stranger (a bureaucrat) is corruptible and accepts bribes allowing them to obtain a license. That is, both desirable and undesirable producers trust strangers when they expect a stranger to do something that is good for themselves. Hence, the trust of consumers and desirable producers bring about cooperation for the achievement of legal economic exchanges. On the contrary, the trust of undesirable producers helps them to cooperate with bureaucrats to circumvent a regulation.====The economics literature on trust has taken different approaches to incorporate trust in a theoretical setting. For instance, Zak and Knack (2001) introduce trust as the time not spent in verifying others, Gennaioli et al. (2012) think of trust as a factor that decreases the losses produced by taking risk. And, similar to this paper, trust has also been modeled as the belief that someone is of a given type or that someone will do a particular action (Cabral, n.d.; Carlin et al., 2009; Butler et al., 2016; Rohner et al., 2013). For instance, Carlin et al. (2009) propose a theoretical model in which a group of heterogeneous agents sell an investment opportunity to a group of clients. Agents can choose to act in the interest of their customers or act opportunistically and ignore their customers' welfare. In their model, the clients’ trust is the proportion of agents who act in the best interest of their customers. Correspondingly, my definition of trust is aligned with this one. However, while in Carlin et al. (2009) trust is used to legally invest in a market, in my model, trust can also be used to cooperate for the achievement of corrupt deals.====Moreover, my setting incorporates the essential elements of a corruption model according to Burguet et al. (2016), who review the undertaken research on corruption of the last three decades. They show that a standard model of corruption is usually based on a principal-supervisor-client setting. The proposed model in this paper is, in fact, a reduced version of this structure. Specifically, there is an agency composed of bureaucrats (supervisor) who are delegated the task to screen out undesirable producers from the market and act in the interest of desirable producers and consumers (principal). Nevertheless, bureaucrats might collude with undesirable producers (client) and negatively affect desirable producers and consumers. Thus, the novelty of this paper does not lie on the way of modeling corruption, but in considering the role that trust can play in an illegal setting such as the market for bribes.====The model has a unique equilibrium that depends on institutional quality, the bureaucrat's wage and the share of undesirable producers. When institutional quality is good enough, bureaucrats do not accept bribes. Consequently, desirable producers completely trust strangers and become entrepreneurs. Undesirable producers, in their turn, distrust strangers and engage in home production. As a result, consumers fully trust strangers. Altogether, the aggregate level of trust towards strangers is high and corruption is nonexistent. Conversely, when institutional quality is poor enough, bureaucrats are ready to accept bribes. Undesirable producers trust strangers, and as a consequence, some of them become entrepreneurs through corruption. Desirable producers, in turn, distrust strangers and some of them no longer engage in the entrepreneurial activity, since the entrance of undesirable producers in the entrepreneurial activity crowds them out. In consequence, consumers trust strangers less than in the first case. As a whole, if institutional quality is poor enough, the aggregate level of trust is low and corruption is high. Thus, if countries have different levels of institutional quality, the model reproduces the negative cross-country correlation between trust towards strangers and corruption. Not surprisingly, good institutions generate high aggregate levels of trust towards strangers and low corruption.====Therefore, under the more complex view of trust considered in this paper with respect to the unambiguously positive one which dominates in the literature, the model does not contradict the well-known negative correlation between trust towards strangers and corruption across countries. Nevertheless, the model generates a non-trivial new prediction at the individual level. Individuals who tolerate corruption (undesirable producers) have the highest levels of trust when institutions are bad. Conversely, individuals who do not tolerate corruption (desirable producers and consumers) hold the highest levels of trust when institutions are good. Therefore, the individual-level relationship between honesty and trust towards strangers changes depending on the institutional quality of a country. In countries with good enough institutional quality, more honest individuals are also the more trusting ones. However, in countries with poor enough institutional quality, more dishonest individuals are the more trusting ones. Using data from individuals of 80 countries from the World Value Survey and the European Values Study, I present empirical evidence in support of this prediction.====Challenging the established view, this prediction highlights that trust towards strangers is a doubled-edged sword. In general, and in the context of legal businesses, trusting strangers might help entrepreneurs to follow their honest activities since many deals are done by just shaking hands in the business environment. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs willing to bribe an unknown bureaucrat need to trust the bureaucrat to not report them to the police and accept the bribe, and more importantly, to act as expected since corrupt deals cannot be enforced by any type of legal contract by their nature. Thus, trusting strangers might also assist entrepreneurs to accomplish corrupt transactions. Summing up, I show that trusting strangers can promote cooperation for both socially desirable and harmful activities. Consequently, this paper is also connected to the growing literature which identifies the dark side of social capital (Lampe and Johansen, 2003; Satyanath et al., 2017).====The model in this paper is similar to the one proposed by Aghion et al. (2010) in the sense that in both models there exist some individuals who need to choose between engaging in an entrepreneurial activity or into an outside option. In their model, however, before deciding what to work on, individuals also have to choose between becoming civic or uncivic. Those individuals who engage in the entrepreneurial activity and who are uncivic impose a negative externality on others. Furthermore, individuals endogenously choose between having an unregulated market or introducing a regulatory agency that can potentially reduce negative externalities albeit forges the favorable conditions for corruption to emerge. The main mechanism of their paper is that the inability to trust others fosters the need for regulation and, at the same time, regulation prevents the creation of trust. This mechanism in Aghion et al. (2010) leads to multiple equilibria. Having multiple equilibria is what allows Aghion et al. (2010) to explain the negative cross-country relationship that exists between trust and regulation and between trust and corruption. My model is also capable of generating this latter relationship. Nonetheless, the equilibrium in my model is unique and depends on several exogenous parameters that include institutional quality. Thus, it is institutional quality that determines whether a country is corrupt or honest and at the same time affects trust. The better institutional quality, the lower corruption, and the higher trust. However, the main addition of my paper is new insight into the role that trust can play in an economy. While Aghion et al. (2010) think of trust as a belief about civicness that determines the equilibrium, I model trust as a belief that can explicitly be used to facilitate socially desirable economic exchanges but might, as well, facilitate the achievement of illegal and corrupt transactions. Hence, I show that trust towards strangers might be a channel through which institutions determine economic outcomes that might be legal but also illegal.====Finally, my model also predicts that the higher the share of desirable producers in an economy, the higher the incentives for bureaucrats and undesirable producers to bring about corrupt transactions since they can get higher economic payoffs, and, consequently, the higher institutional quality needed to fight corruption. This suggests that if the number of desirable producers increases, a country should implement policies that improve the quality of institutions.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the model. Section 3 empirically tests the main prediction of the model and, finally, section 4 concludes.","Entrepreneurship, trust and corruption",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300859,4 September 2020,2020,Research Article,146.0

Theoretical explanations have relied on either financial access or political-economic factors to justify this phenomenon. In this paper, we model the fiscal-output relationship as a dcc-garch process, and inquire whether debt or political economy constraints play a comparatively more important role in conditioning this correlation. Our evidence favors a positive effect from political economy, with weaker and more mixed results pertaining to financial access. Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that politics-induced procyclicality appears to be driven by advanced economies, and fiscal rules exacerbate procyclical tendencies.","In December 2017, the United States Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The law led to a swelling of the budget deficit by $780 billion in 2018 (and added another $2.3 trillion to the national debt), and famously occurred amid already solid late-cycle growth conditions. This example is not unique to the latest U.S. administration. In the midst of the first Obama term, a failure to extend the Great Recession-related stimulus package led to spending cutbacks even in a weak economy. And more recently in Europe, German policymakers—citing its infamous ==== balanced-budget rule—remained reticent to calls for fiscal support in 2019, even as the economy was on the skids.====Fiscal procyclicality—the tendency to enact expansionary fiscal policy during a boom and ====—is by no means confined to advanced economies. Smaller economies as diverse as the Congo, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Saudi Arabia have, at numerous instances in their recent history, chosen to expand government expenditures even while enjoying already-strong economic performance (and contracted in the face of recession). Yet economic theory militates in favor of countercyclical—or at least acyclical—fiscal policy, which renders the relatively widespread nature of procyclicality somewhat of a puzzle.====The pervasiveness and persistence of fiscal procyclicality has led to the emergence of two major schools of thought on why we observe procyclicality in practice. The first stakes the argument on constraints to financial access faced by governments, due to reasons such as credit frictions (Aizenman et al., 2000), incomplete markets (Cuadra et al., 2010), or commitment difficulties (Bauducco and Caprioli, 2014). The second places the onus on political economy complications, such as electoral rules (Persson and Tabellini, 2004), political polarization (Ilzetzki, 2011), or corruption (Alesina et al., 2008). Yet despite the distinctiveness of these two competing explanations, there has been little effort at systematically comparing the relative contributions of each to the overall phenomenon of procyclicality.====In this paper, we take on the question of evaluating competing explanations for fiscal cyclicality.==== Our approach first constructs measures of the time-varying relationship between fiscal spending and economic activity that is robust to a non-normal data generating process. In particular, we model the variations in the fiscal-output relationship as a multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (garch) process exhibiting dynamic conditional correlation (dcc). We then jointly evaluate the relative importance of financial access and political economy explanations for procyclical behavior, at both the cross-sectional as well as panel levels.====Overall, our evidence favors a positive effect due to political economy—as proxied by a measure of political participation—for procyclical fiscal policy, consistent with theory. This effect is distinct from the more common phenomenon of ==== business cycles (which attributes economic fluctuations to political drivers), since business cycles ==== tend to occur more infrequently than events on the political calendar. The effects of financial access—as proxied by the outstanding debt burden—are weaker and more mixed. We also find that the debt-related positive association for government consumption becomes negative with respect to government expenditure, suggesting that the public investment component of spending, if financially-unconstrained, could actually be countercyclical in nature, or that political influence operates via the transfer payments channel. Interestingly, secondary analyses also reveal that much of the politics-induced procyclicality in our full sample is driven by advanced, rather than developing, economies.====Existing empirical approaches often rely on estimates of cyclicality based either on discrete partitions of the data (e.g. correlations over a given time period), or on temporally-static coefficient estimates obtained from regressions of policy on a measure of cyclically-adjusted output. The problem with the first approach is that such partitions are arbitrary (and hence may be either artificially oversensitive or insensitive to temporal changes in correlations), while the concern with the second is that estimates may suffer from endogeneity (from reverse causality as income itself reacts to fiscal policy, omitted variables due to common unobserved confounders, or measurement error bias since the output gap is unobserved) along with imprecision (because heteroskedasticity resulting from the volatility of the business cycle can bias correlation estimates====). Taken together, these measurement issues cast doubt on whether the estimated procyclical relationship is genuine. In comparison, our dcc approach explicitly accounts for time-varying idiosyncratic changes in the evolution of the fiscal-output relationship, embeds all available historical information, while simultaneously allowing for heteroskedastic and leptokurtic features in the underlying data generating process.====Moreover, our reliance on a multivariate garch model means that we are able to directly accommodate the possibility that financial or political drivers alter our measure of procyclicality, without the need to secure plausible instrumental variables for either government spending or output. Although garch methods nevertheless inherit the identification problem associated with endogeneity, our approach allows us to adopt an agnostic stance on whether we have satisfied exclusion restrictions for potential candidate instruments, and instead focus on how the conditional correlation changes when these factors are introduced.====The question of whether fiscal policy tends to be procyclical has been directly taken on in a number of empirical papers. The majority of these papers find fairly strong evidence of procyclical behavior in developing economies (Alesina et al., 2008; Calderón et al., 2016; Frankel et al., 2013; Gavin and Perotti, 1997). In contrast, while some authors have argued that advanced economies tend to subscribe to countercyclical policies (Galí et al., 2003; Lane, 2003), others find little evidence of cyclicality in either direction (Bashar et al., 2017; Talvi and Végh, 2005). Moreover, even among OECD economies, certain conditions—notably political concentration—may increase the likelihood of running procyclical fiscal policies (Lane, 2003). Many of these analyses have been limited to a set of similar economies, for a comparatively brief time period. One of the advances we make in this paper is to expand our working sample to as many as 44 advanced and developing economies, with time spans for some nations extending to as long as 1800–2015. The extended temporal coverage is especially important, since it allows us to encapsulate many more occurrences of business cycles.====Importantly, many of these papers have sought to empirically account for how either financial imperfections or political confounders can explain procyclical fiscal choices. Most papers in the former category have found evidence that underscores the importance of financial access. Gavin and Perotti (1997), for example, demonstrate that reliance on emergency finance appears to spike during bad times, supporting the notion that borrowing constraints become more binding during contractions. Kaminsky et al. (2005) document that both fiscal policy as well as capital inflows are procyclical in emerging markets—consistent with the idea that reduced financing may be a relevant channel—while Aizenman et al. (2019) find that governments in more indebted countries (and thereby less able to obtain additional credit) tend to spend more in good times, and ====.====Studies in the latter group have likewise ascertained how political economy matters. Lane (2003) and Alesina et al. (2008), for instance, find that when political competition is greater, fiscal policy often ends up exacerbating the business cycle (competition in these respective papers are captured by measures of political constraints and political participation, respectively), while government corruption can further exacerbate the degree of procyclicality. Abbott et al. (2015) also find that the coincidence of political party control at federal and state levels increases the likelihood that state legislatures accommodate rent seeking (Abbott et al., 2015). More generally, Calderón et al. (2016) show that higher levels of institutional quality better equip policymakers to resist pressures to engage in procyclical fiscal expenditures.====One common shortcoming among most of these “determinants” studies is that they seldom test for the relevance of the financial access and political economy channels side-by-side. Part of the reason is the difficulty in addressing endogeneity, which requires finding valid instruments. One example is Brückner and Gradstein (2014), who utilize weather shock instruments to resolve the endogeneity issues afflicting the government spending response.==== In contrast, our approach here sidesteps this thorny problem by, first, deriving correlations from the ==== variance-covariance matrix of error terms (instead of from estimated coefficients, which may be more subject to simultaneity bias); and, second, by directly embedding our variables of interest into the multivariate system, and comparing the resulting changes in conditional correlations.====Fiscal procyclicality has also been touched on, albeit tangentially, in the literature on fiscal multipliers (see, for example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012b,2012a; Candelon and Lieb, 2013; Favero et al., 2011). In most such instances, multipliers are conditional on, ====, the state of the business cycle. Consequently, the fact that recession (expansion)-phase multipliers are larger (smaller) indirectly suggests a diminished benefit to the pursuit of procyclical policy.==== However, the unique conditions surrounding business cycle turning points caution against such generous interpretations against procyclicality on the basis of such indirect evidence.",The political economy of fiscal procyclicality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300781,4 September 2020,2020,Research Article,147.0

But ever since the Great Depression, international externalities and spillovers have exposed the international public good character of financial stability and the need for international regulation and safety nets. International safety nets would help mitigate the adverse effects of global financial and liquidity shocks and international regulation would aim to prevent national regulatory deficiencies and beggar-thy-neighbour policies.====As a lesson of the Great Depression and World War II, the International Monetary Fund was created as an international credit provider. Following severe disturbances in international currency and banking markets, the then Group of Ten countries in 1974 established the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as a forum for cooperation on banking supervision. However, it took until the 1980s until international rules for the financial sector were agreed, starting with the Basel Accord in 1988 on capital requirements (Kapstein, 1989; Monticelli, 2019).====Though evolving, international and national financial regulation has repeatedly proven highly deficient, as numerous crisis over recent decades and the global financial crisis show. The global financial crisis also brought to the fore broader economic and political stability risks.==== In 2009, the G20, in conjunction with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and its 24 member countries, agreed to develop and implement the third Basel package, a new set of international rules for banking, insurance, derivatives and asset management with a particular focus on addressing systemic aspects.==== As members have been implementing the agenda over the 2010s, the BCBS has monitored progress closely and the FSB has regularly reported on this progress to the G20 (FSB, 2015–2019).====This paper analyses whether the implementation of international financial regulation, and specifically, the set of Basel III regulations, appears to reflect cooperative behaviour between countries with the aim of internalising externalities and committing to stronger financial sectors, or whether special interests have had a determining influence via lobbying for delayed implementation. The study focuses on the implementation of key regulatory provisions for banking, notably capital, liquidity and long-term funding, resolution and recovery planning and OTC derivatives requirements.====It finds that the size of the banking sector and the presence of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are positively associated with a stronger implementation record. These results suggest that cooperative motives of internalising externalities, creating a level playing field and preserving financial stability play a role in explaining the implementation record. We find evidence that this cooperative behaviour may be driven by the self-interest of global players as the positive record is particularly strong in countries where large banking sectors and big banks are both present, and where regulation only applies to large players. Sectoral concentration, bank health and the share of foreign ownership show more mixed signals as regards their impact on implementation.====The empirical strategy does not allow us to unambiguously determine whether these jurisdictions cooperate for the common interest or due to the self-interest of domestic but globally operating industries. However, the fact that countries with large banking industries and G-SIBs and those where the rules only apply to big banks have a better implementation record suggests that cooperation due to the self-interest of the (global) players may be an important motive. It may also point to the pursuit of narrow special interests by smaller domestic banks.====Our results are consistent with the literature that emphasises the benefits of regulation and the adverse effects of regulatory capture, but it also shows that in practice, these dynamics may be more nuanced and that international and industry interests may have become more aligned. More work is needed to understand the implementation record and differentiate more clearly between the underlying motives.",The political economy of the G20 agenda on financial regulation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300896,30 August 2020,2020,Research Article,148.0

This paper studies how immigrants affect public health expenditure across Italian regions during the period 2003–2016 using NUTS II level data. Identification strategy is based on shift–share instruments, which are made robust to pull factors that might attract immigrants in Italy and to internal migration of natives. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in immigrants over total resident population leads to a decrease in public health expenditure per capita by about 3.8% (i.e. around 69 euro per capita). Among possible channels, we find no support for any crowding out effect from public to private health services by natives due to increasing immigration or for any role played by different levels of efficiency across regional health systems. Our results are driven by immigrants' demographic structure: they are mostly males and younger workers that call for less health spending, according to a positive selection mechanism. Moreover, linguistic barriers contribute to limiting the immigrants' reliance on public healthcare, which is confirmed also by the use of the European Health Interview Survey microdata.","Immigration is a structural phenomenon in Europe and the debate on its socio–economic consequences, especially on the labour market (e.g., D'Amuri et al., 2010; Docquier et al., 2019), has intensified in recent years due to the increasing pressure on countries on the external borders of the European Union (EU).====The migratory crisis in the Mediterranean is also translated into a growing public perception that immigrants are a fiscal burden in Europe and take advantage of generous welfare states (Nannestad, 2007; Razin and Wahba, 2015; Alesina et al., 2018). According to 2018 Eurobarometer data, over half (56%) of EU–28 respondents agree that immigrants are a burden on their country's welfare system and this share increases to 63% in the case of Italian citizens.====Actually, the related empirical evidence is mixed. Immigrants are more likely to receive welfare benefits than the native population in the United States (Borjas and Hilton, 1996; Borjas, 2011) whereas a substantial dispersion in immigrants' participation in the welfare state is observed across EU countries (Boeri et al., 2002; Boeri, 2010). A negative net effect on welfare systems is not supported by existing studies (Preston, 2014); on the contrary, immigrants often result as net contributors to public finances (Dustmann et al., 2010; Dustmann and Frattini, 2014; OECD, 2013). The effects of immigration on education expenditure and redistribution have been widely analyzed. Speciale (2012) shows that an increase in foreign population in EU-15 countries had a negative effect on public education expenditure between 1987 and 1999 due to more heterogeneous societies calling for less redistribution (Alesina et al., 1999). The same happened for public school spending in Spain due to the large 2000–2008 wave of immigration (Tanaka et al., 2018). On the other hand Gaston and Rajaguru (2013) provide evidence of immigration leading policy–makers to raise welfare state spending across several OECD countries in order to compensate for the increased sense of vulnerability felt by native workers.====Less explored, until recent years, is the impact of immigrants on healthcare in host countries. Existing studies have mostly dealt with the access to health services and their utilization. Norredam and Krasnik (2011) point out that immigrants' access to health care differs from that of non–migrants, while Wadsworth (2013) finds no significant difference in hospital stays and visits to general practitioners between immigrants and natives in both UK and Germany. Also in Spain immigrants use hospital and general practitioners' services at about the same rate as the native population (Antón and Muñoz de Bustillo, 2010); at the same time, however, they have lower access to specialist care services and make more frequent use of emergency rooms. Evidence in this direction has been provided also for Italy, where access to specialist doctors and preventive care is lower among non–EU citizens, while their likelihood to contact emergency services is higher (Devillanova and Frattini, 2016).====Other recent works show how immigration affects the job quality and working conditions of natives as well as their health outcomes. In the UK immigrants perform the most strenuous, physically intensive and riskiest low–skilled jobs thereby contributing to a significant reduction of the average physical burden among native workers (Giuntella et al., 2019). At the same time, immigrants exhibit lower injury rates compared to natives, with a positive impact on the overall costs related to workplace injuries. Similar evidence has been provided for Germany, where immigrants are more likely to perform blue–collar tasks and therefore to be exposed to work–related risks for longer periods of time than their native counterparts (Giuntella and Mazzonna, 2015). This has a direct impact on the health trajectory of the native population by reducing the number of hours worked and the degree of physical intensity especially among low–skilled native males employed in blue–collar jobs. As far as Italy is concerned, immigration seems to exert a beneficial effect on the quality of native employment by decreasing the likelihood of working non–standard hours (Giuntella, 2012).====So far, to the best of our knowledge, no specific evidence has been provided on the direct impact of immigration on public health spending in European host countries, with possible implications for their welfare systems and public finances. In order to fill this gap, this paper analyses how immigrants affect public health spending during the period 2003–2016 in Italian regions. Italy is a prominent case for several reasons. Concerning immigration, the share of legal immigrants over total population rose from less than 3% at the beginning of 2000s to more than 8% in 2016 (i.e. over 5 million people), thereby denoting an increasing trend of the phenomenon with high variability across regions. More than 90% of immigrants come from countries that suffer from a large economic divide and offer lower social protection to their citizens (e.g., Central and Eastern Europe, North Africa, East Asia).====Concerning health spending, it has become an undisputed regional government responsibility in Italy (Costa-Font and Turati, 2017). Since the constitutional reform in 2001, each region is autonomous in the health management sector, which currently absorbs nearly three quarters of the regional budget (Ferrario and Zanardi, 2011).==== This translates into twenty different health systems – one for each Italian region, with Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy (both in the North of the country) often quoted as extreme virtuous cases (Bordignon and Turati, 2009). In this respect, performing an empirical analysis according to the NUTS II classification==== is essential in order to capture significant differences in health spending across regions.====The increase of health spending tasks assigned to Italian regions due to decentralization reforms combined with the rapid surge in immigration inflows since the early 2000s, due to the Eastern EU enlargement and, more in general, to the deepening globalization process, make our period of analysis (2003–2016) rather interesting to address our research question.====In order to investigate the causal impact of immigrants on public health spending, endogeneity concerns have to be taken into account. First, according to the “welfare magnet” hypothesis (Borjas, 1999; De Giorgi and Pellizzari, 2009; Razin and Wahba, 2015), immigrants normally locate into areas where welfare benefits – including health – are higher; reverse causality could therefore bias the estimated effect of immigrants on public health expenditure. Second, unobserved pull factors might cause a spurious correlation between the two variables. We therefore adopt an instrumental variable approach that takes into account the role of “migration networks” (Munshi, 2003; McKenzie and Rapoport, 2010) in determining the geographical distribution of immigrants from the same origin into destination areas. The instrument is built as a weighted average of the current stock of immigrants by origin, where the weights are represented by the regional share of the immigrant stock by each single origin in 1994, that is ten years before the beginning of our sample period. In particular, in order to improve the quality of the instrument, compared to the traditional shift–share approach a la Card (2001), we build a weighted average of immigration stocks into EU–15 countries other than Italy (Bianchi et al., 2012). By excluding Italy, all pull factors linked to the attractiveness of Italian regions are removed and push factors related to the countries of origin can be better isolated. As a further refinement of the identification strategy, we compute this predicted immigration share not over the actual resident population – which may be affected by pull factors as well – but over the predicted resident population according to the 1994 distribution of population at the regional level (see Bratti and Conti, 2018). This strengthens the exogeneity of the instruments with respect to natives' internal mobility patterns in response to increasing immigration. As a matter of fact, Mocetti and Porello (2010) show that traditional South-North flows of low–educated natives have been displaced by immigrant concentration in the Northern regions. At the same time, regions attracting immigrants, especially the most urbanized areas, benefit also from high–skilled native inflows.====We find a robust negative relationship between the share of immigrants over total population and public health expenditure. In terms of magnitude, a 1 percentage point increase in the immigrant population over total population leads to a decrease in public health expenditure per capita by about 3.8% (i.e. about 69 euro per capita). The negative relationship is confirmed also when: ==== we check for any bias in the results due to the presence of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers in recent years; ==== we take into account fiscal consolidation measures, following the recent economic crisis, that affected aggregate public spending, including the health sector. Moreover, we find that an increase in immigrant population, although having a negative effect on per capita health expenditure, does not worsen health outcomes for the resident population.====We hence investigate the mechanisms that might drive the negative relationship between immigration and public health spending. We first rule out any possible crowding out effect from public to private health services by showing that immigrants do not increase natives' private health expenditure. Secondly, we exclude that different levels of health system efficiency across Italian regions (Piacenza and Turati, 2014) might determine our results as higher shares of immigrants are associated with lower health spending even when controlling for healthcare efficiency at regional level. The main driver of our results is the immigrants' demographic structure: the negative effect on public health expenditure is mostly due to the male component and the working age group. Put differently, male and working–age immigrants (i.e.15–64 years old) call for less health spending. Both results suggest the existence of a positive selection mechanism, the so–called “healthy immigrant effect” (Chiswick et al., 2008; Farré, 2016; Constant et al., 2018), when immigration takes place, which helps also explaining the reason why a larger share of immigrants on the resident population is associated, ====, with a lower mortality rate.====Additionally, we find that the existence of entry barriers such as language limits immigrants' access to public healthcare and may contribute to explain the negative effect on health spending in our sample. Given the role played by both the demographic structure and the language barriers, we finally look at the access to different types of health services by immigrants compared to the native–born population using the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS). The results confirm that immigrants show a lower propensity to consult specialist doctors and to rely on screening and preventive practices compared to the native population.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Since political competition is associated with higher growth and welfare, with the free movement of labour, we argue that it should also encourage inward migration. We test this hypothesis by using data from the US and find a strong positive relation between political competition and net migration. This result is robust to alternative specifications, alternative samples and addressing endogeneity using the Voting Rights Act to instrument for political competition. The effect is economically large, specifically, we find that an increase in political competition in the order of magnitude observed in US Southern states during the post-war period leads to an increase in net migration by between 27 and 44 individuals per 1000 population.","There is now ample of evidence suggesting that political competition improves economic growth and welfare (see Stansel, 2005; Besley et al., 2010; Hatﬁeld and Kosec, 2013; Kosec et al., 2018). More debated is the question of the economic channels behind the political competition and growth nexus. For example, the literature has shown that political competition can reduce rent extraction and increase the efficiency provision of public goods (Polo, 1998; Svensson, 1998), force politicians to adopt pro-business policies and market based reforms (Murillo and Martinez-Gallardo, 2007; Besley et al., 2010), curb inefficient favouritism (Burgess et al., 2015; Curto-Grau et al., 2018), and protects important institutions like judicial autonomy (Leiras et al., 2015).====Notwithstanding this important literature, we know little about how political competition affects the decisions of individuals. Accordingly, in this paper, we investigate whether political competition influences individuals’ migratory choices. In particular, we ask: do individuals “vote with their feet” by moving from less to more politically competitive jurisdictions?====With free labour movement, individuals can rationally migrate in response to the poor policies and/or a lower standard of living resulting from a lack of political competition. Indeed, history has given us several examples of mass migration in response to authoritarian governments and a poor standard of living—a case in point is the mass migration from East to West Germany post-World War II, where over 2.6 million people made the move between 1949 and 1961 when the Berlin Wall erected by the East to stem the flow. Further, in May 1989 when the Hungarian border opened, hundreds of thousands of East German dissents fled westwards via Hungary and Czechoslovakia due to the growing difference in economic wellbeing between East and West Germany, catalysing the collapse of the Berlin wall. Despite this, no empirical study presents systematic evidence on the relation between political competition and migration.====To formally test the hypothesis that political competition affects migratory choices, we exploit the significant cross-state and within-state variation in political competition to explain internal (state-to-state) migration in the US. The US is an ideal experimental setting for several reasons. First, studying internal migration within a given country is arguably less prone to omitted variables problems that typically beset international studies. For example, the answer to whether democracies grow faster has proved elusive with the literature failing to find consensus.====Second, as a developed country, free labour mobility across state borders and high rates of internal migration is a defining feature of the US economy (Molly et al., 2011). This makes it possible for individuals to vote with their feet in response to bad policies and/or a poor standard of living. In contrast, individuals in developing countries often face insurmountable barriers to migration, even domestically (De Brauw et al., 2014). Moreover, authoritarian regimes may actively prohibit migration for fear that outward migration may weaken the regime’s grip on power (Aleman and Woods, 2014).====Third, a US study provides us with a unique opportunity to estimate the casual effect of political competition on migration. A key empirical challenge is the simultaneity between migration and political competition. For example, outward migration from politically uncompetitive areas may weaken local governments (e.g. through a reduction in the productive labour force, tax base and ultimately growth and welfare) and usher in more competition. To alleviate concerns of such endogeneity, we use the introduction of 1965 Voting Rights Act as an exogenous event to instrument for political competition. Since the event is a nationwide prohibition of the denial or abridgment of the right to vote, forced upon the states by the federal court it dramatically changed the competitiveness of the political landscape in several southern states with restrictions on the right to vote. Further, this law change was exogenous to state-level politics, since it represented a federal intervention into Southern state politics rather than a decision by Southern states to extend voting rights.====To operationalize our idea, we rely on United States (US) state-level decennial census data from 1940 to 2010. To begin we plot in Fig. 1 the correlation between Besley et al. (2010) party neutral measure of political competition at ==== and net migration at ====+1.==== The relation is positive: individuals tend to migrate to more politically competitive states and away from politically uncompetitive states.====We next confirm this correlation in a regression setting. First, we estimate the impact of political competition on net migration using ordinary least squares. Second, we estimate the model including lagged net migration terms using System-GMM (Arellano and Bond, 1991; Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998). Finally, our results are robust when we use the introduction of 1965 Voting Rights Act as an exogenous event to instrument for political competition. A consistent picture emerges: political competition is positively related to net migration.====We perform two additional robustness. First, despite the nature of the Voting Rights Act some readers may be concerned that omitted latent factors may contaminate our instrumental variables approach. For example, the period around the introduction of the Voting Rights Act coincided with technological advances like air-conditioning which made living in Southern states more comfortable. To ensure that omitted factors are not driving our results we perform a placebo test where we investigate the migratory patterns into the states that neighbour those Southern states impacted by the Act but were themselves ==== subject to the Act. We find no significant change in net migration into these neighbouring states unaffected by the Act. It therefore appears that “being Southern” is not sufficient to see the influx of migrants. Only those Southern states specifically targeted by the Voting Rights Act saw a significant rise in both political competition and inward migration. Second, to ensure the external validity of our results, we repeat our analysis using internal migration data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These data differ from the Census data on three main fronts. First, the frequency of the data is annual, which we use to calculate two-year migration rates for the analysis (instead of five-year rates from the Census). Second, the sample covers a much more recent period (i.e., 1988–2010) when variation in political uncertainty is much lower and driven by electoral competition, rather than institutional/cultural change (i.e. introduction of the VRA). Third, the sample only represents migration of the working population who file tax returns. We find similar results.====Our findings are not only statistically significant but also economically meaningful. We find that a 0.3 increase in Besley et al. (2010) party neutral measure of political competition (common among Southern states of the US for the post war period) leads to an increase in net migration of by between 27 and 44 individuals per 1000 population. To put this in context, five-year birth rates over same period ranged from a maximum of 150 per 1000 population to 70 per 1000 population.====As a final avenue of research, we provide ==== evidence of the underlying channels driving migratory choices and the consequences of higher levels of inward migration. On the channels, we find in our sample that higher political competition associates with lower taxes (as a fraction of income) and higher capital expenditure (as a fraction of taxes) by government. Thus it appears individuals are attracted to states that leave them with higher disposable income and as well as to states where there is greater importance placed on investment by the government.====On the consequences of politically induced migration, we find that inward migration is associated with higher future income growth. The movement of people—especially productive labour====—from less to more politically competitive jurisdictions can reinforce pre-existing differences in growth and welfare across jurisdictions. That is, since inward (outward) migration can increase (decrease) the productive workforce it can also lead to higher (lower) productivity and growth (e.g. Borjas, 2019). Consistent with this interpretation, we also show that the proportion of the population that is of prime working age increases significantly more in states impacted by the voting rights act after its introduction. Thus, inward migration is potentially a new channel through which political competition can enhance growth and welfare.====Putting it together, it looks as though political competition leads government to lower taxes and prioritize expenditure on economic infrastructure, which, in turn, attracts inward migration. Next, since inward migration increases the supply of productive labour it drives future income growth thus reinforcing the positive effects of political competition.====Our work primarily contributes to the literature on the determinants of internal migration (especially in the US). To be sure, there are many factors that contribute to the decision to migrate. This literature is vast, so we do not attempt to provide a complete review (see Greenwood, 1975; Greenwood, 1985; and Greenwood, 1997 for extensive reviews). Research on the determinants of migration is typically formulated in the context of individual utility maximization, with early contributions to the literature focusing on economic differences between origin and destination as key drivers. Later research has emphasized the importance of non-economic factors such as distance, personal characteristics and life cycle effects, weather and the environment (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008), the business cycle (Saks and Wozniak, 2011), and taxes and the availability of public goods (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008). Closest to our work is a recent paper by Revelli (2019) who develops a novel test that examines Tiebout’s sorting hypothesis. Using the staggered time structure of local elections in Italy as an instrument as for changes in the bundle of public goods, he presents evidence that shows the electoral schedule affects households’ migratory decision. None of these studies however, explicitly look at the impact of differences in political competition between locations on migratory choices, the channels behind this relation nor the consequences of politically induced migration.====Our work also relates to the literature examining the impact of political competition on policy choices and the provision on public goods (Polo, 1998; Svensson, 1998; Murillo and Martinez-Gallardo, 2007; Besley et al., 2010; Burgess et al., 2015; Leiras et al., 2015; Curto-Grau et al., 2018). By improving policy choices and the efficiency of public goods provision this literature has also shown that political competition enhances economic growth and welfare (see Stansel, 2005; Besley et al., 2010; Hatﬁeld and Kosec, 2013; Kosec et al., 2018). We contribute by showing that individuals respond to a lack of political competition by moving to more competitive states. Additional evidence suggests the reason behind this relation is because politically competitive areas have lower taxes and prioritize spending on economic infrastructure. Since the inward migration of productive labour contributes to growth (e.g. Borjas, 2019) we also uncover a new mechanism through which political competition can enhance growth and welfare.",Voting with your feet: Political competition and internal migration in the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300793,23 August 2020,2020,Research Article,150.0

However, the theorem does not address which PARs are more likely to violate those conditions across preference profiles. We compare the probabilities that thirteen PARs (anti-plurality, Hare, Nanson, plurality, plurality runoff, Simpson–Kramer, Baldwin, Borda, Coombs, Copeland, Dowdall, pairwise majority, and ranked pairs) violate Arrow’s conditions. We prove that Baldwin, Borda, Coombs, Copeland, Dowdall, and ranked pairs are less likely to violate IIA than the first six PARs, and they are less likely to violate Arrow’s conditions jointly. In contrast, pairwise majority never violates IIA but can violate transitivity. Simulations with three alternatives reveal that among the PARs studied, pairwise majority is the most likely to satisfy Arrow’s conditions jointly. Our results suggest pairwise majority violates transitivity with a small probability, while the other PARs violate IIA with much larger probabilities.","Arrow’s (1963) impossibility theorem created a milestone in the history of voting theory, welfare economics, and social choice. “It is not stating the case too strongly”, Ordeshook wrote, “to say that Arrow’s theorem and the research that it inspired wholly undermine the general applicability or meaning of concepts such as the public interest and community goals” (1986, 65).====Arrow’s theorem shows that a few “plausible and desirable features of a social decision mechanism are inconsistent with democracy” (Varian, 2010, 634). Arrow believed that any method of aggregating individual preferences should produce a transitive ranking (transitivity), respect unanimous consent on pairs (Pareto), be independent of the rankings of other pairs (IIA), and work for any ordering of individual preferences (unrestricted domain). Arrow showed that, for at least two individuals and at least three alternatives, it is not possible to aggregate individual preferences and guarantee that each condition is simultaneously satisfied unless the method is a dictatorship.====The collection of individual preference rankings is called a profile. Arrow proved that one of his conditions ==== be violated in the set of all possible profiles if dictatorship is not allowed. He did not prove that his properties must be violated for every profile. This is why he originally called his theorem a ==== theorem rather than an impossibility theorem, because the conflicts were possible but not universal.====In this paper we compare the probability that various preference aggregation rules (PARs) violate one or more of the conditions of Arrow’s theorem. Our analysis is similar to studies about the probability of pairwise majority violating the Condorcet Criterion or transitivity (Niemi and Weisberg, 1968, Merrill, 1984, Gehrlein, 1994, Huang and Chua, 2000, Lepelley et al., 2000, Gehrlein and Lepelley, 2010), or other voting rules violating other properties (Plassmann and Tideman, 2014, Tideman and Plassmann, 2014, Diss and Doghmi, 2016, Green-Armytage et al., 2016). Our primary goal is to determine which PARs are most likely to adhere to Arrow’s conditions, thereby extending recent studies that show pairwise majority is most likely to adhere to a set of similar conditions when trying to determine a single best selection rather than a complete ordering of all the alternatives (Dasgupta and Maskin, 2008, Xefteris, 2014).====Specifically, we consider anti-plurality, Baldwin, Borda, Coombs, Copeland, Dowdall, Hare, Nanson, pairwise majority, plurality, plurality runoff, ranked pairs, and Simpson–Kramer. We prove that anti-plurality, Hare, Nanson, plurality, plurality runoff, and Simpson–Kramer​ (which we call Group 1) always violate IIA, whereas Baldwin, Borda, Coombs, Copeland, Dowdall, and ranked pairs (which we call Group 2) adhere to IIA in some cases. Sen (1979) shows that the remaining PAR, pairwise majority, cannot violate IIA but can violate transitivity. Because the PARs in Group 2 never violate any of Arrow’s other conditions, we conclude they dominate the PARs in Group 1 on these criteria. We then determine the probability that each PAR will violate Arrow’s conditions using simulations with three alternatives and preferences distributed according to the impartial culture condition or the impartial anonymous culture condition. We find that Coombs and ranked pairs are generally least likely among the PARs in Group 2 to violate IIA but pairwise majority is the least likely to violate Arrow’s conditions jointly, because pairwise majority is less likely to violate transitivity than the other PARs are to violate IIA. The Pareto condition has a negligible effect. We obtain similar results using preference distributions from nine U.S. presidential elections and the dual culture condition. Although Arrow’s theorem has been treated as a barrier that no PAR can overcome (Riker, 1982), our results show the extent to which some PARs are more capable of fulfilling his conditions than others.",The probability of violating Arrow’s conditions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300847,21 August 2020,2020,Research Article,151.0

We shed light on this question by analysing the unique historical case of the peaceful separation of Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 – the last fully recognised internationally state-disintegration on European soil. Using the synthetic control approach, we find that independence for the seceding country (Montenegro) had a sizeable but seemingly transitory positive effect, boosting GDP per capita in the period immediately following independence, but with gains slowly evaporating in the longer period – which we attribute partly to increased vulnerability of the newly independent state to fluctuations in the international economic environment. In contrast, for Serbia we find no evidence of an independence dividend. We postulate that, at least in part, this asymmetry of effects may be linked to divergences in economic sentiment between the seceding entity and the one ‘left behind’.","What is the economic dividend of state independence? Despite the recent surge in secessionist and pro-independence movements, the evidence concerning the economic impact of ==== (state independence and political autonomy) in the academic literature is surprisingly limited. In Europe, the independence referrenda in Scotland and Catalonia in recent years spurred a new body of research and policy analyses seeking to measure, and anticipate, the economic consequences of various separation scenarios (see, inter alia, Bell et al., 2014; Muñoz and Tormos, 2015). Unavoidably, however, such studies rely heavily on ==== assumptions about future developments in key policy and behavioural parameters or on structural models calibrated on past episodes of ====. Other cases of secession or new state formation – especially in relation to the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the USSR – are also relatively under-studied, perhaps partly because of the complexity of the cases, complicated as they were by ethnic tensions and military hostilities.====In public finance theory and the literature on fiscal federalism, state independence – as an extreme form of fiscal decentralisation – is expected to have positive welfare effects. This is for a number of reasons. Independence allows the accommodation of heterogeneous preferences, resolving information and coordination problems that may exist at the central (federal) level and providing for a better match between local conditions and local policies (Salmon, 1987). It also enhances local voice and accountability, raising policy effectiveness through yardstick competition (Brennan et al., 1980; Besley and Smart, 2002); while it may have additional beneficial effects by raising confidence and creating new economic opportunities in the newly formed state entities (Brueckner, 2006; Rodriguez-Pose and Sandall, 2008). Inversely, in international economics it is economic and political ==== which creates positive welfare effects, as it eliminates barriers to trade and to other economic flows (FDI, migration) and removes distortionary taxes and non-tariff barriers (e.g., via national standards).====In practice, of course, the materialisation of any such effects is heavily conditioned on the capacities of the ‘devolved’ administrations and the quality of government or of local institutions more generally – as well as on the appropriateness of policies pursued by the newly-independent authorities.==== The positive effects of independence can further be annuled by the political instability and economic uncertainty which often accompanies historical episodes of new state formation (Rodriguez-Pose and Sterm, 2015).====In this paper we exploit the unique historical case of the separation between Serbia and Montenegro – the last fully recognised internationally state disintegration on European soil – to provide evidence on the causal effects of political disintegration (state independence). Despite the historical, political and geo-political specificity of the case, in our view there are useful insights that can be drawn from this analysis concerning the economic effects of independence, not only retrospectively for Montenegro and Serbia but also prospectively for contemporary cases of potential disintegration in Europe. This is for a number of reasons.==== First, at the time of its declaration of independence in 2006 Montenegro had higher levels of development and significant natural resource advantages (be it, mainly in tourism) compared to its counterpart within the so-called State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. This is not dissimilar to cases such as those of Catalonia and Scotland. Second, unlike previous historical episodes of secession (e.g., Abkhazia and South Osetia, Kosovo, Crimea, etc), Montenegro’s secession from the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro was remarkably peaceful and uneventful. This makes the case particularly suited for studying the economic effects of independence without the distortive effects of armed conflicts and political upheavals usually associated to unilateral declarations of independence, which are unlikely to apply to contemporary cases of potential splits in Western Europe. Third, Montenegro had already, well before its declaration of independence, significant policy autonomy in a large number of policy areas, including crucially in privatisation (and thus also in FDI-attraction policies) and monetary policy (Noutcheva and Huysseune, 2004). This ensured an unprecedented degree of policy continuity since independence.==== This in turn allows the estimation of the economic effects of independence unsoiled by influences that may have to do with (sometimes paradigmatic) policy shifts or changes in administrative capacity and the quality of government. Fourth, Montenegro’s independence was not driven by an isolationist strategy; instead, as we discuss in more detail in the next section, Montenegro saw its secession from the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro partly as a strategy to accelerate its economic and political integration with the European Union, while maintaining a high degree of economic integration (including relatively ‘porous’ borders) with its former union. Again, this is very similar to contemporary cases in Western Europe.==== Last, like in the case of Serbia and Montenegro, cases such as Scotland or Catalonia represent potential separations of entities that share many cultural characteristics (common religion, mixed ethnicity, commonly spoken language, same popular culture, etc).====To analyse the economic effects of independence we apply a synthetic control approach, matching pre-independence outcomes in Serbia and in Montenegro (separately) with those in a set of comparable ‘donor’ countries and producing estimates of the post-independence divergence between actual and predicted (’synthetic’) outcomes in the two countries. We find that independence produced a substantial boost in Montenegrin GDP, which was however shortlived: in our core results, the positive income effect of Montenegrin independence seems to had been fully eliminated by 2014. In contrast, for Serbia we find no evidence of an independence dividend. If anything, Serbian GDP seems to have grown more slowly than that of ‘synthetic’ Serbia (in the non-separation scenario), although this effect does not seem to carry much statistical confidence. This suggests that independence has asymmetric effects on the successor entities. Our further exploration shows that objective economic factors (e.g., changes in FDI flows or trade) cannot fully account for this asymmetry – leaving perhaps space for explanations that may have to do with differences in economic sentiment and trust in institutions, between the two entities, post-separation.====We explain the synthetic control method and our overall empirical approach in section III, after a brief overview of the historical context of the Serbia-Montenegro union and separation. Section IV presents our empirical results, separately for Serbia and Montenegro, as well as a number of robustness checks and additional explorations. Section V explores possible drivers for these results, looking in particular at the vulnearabilities that may have been created post-separation domestically as well as in relation to the external environment.

Terrorist groups succeed if they join the political process or achieve some of their goals. Based on a sample of 470 terrorist groups, we first estimate the determinants of groups’ ending and, conditional on their demise, we identify factors conducive to their success. We find that religious fundamentalist terrorist groups survive longer than left-wing, nationalist/separatist, or right-wing groups; but religious groups are less apt than other ideologies to attain their objectives or to join the political process. Larger groups survive longer and possess a better success prognosis. Within-country group competition is conducive to survival, but harmful to success. Controls include groups’ goals, groups’ strategic choices, and home country’s characteristics. Robustness tests disaggregate our success measure, provide panel estimates, and incorporate other controls.","In recent years, data have been collected on essential attributes of terrorist groups, including their membership size, ideology, duration, alternative endings, strategic choices, goals, competitive groups, attack carnage, base countries, and base countries’ characteristics (see, e.g., Asal and Rethemeyer, 2015; Blomberg et al., 2011; Carter, 2012: Crenshaw, 2018; Cronin, 2009; Jones and Libicki, 2008). Those datasets provide opportunities for researchers not only to investigate the influences on terrorist groups’ survivability, but also to ascertain the factors behind terrorist groups’ success. Implicitly, some of the terrorism literature equates terrorist groups’ longevity with their success (Blomberg et al., 2010; Cronin, 2006; Gaibulloev and Sandler, 2013; Jones and Libicki, 2008); however, terrorist groups may survive for fifty years or more, yet never achieve their intended influence on policy – e.g., the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) or Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) – or become a legitimate political voice. The PFLP wanted an independent Palestinian state, while the ETA desired an autonomous Basque state. Despite al-Qaeda’s campaigns to traumatize the public at large through horrific attacks (e.g., the four deadly hijackings on September 11, 2001 – henceforth, 9/11), al-Qaeda has not realized its main goal of ridding the Moslem world of all foreign influences. Carnage and notoriety do not equate with political legitimacy or success.====The current paper distinguishes the determinants of terrorist groups’ survivability from those behind their success, based on empirical analyses using a sample of groups drawn from a newly constructed terrorist group dataset that covers 1970–2016 (Hou et al., 2020). For the current investigation, the success of a terrorist group is equated with either joining the political process or achieving some of its primary goal. By joining the political process, the group becomes legitimate and may influence policy through public debate or votes in the legislative body (e.g., the Irish Republican Army or the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 2005 and thereafter – see Jones and Libicki, 2008).==== For another instance, Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) ceased operations and became a political party that shortly thereafter won 112 seats in the national assembly in October 1994 (Jones and Libicki, 2008). Post (1991, p. 38) equates terrorist success with groups that convince more powerful actors of the legitimacy of the groups’ cause. Becoming a legitimate political player is one important means of displaying a relevancy to those in power and to the electorate and global community. Similarly, Thomas (2014) indicates that “a marker of success” (p. 804) for a rebel group employing terrorism is to gain an invitation to participate in negotiations. Concessions can only come when channels of communication are opened up between the government and the terrorist group. In a seminal study on foreign aid and terrorist group longevity, Bapat (2011) does ==== equate joining the political process as a sign of failure. When achieving some of their main goals, we also view terrorist groups as successful if they are sufficiently satisfied to cease terrorist attacks. Groups that gain no political participation or concessions are deemed to be unsuccessful when they end operations, are defeated by force, or splinter into factions (Bapat, 2011).====Any measure of terrorist success is fraught with difficulties (Cronin, 2006; Schelling, 1991). Our aggregate success measure is intended not only to capture groups’ drive to legitimacy and accomplishment, but also to provide sufficient observations for statistical inference. In the robustness tests, we disaggregate our success measure into its two components to establish similar results.====The primary purpose of this paper is to estimate significant influences that affect the life span of terrorist groups and, conditional on their demise, the paper ascertains the key determinants that affect groups’ success. For a cross-section of terrorist groups during 1970–2016, this exercise is accomplished with a probit with sample-selection model for which the two outcomes – ending versus concluding successfully – are treated as dependent processes. For comparison purposes, we also estimate separate probit regressions for which the two outcomes are considered to be independent processes. As a robustness check, we employ two panel analyses – based on annual observations and five-year averages – to identify drivers behind terrorist groups’ endings versus their success. Additional robustness tests disaggregate terrorist groups’ alternative endings particularly with regards to success. The sign and magnitude of the significant controls driving the two processes may differ – e.g., group size may inhibit a group’s demise but may foster a successful ending. For other controls, the sign associated with the two processes may be the same so that groups’ ideology may bolster their demise, while also fostering their success when ending (e.g., nationalist/separatist terrorist groups). Up until now, the extant literature on terrorist groups focuses primarily on what influences the longevity of these groups (see, especially, Blomberg et al., 2010; Blomberg et al., 2011; Cronin, 2006; Jordan, 2009; Phillips, 2014, Phillips, 2015a; Vittori, 2009; Young and Dugan, 2014).==== Carter (2012) and Gaibulloev and Sandler (2014) apply a competing-risk empirical methodology to find factors that influence alternative endings for terrorist groups that include defeat, splintering, joining the political process, or victory, but their studies do not make measures of success conditional on the groups’ ending.====The current paper contains some key findings. First, larger terrorist groups are found not only to display a greater likelihood to survive, but also to be more inclined to end successfully from a political or strategic vantage. Second, relative to left-wing, nationalist/separatist, and right-wing terrorist groups, religious fundamentalist terrorist organizations display a smaller probability of demise, while, conditional on ending, being less apt to be successful.==== Thus, longevity is clearly not synonymous with success for terrorist groups. Third, within a host country, greater competition among terrorist groups raises groups’ longevity prospects==== but at the expense of their success. Fourth, terrorist groups that rely more on transnational terrorist attacks are more likely to end owing to the inherent risks associated with such attacks. Fifth, terrorist groups survive longer if they employ more diversified attacks that are harder to protect against.====The remainder of the paper contains five sections. Section 2 provides essential background material on terrorist groups, including their definition, ideologies, campaign composition, and alternative endings. Section 3 offers some theoretical considerations, followed by the presentation of our empirical methodology and data in Section 4.

Transport costs can be lowered by an improvement in transport infrastructure. National governments non-cooperatively decide about their respective country's investment level. Governments' preferences are assumed to be biased in favor of producers' interests with consequences for equilibrium investments: Exporting countries, whose producers benefit from a transport cost reduction, spend more for infrastructure than importing countries, whose producers are protected by transport costs from foreign competition. This outcome is inefficient, and governments have an incentive to cooperate internationally. The paper also incorporates bilateral trade with two goods that benefit from infrastructure improvements as well as trade that results from offshoring.","Countries shape the environment of international trade not only via tariffs and regulations but also by providing infrastructure that facilitates the transportation of goods across national borders. Various empirical studies suggest that the supply of trade related infrastructure differs substantially between countries and that infrastructure plays a vital role in determining international transport costs and trade.==== According to Limao and Venables (2001), a large part of the low trade levels of African countries in the 1990s can be explained by their poor infrastructure.==== While the literature on the political economy of trade policy is substantial, the motivation for governments to invest in trade facilitating infrastructure appears to be far less researched.====In this context, the current paper focuses on the provision of trade facilitating “hard” infrastructure (such as roads, railway lines, bridges, or ports) and analyzes how trade policy motives of governments influence the provision of such infrastructure. Point of departure is a simple partial equilibrium model with small open economies trading a single good that is subject to transport costs. Governments are assumed to be biased in the favor of producer interests. In this setting, the political bias leads to a distortion with respect to infrastructure provision. Exporting countries spend more for infrastructure improvements compared to importing countries. Since marginal returns for an individual country of investing in infrastructure are decreasing, this asymmetry in spending levels is not cost efficient: Countries could gain from a reallocation of infrastructure spending from exporting countries to importing countries. Governments, therefore, have an incentive to cooperate internationally – even if no technological externalities exist and even if countries cannot manipulate the terms of trade. In a next step, the model is extended to incorporate bilateral trade with two goods that benefit from trade facilitating infrastructure. The distortion persists if sectors differ systematically with regard to their size or to the trade facilitating influence of infrastructure. Firms may also be affected by infrastructure improvements if they offshore parts of their production tasks. Offshoring firms benefit from a decline in the costs of transporting unfinished goods, and this effect may cause an additional asymmetry in spending patterns. In countries that are characterized by higher production volumes of the offshored good producers benefit more from trade facilitating infrastructure, which results in higher infrastructure levels.====Several theoretical contributions analyze the provision of transportation infrastructure in an international trade setting. To my knowledge, none of the existing papers finds a similar distortion with regard to the international distribution of infrastructure spending as identified here. Bond (2006) sets up a two-country, two-goods model in which governments non-cooperatively set infrastructure levels that reduce transportation costs. He assumes large countries that choose their policies to maximize aggregate welfare. In equilibrium, countries spend too little for infrastructure improvements because they disregard a positive terms of trade externality that results from a decline in transport costs. This terms of trade effect is comparable to the one resulting from a reduction of tariffs or export taxes. Unlike Bond (2006), the current paper considers infrastructure investments by small countries which cannot influence the terms of trade with their unilateral policies.====In Bougheas et al. (2003) each country is endowed with a country-specific good that can be consumed, exported or used to improve transport infrastructure. In their framework, a negative spill-over may occur from infrastructure spending as an increase in the use of the country specific good for improvements in transport infrastructure reduces the availability of this good for consumption in the partner country. In the current paper, there is no such supply externality, as infrastructure can be produced from a homogeneous good that is freely tradable internationally.====Some papers focus on potentially positive technological spill-overs of infrastructure in that an improvement may reduce transport costs for foreign countries as well. Mun and Nakagawa (2008) set up a two-country model in which this positive externality results in inefficiently low infrastructure levels in the non-cooperative equilibrium compared to the global optimum. The authors look at the role of foreign aid to mitigate this underinvestment problem, and in another paper Mun and Nakagawa (2010) analyze different pricing regimes for transport infrastructure.==== Felbermayr and Tarasov (2015) set up a spatial model of a linear economy in which transport costs depend on the aggregate infrastructure level along the transportation route between source and destination location. The non-cooperative equilibrium results in regional underinvestment that is more pronounced close to a national border. Finally, Yanase and Long (2018) model non-cooperative infrastructure provision as a dynamic game between two governments. General underinvestment due to positive investment externalities is not behind the results of the current paper.====All papers mentioned above assume “social planner” governments and do not consider the political economy aspects on which the current paper focuses. One recent article that accounts for political distortions (albeit in a totally different setting) is Bonfatti et al. (2019). There, the authors focus on rent-seeking motives by the ruling elite to explain the geographical pattern of Africa's road network. According to their results, spending by autocratic governments in resource exporting countries is biased towards road connections from resource deposits to major ports.====Maggi et al. (2018) analyze the political economy determinants of wasteful “red-tape” trade barriers in importing countries with biased governments and their relationship to tariff policies. In their paper, governments have two types of trade policies at their disposal, import tariffs and wasteful regulatory trade barriers. As regulatory trade barriers typically do not generate revenues, governments only resort to this instrument if tariffs are restricted by international trade agreements. In such a setting, however, barriers may even be set on a prohibitive level for a range of products. In comparison to imposing red tape barriers, lowering the supply of trade facilitating infrastructure can be seen as a superior instrument to substitute tariffs as it saves costs for providing this infrastructure.",Investment in trade facilitating infrastructure: A political-economy analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300768,8 August 2020,2020,Research Article,155.0

Moreover, we investigate the relation between employment shocks to large firms, granular shocks, and populism. To measure populism, we look at the municipal-level support toward the Finns Party, the Finnish right-wing populist party, during the 2011 and 2015 parliamentary elections. We find that the labor market churning rate and the granular shocks are negatively associated with support for populism. Hirings in continuing establishments are negatively correlated with populism, while hirings due to the entry of new establishments and the job reallocation rate are positively related with populism, a possible consequence of economic restructuring. We complete our analysis by looking at the link between local labor market conditions and the supply of populist candidates, and by examining the usefulness of microdynamics indicators in a predictive setting.","Populism has been the keyword used to describe the global political environment of recent years. Events such as the U.S. presidential elections of 2016, the Brexit referendum or the Italian elections in 2018 have shaped the public debate and have been studied by researchers of multiple fields. Looking at Europe, the support toward populist parties has increased steadily (The Guardian, 2018), both for parties leaning toward the left (to a lesser extent) and to more far-right positions.====A growing empirical economic literature has tried to identify some of the determinants of the populist wave, highlighting the role of changes in the economic structure and in job market dynamics. In this paper, we consider the relation between job and worker flows (which we refer to as microdynamics), and the support for (right-wing) populism, in the Finnish setting. Firm-level patterns of hirings, separations and the creation and destruction of job places are important indicators of how an economy is evolving, giving us measures of creative destruction and of labor market churning (i.e. how dynamic the labor market is), and therefore should be interconnected with changes in political sentiments.====We look at the 2011 and 2015 parliamentary elections and proxy support for populism by the share of votes going to the right-wing populist party Perussuomalaiset (PS, in English the Finns Party) at the municipal level. In addition to microdynamics, we look at the association between populism and local granular shocks, identified as the employment growth among the largest establishments in a municipality, adjusted by the degree of economic concentration in the municipality. The analysis is complemented by a study of the link between local microdynamics, at the electoral district level, and the degree of populism of the candidates proposed by parties in a given district, giving us an idea of whether there is a degree of strategic party response to local conditions. To quantify how different candidates are close to populist values, we rely on a candidate-level survey (Vaalikone) which has been conducted by the Finnish public broadcasting company YLE before the parliamentary elections since 2011. We finish our empirical study by examining the explanatory power of our microdynamics indicators using two different variable selection procedures, in particular a standard backward stepwise regression approach and the least absolute selector and shrinkage operator (lasso), formulated in Tibshirani (1996).====The Finnish context offers an excellent platform to study sudden changes in populist support. From 2007 to 2011, the support for the Finns Party jumped as much as 15 percentage points (from 4.1 to 19.1) making it the third largest party in the parliament with just 1.3 percentage points behind the winner of the election, the National Coalition Party. The sudden success of the populist party occurred just a little after the biggest fall (−8.3 percent in 2009) in GDP in Finland's economic history since the First World War. Economic distress was apparent also in the parliamentary election of 2015, which took place after four years of extremely sluggish growth. Given the fact that demand-side factors affect the support for populism (Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2018; Guiso et al., 2017), Finland's poor economic performance created a breeding ground for expressions of political discontent.","Microdynamics, granularity and populism: The Finnish case",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300744,6 August 2020,2020,Research Article,156.0

The recent years have shown a particular interest in how people assess their social and economic environment and whether their perceptions concur with reality. The discussion of a “post-factual era” and on how subjective and often severely biased views of reality influence individuals' actions as citizens provides a general case in point. The perception of the extent of income or wealth inequality has attracted particular attention given its importance for voting behavior, redistributive preferences, the likelihood of social upheaval or migration (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005) as well as on attitudes like life satisfaction and trust (Clark & D'Ambrosio, 2015; Knell and Stix, 2017).====The existing empirical literature has established that people have biased perceptions of the extent of inequality (Slemrod, 2006; Osberg and Smeeding, 2006; Norton and Ariely, 2011; Kuhn, 2011; Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018). This literature uses specific survey questions in order to capture the perception of inequality. These distinct questions often refer to different dimensions of inequality (e.g. to the shape of the aggregate distribution or the individual position within this distribution). A small number of papers also takes a more multidimensional view on this topic by looking at more than one than one of the survey questions at a time. The papers by Gimpelson and Treisman (2018) and Engelhardt and Wagener (2018), e.g., contain regressions for different perception measures and Bavetta et al. (2019) offer an empirical strategy to explicitly capture the multidimensional nature of the perception of inequality.====Our paper contributes to this latter literature both from an empirical and from a conceptual perspective. The starting point of our analysis is a simple conceptual framework that leads to specific predictions about systematic differences of inequality perceptions as well as the pattern of answers to different survey questions. In the empirical part we investigate whether these patterns correspond to the responses in a large international survey study. The conceptual framework is based on the straightforward idea that people form their perception of the income distribution by looking at reference groups that are not arbitrary subsamples of society but are typically biased towards individuals that have a similar social and economic background. When asked about their assessment of the distribution individuals base their answer on a subjective income distribution formed from this biased subsample.==== The composition and formation of reference groups thus plays a crucial role for the perception of the income distribution. There exists a wide and interdisciplinary literature on the determinants of reference groups (McPherson et al., 2001). It has been found that many factors play a role in the formation of reference groups, e.g. age, religion, education, occupation, gender, race and ethnicity, geographic proximity, class and socio-economic status. In this paper we focus on the latter factor and in particular on income as the main influence for the formation of reference groups. Even though this narrow perspective excludes a number of important contributing elements, we believe that it is a valuable starting point to investigate how far this approach is able to explain the empirical pattern of perceived inequality. For the benchmark framework about the income-determined formation of reference groups we start from the phenomenon of “homophily” (Kandel 1978; McPherson et al., 2001)—i.e. the observation that people tend to have similar peers. In particular, we assume that individuals consider the entire distribution of all income levels but put more weight on income levels close to their own position. We illustrate this with a benchmark example where the true income distribution is of the lognormal type while the subjective density functions are assumed to be also lognormal but with the mode at the own income level (“self-centered density function”). This biased perception will get reflected along various dimensions. In this paper we document the implications of homophilic reference groups for four measures of perception of the income distribution which are directly related to variables that are included in existing surveys. These are the assessment of: (i) the own subjective rank (cf. “social-ladder question”), (ii) the mean income (cf. “actual-earnings question”), (iii) the distributional shape of society (cf. “type-of-society question”), and (iv) the extent of income inequality (cf. subjective inequality measures based on various questions). We are particularly interested in how the different dimensions of inequality are connected and how the assessment differs for individuals at different deciles in the (objective) income distribution.====The benchmark framework based on the “self-centered density function” implies that: (i) the subjective rank is positively but not proportionally related to the objective rank, i.e. low-income (high-income) people will tend to overestimate (underestimate) their position; (ii) an individual's estimate of the average income level increase with his or her income level; (iii) low-income individuals will view the shape of society as a “pyramid” while high-income people will view it more like an “inverted pyramid”; (iv) the subjective Gini coefficient will be negatively related to the objective position in the income distribution. The reason for the latter two implications is due to the fact that for the assumption of a self-centered density function the skewness of the perceived distribution changes with the income position which is reflected in the perceived shape of society and the corresponding inequality.====In the second part of the paper we confront the four implications of the theoretical framework with data from the International Social Survey Project (ISSP) which contains information on 40 countries. While this data set provides information on all four model predictions, the key assumption about the existence of heterogeneous reference groups cannot be tested directly since the ISSP does not contain information about how individuals form reference groups.==== We can, however, analyze whether the answers to the various questions about inequality perception are in line with the predictions of the theoretical framework which at least provides indirect evidence that heterogeneous reference groups are an important element to understand the pattern of these perceptions.====The empirical results provide strong support for our framework. First, we use the social-ladder question to study the perception of the own position in the income distribution. As in a number of previous studies (Cruces et al., 2013; Engelhardt and Wagener, 2018; Karadja et al., 2017; Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018) we find that there is a considerable degree of over- and underestimation of the subjective rank for low-income and high-income people, respectively. On average, individuals place themselves into the range between the fourth and the sixth decile. This outcome is not only qualitatively but quantitatively similar to the results of the model using a self-centered subjective density function. Second, we find that high-income people tend to give higher estimates for earnings of characteristic professions (like unskilled workers or shop-assistants) suggesting that they perceive a higher general income level than low-income persons which is again in line with the predictions of the model. Third, we use the type-of-society question and study how the perceived shape of society depends on the own position in the income distribution. So far this income-dependence has not been studied in the related literature (Niehues, 2014; Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018) although we argue that it provides valuable information about the determinants of inequality perceptions. We find that there exists a highly significant correlation between the (objective and—even more so—subjective) position in the distribution and the view about the shape of society and the skewness of the distribution. In particular, low-income people predominately view society as right skewed (e.g. as a tower or a pyramid) while high-income people have a stronger tendency to view it as skewed more to the left (e.g. as an inverted pyramid). This again supports the assumption of a self-centered subjective density function. Since the tower and the pyramid are also associated with the most unequal distributions this finding also implies that low-income individuals perceive society as being more unequal. This observation is also confirmed in a fourth set of results where we construct an individual-specific Gini coefficient. It turns out that this subjective inequality measure decreases with the rank in the distribution which is also in line with the predictions of the model. Overall, the empirical results strongly support the starting conjecture that individual differences in the perception of the income distribution are influenced by the presence of heterogeneous reference groups that are socially biased and centered around the own income level. This suggests that inequality misperceptions are not simply an implication of arbitrary survey responses or unsystematic biases but rather are the direct and inherently consistent consequence of social stratification due to reference group formation.====The paper builds on several strands of the literature. A number of papers document that the perceived degree of inequality deviates considerably from the measured extent of inequality (Slemrod, 2006; Osberg and Smeeding, 2006; Norton and Ariely, 2011; Kuhn, 2011; Page and Goldstein, 2016; Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018). An additional strand has investigated whether and how people's perceptions and policy preferences change when they are provided with “informational treatments” about the reality (Cruces et al., 2013; Kuziemko et al., 2015; Engelhardt and Wagener, 2018; Karadja et al., 2017; Hoy and Mager, 2019). Other papers have used cross-sectional estimations to compare the explanatory power of measured and perceived inequality. Niehues (2014), Engelhardt and Wagener (2014), Gimpelson and Treisman (2018), Gründler and Köllner (2017) and Choi (2019) have shown, e.g., that cross-country variations in the perception of inequality are more successful in explaining variations in redistributive preferences than measures of actual income inequality. Clark and Senik (2010), Clark et al. (2013) and Mayraz et al. (2009) study the importance and the specific identity of reference groups. Clark and Senik (2010), e.g., use a large European survey and find, inter alia, that individuals tend to compare themselves to those with whom they interact most often. Over the recent year the topic of biased perceptions has gained attention and the literature deals, e.g., with the perception of upward mobility (Alesina etal., 2018a, Alesina etal., 2018b), immigration (Alesina etal., 2018a, Alesina etal., 2018b) or the development of the economy and of house prices (Kuchler and Zafar, 2019; Bailey et al., 2019).====The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss the main survey questions on distributional perceptions. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework based on the assumption of reference groups and derives the main implications of this framework.

Academic research and political consulting that support the fight against corruption primarily rely on a small number of subjective indicators of corruption, among which Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is best known. It is crucial for both research and the design of anti-corruption policies that the corruption indicators being used accurately reflect reality.====This study deals with the divergence between two types of corruption indicators. Some corruption indicators focus on expert or general population surveys to determine the perceived significance of public-sector corruption in a specific country. Both the World Bank’s corruption indicator and the CPI are based on such data. Other indicators, like the one from the International Crime Victims Survey, are not based on perceived corruption, but on personal experience with bribery. They ask, for instance, whether, how often, and to whom a person had to pay a bribe over the course of the past 12 months. Treisman (2007) already noted that perception-based indicators are not simply a transformation of experienced-based indicators (Svensson, 2005 points out that they are at least not highly correlated).====Neither corruption perception nor reported corruption experience is necessarily an expedient measure of what researchers are actually interested in. ====, one might expect experience-based indicators to be more reflective of corruption reality than perception-based indicators; and much of the literature seems to concur that the latter are more susceptible to systematic biases (see, e.g., Kurtz and Schrank, 2007; Svensson, 2005). If there are significant and systematic deviations between the two types of indicators, this implies that neither should be used as a proxy for corruption without due consideration. First, one needs to understand why individuals evaluate corruption differently than how they seem to experience it. This is precisely the question we want to address here. Analogously to earlier studies, we analyze the conditions under which individuals report an increased or decreased level of corruption perception, given their own corruption experience.==== Traits of respondents and of their home countries might both play a role in the formation of corruption perception.====Our study contributes a number of improvements over previous research in this literature. In our theory section, we discuss concrete cognitive biases that could be at play when individuals with bounded rationality are asked to evaluate corruption levels. Previous research has simply claimed that some characteristics of individuals or countries may influence priors about corruption levels in a country, without providing any further explanation of this mechanism. Using data from the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB), we are able to not only produce empirical results for a much larger set of countries compared to any existing study, but we are also able to directly link corruption perception to the corruption experience of individual respondents, which leads to much more informative and reliable empirical results.====Based on 184,018 individual-level observations in 109 countries, we find that a number of respondent and country characteristics are related to levels of corruption perception that systematically differ from what individual corruption experience would predict. Corruption experience itself has a significant and robust effect on corruption perception. Independently of their experience with corruption, individuals who are male, Protestant, earn a high income, and are not working perceive corruption levels to be lower than they are perceived by others. More importantly, higher economic growth and income per capita are associated with downward-biased corruption perceptions. Results of corruption research that is exclusively based on perception indicators thus need to be rethought, and what might be even more important, all sorts of anti-corruption policies that have been designed based on these results need to be reevaluated.====In Section 2, we survey the extant literature on measuring biases in corruption perception. Section 3 introduces the GCB dataset, discusses the construction of our corruption indicators, and describes their properties. Section 4 deals with theoretical explanations for the differences between corruption perception and experience. We offer a number of theoretical conjectures about the conditions under which one would expect systematic differences between perception and experience measures. The data used for corroborating these predictions is also described. In Section 5, we discuss how the relationship between corruption perception and experience can be modeled empirically and we present and discuss our regression results.

A burdensome regulatory environment increases the opportunities for individuals and firms to bypass these regulations through various forms of bribery.

I also find some suggestive evidence that campaign expense reimbursement can help female candidates become career politicians.","One of the barriers that deters candidates from running in an election is the cost incurred in campaigning. Proponents of public financing assert that it can increase the competitiveness of elections, and encourage diverse candidates to run for office (e.g., Brennan Center for Justice, 2016). In the United States, 14 states currently provide public financing options to candidates, such as the “clean election” programs offered by Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine.==== Previous studies have examined whether these public financing programs have increased the competitiveness of elections (Donnay and Ramsden, 1995; Government Accountability Office, 2010; Gross et al., 2002; Jones and Borris, 1985; La Raja and Wiltse, 2015; Malhotra, 2008; Mayer and Wood, 1995; Mayer et al., 2006; Miller, 2011; Powell, 2012; Primo et al., 2006; Stratmann, 2009; Werner and Mayer, 2007). However, the findings of these papers are mixed.==== Since many of these studies are observational, it is difficult to infer a causal relationship between public funding and the competitiveness of elections. In addition, these states have different public financing programs (e.g., clean elections, matching funds, and public financing for parties). Therefore, the results of any study can depend on the states and time periods that are included in the analysis. To the best of my knowledge, there has been no empirical research that has investigated the causal effect of public financing on candidates outside the US.====In this paper, I study whether public financing of campaigns is effective in encouraging candidates to run for office and in helping them win. To overcome the limitations of previous studies, I estimate the causal effect of public funding of elections on candidates' re-emergence and success using a regression discontinuity (RD) design in the context of South Korean municipal legislative elections. In South Korean municipal legislative elections, candidates are eligible for the reimbursement of campaign expenses if they receive more votes than a pre-determined threshold. This institutional feature makes the South Korean case ideal for an RD analysis.====The main findings of my paper can be summarized as follows. First, they show that there is no overall effect of campaign expense reimbursement on either candidate reemergence or success in a subsequent election. Second, an investigation of the heterogenous effects of reimbursement across different types of candidates indicates that public financing is especially effective for female candidates. With these candidates, the probability of running again increases by 24.6 percentage points and that of winning the next election goes up by 10.1 percentage points. Third, I also find a positive effect of campaign expense reimbursement on running again for nonincumbents and minor party or independent candidates, although the estimates are somewhat imprecise. Finally, I find some suggestive evidence that campaign expense reimbursement can help female candidates become career politicians.====The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, my paper contributes to the literature on the public financing of elections. Using South Korea's election rules and the RD design, I provide a causal estimate of the effect of campaign expense reimbursement on the reemergence and success of candidates in elections. The paper that is most closely related to my study is Harada and Smith (2014), which analyzed the effect of Japan's expensive election deposits on candidate entry using an RD design. Their paper is similar to mine in that they also exploit the predetermined vote share threshold for the reimbursement of deposits. However, my study differs from and extends theirs in several ways. First, while they examine the effect of deposit reimbursement on candidacy for “serious” versus “fringe” candidates alone, I also estimate the effect of reimbursement on females and males as well as incumbents and non-incumbents.==== I also examine whether campaign expense reimbursement increased the candidates' probability of winning in the next election and whether the reimbursement has long-term consequences for candidates. Finally, while they focused on deposit refunds, I study the effect of campaign expense reimbursement, which is a form of the public financing of elections.====Second, my findings have implications for the literature on gender inequality in politics. I show that the effect of campaign expense reimbursement on the probabilities of running in and winning the subsequent election is greater for females than for males. These results suggest that public financing can be an effective tool in the enhancement of women's representation in politics. Public financing may have an additional effect that goes beyond its immediate impact on female candidates. A number of studies find that exposure to a female politician reduces anti-female bias among voters, and, as a result, women are more likely to run for and win office in the future (Beaman et al., 2009; Joo and Lee, 2018). Some studies suggest that having a female politician also has a positive spillover effect on other women: they find that the election of women motivates more women to enter politics and helps female candidates run for and win elections to lower offices (Bhavnani, 2009; Baskaran and Hessami, 2018; Ladam et al., 2018).====Finally, this paper is also related to the literature on incumbency advantage. Numerous studies, especially those on US politics, show that incumbents enjoy an advantage in elections over other candidates (e.g., Ansolabehere and Snyder, 2002; Erikson, 1971; Gelman and King, 1990; Hainmueller and Kern, 2008; Lee, 2008). Incumbency advantage can emerge from many reasons, but one possible concern surrounding it is that it may help inferior politicians to keep office (e.g., Fiorina, 1977). I find some evidence suggesting that while campaign expense reimbursement encourages non-incumbent candidates to run again in the next election, it has no effect on incumbents. This result suggests that public financing can narrow the gap between incumbents and non-incumbents, and thus reduce incumbency advantage by “leveling the political playing field.”====The rest of the article is organized as follows: I first provide background information about the South Korean municipal legislative elections, which is followed by a theoretical discussion on the effect of campaign expense reimbursement. I then describe the data and research design used in this study, and present the results.

Although precisely quantifying the magnitude of tax evasion and avoidance is difficult, the consensus is that tax evasion is substantial, including in developed countries. According to Murphy (2019), in 2015, the tax gap in the European Union (EU) is estimated to have been €825 billion per year.==== Similarly, in 2017, the VAT gap, the only tax gap for which there are comparative estimates for all EU countries, is estimated to be approximately €137.5 billion (European Commission, 2019).==== Possible explanations that have been proposed for these differences include, the level of tax burden, the functioning of the tax system, and other institutional features and differences in tax morale and social norms.====In this paper, we stress the role of tax morale and reputation in affecting taxpaying behaviour. We present an ‘agent-based’ dynamic model in which taxpayers ‘live’ in a network and care about their social reputation. Individuals decide whether to pay or to evade taxes by considering the expected economic net benefit (balancing monetary costs and benefits from tax evasion), the subjective cost, and the reputation cost. The higher the subjective cost from tax evasion, the higher is the individual's intrinsic motivation to comply, namely, his/her tax morale.==== In our model, this is updated using an adaptive rule based on the intrinsic motivation of the individual's ‘neighbours’ (the reference group). Individuals also care about their reputation as taxpayers, which depends on the strength of the social norm in the reference group.====First, we simulate the model for different values of the parameters. We focus on the effect of three parameters on tax compliance, namely, the probability to find like-minded peers in the reference group (network integration), the weight individuals attribute to reputation, and the share of updating individuals. The results suggest that the more individuals are integrated and the more they care about reputation, the higher the tax compliance. We also show that, if all individuals in the network update their intrinsic motivation by considering the neighbours' tax morale, they converge to a common tax morale (a social norm in the network). In this situation, all individuals either evade or pay their taxes. By contrast, if only some individuals update their intrinsic motivation, tax evasion and compliance may coexist in a steady state, suggesting a sub-network social norm.====The second contribution of this paper is to consider the possibility of a fiscal authority exploiting the knowledge of the network structure and targeting ‘central’ individuals. By positively affecting the tax morale of individuals whose influence within the network is high, a fiscal authority can hope to increase overall tax morale and thus tax compliance. We have in mind a communication campaign in which the tax authority conveys some content to the taxpayers. For example, a personal letter targeted at ‘central’ individuals, as discussed in the recent debate on ‘nudging’ taxpayers (see OECD, 2019 and, for a critical appraisal, Antinyan and Asatryan, 2019). Another possibility is to engage ‘influencers’ for a communication campaign to raise taxpayers' awareness about the importance of paying taxes as a moral obligation and as a means to finance public spending. Our simulations show that by positively affecting the tax morale of influential individuals, a fiscal authority can increase tax compliance. We compare this targeting strategy, which exploits the diffusion process in the network and acts upon tax morale, with a policy that increases the monetary cost of tax evasion, and conclude that affecting the tax morale of influential individuals could complement other efforts to improve compliance.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we review the related literature; in section 3, we present a simple model of taxpayer behaviour; in section 4, we introduce basic concepts and definitions of networks; in section 5, we summarise the results of simulations; in section 6, we illustrate our ‘policy exercise’; and in section 7, we provide some final remarks and policy implications.",Tax evasion and tax morale: A social network analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300707,14 July 2020,2020,Research Article,161.0

Identification of the causal effect exploits a quasi-natural experiment generated by the removal in 2001 of the fiscal restraints on budget decisions for municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants and by stricter budgetary restrictions and severe penalties for noncompliers in 2002. We find that relaxing fiscal rules had a sizeable impact on budget forecast errors, especially in 2002. In fact, revenue (expenditure) forecast errors for municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants became 26% (22%) larger than in the past.","In the past two decades, many decentralized countries have used sub-central fiscal rules to enforce local fiscal discipline, thus avoiding excessive spending and excessive debt of local governments. It has been indeed recognized that high levels of sub-central deficit may turn into higher levels of central government spending and debt (Fornasari et al., 2000), undermining the long-term sustainability of national public finances. In some European Union (EU) countries, e.g. Austria, Belgium, Spain, and Italy, the adoption of sub-central fiscal rules has been the result of abiding with budget agreements taken at the supranational level through the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).====Fiscal rules have been often seen as useful means to curb fiscal indiscipline, especially by local authorities, and to prevent biased budget estimates that are responsible for excessive deficits (Von Hagen and Harden, 1994; Alesina and Perotti, 1996; Frankel, 2011; Chatagny and Soguel, 2012; Frankel and Schreger, 2013). The systematic biased formulation of fiscal variables has indeed major drawbacks in the creation of structural deficit and public debt accumulation to the detriment of local welfare (Boukari and Veiga, 2018) and long-term national fiscal sustainability. However, fiscal rules have been accused of forcing discretionary pro-cyclical fiscal policy (Marinheiro, 2008) and creating “window dressing” measures (Milesi-Ferretti, 2004; Balduzzi and Grembi, 2011) and excessive optimism in official budget forecasts (Frankel, 2011; Frankel and Schreger, 2013), especially in the run-up to elections (Brück and Stephan, 2006; Pina and Venes, 2011). There is a large body of empirical literature which has found controversial results using cross-country data. Empirical studies on the impact of sub-central fiscal rules at the local level are instead much scarcer. Luechinger and Schaltegger (2013) and Chatagny (2015), who exploited the variation in fiscal rules across the Swiss cantons, found that sub-central fiscal rules are effective in improving budgetary forecasting.====In 1999 and 2000, all Italian municipalities were subjected to the Domestic Stability Pact (DSP), a sub-central fiscal rule which restrained the budgetary liberty of local governments. The DSP adopted a “carrot and stick” approach to encourage virtuous behavior and punish noncompliers. However, since 2001 municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants have been exempted from the DSP.==== In 2002, more stringent budgetary restrictions and severe penalties for the violation of the pact were introduced to discourage further non-compliant municipal budgeting decisions. The DSP has been at the centre of numerous political debates, fuelled by the protests of the mayors, who have demanded relaxation of its constraints, especially those on investment spending, or even elimination of the pact. Grembi et al. (2016) showed that the Italian municipalities affected by the DSP had significantly increased their taxes and decreased their deficits, suggesting that the DSP was effective in favoring the sustainability of public finances. However, the misrepresentation of budgetary decisions in Italy is a further key issue, which was not investigated by Grembi et al. (2016). It is indeed well-documented in Cepparulo et al. (2014) and Anessi-Pessina and Sicilia (2015) for national and local contexts, respectively.====In this study, we analyze the effects of the DSP on the accuracy of budgetary projections of Italian municipalities. The analysis of the Italian context is very interesting. There are indeed high levels of compliance among the municipalities (Brugnano and Rapallini, 2009; Balduzzi and Grembi, 2011), which could be a measure of the DSP effectiveness. However, this may reflect creative accounting to circumvent the fiscal restraints (Balduzzi and Grembi, 2011). Furthermore, the removal in 2001 of fiscal restrictions on budgetary decisions for municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants generates a quasi-natural experiment to identify the causal effect of the sub-central budget rule. Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, we shed more light on the relation between local fiscal rules and budgetary behavior of local governments by focusing on the impact on budgetary forecast accuracy, a dimension of the budget that Grembi et al. (2016) overlooked. It is indeed very important to determine how and to what extent the DSP affects municipal budget forecasting, because repeated forecasting errors in local government fiscal variables may frustrate the efforts made by the central government to consolidate national public finances, and they may worsen local welfare. Second, we provide robust estimates of the causal effect on budget forecast errors by exploiting: i) the quasi-natural experiment generated by the exemption in 2001 from the DSP of the municipalities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants, following the identification strategy described in Grembi et al. (2016); ii) stricter budgetary restrictions and severe penalties for noncompliers in 2002. Third, we study whether the effect was heterogeneous across municipalities with different characteristics, the purpose being to enrich the scenario further and speculate on the mechanisms inducing change in the budgetary forecast behavior of local administrators.====We find that the 2001 removal of the fiscal restraints for small municipalities and the introduction of incentives for compliers did not affect forecast errors as regards either revenues or expenditures. However, after the ceiling on current expenditure growth was introduced in 2002 together with more severe penalties for noncompliers, the difference between municipalities just below and above the population threshold became sizeable and significant. We find indeed that revenue (expenditure) forecast errors of municipalities with just under 5000 inhabitants became 26% (22%) larger than those of municipalities just above the cutoff in 2002. The results for revenues are due to increases in the forecast errors in taxes and, especially, in fees and tariffs. Larger errors in revenue projections may be due to excessive exuberance in budget forecasting and/or to a lesser ability to collect taxes and fees resulting in a lower amount of realized revenues, as shown in Grembi et al. (2016). The results for the expenditure forecast errors are instead driven by changes in forecast errors concerning capital outlays. Considering different dimensions of municipality heterogeneity, we find that the effects on the revenue forecast errors are driven by municipalities in the North-West, with larger territories, and with a higher proportion of young people. The results of the expenditure forecast errors are ascribed to municipalities in the North-West, but also to those with high shares of immigrants, young people, and inhabitants with tertiary educations.====Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature on theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of fiscal rules on fiscal outcomes, including budgetary projections. Section 3 focuses on the DSP in Italy. Section 4 describes the sample used in the empirical analysis, the outcome variables, the econometric model, and the identification assumptions. Section 5 reports the empirical findings.

The effect of Mafia infiltration on execution cost overruns and the probability of their occurrence is weaker for larger PWC, and the elections of the new municipal councils, after the dissolution of the previous ones, do not significantly influence the performance of PWC.====Our findings suggest the presence of collusive schemes among bidding firms within the Mafia network and provide new insights for the implementation of more sound policies to tackle practices associated with Mafia infiltration in public procurement.","Public procurement (PP) plays an important economic role within the EU countries given that publicly procured expenditure on works, goods and services in 2015 represents approximately 13.1% of the EU GDP (European Commission, 2019) and 29% of general government expenditure (OECD, 2016). Therefore, an effective and efficient PP system is of strategic importance for governments to avoid mismanagement and waste of public funds (OECD, 2016). PP can be defined as a contract for pecuniary interest concluded between a purchasing public authority and a supplying private economic operator for the provision of works, products, or services needed to pursue institutional goals (Baldi et al., 2016).====There is broad consensus that public authorities should aim to pursue “value for money” in the management of PP (Guccio et al., 2012). However, the relevance of PP also lies in its consideration as a policy instrument to achieve public strategic objectives such as fostering domestic economic growth, innovation, inclusion of SMEs, social responsibility, and sustainability (Flynn, 2017). In this vein, from April 2016, recent EU Directives (2014/24/EU, 2014/25/EU and 2014/23/EU) have imposed the inclusion of these broader social goals, as well as measures to achieve higher efficiency and transparency, within the national PP regulation of the EU member states (Baldi et al., 2016).====Nonetheless, the pursuit of these objectives introduced by EU Directives may be full of obstacles especially in certain social and institutional contexts facing issues like corruption, favouritism, conflict of interests, and other public institution flaws (Baldi et al., 2016). In particular, the extreme vulnerability of PP to corruption, even within the OECD countries, arises from the great magnitude of financial transactions and variety of stakeholders involved, as well as from close interactions between public officials and private businesses (Hessami, 2014; OECD, 2016). The direct social costs of corruption consist of misallocation and waste of public funds, whereas the indirect costs lie in distortion of business competition and underfunding of public policies for social and economic development (OECD, 2015).====In this regard, Italy, as well as being one of the most corrupted nations in EU, according to the 2018 Corruption Perception Index,==== is plagued by the presence of Mafia organizations that exert pervasive control over the economic, political and social activities of the country (Caneppele et al., 2009). The Mafia infiltration for the control of both PP and political institutions is historically so typical that it is embedded in the definition of the Mafia-type association crime, according to the article 416-bis of the Italian criminal law. In this context, the inefficiency of the Italian PP system and the consequent under-provision of infrastructures are not surprising (Guccio et al., 2014).====That said, in this paper we examine the effects of Mafia infiltration on the performance of PP, using a sample of 68,063 public work contracts (PWC) awarded by Italian municipalities over the period 2012–2017, in order to seek evidence of inefficiencies possibly linked to embezzlement and rent-seeking in favour of Mafia organizations. Within this sample, we infer Mafia infiltration in 687 PWC based on two pieces of evidence.====The first piece of evidence is the dissolution of Italian municipal councils, through decree of the President of the Republic, because of verified connections of local administrators with the Mafia. All awarded PWC arising from public tenders published during the term of office of the dissolved elective municipal councils are assumed to be Mafia-infiltrated. In this respect, the 2018 report of the Minister of the Interior on the municipalities dissolved due to Mafia infiltration states that “the operational modalities of the infiltration are mostly concentrated in the sector of PWC on which the economic interests of the organized crime mainly converge” (Ministero dell’Interno - Dipartimento per gli Affari interni e territoriali, 2018).====On the other hand, the second piece of evidence is based on firms seized by judicial authorities because of the accusation of Mafia-type association against their owners. Indeed, the above-mentioned article 416-bis of the Italian penal code provides for the seizure of all the assets, including firms, of the Mafia-associated person, representing the proceeds of the crime or their investment. All PWC awarded to firms controlled by the Mafia, before their seizure, are also assumed to be Mafia-infiltrated.====To test the effect of Mafia infiltration, we use several measures of public work procurement performance, including delivery delays, cost overruns, and awarding rebates, widely used in previous studies on Italian PP as efficiency indicators (Coviello et al., 2018a; Decarolis, 2014; Decarolis and Palumbo, 2015; Guccio et al., 2014). All these performance dimensions may have significant implications for the social welfare addressed by the procured public works (Guccio et al., 2014). Furthermore, we control for several possible determinants of PP performance that include characteristics of the tender, the institutional, social and political context, the awarding firms, the municipalities and their financial health.====Overall, our results support our hypotheses on the positive association of Mafia infiltration with PWC awarding rebates and PWC execution cost overruns. On the other hand, Mafia infiltration is associated with shorter delivery delays for PWC. Our estimations, including municipality fixed effects, are robust to several matching procedures, to address selection bias, as well as to instrumental variable methods and the procedure developed by Oster (2019), to address omitted variable bias. Additional analyses reveal that the positive effect of Mafia infiltration on execution cost overruns, as well as on the probability of their occurrence, is weaker for larger PWC, whereas the effect on awarding rebates and delivery delays is not moderated by the size/complexity of PWC. Furthermore, Mafia infiltration is associated with a higher number of valid bids submitted in the related public tenders, providing further support for the thesis of collusion among bidders within the Mafia network, aiming to influence the awarding of PWC. Finally, we find that the elections of the new municipal councils, after the dissolution of the previous ones, do not significantly affect the prior performance of PWC, suggesting that the dissolution of the Mafia-infiltrated municipalities may be ineffective in eliminating the influence of the Mafia on PWC.====To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to analyse the effects of Mafia infiltration on PP performance, using a wide sample of PWC over a 6-year period. In particular, we contribute to the related literature by adopting a novel strategy to measure Mafia infiltration in PP. This strategy allows us to provide empirical evidence of opportunistic practices, recently documented in anti-Mafia judicial investigations (Caneppele and Martocchia, 2014; DIA, 2016; Martocchia et al., 2014), whereby, to exclude more efficient and capable competitors, colluded companies within the Mafia network get PWC awarded through abnormally high rebates that are subsequently offset with price renegotiations.====As a further contribution, our study supports the usage and analysis of PP performance measures, as red flags for corrupted and collusive schemes, in combination, rather than in isolation, to avoid drawing wrong conclusions. In this regard, the widely used corruption risk indicator in PP based on the single bidding (Fazekas and Tóth, 2018) is not valid in our context. Furthermore, the interpretation of the PP performance measures should also consider the characteristics of PWC, such as complexity and legal requirements, as well as the socio-institutional context that may together influence the strategies adopted by the criminal organizations.====Finally, among the studies on political corruption (e.g., Hessami, 2014; Solé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro, 2018), our study is the first to indicate that, to eradicate criminal infiltrations and corruption from public administration, it may not be enough to intervene on and renew the elected political bodies. Indeed, although the newly elected politicians may have a higher educational level (Daniele and Geys, 2015), the criminal contamination could concern the administrative apparatus of the permanently employed public officials who survive the renovation of the elected political bodies.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: section 2 presents some theory and develops the hypotheses; section 3 describes the empirical strategy and sample data; section 4 presents empirical results; section 5 includes concluding remarks.",The effects of mafia infiltration on public procurement performance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300719,9 July 2020,2020,Research Article,163.0

If so, does voter response vary according to the composition of fiscal adjustments? The empirical literature on the political economy of fiscal adjustments, which is mostly OECD-based, argues that consolidations do not have significant electoral consequences. In contrast, we find that voters punish fiscal consolidations at the polls in Latin America. To explain this result, we focus on the way fiscal adjustments episodes are implemented, both in terms of their design (taxes vs. spending) and timing. Such episodes rely fundamentally on increasing tax rates and bases of ==== (such as the VAT) that hit broad segments of the population. Moreover, these policies are often implemented when politicians have no choice but to consolidate, that is, under severe economic circumstances. These macro results are corroborated with micro evidence from an original survey experiment that measures voter’s fiscal policy preferences over the business cycle in seven countries across Latin America. The experimental evidence shows that respondents prefer expenditure cuts to tax increases during downturns, which is the opposite of the type of consolidations that countries typically pursue.","The ==== literature assumes that voters reward incumbent governments when the economy is strong and punish them when it is weak (e.g., Tufte, 1978; Lewis-Beck, 1988). Empirical studies using cross-country and individual level survey data show that when voter perceptions of the state of the economy improve, they are more likely to vote for the incumbent (e.g., Duch and Stevenson, 2008). A related literature on the ==== (PBC) studies the behavior of fiscal policy in the vicinity of elections and the returns of fiscal policy expansions, such as an increase in deficits, spending hikes, or tax cuts, on electoral results (Drazen, 2000; Rogoff, 1990). Forty five years of research since Nordhaus’s (1975) seminal study, we have learned that fiscal expansions around elections tend to be conditional on a variety of institutional factors==== (Alt and Rose, 2007), and evidence on their effectiveness in boosting incumbents’ reelection prospects is mixed (de Haan and Klomp, 2013; Brender and Drazen, 2008). Surprisingly, much less is known about the political consequences of the opposite phenomenon to the PBC: policy actions oriented at reducing the fiscal deficit in the form of tax increases or spending cuts.==== This is especially true in developing countries or new democracies where evidence on the electoral effects of fiscal adjustments or austerity is almost non-existent.==== In a context of high debt and rising debt service costs in several emerging markets (IMF 2020), identifying how fiscal adjustment strategies might be designed to mitigate potential political costs is a relevant and timely policy issue.====In principle, following the economic vote and PBC logic, voters should oppose fiscal consolidations. Such episodes typically reduce economic growth and thus, voters would punish incumbents who pursue these types of policies.==== Yet, an influential literature, which is mostly based on the experience of advanced democracies, contends that there is no empirical support for this argument (Arias and Stasavage, 2019; Alesina et al., 2013). For example, using a dataset of 19 OECD countries, Alesina et al. (2013) do not find a statistically significant effect of large budget adjustments on electoral outcomes. The policy implication is that fear of punishment at the polls should not be a reason for governments to avoid fiscal consolidations. However, electoral dynamics in OECD countries, particularly because of the large influence of European parliamentary systems, may be quite different to other regions of the world. In the European countries it is easier to hold elections when the timing is favorable (electoral timing is endogenous) and introduce consolidations when electoral risk is low, demonstrating strategic selection bias (Hübscher and Sattler, 2017).====Do these OECD-based results travel to other regions of the world? In this paper we present evidence on the electoral consequences of fiscal adjustments in Latin America. Latin America is an interesting case study for several reasons. First, electoral calendars are fixed, so there cannot be endogenous electoral timing as in most OECD countries. Second, its tax and spending policies are representative of the reality of middle income developing countries: low levels of tax collection coexist with a tax structure that depends mostly on consumption taxes (Gordon and Li, 2009), and the level and composition of public spending limits the typical redistributive role of fiscal policy seen in advanced economies (IMF, 2015). Finally, fiscal policy has been traditionally procyclical, as in most of the developing world (Kaminsky et al., 2004), meaning that tax and spending policies tend to exacerbate macroeconomic volatility and hamper attempts at protecting the most vulnerable groups during recessions.====Our findings show that the OECD-based results do not travel well. Combining a dataset on almost 300 fiscal consolidation episodes that use the “narrative” approach to identify fiscal shocks==== with electoral outcomes spanning 31 countries from 1978 to 2016 across the OECD and Latin America, we find that voters ==== replace government parties more frequently after the implementation of fiscal consolidations in Latin America. Compared to a government that does not engage in fiscal adjustments, the probability of government turnover triples when countries implement ambitious adjustment programs.====To explain this result, we look at the mix (or composition) and timing of fiscal consolidation policies. We show that fiscal consolidations in Latin America are mostly tax-based and rely fundamentally on increasing the tax rates, and bases, of indirect taxes (such as the VAT) that hit broad segments of the population. Moreover, our empirical analysis indicates that these policies are often implemented when politicians have no choice but to consolidate, that is, under severe economic circumstances, which amplifies the multiplier effects of fiscal contractions. We find that tax-based fiscal adjustments are punished by voters, but expenditure-based ones are not. While these conclusions come from aggregate data on elections and fiscal actions, we present micro evidence in the form of a survey experiment specifically designed to measure preferences for fiscal adjustment instruments (taxes, and different expenditure categories) in a cross-section of 6000 Latin American citizens from seven different countries. Our results suggest that voters in these countries prefer expenditure cuts to tax increases during downturns, which is the opposite of the type of consolidations that countries typically pursue.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews previous research on the political economy of fiscal adjustments, discusses the mechanisms linking fiscal actions to electoral results in emerging economies, and identifies our contribution to the literature. Section 3 presents the data and describes our empirical strategy.

Democracies should be cleaner. This is the essence of the ‘clean democracy hypothesis’ (Schultz and Crockett, 1990; Payne, 1995; Li and Reuveny, 2006). According to this theory, there are five related causal mechanisms through which democracy leads to a cleaner environment: First, democracies allow a freer flow of information, and, therefore, environmental lobby groups are more effective in informing the population and raising awareness than in autocracies that censor information. Second, democracies protect the rights of civil society through freedom of speech and freedom of association, which makes it easier for environmental interest groups to organize and exert influence on the political process. Third, democracies are more responsive to demands of the electorate as incumbents are more accountable through free elections and environmental interests can seek political representation. Relatedly, democracies have a higher respect for human life and thus try to avert life-threatening environmental degradation more than autocracies (Gleditsch and Sverdrup, 2003). Fourth, democracies are more cooperative and tend to honor environmental agreements as they are bound by the rule of law (Weiss and Jacobsen, 1999). Fifth, the members of the ruling elite in autocracies are less inclined towards environmental protection than the democratic public as they have a bigger share in the national income and the costs of environmental protection would therefore be higher for them (Congleton, 1992).====Indeed, it has been argued that environmental lobbying groups have led to more stringent environmental policies (Binder and Neumayer, 2005; Fredriksson et al., 2005) and that they have affected policies in other areas as well, such as trade and investment policies (==== Hillman and Ursprung, 1992, 1994, Fredriksson, 1999; Bommer and Schulze, 1999, Schleich, 1999).==== List and Sturm (2006) demonstrate that not only lobby groups, but also electoral incentives are important for shaping environmental policies. Environmental policies in democracies should thus be more demand-determined and, therefore, more stringent than in autocracies or semi-democracies, leading to a better environmental quality.====Implicitly this argument assumes that autocratic rulers care less about the environment than the democratically elected politicians, who are accountable to the public that demands environmental controls.==== According to this line of argument, democratic politicians are consequently more willing to implement environmental restrictions than autocratic rulers.====Yet, democracies also have features that may counteract stricter environmental policies. Congleton (1992) argues that politicians are short-sighted and may refrain from making long-term investments in environmental quality. This may be particularly pronounced as the costs of environmental protection are borne today, while benefits may accrue only with a significant time lag, when incumbents may no longer be in office. Moreover, powerful industry lobbying groups may counteract environmental interests and shift the balance towards lower environmental standards (Midlarsky, 1998; Bättig and Bernauer, 2009). In the presence of large cross-border externalities of environmental protection, democracies may also have similar incentives to free-ride on the abatement efforts of neighboring countries as autocracies. Lastly, it may not be true that the electorate in democracies cares systematically more about the environment than autocratic elites that have to please their ‘selectorate’. In the end, it is an empirical question whether democracies are indeed cleaner.====The majority of empirical evidence is in favor of the ‘clean democracy’ hypothesis. Congleton (1992) argues that liberal democracies are more willing to regulate the environment and provides supportive evidence for regulations of CFC and methane emissions. Li and Reuveny (2006) study carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and organic water pollutants in fixed effects (FE) panel regressions and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, deforestation, and land degradation in cross-sectional regressions. They find for these five measures that democracies have significantly and sizably lower environmental damage.==== Bernauer and Koubi (2009) analyze sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions for 107 cities in 47 countries for the period 1971–1996. In their random-effects model, they find that democracies emit significantly less SO2. Arvin and Lew (2011) study the effect of democracy on CO2 emissions, water pollution, and deforestation damage for 141 developing countries and the period 1976–2003. Using FE models, they find that democracies experience less environmental damage in all dimensions studied, but that this effect is subgroup-specific. For CO2 emissions and water pollution, the effect of democracy is apparent for lower and upper-middle-income countries, but not for low-income or high-income countries. Halkos and Tzeremes (2013) analyze CO2 emissions for the G20 for the period 1996–2010 and relate them to various governance indicators. They find that better governance is associated with lower CO2 emissions. You et al. (2015) use a quantile regression approach for the period 1985–2005 and find that democracy reduces CO2 emissions for high polluting countries but increases emissions for low polluting countries. Lv (2017) uses an interaction term between democracy and GDP per capita to investigate whether the effect of democracy depends on the level of development. For a sample of 19 emerging countries and the period 1997–2010, he finds that CO2 emissions are not smaller in democracies as such, but that high-income democracies emit less CO2 while low-income democracies emit more. Yet, in quantile regressions, he shows that this interaction effect is only significantly negative for countries with low emissions, thus directly contradicting You et al. (2015). Povitkina (2018) finds for a sample of 144 countries and the period 1970–2011 that democracies emit less CO2, but only if their corruption levels are low (between analysis only).====Other studies find no effect of democracy on pollution. Roberts and Parks (2007) find almost no effect of democracy on CO2 emissions. Scruggs (1998) uses data from the Global Environmental Monitoring System and measures for 22 to 29 countries and multiple sites and years the effect of democracy on water pollution (dissolved oxygen, fecal coliform) and air pollution (SO2 and particulates) and finds only for SO2 a significant negative effect of democracy on pollution. The other pollutants are unaffected by democracy. In contrast, Midlarsky (1998) finds that democracy increases CO2 emission, deforestation, and soil erosion by water, that it does not affect freshwater availability and soil erosion by chemicals, and that it increases protected areas; thus that it is, on balance, detrimental for the environment. Finally, Gassebner et al. (2011) carry out an Extreme Bound Analysis on a panel of up to 120 countries and the period 1960–2001 and find that dictatorships are associated with ==== air pollution (CO2) per capita and that economic freedom tends to increase water pollution (biological oxygen demand).====As there is still no empirical consensus on the effect of democracy on pollution, we seek to shed new light on this contentious issue with the help of a novel and comprehensive database. We use the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), a large panel data set covering 132 countries and the period 1970–2012, which allows for testing the effect of democracy on air pollution. Sector-specific emissions for each country are estimated with region and country-specific activity data, emission factors, technology, and end of pipe measures. This methodology ensures transparency and comparability across countries (Crippa et al., 2018). The coverage of the EDGAR database, with eleven emission measures over more than 40 years, is unique and gives us the opportunity to expand the aforementioned studies substantially by discerning patterns across different pollutants. If the hypothesis that democracies are cleaner was true, we should see this effect for most, if not all pollutants. A focus on one pollutant – SO2 or CO2 – might not give a full picture.====Our paper is related to the literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) as we are controlling for per capita GDP and its squared term. The EKC hypothesis posits that per capita emissions should have an inverted U shape relationship with per capita income (Selden and Song, 1994; Grossman and Krueger, 1995; Torras and Boyce, 1998); it has been subject to extensive debate and testing (e.g., Dinda, 2004). The idea behind the EKC is that increasing economic activity, especially energy production and industrial output, first raises environmental degradation (per capita). Then, however, when economic activity grows further, pollution per capita declines again because the economy becomes more advanced and people become richer: the structure of the output shifts towards cleaner products, the technologies become more advanced and cleaner, and people demand higher environmental protection as they have become richer.====Our paper also informs the trade and environment debate (Cherniwchan et al., 2017; Schulze and Ursprung, 2001) on the effects of globalization on environmental quality as we are controlling for globalization and factor endowments of a country. Trade liberalization affects pollution levels through three effects: the scale effect increases pollution due to higher economic activity, the composition effect can go either way depending on the pattern of specialization as countries restructure their economies according to their comparative advantages, and the technique effect reduces pollution as countries have better access to more modern, cleaner technology (Antweiler et al., 2001). Moreover, as trade liberalization increases the average per capita income, people will value the environment more highly and demand better protection. The net effect depends on the relative strengths of these three effects and may differ across countries. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) facilitates technology transfer and thus could reduce environmental damage as more modern and cleaner technology is adopted. We test for a possible globalization effect by including different measures of globalization (KOF globalization index, trade openness and FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and FDI stocks as well as variables capturing the relative factor endowments and their interactions (depending on the specification).====We find no consistent effect of democracy on pollution levels, neither in the regressions with country and time FE, nor in the regressions with only time FE. We do not even find that democracy has a consistent positive effect on the environmental quality for richer countries (as well-off citizens could have been hypothesized to be more likely to demand environmental control). Likewise, there is no convincing evidence for the EKC hypothesis; lastly, we do not find consistent evidence that globalization affects pollution levels.====Our paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we describe our data and empirical approach. Section 3 presents the results.

Such a subsidy brings forward the end of the fossil fuel era but accelerates fossil fuel extraction and global warming in the short run. A weaker fossil fuel ==== implies that anticipation of a given global carbon budget induces fossil producers to deplete reserves more voraciously and accelerate global warming. This race to burn the last ton of carbon is more intensive for the feedback than open-loop ====, so that the Green Paradox effect of a renewable energy subsidy is stronger. There is an intermediate phase of limit pricing to keep renewable energy producers at bay, which becomes much more relevant when a cap on global warming is enforced. A stronger fossil fuel ==== lengthens the period of limit pricing and typically brings forward the carbon-free era. Finally, the mere risk of a cap on global warming being enforced at some unknown, future date makes fossil fuel extraction more voracious and accelerates global warming.","At the 2015 Paris United Nations Climate Change Conference governments have committed to put a cap on global warming of 2 ​°C and strive to keep temperature below 1.5 ​°C. The International Panel of Climate Change, the Carbon Tracker Initiative (Carbon Tracker and Grantham Research Institute, 2013) and a host of academic studies (e.g., Allen et al., 2009; Allen, 2016; McGlade, 2015; van der Ploeg and Rezai, 2020b) have argued that such a cap on global warming requires a credible carbon budget for cumulative emissions. Aengenheyster et al. (2018) show that a cap of 2 ​°C and a risk tolerance of one third means that at most 424 Giga tons of carbon can still be burned from 2015 onwards. If current fossil fuel use is maintained at 10 GtC per year, only 30 years are left before the cap is reached. This study also shows that with a cap of 1.5 ​°C only 198 GtC can be burned from 2015 onwards. Furthermore, if the risk of overshooting the cap is only 5% instead of a third, then the carbon budgets are curbed to 245 GtC and 69 GtC from 2015 onwards for the caps 2 ​°C and 1.5 ​°C, respectively. This means that for the case of a 1.5 ​°C cap only a couple of years are left before the target overshoots. If policy makers wait too long before stepping up climate action, the point of no return will have been reached in the sense that climate policy is no longer able to attain the Paris targets unless policy makers resort to unorthodox policies to ensure negative emissions (e.g., geo-engineering) with all the dangers this might entail (e.g., Wagner and Weitzman, 2015).====Recent debates and concerns about stranded assets among pension funds and other investors indicate that the markets might be anticipating the possibility that climate policy will eventually be toughened to meet the Paris targets and thus that not all fossil fuel reserves in the crust of the earth might be burned. For example, the Generation Foundation (2013) has argued:====Governor Carney of the Bank of England and other presidents of central banks have also warned about the risk of stranded carbon assets for investors and economies, and especially for financial stability (e.g., Carney, 2015; NGFS, 2019). The press speaks of a ‘life or death’ question for fossil-fuel companies, since “investors’ biggest fear is that oil demand growth is longer a given in perpetuity, with some predicting that by the end of the next decade the industry could be facing a peak in consumption as government policies try to curb the use of fossil fuels” and “after all, no chief executive wants to be left holding multibillion-dollar oilfields the world no longer wants or needs” (Sheppard and Raval, 2019). Recently, the equity research house Redburn has removed all “buy” ratings from all the biggest integrated oil companies and has downgraded ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol by giving them a “sell” advice, arguing that the industry faces an existential risk as long-term forecasts are up to 30% too high as they do not price in that policy makers will have to tip into action in the coming years (Dempsey and Shephard, 2019). Hence, the industry faces draconian measures.====The problem is that proven and probable fossil fuel reserves of the major oil and gas companies alone are much higher than the carbon budget necessary to cap temperature at 2 ​°C.==== ==== The excess reserves are even higher for a cap of 1.5 ​°C. Burning these reserves beyond the safe limit increases global warming to unacceptable levels. Furthermore, the problem of stranded assets exacerbates if the relentless discoveries of oil and gas including shale gas in recent years especially in developing economies (e.g., Arezki et al., 2016; 2019) continues in the coming decades and is followed up by ongoing exploitation investments. Oil and gas companies are therefore either overvalued by a substantial amount, so one can profit from shorting these companies on futures markets, or the temperature caps agreed on in Paris are not credible.====But with a strict global carbon budget would it not be rational for policy makers of oil- and gas-rich countries and for oil and gas producers to pump up their oil and gas reserves more vigorously before their competitors do so and before policy makers step up climate action? Would such a fully credible cap on global warming encourage fossil fuel producers to engage in a race to burn the last ton of carbon and bring forward the carbon-free era where only renewable energies are used?==== Does such a race to burn the last ton of carbon and consequent run on oil still arise if the market merely anticipates a risk that the cap on global warming is enforced at some future date? Would the race to burn be less intense then?====At the same time monopolistic fossil fuel producers may use limit pricing to discourage entry of renewable energy producers (Hoel, 1978) and the same is the case for a natural resource oligopoly (e.g. Benchekroun et al., 2017). Setting the price to maximise profits relatively high would induce more entry of renewable producers. Fossil fuel producers may thus set a price lower than that; at a level that still makes profits yet keeps out renewable energy producers. By flooding the market and depressing prices, fossil fuel producers can keep out renewable energy producers.==== If the substitute is supplied competitively and infinitely elastically at constant production cost, fossil fuel has constant extraction cost and fossil fuel producers are monopolistic, it has been shown that there is an initial phase with Hotelling pricing where the rent on fossil fuel rises at the market rate of interest and a subsequent limit pricing phase where the fossil price is set just below the renewable energy cost and the phase ends when reserves are fully exhausted (Hoel, 1978). Such a phase of limit pricing also occurs in the open-loop Nash equilibrium of oligopolistic natural resource markets with constant extraction cost (Benchekroun et al., 2017). How will this phase of limit pricing be affected in the more realistic feedback Nash equilibrium and when extraction costs rise as reserves fall?====In view of these questions, my first aim is to gain analytical understanding on the race to burn the last ton of carbon and how this race is affected by limit pricing if fossil fuel extraction costs rise as reserves are depleted. I therefore analyse the open-loop and feedback Nash equilibrium outcomes for an oligopolistic market of fossil fuel producers whose extraction costs rise as the cheapest oil, gas and coal deposits are depleted and who face a carbon-free perfect substitute (renewable energy) or the backstop for short. The condition that the cost of extracting the last ton of carbon must equal the cost of renewable energy then implies that the amount of fossil fuel to be left in the crust of the earth or stranded carbon assets decreases in the net cost of renewable energy.==== I show that for both outcomes an increase in the number of fossil fuel producers increases the speed of fossil fuel extraction and accelerates global warming in the short run, but cumulative carbon emissions are unaffected. More competition on the fossil fuel market induces a quicker end of the fossil fuel era. I show that this race to burn the last ton of carbon is more intense for the feedback than the open-loop Nash equilibrium outcome. I also show that the phase of Hotelling pricing is followed by an intermediate phase of limit pricing before the carbon-free era finally commences and characterise the properties of each of the three phases.====Benchekroun et al. (2017) study an oligopoly of oil producers, a fringe of shale oil producers and a backstop supply of competitive renewable energy producers and analyse limit pricing strategies to keep other energy producers at bay. My paper differs in two important respects. First, Benchekroun et al. (2017) analyse an open-loop Nash equilibrium whereas I also provide a feedback Nash equilibrium outcome. Second, Benchekroun et al. (2017) assume constant extraction costs per unit of fossil fuel whilst I assume stock-dependent extraction cost. This allows cumulative extraction and thus cumulative emissions and temperature to be endogenous, which is essential to discuss climate policy and the issue of stranded carbon assets in a meaningful way. This extension also allows a risk perspective on a cap on cumulative emissions or temperature.====The mechanism for rapacious extraction differs from that in dynamic common pool problems (e.g., Gordon, 1954; Levhari and Mirman, 1980)==== or from the voracity effect (Lane and Tornell, 1996; Tornell and Lane, 1999), both of which arise from the natural resource being publicly rather than privately owned. In the framework of the current paper there is also a dynamic common-pool problem as the global or industry-wide stock of fossil fuel reserves affects extraction costs of individual fossil fuel producers. However, a novel feature of my paper is that there is an additional mechanism for voracious extraction which arises as fossil fuel owners anticipate that there is a strict budget for cumulative carbon emissions and thus deplete faster in order to not to get stuck with unsaleable carbon assets.====My second aim is to investigate how the race to burn the last ton of the carbon is affected by second-best climate policies. Governments prefer the stick to the carrot as it is politically tough to commit to a slow and rising path of carbon taxation and easier to postpone carbon taxation or subsidise renewable energy. A cap on peak global warming requires a credible carbon budget, which can be enforced by an appropriate subsidy on renewable energy. This induces faster fossil fuel extraction and accelerates global warming in the short run, which is the Green Paradox (e.g., Sinn, 2008), but locks up more fossil fuel reserves in the crust of the earth in the long run.==== Enforcing a cap on global warming with a renewable energy subsidy thus induces a short-run cost of accelerated heating of the planet and exacerbates the race to burn the last ton of carbon.====My final aim is to analyse the effects of the probability of a serious climate policy taking place at some unknown, future data on the speed of fossil fuel depletion and on stranded carbon assets. I apply a regime shift framework and show that an increased risk of the cap on peak global warming and on cumulative carbon emissions being enforced with a second-best climate policy accelerates global warming and reinforces the race to burn the last ton of carbon, but less so than if the cap on global warming is enforced immediately.====The “race to run the last ton of carbon” and the “Green Paradox” are closely related concepts. Both are concerned with the political economy of politicians tending to prefer the carrot to the stick. Here this means that politicians prefer to use renewable energy subsidies instead of the first-best policy of carbon pricing. Furthermore, politicians tend to procrastinate on climate policy which means it is unclear when they will finally implement the climate policy that is needed to stay below the temperature cap. The resulting second-best climate policies have unintended consequences as they boost fossil fuel extraction and carbon emissions in the short run with adverse effects on temperature. However, there are four important differences between the race to burn the last ton of carbon and the discussion of the Green Paradox in the literature.====First, the models used to analyse the Green Paradox effect have a negative impact of global warming on aggregate production and set the first-best optimal carbon price to the expected present discounted value of all current and future global warming damages resulting from one emitting one ton of carbon today (i.e. the “social cost of carbon”). Instead, following the Paris agreement the race to burn the last ton of carbon has as its focus a temperature cap or equivalently a cap on cumulative emissions, not damages to production. Hence, the first-best optimal climate policy is to have carbon price that follows a modified Hotelling rule for else the policy would not be intertemporally efficient. I show that enforcing a temperature cap via a second-best renewable energy subsidy will induce Green Paradox effects, i.e. acceleration of fossil fuel use and carbon emissions, but will also lock up more carbon in the earth as this is the only way to curb cumulative emissions. It follows that this necessarily implies a more rapid transition to the carbon-free era.====Second, the race to burn the last ton of carbon involves game-theoretic aspects as it deals with multiple firms producing fossil fuel. It takes account of the fact that if one firm burns a ton of carbon then all the other firms together must burn one ton less if the cumulative carbon budget is strictly imposed. Market structure of the fossil fuel industry matters. I show that even though a monopolist and to a lesser extent an oligopoly extracts fossil fuel less voraciously than a competitive fossil fuel market and bring in limit pricing at a later period and also lead to a later start of the carbon-free era. The maximum temperature is as a result of the renewable energy subsidy the same under all market outcomes, but under an oligopolistic fossil fuel market it takes longer for the carbon-free era to emerge than under a competitive fossil fuel market.====Third, as the race to burn the last ton of carbon allows for a departure from competitive fossil fuel markets, a new phase of limit pricing to keep renewable energy producers out of the market for some time longer emerges. I therefore pay attention to the nature and timing of the various phases of the optimal programme. Fourth, the race to burn the last ton of carbon also sheds light on the risk that future climate policy becomes more ambitious and the possibility of stranded carbon assets. For these reasons it helps to coin the phenomenon under consideration as the race to burn the last ton of carbon, although this concept is clearly closely related to the Green Paradox.====Some recent studies have investigated the run of oil, climate policy and stranded assets and on the risk of a sudden tightening of climate policy at some future date and the implications this has for stranded assets (e.g. Barnett, 2019; Rezai and van der Ploeg, 2016,b). These studies show that stepping up climate policy that restricts oil use at some unknown future data generates a run on oil (or a Green Paradox effect). Effectively, oil firms dynamically accelerate the rate of oil extraction and thus accelerate global warming due to the risk of future climate policy stranding carbon-intensive assets. The risk and uncertainty of a future tightening of climate policy and the run on oil it causes, depresses the oil price and the value of firms compared to a setting without anticipated climate policy changes. Barnett (2019) offers empirical evidence that suggests that climate policy risk on observable market outcomes for oil production, stock returns and oil prices are in line with those arguments. Rezai and van der Ploeg (2016,b) extend the arguments to allow for the effects of multiple tipping of climate policy where policy at some future unknown date is set optimally to meet the internationally agreed target of 2 ​°C warming relative to pre-industrial temperatures on the asset price, market valuation and exploration investments of the oil industry, paying particular attention to investment adjustment costs. The contribution of the present paper relative to these studies is that it focuses on the game-theoretic foundations of a run on oil. This is also why we refer to this newly identify phenomenon as a race to burn the last ton of carbon rather than a run on oil.====The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 sets up the model. Section 3 derives the oligopolistic market outcomes and shows the three phases for the energy market. Section 4 shows how the speed of extraction varies with the number of fossil fuel firms for both the open-loop and the feedback Nash equilibrium outcomes and further characterises the optimal outcomes. Section 5 analyses the short-run Green Paradox effects of using a renewable energy subsidy to put a cap on peak global warming. Section 6 gives numerical policy simulations to illustrate the results and gain further insights. Section 7 discusses the effects of the risk of a cap on global warming as a political regime shift. Section 8 concludes and offers some suggestions for further research.",Race to burn the last ton of carbon and the risk of stranded assets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626802030063X,17 June 2020,2020,Research Article,168.0

That shift was large and particularly pronounced in states that typically vote Republican, and in swing states. Without it McCain would have received half the votes needed in nine crucial swing states to reverse the outcome of the election. We extend our analysis to the Presidential elections from 1996 to 2012 and find that voters only react to contractions, not expansions, of credit, and reactions are similar for Democratic and Republican incumbent parties.","Empirical work on the economic voter hypothesis consistently shows that the state of the economy affects voting behavior.==== But the same work fails to pin down at the micro level the economic variables (e.g. inflation, unemployment) that matter the most for voters. Here we offer another economic variable for consideration, which is the change in the supply of credit.====There are good reasons to suspect voting and credit subsidies are related: government policies subsidizing homeownership have been a hallmark of American politics for nearly a century and have also figured prominently in various electoral campaigns across the world. That said, we also recognize that there are mechanisms other than voting that may reward politicians for supporting credit subsidies. For example, apart from voting, politicians may be rewarded by the financial or political support of well-defined and organized vested interests, which may include banks and urban activist organizations, which played a crucial role in promoting mortgage credit subsidies, especially from 1992 to 2007 (Calomiris and Haber, 2014). It is possible that some politicians’ actions are rewarded or punished by voting while others are rewarded by the coordinated actions of interest groups.====While there is ample evidence of the strong relation between the state of the macro-economy and elections’ outcomes (Fair, 1978, 1996, 1998; 2002; Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2000) there is no micro evidence of the relation between changes in credit supply and voting behavior. In this paper, we provide the first such micro evidence and find that voters do, in fact, punish incumbent Presidential candidates for experienced contractions in the supply of mortgage credit. We build on Fair’s work by connecting votes for President at the county level to county-level conditions in the mortgage market, as well as other economic variables, including unemployment. Using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on banks’ provision of mortgage credit, we identify supply shifts in mortgage credit at the county level and examine how shifts in the supply of mortgage credit affected the county-level popular vote in the Presidential election of 2008. We focus primarily on the period 2004 to 2008, and the election results of 2008 because this four year period saw an unprecedented swing from the most generous underwriting standards for mortgages in U.S. history in 2004–2006 to a severe contraction of mortgage credit during the subprime crisis of 2007–2009. It also saw a dramatic swing in electoral results, with the Republican Presidential candidate winning many key swing states in 2004, but losing those same states in 2008.====We find that, after controlling for other relevant factors, voters responded to the contraction in credit by shifting their support away from the Republican Presidential candidate in the 2008 Presidential election (John McCain). The shift toward the Democratic Presidential candidate (Barack Obama) was particularly pronounced in swing states (those that have the least predictable support for either party). The magnitude of the effect of mortgage credit supply shifts on voting is large in 2008. Our estimates indicate that in the absence of the mortgage credit supply contraction, some important swing states – most obviously, North Carolina – would have cast their electoral votes for McCain. In other swing states, the absence of mortgage credit supply contraction by itself would not have reversed the electoral result, but nevertheless, would have substantially narrowed the gap between votes received by McCain and Obama in 2008. Overall, taking into account the effects of mortgage credit in the crucial swing states that voted for Obama, we find that if mortgage credit supply had not shifted adversely from 2004 to 2008, McCain would have received half the votes needed to capture all nine of the swing states that Bush had won in 2004 but that McCain lost in 2008, which would have reversed the outcome of the election. In that sense, the contraction in mortgage credit supply from 2004 to 2008 was five times as important as the increase in the unemployment rate; if unemployment had not increased from 2004 to 2008, that improvement in local labor markets would only have given McCain 9% of the votes he needed in those crucial swing states.====We extend our analysis to other Presidential elections from 1996 to 2012. Consistent with the findings for 2008, we find that contractions in credit supply from 2008 to 2012 penalized the incumbent party and benefited the candidacy of Mitt Romney. In the mortgage credit boom phase, however, which was relevant for the 2000 and 2004 elections, there is no evidence that counties with relatively high credit expansion voted in favor of either the Democratic Presidential candidate in 2000 or the Republican Presidential candidate in 2004. In other words, voters did not reward Presidential candidates of the incumbent party in response to experiencing a greater than average local boom in mortgage credit supply. These results suggest that the way voters react to mortgage credit changes do not vary substantially according to the political party of the incumbent, but do vary according to whether a boom or a contraction in credit is occurring. Voters do not reward Presidential candidates for booms of credit, but they do punish them for contractions.====Our findings have important implications for research on the politics of mortgage credit. Most importantly, our findings do not lend support to the view that Presidential candidates gained direct votes from supporting the relaxation of underwriting standards for mortgage lending from 1996 to 2004. If political rewards attended that support, those rewards would have had to come from other sources (such as campaign donations or other support by interest groups). The contraction of credit supply, however, had large and tangible consequences for Presidential candidates. That finding suggests at least part of the explanation for recent policies by the Obama Administration to relax underwriting standards may be a concern for electoral consequences. Indeed, our findings may help explain the actions by Mel Watt, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) from 2014 to 2019, who lowered downpayment requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, and coincident actions to limit the insurance premium charged by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).==== GSE mortgage-backed securities were also exempted from the Volcker Rule’s prohibition on proprietary trading. Finally, although the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 called for strict new standards for “qualifying mortgages,” rather than create two standards (strict and less strict), regulators opted to only create a single, less strict standard, after considerable lobbying pressure and pressure from members of Congress pushed the regulatory agencies to weaken previously proposed standards (Gordon and Rosenthal, 2016).====Section 2 provides an overview of the related literature.

The typical economic rationale underlying the approach is that decentralization leads to a better match between the supply of local services and the geographically diverse preferences of residents. Theoretically, the anticipated benefits fundamentally derive from the relative physical closeness of local governments to their respective citizens. The proximity allows local politicians to more precisely determine citizen demand for public goods, compared to central government, and facilitates the supply of services to meet those demands (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1972).====Proximity may also assist in strengthening local political accountability (Seabright, 1996; Besley and Coate, 1999; Persson and Tabellini, 2002). Because citizens are physically nearer to their local governments, they may be especially motivated and able to insist that their demands for more and better services are met. Citizens reward politicians that are responsive to their service needs by returning them to office and penalize those that don’t by voting them out, again in theory. The economic and political mechanisms associated with decentralization reinforce one another to yield improved service outcomes, it is argued.====Substantial research suggests, however, that the posited interrelated economic and political benefits described above may not be so easily obtained. Elite capture and clientelism—ubiquitous in the developing world—may restrain achievement of the hypothesized match between service supply and citizen demand in decentralized systems, as benefits are seized by special interest groups of one kind or another (e.g. Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2000, 2006, 2012; Martinez-Bravo, 2014; Martinez-Bravo et al 2017). And citizens may face information and personal capacity limitations that constrain their decision-making and institutional arrangements that obscure public sector responsibility for delivering services. Both of these may reduce voters’ collective ability to accurately judge government performance, either retrospectively or prospectively, which in turn may skew electoral choices and limit political accountability (Anderson, 2007; Lacy and Christenson, 2017).====This paper focuses specifically on political accountability and public service delivery. We ask: to what extent do voters actually hold local leaders accountable for public service performance in decentralized environments, as some theory suggests should be the case and that other research casts in doubt? Perhaps surprisingly, the question has not received much empirical attention in the literature (De Kadt and Lieberman, 2017). And the studies that do address this specific question have yielded quite divergent results.====Harding (2015), for example, finds that voters in Ghana hold politicians accountable for investment in roads but not for the quality of education. The author argues that the differential outcomes obtain because roads are more clearly seen as a local responsibility (i.e. they are “attributable”) whereas education is not. Blattman et al. (2018) determine that recipients of poverty-reduction transfers in Uganda are no more likely than non-recipients to vote for the party that organized the anti-poverty program in the first instance. According to the authors, citizens may have misattributed program implementation to the wrong parties. De Kadt and Lieberman (2017) find a negative relationship between improvements in the provision of piped water, flush toilets, and refuse collection (all of which are attributable) and voter support in South Africa. The authors submit that citizen concerns about corruption and escalating expectations for service delivery may be driving these surprising results.====We extend and deepen this literature by studying the case of Indonesia, one of the world’s most decentralized countries and its third largest democracy. We consider three main questions of significance in this context. First, we examine the impact of mayoral candidates’ incumbent status on the probability of winning subsequent election, in general. Second, we investigate the extent to which variation in changes to public service access condition those incumbency effects. Third, we analyze the fiscal, financial management, and service delivery performance of electorally successful incumbents—second term mayors. We have constructed a unique database on local government elections to study these questions and apply regression discontinuity (RD) methods to the data to identify casual effects.====We analyze individual candidate incumbency effects, as opposed to political party incumbent advantage. Political party proliferation at the local level in Indonesia is significant (Tomsa, 2014). Recently, the average number of political parties serving on local legislatures was over 11 and ranged between four and 22 (Lewis and Hendrawan, 2019). Unsurprisingly, the same parties are not often represented in consecutive elections. Furthermore, most mayoral candidates in Indonesia do not have strong political party affiliations. Some candidates run as independents and others choose their party affiliation out of convenience, from the set of political parties in the local legislature that join their pre-electoral coalitions (Lewis, 2019b). Winning and losing candidates in one election may switch their official party associations if and when they run in the next election. Under these circumstances, the analysis of personal incumbency effects is more sensible (De Magalhaes, 2015).====Similar to other recent studies at the subnational level, we estimate unconditional (individual) incumbency effects (Trounstine, 2011; De Magalhaes, 2015; and De Benedictis-Kessner, 2018).==== The unconditional impact provides an estimate of the probability that an incumbent candidate wins in the next election, relative to non-incumbent candidate chances, where all candidates who ran in the previous election comprise the set of observations to be examined, i.e. including those candidates in the first election that did not rerun in the subsequent election. Estimated unconditional incumbency effects may be biased if incumbents and non-incumbents rerun at different rates. The solution proposed by De Magalhaes (2015) and followed by De Benedictis-Kessner (2018), is to estimate two outcomes: (1) the probability that incumbent candidates rerun relative to non-incumbents and (2) the probability that incumbents run and win compared to non-incumbents.====De Magalhaes (2015) finds that mayoral incumbents in Brazil are 17 percent more likely to run in the next election than non-incumbents but that the former are no more likely to run and win than the latter. De Benedictis-Kessner (2018) estimates that the probability that incumbent mayors in the US run in the subsequent election is 46 percent higher than that of non-incumbents and that incumbents are 37 percent more likely to run and win than non-incumbents. ==== Adopting a similar approach, our baseline estimates of incumbency advantage in subnational Indonesia show the extent to which citizens are generally willing to vote mayoral incumbents back into office and are intended to provide some initial idea about the relationship between political accountability and service delivery.====An important specific issue regarding estimated incumbency effects is the extent to which they are heterogeneous across election, candidate, or electoral district characteristics. The analysis of incumbency advantage heterogeneity can yield significant insights about democratic accountability in the political system. De Benedictis-Kessner (2018) examines the heterogeneity of unconditional mayoral incumbent advantage in the US across the differential timing of polls (i.e. on- and off-cycle), for example. He finds that on-cycle (i.e. concurrent) elections confer a substantially larger advantage to incumbent candidates than off-cycle elections, demonstrating the importance of electoral rules for political accountability.====We focus our analysis of mayoral incumbency effect heterogeneity on improvements in the provision of services in the education, health, and infrastructure, all of which are the direct responsibility of local governments and widely recognized as such. We do so to drill down in a more detailed manner on the hypothesis that citizens hold elected politicians accountable for local public service outcomes, as theory suggests should be the case.====A final concern of significance in this context is the performance of electorally successful incumbent candidates—second term mayors. While the examination of incumbent advantage heterogeneity can assist in uncovering factors (differential improvements to service access in our case) that may underlie that advantage, the investigation of second term performance of winning incumbents can help reveal how well politicians respond to citizens having returned them to office (i.e. via improvements in service delivery, for example). This is important because, after all, a vote for an incumbent is not just recompense for (potentially) meeting citizen demands in the current period; it also represents the expectation that good performance will continue in the succeeding term. This issue has not received much attention in the literature. To the authors’ knowledge the only published work on the topic is that of Ferraz and Finan (2011) who examine differences in corruption across first- and second term mayors in the US, although not in the context of incumbency advantage. They find that second term mayors are more corrupt than first term municipal executives. We investigate budget allocation, financial management, and service access differentials across first- and second term mayor led districts with a view to providing evidence about the extent to which politicians reward citizens for re-electing them with generally improved performance.====We find evidence of very strong incumbency effects for mayoral elections in Indonesia. Incumbent candidates are just less than 50 percent more likely to run in the next election than non-incumbents and they are also around 50 percent more probable to run and win election than their non-incumbent counterparts. We discern mixed results regarding the heterogeneity of incumbents’ advantage with respect to advances in local service provision: incumbents seem no more or less apt to run again in quickly improving service delivery districts than incumbents in more slowly advancing districts; however, when incumbents in more rapidly progressing service delivery districts do run again voters appear substantially more likely to return them to office than their counterparts in more slowly service improving districts. Finally, we show that second term mayors allocate fewer funds to (routine and) education and health budgets and spend more on (capital and) infrastructure than first term mayors, that they manage their budgets less carefully (as judged by external audit outcomes), and that they deliver services no more or less effectively than their first term counterparts. We conjecture that the lack of electoral incentives faced by second term mayors (who cannot stand for re-election because of term limits) leads to their rather disappointing fiscal, financial management, and service performance vis-à-vis first term mayors.====Our paper makes three main contributions to the academic literature. First, we add substantively to the small but essential body of work on the estimation of ==== incumbency impacts (Trounstine, 2011; De Magalhaes, 2015; and De Benedictis-Kessner, 2018), extending the basis for useful comparisons of incumbent advantage across countries of the world. Second, and more importantly, we deepen research on the extent to which voters hold their politicians accountable for desired outcomes by assessing the heterogeneity of incumbency effects across a wide range of service outcome differentials and, for the first time in the literature, by investigating the fiscal, financial management, and service performance of electorally successful incumbent candidates We also advance research in this area by adopting a methodological approach that arguably yields more reliable causal estimates of accountability effects than in previous studies (Harding, 2015; De Kadt and Lieberman, 2017; and Blattman et al., 2018). Finally, we add to the large and growing body of research on state-of-the-art estimation of causal incumbency impacts that began with Lee (2008) and continues through today (Hainmuller and Kern, 2008; Ferreira and Gyourko, 2009, 2014; Gerber and Hopkins, 2011; Ade et al., 2014; Hal and Snyder, 2015; Freier, 2015; Ban et al., 2016; De Benedictis-Kessner and Warshaw, 2016; Freier and Thomasius, 2016; Ariga et al., 2016; Hidalgo and Nechter, 2016; Klašnja and Titiunik, 2017; and Da Fonseca and Lopes, 2017).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we provide some background on the local fiscal and political context in Indonesia. Second, we describe the data used in our various analyses. Third, we outline our identification strategy. Fourth, we present and discuss our main empirical results related to incumbency effects and check the robustness of those results to underlying assumptions. Fifth, we examine the heterogeneity of incumbency impacts across differential changes in service access. Sixth, we investigate the performance of first- and second term mayors.

For the implementation of such rights in some countries, certain rules concerning the number and geographical distribution of the speakers of a minority language have to be fulfilled.

We first provide a normative background for this type of language policy, a benchmark, analyzing language policy on the basis of ====, first discussing why language policy is but one type of public policy, then defining and discussing the benefit or “demand” side assuming that benefits are basically proportional to the number of beneficiaries of the planning measure. We then argue that the costs of a planning measure can be described as a function of two variables, “number of beneficiaries” and “size of area of application”. This lets us analyze planning measures in a two-dimensional model fully characterized by the number of beneficiaries and their geographical distribution in the jurisdiction under consideration. Finally, we characterize the optimal size and extension of the jurisdictions where the language rights are to be implemented. It is then shown, how the policy maker can manipulate the goals of the policy, the implementation rules, as well as the borders of the jurisdictions in order to achieve her or his political goals when they differ from the cost-benefit optimum.","In order to sensibly discuss the effects of a politically motivated language policy, it is necessary to have a normative benchmark with which the policy outcomes can be compared. Our benchmark in this essay is (Pareto) efficiency. This can be modified into cost efficiency to take the policy maker's preferences for discrimination into account. Policy alternatives and actual policy observed will be compared to these benchmarks. We argue that the policy maker has several instruments at his or her disposal for manipulating, positively or negatively, the well-being of members of a minority. We will show that although a cost-efficient discriminatory policy is possible, taking the preferences for discrimination of the policy maker into account, the most common instruments, as a rule, do not lead to cost efficiency. We will argue that “efficient” discrimination might be politically unacceptable, whereas formally fair rules leading to inefficient indirect discrimination of comparable magnitude might be met with less political resistance.====In this introduction, we will first discuss why language policy measures form a natural part of public policy. Then, we show how the efficiency benchmark relates to concepts of justice based on equal treatment, arguing that efficiency and equity in general are only possible with compensations payments from members of the majority to the those of a minority.

Incoming teacher-trainees are more left-wing in ideology and political preferences than the average incoming university student. I find also that teacher training programs exert a socialization effect: as compared to the average student, teacher trainees’ views are reinforced and they become more left-wing as they progress in their studies. In a third step, I use the German Socio-Economic Panel to compare tenured teachers’ political attitudes with other university graduates and other civil servants, and find that tenured teachers are more left-wing than the average in the respective reference groups. I consider possible explanations for the left-wing orientation of teachers in the German educational system and implications of indoctrination and imbalance of views.","For many young Germans, becoming a teacher is an attractive option. The compression of earnings in the teaching profession attracts relatively risk-averse students (Lang and Palacios, 2018) and, since performance assessments of teachers are not a high-stake matter in Germany, peer competition is limited. After graduating from a university program called ====, a teacher training position (====) is readily obtained through a state-wide centralized employment system. Teachers have the status of civil servants, which grants them tenure and various other employment benefits.====I consider the following questions. Do incoming teacher-training students differ significantly from students in other fields of studies; do their attitudes change while studying; are these changes, if they occur, specific to teacher trainees or do they reflect a common trend among students; and finally do the attitudes that set graduates of teacher-training programs apart from other university graduates also set apart tenured teachers from people with a similar training or profession?====My focus is on ideology and politics. Are teacher trainees more supportive of a particular ideology than their fellow students; and, if so, is this reflected in a sustained ideological position of tenured teachers that differs from that of similar professionals who followed different career paths?====Answers can reflect self-selection and socialization (Hastie, 2007). Self-selection refers to initial choice of a field of study according to ideological or political attitudes. Socialization is the effect on political attitudes in the course of progress in a chosen field of study (Plant, 1966; Guimond and Palmer, 1990, 1996). With respect to socialization, Eagly and Chaiken (1993) distinguished two main mechanisms: ====, whereby attitudes change based on information received when studying; and ====, whereby students’ attitudes change by exposure to attitudes of their professors (indoctrination) and fellow students (peer pressure).====I find prominence of left-wing ideology and political views among German-trainer teachers, ostensibly through self-selection. There is reinforcement through socialization as studies progress. The results are consistent with ideology and political attitudes of tenured teachers, who the students eventually become.====Ideological and political attitudes of teacher trainees have not been previously studied. Investigating the political attitudes of teacher-trainees is interesting because these students will become teachers who influence their pupils’ ideological and political attitudes. Knowing more about future teachers can determine whether tenured teachers embrace ideologies and have political attitudes because of their family background, peer pressure while studying, or financial dependence on the state. Teacher training, as compared to most other university programs, is targeted to a clearly defined career path and is thus ideally suited for an investigation that links the ideological and political attitudes of university students to the ideological and political attitudes that may be prominent in the profession they will be joining.====Most closely related to my study are the studies by Goossens and Méon (2015) and Fischer et al. (2017). Both of these studies are concerned with university education and differentiate carefully between self-selection and socialization effects. Goossens and Méon (2015) use a survey of students of different disciplines in their first and final year of university studies to investigate whether economics and business students hold different beliefs about the existence of mutual benefit from market transactions than students studying different disciplines. The results show evidence of both socialization and self-selection effects of studying economics or business. Fischer et al. (2017) also investigated self-selection and socialization effects of university students. They found evidence of self-selection according to political attitudes in all fields of study, and socialization effects only for economics students, who become, in the course of their studies, more market oriented.",Teachers and politics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300501,22 May 2020,2020,Research Article,173.0

However, as most of these studies acknowledge, the measures tracking the security of property rights that are currently available are not without issues. Indeed, one major problem of the indexes that combine various measures, like the Fraser Institute's index used in Amendola et al. (2013), is that they often include aspects that are not directly related to property rights. Other measures, like the Heritage Foundation's indicator used by Goldsmith (1995), are potentially influenced by the political perception/leaning of their authors. Despite these problems, these indicators continue to be used because of a more pressing issue concerning the availability of the data. For example, while the index of patent rights of Ginarte and Park (1997), which is used by Schneider (2005), does not suffer from similar problems as the indicators above, it is only available on a five-yearly basis between 1970 and 1990. Consequently, researchers have been forced to make a trade-off between the methodological suitability and availability of the data.====In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a new index that strictly measures the security of property rights (PRP). The security of property rights is defined as “the degree to which the country's laws protect private property rights and the degree to which its government enforces those laws. This also includes the possibility that private property will be expropriated” (Teorell et al., 2013, p. 211). This definition is distinct from the more general rule of law, which captures the extent to which property rights are protected; but also includes indicators that “measure the success of a society in developing an environment in which fair and predictable rules form the basis for economic and social interactions” (Teorell et al., 2019 p.657). Our proposed index, on the other hand, tries to measure the security of property rights by purging where possible elements such as those alluded in Teorell et al. (2019). We do not imply this to mean that the other components of the rule of law, or the quality of governance do not affect property rights. However, this more strict definition is particularly useful when contrasting different components of the quality of governance or in empirical studies that focus specifically on property rights, especially when it is posited to have a non-linear effect (as is the case with inequality).====Starting from an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of existing measures on property rights, we select 18 indicators that strictly measure the security of property rights. Combining these indicators into a single index of property rights requires finding a solution to several technical problems, most importantly, the difference in the availability of the indicators: as much as 80% of the data is missing. Moreover, these indicators can also be markedly different: seven indicators are close-to continuous variables, four are truncated, while the remaining seven indicators are categorical data. To combine the indicators in a way that reflects the differences in their type, and that can handle missing observations, we use a state-space model. A state-space model is similar to the unobserved components model used in the construction of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (Kaufmann et al., 2009). The primary difference is that the state-space model also takes the temporal dependence into account. This is particularly interesting when creating an index of the security of property rights as this is likely to follow a random walk: barring any (legislative) changes, the security of property rights will be the same today as it was yesterday. By taking this temporal component into account, the state-space model can estimate with much greater certainty, particularly in the presence of missing observations.====The new PRP index provides an estimate of the security of property rights for more than 190 countries from 1994 to 2014. As such, it significantly increases the data availability relative to the Heritage Foundation (15% increase) and the Fraser Institute's indexes (45% increase). While the overall correlation between the three indexes is high, this is entirely driven by a strong correlation in the average security of property rights of different countries. As we will show, the three indexes reach sharply diverging conclusions when used in panel data or time-series analyses. Finally, the PRP index is robust to our modelling choices, including the assumption about the behaviour of PRP over time, the treatment of categorical data, and other modelling choices.====After constructing the index, we use it to re-examine the link between inequality and property rights. While the importance of property rights for growth and development has been firmly established, their effect on income distributions remains an open question. Theoretically, the extent to which property rights affect inequality will depend on whose property is being protected by the government. Property rights can worsen income inequality if they are designed to perpetuate the interests of advantaged minorities (Levi, 1988; Sened, 1997). On the other hand, as Besley and Persson (2013) note, property rights also increase the ability of the government to levy taxes and redistribute that income, which could lead to a decrease in inequality. In line with this, empirical analyses by Carmignani (2009) and Amendola et al. (2013) found that more secure property rights decrease inequality.====Our empirical analysis differs from the existing studies in a few ways. First, by using the newly constructed index of the security of property rights, we increase the number of countries covered. As we will show in section 3.2, the PRP index is also specifically designed to be used in panel data analysis, in contrast to e.g. the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Moreover, whereas most indicators take various aspects of the rule of law into account, our index is focused solely on the security of property rights. This allows us to separate its effects on income distribution from that of other institutional changes. Finally, we investigate the effect of property rights on income inequality before and after taxes and transfers.====The relationship between property rights and inequality is estimated using a panel threshold model, which allow us to explore the interplay between inequality, democracy and property rights. To be more specific, the approach allows us to estimate the effect of property rights on inequality at different democratic threshold levels, thus allowing for non-linearities in the relationship between inequality and property rights. We subsequently replicate our empirical analysis using the Fraser Institute index, the Worldwide Governance index and the Heritage Foundation index. In contrast to existing measures of property rights, we find that in more democratic countries the decrease in inequality caused by property rights is achieved via the government's redistribution. This finding offers support to Besley and Persson (2013) and Acemoglu et al. (2013) who highlight the distributive role of government on the effectiveness of property rights.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we discuss available data on the security of property rights and section 3 outlines the construction of the new PRP index. Section 4 then uses the PRP index to take another look at the relationship between property rights and inequality.

First, do election systems differ in how they translate physical attractiveness of candidates into electoral success? Second, do political parties strategically exploit the “beauty premium” when deciding on which candidates to nominate, and, third, do elected MPs use their beauty premium to reap some independence from their party? Using the German election system that combines first-past-the-post election with party-list proportional representation, our results show that plurality elections provide more scope for translating physical attractiveness into electoral success than proportional representation. Whether political parties strategically use the beauty premium to optimize their electoral objectives is less clear. Physically attractive MPs, however, allow themselves to dissent more often, i.e. they vote more often against the party line than their less attractive peers.","Beauty pays. This is a commonplace truth. Physically attractive people experience benefits in almost all areas of life. Cute babies are better cared for, teachers pay more attention to attractive school children, and attractive adults are more likely to obtain good jobs, to be promoted, to earn high incomes, to obtain loans, to be elected to public office, to be acquitted as defendants, to be given lighter sentences when convicted, to be treated favorably in all kinds of social intercourse, and to enjoy physically attractive and cultivated life companions (Hamermesh, 2011, Mazzella and Feingold, 1994). Physical attractiveness may, however, also give rise to violent victimization (Savolainen et al., 2020). Technically speaking, those benefits often constitute economic rents; in everyday language they may well be put on a level with discrimination. Daniel Hamermesh, never at a loss for asking uncomfortable questions, contemplates, tongue in cheek, whether the ugly should not be helped by government-sponsored affirmative action programs.====We restrict ourselves to the political sphere and ask to what extent specific electoral rules alleviate the effect of the candidates’ physical attractiveness on election outcomes. If the “beauty premium” cannot be neutralized by institutional measures, two questions arise. First, do political parties strategically exploit this effect when they nominate candidates in general elections, and, second, do elected MPs take their beauty premium into account when deciding whether to dissent from their party line. We will address these issues as well.====General elections are an excellent field for investigating biases induced by physical attractiveness because we deal here with low-cost decisions in the sense of Kirchgässner (1992). In low cost environments biased individual behavior, even if it proves to be dysfunctional at the aggregate level, is not subject to strong self-correcting forces and can, therefore, persist for a long time. Individual vote decision in general elections are, of course, low cost because the vast majority of the electorate shows little interest in political affairs (Caplan, 2011) and, perhaps more importantly, because the individual voter’s influence on the outcome is virtually zero (Tullock, 1971). Both of these features induce many voters to remain “rationally ignorant” about the alternative candidates’ or parties’ agendas (Downs, 1957). Rationally ignorant voters, if they attempt to vote in line with their instrumental objectives at all, base their decision on whatever expedient information they bump into. They may consciously or unconsciously look out for cheap cues that indicate candidate competence. Empirical evidence indicates that attractive people are perceived to be more competent than less attractive people (Jackson et al., 1995). It is therefore reasonable to assume that many voters are beauty-biased even if they have instrumental intentions.====The low-cost nature of voting in general elections may, of course, also dispose voters to completely decouple their motives from the outcome of the election and to simply indulge in a quest for self-gratification through the act of voting expressively (Hillman, 2010; Hamlin and Jennings, 2011). Expressive voters derive utility from expressing support for specific candidates because this lets them demonstrate their affiliation with a group of kindred spirits they want to belong to, or at least be associated with. Whatever identity is supposed to be signaled, the demonstration effect works best if the target candidate radiates popularity, recognizability, likability, dynamism, assertiveness, self-confidence, leadership, intelligence, competence, trustworthiness, and a dashing will to affect a turnaround. All these traits people perceive to be associated with physical attractiveness (Langlois et al., 2010). Expressive voters can therefore also be expected to be beauty biased.====We use data from German general elections because the German mixed election system combines the two extreme and most widely used election rules, i.e. plurality elections and proportional representation, and does so in one round of voting by one and the same electorate. This feature helps to compare the two systems regarding how physical attractiveness of candidates translates into electoral success.==== The mixed system also allows us to explore whether political parties strategically exploit the beauty premium by conditioning the allocation of candidates to electoral districts and/or the party list on the candidates’ physical attractiveness.====Each federal state (Land) comprises, as of 2017, between 4 (Saarland) and 64 (North Rhine-Westphalia) single-member electoral districts. The candidates running in these districts for direct election are highly visible because they are used by their parties as crowd pullers. The direct candidates’ physical attractiveness is therefore expected to play a significant role for electoral success. The candidates running on the party lists issued in each state (Land) are much less visible. Their prospects of being elected depends on how high-up they are placed by their party on the party state-list, on the share of list votes obtained by their party in the respective state (Land), and on how many candidates of their party are elected directly. Advertising themselves as individual candidates thus does not help them in their bid for election. Apart from the top candidates who are well known anyway, voters hardly take in the appearance of list candidates into account. We thus conjecture that the beauty effect is much stronger in the direct election tier than in the proportional representation (party-list) tier where the effect might not be present at all.====The results are as follows. First, we find that physically attractive candidates, especially those nominated by the catch-all parties, the Christian-conservative CDU/CSU and the social democratic SPD, do better than less attractive candidates in direct elections. The physical attractiveness of the prominent list candidates, on the other hand, does not turn out to be related to the all-important second vote share that determines the proportional distribution of seats, and how much money the parties receive from the government. These results are based on regressions of our full sample and consider dummy variables of the candidates’ party affiliation. Second, we find that the MPs of catch-all parties who only ran for office in electoral districts, are on average physically more attractive than their peers who ran on the party list as well. This result is compatible with the presumption that the catch-all parties strategically exploit the beauty effect identified and summarized by our first result. We do, however, not find that the catch-all parties nominate physically attractive candidates in contested districts. On the contrary: it rather appears that physically attractive candidates have the political clout to run in safe electoral districts. German political parties thus do not tend to maximize electoral success by strategically allocating their beauty resources to specific districts in the same way as parties allocate their financial resources (Stromberg, 2008).====We also ask whether physical attractiveness relates to how politicians behave when they are elected to public office. In parliamentary democracies, this question is not easy to answer if one restricts one’s attention to the voting behavior of MPs because party discipline does not allow a great deal of variation in voting behavior across members of parliamentary fractions. Moreover, in the German Bundestag, individual voting behavior is only documented for roll-call votes. We therefore use the relatively few instances in which MPs dissent in roll-call votes from the party line and find that physically attractive MPs are indeed more likely to dissent than physically less attractive MPs. This result is driven by directly elected MPs; the physical attractiveness of list-MPs has no power in explaining dissension from the party line.","Election systems, the “beauty premium” in politics, and the beauty of dissent",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300483,16 May 2020,2020,Research Article,175.0

We show that the average support for ,"In recent years, globalization has got under strain: while the vote to leave the European Union will remove Britain from the world’s biggest common market, the Trump administration’s mantra to put “America first” has ignited a trade war between the US, Europe and China. These developments will almost certainly reduce the international exchange of goods, services and assets, and accelerate a development that has already started during the global financial crisis. However, while the great trade collapse of 2008/09 could be explained by a decline in investment activity as well as a breakdown of global financial markets (Baldwin, 2011; Chor and Manova, 2012; Bems et al., 2013, Haugh et al., 2016), the new protectionism is associated with the growing success of political parties and candidates who integrate the fight against globalization into their agendas. Put differently, the anti-globalist backlash does not happen ==== nations’ objectives, it seems to reflect the desire and the ambitions of large parts of countries’ constituencies. This, of course, spurs international conflict and makes it increasingly difficult to engage in any form of cooperation.====The goal of our paper is to explain these developments and to identify the forces that have affected (and possibly changed) attitudes towards international trade in different countries. Using data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) – a large international survey that elicits individuals’ view on international trade – we compare the responses given in the context of the 2003-wave to the responses of the 2013-wave. These two waves are separated by ten years, during which many countries underwent severe recessions, often associated with substantial drops in income, large increases in unemployment, and widening inequality.====Fig. 1 illustrates that, in fact, the average support for free international trade changed quite substantially in many countries. The size of the bars indicates the percentage of ISSP respondents who strongly disapproved or disapproved with the statement ““[My country] should limit the import of foreign products in order to protect its national economy” in 2003 and 2013, respectively. Apparently, the support for international trade has decreased in twelve out of 21 countries, while it has increased in the nine other countries. As we will show in the following section, the average support for international trade can be decomposed into three components: a component that reflects the “collective experience” of all respondents in a given country, a component that reflects the “====” of those respondents who share certain socio-economic characteristics – e.g. a given educational attainment or age –, and a “====”, which reflects changing relative shares of the different groups. With respect to the collective experience of different countries’ residents, we conjecture that the experience of the global financial crisis and of the European debt crisis illustrated the perils of international interdependence, and that the change of individuals’ attitudes is influenced by the severity of these crises in their respective country. Moreover, and following up on the recent discussion about the distributional consequences of globalization (see, e.g. Kanbur, 2015; Autor et al., 2016a, Pavcnik, 2017, Dorn et al., 2018, Lang and Mendes Tavares, 2018), we expect the group-specific component to reflect a widening difference in attitudes between the “winners” and “losers” from international trade.====Interestingly, this is not what we find. While our results document that country-specific changes in the average support for international trade are linked to the depth and length of the 2008/09 recession and to the evolution of income inequality, our findings contradict the standard narrative that the increasing sentiment against international trade predominantly reflects the anger of those groups whose wages and jobs were negatively affected by international competition. By contrast, it is rather the ==== than the ====, which contributed to the declining support for international trade: in 2013, youth, education and income were less likely to make individuals respond explicitly in favor of international trade than in 2003. Of course, a young individual with a university degree and a leading position in his or her company was still less opposed against international competition than an elderly person without a formal education. However, the difference has shrunk substantially between 2003 and 2013. While this declining discrepancy still allows for the possibility that the losers from globalization have become more positive about international trade, our results demonstrate that this is not the case: instead, those individuals who have benefitted most from the advance of globalization seem to have lost their enthusiasm for the very basis of their prosperity. We demonstrate that this effect is still discernible if we account for the fact that firms’ offshoring activities have made even high-skilled workers increasingly vulnerable to international competition: while offshoring – or the threat of it – clearly reduces individuals’ support for international trade, the “eroding enthusiasm of the elites” reflects a tendency that cannot be easily associated with distributional interests.====Our paper is related to a growing literature that uses survey and election data to understand how the distributional effects of globalization affect individual attitudes and political outcomes: Mayda and Rodrik (2005), Jäkel and Smolka (2017) as well as Egger and Fischer (2019) demonstrate that individuals’ replies to the question whether they appreciate or oppose international goods trade are very much in line with their distributional interests.==== In a similar spirit, Scheve and Slaughter (2004), Kaya and Walker (2012) as well as Harms and Schwab (2019) analyze the empirical determinants of people’s attitudes towards foreign direct investment and demonstrate that those individuals who are more likely to benefit from the presence of multinational enterprises are more likely to utter a positive attitude towards these companies. Finally, focusing on the role of international production, Owen and Johnston (2017) and Egger and Fischer (2019) show that the perceived risk that one’s job is offshored also influences attitudes towards international trade, independent of individuals’ skill level.====A closely related strand of literature relates voting and election outcomes at the regional level to the respective regions’ exposure to low-wage competition, especially from China (Dippel et al., 2015; Autor et al., 2016b, 2016c; Malgouyres, 2017; Colantone and Stanig, 2018a, 2018b). The general thread running through these studies is that an industrial structure that renders a region more vulnerable to the “China shock” increases the success of right-wing and populist parties at the polls. Moreover, while Becker et al. (2017) do not find an economically significant influence of globalization on regional Brexit outcomes, their more recent study (Alabrese et al., 2019) combines regional and individual-level data and confirms the notion that those individuals who were less likely to benefit from globalization were more likely to vote in favor of leaving the European Union.====While we follow the first strand of literature mentioned above in analyzing survey data that reveal individuals’ attitudes towards globalization, the innovative contribution of our paper is its dynamic perspective, i.e. our approach to determine how attitudes towards international trade have evolved over time, how they have been affected by countries’ economic performance in a crisis-ridden decade, and how the marginal effects of potential determinants have changed between 2003 and 2013.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we present a simple model that decomposes changes in the average support for international trade at the country level into different components. Section 3 describes our data set. In Section 4, we consider how much of the changing support for international trade between 2003 and 2013 was country-specific, and whether country-specific developments can be linked to the countries’ economic performance. In Section 5, we focus on the marginal effects of respondents’ socio-economic characteristics. After documenting a significant change in the marginal effects of various socio-economic characteristics between 2003 and 2013, we explore in Section 6 whether the declining enthusiasm of highly skilled individuals can be explained by these individuals’ increasing exposure to labor market competition through offshoring. Section 7 tests the robustness of our results with respect to various changes in sample and specification, while Section 8 summarizes our results and offers some conclusions.",Depression of the deprived or eroding enthusiasm of the elites: What has shifted the support for international trade?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300495,16 May 2020,2020,Research Article,176.0

Five of them were hit especially badly; four of them even had to be bailed out by the rest in one way or another. This paper asks if one could have foretold, based solely on information available prior to 1999, which of the countries then about to enter the Euro-zone would run into economic trouble once a serious economic crisis occurred. The focus is on the (post)predictive power of three kinds of leading indicators: economic indicators, political indicators (indicating quality of governance), and indicators derived from the theory of optimal currency areas (OCA). Since there are more indicators than cases, PLS-regression is used to gauge the (post)predictive strength of the indicators examined. The results show that political indicators have quite some (post)predictive power in this case, whereas indicators derived from OCA-theory do not do too well. Economic indicators perform better than indicators derived from OCA-theory, but generally less well than the political indicators. Thus, the experience from the latest economic crisis in the Euro-zone suggests that more emphasis should be placed on the quality of governance record of a country when deciding if it should be deemed fit to become a member.","According to the report “One market, one money” from 1990 - a sequel to the seminal Delors-report – two central aims of establishing a common currency area in the EU were to ensure macroeconomic stability as well as equality between the participating countries and regions (European Commission, 1990: 9). As the economic crisis from 2008-09 onwards has demonstrated, so far these ambitions have been met with limited success at best: All the “old” Euro-countries==== were hit economically. But not all were hit equally hard. Based on the development in their credit default swaps during the crisis, Noeth and Sengupta (2012) distinguish between “distressed” and “not distressed” Euro-countries. Among the not distressed countries they count Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and The Netherlands. Their group of distressed countries comprises Ireland, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Of the countries in the “distressed” group so far only one – Italy – has not had to rely on financial support from European financial institutions. Thus, ==== the distinction appears valid.====Naturally, the widely differing economic performance of different Euro-countries calls for an explanation. Why did the Euro-countries fare so differently under the impact of the crisis? The present study asks two related, but nevertheless somewhat different questions. The first question is if the economic performances of the Euro-countries during the economic crisis from 2008-09 onwards could have been foretold even before the Euro-zone was formally established in 1999 (2001). The second question is which indicators could possibly have served as early warning signs. More precisely the present study asks (1) if one can identify indicators leading the onset of the crisis by at least 10 years that can be related to differences in economic performance during the crisis, and (2) of which type these indicators are. More specifically question (2) concerns the predictive power of (a) economic indicators, (b) political indicators, and (c) indicators derived from the theory of Optimal Currency Areas (OCA).====Thus, the present study is about (post)-==== economic crisis performance rather than about ==== it. The difference may appear subtle, but it is nevertheless real. First, (post)-predicting is (just) about identifying suitably strong correlations between leading indicators and economic performance. In order to properly explain economic performance, on the other hand, one needs ==== strong correlations between indicators and performance ==== a (correct) understanding of the mechanisms relating indicators to performance.==== Second, an attempt at explaining differences in economic crisis performance could not possibly focus exclusively on indicators that lead crisis onset by 10 or more years; in the context of this study doing so is perfectly legitimate.====Despite the difference in focus, results from the present study may still inform the search for explanations to the observed differences in economic crisis performance among the Euro-countries. If it is possible to identify indicators leading economic crisis performance by 10 or more years, then it certainly appears worth the while to trace the developments in such indicators up to the onset of the economic crisis to see if the relationship persists.====Besides its potential theoretical contribution, results from the present study could (should?) also be used to gauge and discuss the adequacy of the Maastricht-criteria as core criteria for admitting new members into the Euro-zone.",I (Could Have) Told You!

Reelection considerations shorten political time horizons and give rise to political myopia that exacerbates debt accumulation. That laxer institutional reelection restrictions (e.g., no term limits) mitigate this effect due to electoral accountability is well known. Incorporating growth, we find that this mitigation can be reversed because less myopic, and more accountable, incumbents put more emphasis on smoothing the effects of growth across generations. We test these predictions using an annual-based panel of U.S. states over the period 1963–2010. Our identification strategy rests on constitutionally-entrenched differences in gubernatorial term limits that provide plausibly exogenous variation in reelection prospects, and aggregate national TFP shocks that are exogenous to individual states. Our estimates indicate that when reelection is possible a one ==== positive income shock induces, within the same year, a relative increase of approximately $40 in real per capita public debt.","The feedback effects between economic growth and public debt have been of perennial interest to economists and policymakers.==== In this work we offer a new channel via which growth affects debt, namely the extent of reelection prospects. Reelection considerations shorten political time horizons that give rise to political myopia (Buchanan and Wagner, 1977), with various adverse effects, including swelling public debt.==== Previous studies have shown that laxer institutional reelection restrictions (e.g., no term limits) may mitigate this tendency by increasing the extent of electoral accountability.==== We show, theoretically and empirically, that this mitigation effect can be reversed when interacted with growth. In particular, we illustrate, via the case of the U.S. gubernatorial system, that growth tends to boost the deficit bias when interacted with laxer institutional reelection restrictions, in a robust and economically meaningful magnitude.==== The analysis, thus, offers new insights regarding the role of political institutions in manifesting the effects of economic growth.====We develop a model based on politicians-voters interaction in which reelection prospects shorten the time horizon of reelection-seeking incumbents, inducing political myopia. This political myopia is shown to be represented by the political hazard associated with the probability of losing election. The political hazard is endogenous, as it depends on fiscal policy and the ensuing debt, and has a dual effect on deficit spending. First, by increasing political myopia it aggravates deficit spending. Second, consistent with recent debates on the non-linear effects of debt (Blanchard, 2019; Yared, 2019) and the fiscally disciplining effect of elections (Brender and Drazen, 2008), its policy dependence may restrain or enhance deficit spending, depending on the level of debt. We refer to the former as ==== effect and to the latter as ==== effect. The balance between these two, potentially conflicting, effects determines the overall effect of reelection on deficit spending and debt. We examine how (exogenous) economic growth interacts with these effects and how this interaction varies across (exogenous) levels of institutional reelection restrictions.====Growth makes future generations wealthier, hence aversion to intergenerational inequality induces redistribution to the present, i.e., borrowing, which operates to increase debt.==== Interacting this effect with reelection prospects, we find that laxer reelection restrictions induce lower debt, due to the decreased myopia, but at the same time increase the sensitivity of debt to growth. This, somewhat counterintuitive, result occurs because laxer reelection restrictions amplify the impact of intertemporal ==== smoothing.==== The intuition is simple. Laxer reelection restrictions extend the expected political tenure, and hence induce less myopia; in turn, less myopic incumbents put greater weight on smoothing the effects of growth across generations. The model, thus, illustrates that growth may increase debt when reelection restrictions are laxer.====The model's main predictions are corroborated by the empirical analysis, which estimates the effect of growth on debt using a panel of U.S. states. The advantage of an intra-U.S. perspective is that it provides a relatively homogenous environment with constitutionally-entrenched differences in political institutions related to the gubernatorial election system. Gubernatorial term lengths are largely the same across states; however, gubernatorial term limits differ considerably, across states and time. Some states limit the number that governors can stay in office, with limits that vary across states, while others place no limit. This, in turn, provides institutionally-driven, plausibly exogenous variation in reelection prospects that map to the framework considered in the model. Based on the latter, we expect that growth would induce a positive (weak) impact on the public debt of states with laxer (stricter) reelection restrictions, as they provide more (less) reelection possibilities.====We assembled an annual-based panel of U.S. states over the period 1963–2010. As an initial step we construct a ==== that captures the differences in gubernatorial term limits.==== This index assigns a value between 1 and 4, depending on the extent of gubernatorial term limits, where a higher value denotes laxer reelection restrictions. Our main measure of reelection prospects is then an indicator that exploits the full extent of variation related to differences in gubernatorial term limits by capturing the cases in which reelection is an option (i.e., incumbents are not in their last term (lame ducks)), reminiscent of the measure adopted by Besley and Case (1995). To avoid potential endogeneity bias in estimating the effect of growth we use aggregate (national) cumulative TFP shocks to predict state-specific real per capita income (measured via the Gross State Product (GSP)). As each individual state is too small to affect aggregate technological shocks, the resulting growth proxy, namely the national-technology-driven state-specific income shocks, are considered as plausibly exogenous in the panel estimations. We find that income shocks affect public debt when reelection restrictions are laxer, and are only weakly associated with it when such limits are stricter. In particular, our estimates indicate that when reelection is possible a one standard deviation positive income shock induces, within the same year, a relative increase of approximately $40 in real per capita public debt.====Nonetheless, the reelection prospects measure is potentially susceptible to endogeneity. Specifically, the analytical framework suggests that the level of debt may affect the probability of reelection, thus potentially inducing a downward bias in the baseline estimate. To address that, we follow an instrumental variable (IV) approach and instrument this measure using the ====. We follow this route based on three conjectures. First, changes in state debt are not expected to alter constitutionally-entrenched political institutions. Second, variation in the extent of reelection options is primarily based on the underlying political institutions. Third, the gubernatorial term limit regime affects debt only via the extent to which incumbents can be reelected. We further motivate these points in the empirical part. Importantly, they suggest that the proposed instrument is expected to yield a viable first stage, and that it follows the exclusion restriction. The results indeed point at a strong first stage; in addition, they reaffirm the main outcome via the second stage results, and point at an under-estimation of the baseline estimate.====We show that the main result is apparent under a wide array of tests. First, it is robust to a myriad of potential political channels that range from the relative bargaining power of the legislature to the budgeting experience of the governor, including a range of additional fiscal-affecting cross-state institutional differences (discussed in more detail in the next section, as well as in the empirical part), together with their interaction with the income shocks. Second, it is observed using different measures of reelection prospects and aggregate shocks. Last, it is robust to considering different sample restrictions, specifications, time periods, and controls.====The next section discusses related literature and highlights the present contributions. Section 3 presents the model that explains how reelection prospects affect the growth-debt nexus. The data and empirical findings are presented in Section 4.

Does this matter for policy outcomes? This is the first paper to provide a literature review on the substantive effects of female representation on policies. In developing countries, the increase in female political representation has caused a better provision of public goods, especially with regard to education and health. In developed countries, higher female representation has not affected public policies as measured by spending patterns. However, more recent evidence shows that female representation has induced changes in parliamentary deliberations and specific policy choices (e.g. more public child care) that may not be reflected in the observable composition of public spending. Finally, higher female representation has improved institutional quality by reducing ==== and rent-extraction by those in power.","The powerful forces of globalization have given rise to an unprecedented interconnectedness of countries through trade, communication and travel. However, this rise in international cooperation has not only been important from an economic perspective. Globalization has also induced a convergence in the political and social domain. Potrafke and Ursprung (2012) show, for instance, how globalization has given rise to various institutional changes towards gender equality in developing countries. These have in turn led to remarkable increases in female political participation in these countries, paralleling similar trends that have already been taking place in developed countries.====Women's political representation has indeed come a long way since the turn of the century. As of January 2019, women hold 24.3% of parliamentary seats worldwide against 13.4% in 2000. The Nordic countries continue in the lead with a share of 42.8% in 2019 (up from 38.8% in 2000), while 27 states still have a share below 10% (including three parliaments with no women at all). In the meantime, the percentage of female heads of government has increased slightly from 4.7% to 5.2% over the past nineteen years.==== Has this increase of women in politics affected policy choices? Is this the case only for specific policy areas? Does a larger share of women in political offices affect the quality of institutions? Can an increase of women in politics have broader effects on women's empowerment? Our paper addresses these questions and is the first to provide an extensive literature review on the substantive effects of female political representation on public policy.====One of the most prominent theoretical contributions in the political economy literature suggests that personal characteristics of officeholders do not matter for policy choices: Downs' (1957) median voter theory predicts that politicians converge on policy to cater to the median voter in order to secure re-election. Left- and right-leaning, black and white, female and male politicians, all converge to a unique policy platform independent of personal characteristics. In a world in which this theory holds, gender is irrelevant for policy.====Empirically, however, we do not observe policy convergence as suggested by the median-voter model. It turns out that politicians care not only about winning elections but also about policies. This is demonstrated, for instance, by significant policy divergences along partisan lines (Lee et al., 2004). Contributions by Osborne and Slivinski (1996) and Besley and Coate (1997) gave rise to an alternative view of the political process that yields predictions in line with such empirical observations and contradicting the median voter theory. This alterative view, known as the citizen-candidate model, conjugates politicians' preferences for different outcomes and their inability to commit to moderate policies. According to this model, policy diverges depending on who wins the election. In the US, for instance, policies indeed differ depending on whether Republicans or Democrats win the election (Besley and Case, 1995, 2003).====Such policy divergence is not exclusively ideological: the citizen-candidate model extends beyond partisanship into the realm of identity politics and points to the relevance of gender for policymaking (Besley, 2005). As long as differences in policy preferences exist between men and women, gender likely affects policy. Just as mandated representatives from scheduled castes and tribes in India support policies targeted towards their own group (Pande, 2003), female representatives may address specific issues that by nature or due to traditional gender roles mainly affect women (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004). If having more women in political offices enables a better representation of the overall societal preferences, it is imperative to address gender imbalances in political representation.====Yet, rising female representation is likely to have long-run effects that go beyond immediate symbolic effects of representation or substantive effects on policies in the short run. By assuming legislative and executive positions all over the world, women have the opportunity to demonstrate their competence and political expertise. Female politicians may demystify gender biases, promote policies that ease formal and informal barriers to further female engagement and provide a role model for current and future generations of women.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 analyzes the reasons behind the underrepresentation of women in politics (the competitive nature of elections, details of electoral institutions, and voters' and party leaders' biases against female candidates). Section 3 surveys the literature on how the rising share of female representation in different countries and at different levels of government has influenced policy outcomes. We distinguish between observational evidence, quasi-experimental evidence, and evidence on effects regarding institutional quality. Section 4 examines the literature on the impact of today's female political representation on women's future role in politics.

Depending on the level of government and the type of policy, such heterogeneity may lead to lower public spending and redistribution. We assess this issue empirically by analyzing the relationship between the distribution of preferences for redistribution and the amount of public expenditure at different levels of government and for several types of spending in 23 European countries. Our results suggest a negative and significant correlation between heterogeneity of preferences for redistribution and public spending that is stronger at the local level and for redistributive functions, independent of the median individual's preferences.","Government public spending depends on individuals' propensity for income and wealth redistribution through the democratic process. In turn, the propensity for redistribution depends on the level of income and wealth inequality. This simple relation dates back to Meltzer and Richard (1981), and an impressive number of political economics studies have focused on trying to empirically test its validity and investigate in greater depth whether and how other factors may affect this apparently straightforward theoretical prediction. Among others, Bellani and Ursprung (2019) provide a recent survey on the link between inequality and support for redistributive public policies, while Alesina and Giuliano (2010) review the reasons besides economic inequality that may influence the propensity for redistribution.====A society in which all individuals have the same propensity for redistribution and a society in which only slightly more than half of the population share the same propensity may have different outcomes in terms of actual redistribution. Additionally, a third society in which only the mean (or the median) individual has this propensity for redistribution may have another different outcome, even if the preferences of the individual in question are the same in each of the three societies. Therefore, it is not only the average level but also the ==== of those preferences that is likely to have an impact on actual redistribution in the society. In this paper, we focus particularly on the relationship between the ==== of preferences for redistribution across individuals and both the level of general public spending and its allocation between different types of expenditures at different levels of government.====There are two main innovations of this study with respect to the existing literature: first, we are able to look directly at individual attitudes instead of proxying them with socio-economic variables; second, we can analyze different potential effects on general public spending at different levels of government and on specific spending functions.==== Both improvements are made possible by using survey data from the European Social Survey, which include specific questions on several aspects of social trust, politics, and welfare attitudes, in addition to expenditure data from Eurostat, which is also newly available at the central and local levels. Our findings confirm the role played by the heterogeneity of preferences in shaping the features of public expenditure and the public sector, even if we are not able to disentangle the potential channels described in the following sections. Indeed, diverse preferences affect not only the amount of public spending but also its composition, with some kinds of public spending (namely, those more related to cash redistribution) being mostly influenced by diversity in these preferences.====In the following subsections, we briefly review the most relevant literature and outline our conceptual framework.

The excessive entry prediction has been derived primarily for closed economies and using a welfarist benchmark. We extend this framework and allow for (1) horizontal FDI in a multi-period setting and (2) interest group-based government behaviour. Opening the market to greenfield investments from abroad tends to aggravate the entry distortion. Moreover, market opening may reduce welfare if a more pronounced entry distortion dominates the gain in ====. Finally, a government, which places sufficiently little weight on the interests of consumers, will object to market opening, even if welfare rises.","Between 2002 and 2016, the stock of world-wide Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) as a share of GDP has risen by about 60% (====). While this development has not been reflected in according variations in flows, greenfield investments have picked up again in 2018 (====). Moreover, many (consumer) goods have become more homogeneous, in that increasingly similar items are produced and sold in different countries. This implies that knowledge about production techniques or distribution networks gained in one country can be utilised in another location as well. In consequence, the fixed costs of setting up a further production site abroad are likely to be lower than the costs of entering the first, domestic market. Hence, the incentives to undertake horizontal FDI have increased. Whether this development will continue after the coronavirus pandemic has subsided is hard to predict at the moment.====The increased relevance of FDI occurred at the same time at which goods markets have become less competitive and more oligopolistic. ====; ====), and hardly declined in European Union (====). Accordingly, markets are far from being competitive and many industries feature oligopolistic characteristics. If big firms can cope with the consequences of the crisis commencing in 2020 more successfully than smaller firms, which may also receive less government aid, oligopolistic markets will become even more prevalent within the next years.====In our subsequent analysis we combine these aspects and enquire how horizontal FDI affects outcomes in oligopoly. We focus on a long-run, free entry setting which allows for adjustments also at the extensive margin to accommodate the fact that oligopolistic markets are not static but change their composition. In order to ease comparability with earlier investigations, we assume a homogeneous Cournot-oligopoly with identical firms, linear demand and cost schedules, and fixed costs of market entry. In such a setting, the number of entrants will be excessive in a closed economy if entry reduces output per firm, that is, if there is business-stealing (====, ====; ====; ====). We extend the analysis to a multi-country, two-period framework. In period one, there are only domestic competitors. At the beginning of period two, the market may be opened up to horizontal FDI. Entry costs arise in each period, whereas additional set-up costs only occur in the first period of activity and for one market. Therefore, incumbents that undertake FDI do not have to incur set-up costs again. This captures the idea that horizontal (greenfield) FDI activities can utilise knowledge gained in earlier domestic production, such that firms spread fixed costs over more markets and, thereby, greater quantities.====In order to focus on the effects of FDI, we consider two settings: In the first, entry is not regulated. Firms take up production, as long it is profitable. As FDI affects contemporaneous payoffs, market opening alters entry choices in the second period and, if anticipated, also first period decisions. In the second setting, the government regulates entry, for example, by granting costless entry licences. Because such regulation is no longer effective if market opening occurs in period two, it also changes the government’s first period choice. In contrast to earlier analyses, we assume that the government maximises a political support function, and not necessarily welfare. This modification enables us to investigate how the nature of the government’s objective affects choices. For both settings, the unregulated market equilibrium and the one in which entry is restricted, we initially consider a closed economy. This provides a benchmark, to which we compare outcomes, which will result if there is horizontal FDI.====Our analysis shows that the number of firms in a closed economy will be constant over time, though profits vary. This is true in market equilibrium and likewise if the government determines the maximum number of entrants. In this way, unit production costs are minimised. Moreover, and irrespective of the government’s objective, entry usually is excessive, not only in the closed economy, but also if horizontal FDI takes place. The intuition is as follows: Opening the market in period two raises the number of firms in market equilibrium in that period and reduces it in period one. These adjustments result in an increase in total output and, hence, welfare. The expansion comes about because production costs per firm decline and the cost effect of the drop in the number of firms in period one dominates the impact of additional entry in period two. If the government regulates entry, the change in the number of firms will exhibit qualitatively the same features as in market equilibrium. Therefore, entry tends to be excessive also in the presence of FDI. We further show that market opening may actually decrease welfare if entry is regulated. Such outcome can occur if the number of firms is relatively high prior to market opening. Therefore, the increase in output and ==== due to market opening is limited and does not compensate the reduction in profits. Finally, we demonstrate that even if market opening raises welfare, the government’s payoff may decline. This can be the case if the fall in profits because of intensified competition is substantial, while the rise in consumer surplus is not valued sufficiently by the government.====This survey of results indicates that we can add to the literature in four ways: First, we clarify that the excessive entry prediction, derived almost exclusively for closed-economy settings, can also result if there is FDI. Second, we demonstrate how an intertemporal optimisation process of firms can affect outcomes. Third, we illustrate new channels by which international integration can alter welfare. Fourth, we evaluate in how far the government’s incentives to regulate entry depend on whose interests it pursues.====, ====, ====, ====, and ====. ==== generalise assumptions and show that “free entry leads to an excessive (resp., insufficient) number of firms relative to second-best planning if and only if a “business stealing” (resp., “business enhancing”) effect is present …."" (p. 113) The robustness of the excessive entry prediction has been investigated for various extensions, such as imperfectly competitive input markets (====, ====,====, ====, ====, ====), R&D investments (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), asymmetric costs (====; ====), and alternative firm objectives (====; ====, chap. 8, ====).====Analyses of the excess entry result have occasionally been expanded to open economy settings. ====, ==== and ==== assume that there is one foreign firm which enters the domestic oligopoly. They show that if trade costs decline, so do the foreign firm’s costs, such that it produces a greater amount. This, in turn, reduces profits of domestic firms and deters their entry. Moreover, the number of firms in market equilibrium may be insufficient. The rationale for this outcome is that a government, which maximises domestic welfare, takes into account that additional entry raises domestic consumer surplus at the expense of foreign profits. However, this cross-country effect plays no role for the firms’ entry decision in market equilibrium.==== If input prices are given by wages determined by a trade union, lower transport cost may reduce welfare and entry is once again insufficient (====, ====). The latter effect arises because wages deter entry, but do not have a direct welfare effect (see ==== for a similar approach).==== consider a two-country setting in which firms produce locally and can also export, facing linear trade costs. Domestic and foreign governments regulate entry by taxing operating profits of local firms. ==== show that entry is excessive, since domestic taxation fosters entry abroad. Moreover, if entry costs are high, there are few competitors. Allowing for trade intensifies competition substantially. This trade effect exceeds the negative consequences of excessive entry. Hence, trade raises welfare. If market entry costs are low, the gains from trade are also relatively moderate, such that the excessive entry distortion dominates and welfare declines.====; ====). Under additional conditions, which hold for a linear demand schedule, the total number of suppliers rises, but not necessarily of domestic firms (====; see also ====). ==== considers a two-country free-trade setting. The introduction of a tariff raises welfare if demand is strictly concave. This effect occurs because the number of firms decreases, as ==== clarifies. In partial contrast, ==== assumes a two-period setting in which domestic and foreign firms can enter their home market in period one and export part of their production. In period two, only incumbents can undertake horizontal FDI. He shows that exports and FDI may co-exist. In this case, the number of firms shrinks with FDI, while welfare rises, for example, if demand is linear.====In sum, the studies on excessive entry outcomes in Cournot-oligopolies have ignored foreign competition via greenfield FDI, in particular, if the government does not maximise welfare. In order to analyse this issue, the further paper proceeds as follows: In Section ====, we develop the model and describe output decisions and entry choices. Section ==== delineates the market equilibrium and the government’s preferred outcome in an isolated, i.e., closed economy. Section ==== considers market opening, both for the market equilibrium and if the government determines maximum entry. Section ==== concludes.

This decision left Spain and Italy without a bilateral trade treaty for an entire decade. In the literature, broader political issues and local interests are alternatively indicated as the main drivers of the rejection. Based on a new database which collects economic and political variables (including MPs personal features) and using a ====, this paper provides a quantitative analysis of the vote. Results show that constituency interests had a role in determining the result of the vote on the trade treaty. Moreover, constituency interests were also important for the “vote switchers”, i.e. those MPs that supported the overall government policy stance in the first round, but opposed the Spanish-Italian trade agreement in the second.","Did constituency interests matter for the rejection of the 1905 trade agreement between Spain and Italy?====International trade is embedded in a dense network of multilateral and bilateral agreements whose aim is to promote economic integration beyond national borders. However, this phenomenon is related to a specific historical process and the development of a precise institutional context, which repeatedly overcame very diverse resistances, but it is not immutable (Newman et al., 2006). For example, during the first globalization – an episode of increasing economic integration during the 19th century, closely related to an extraordinary fall in trade costs (Jacks et al., 2010) – resistances did not take long to emerge. Relevant examples are the increases in tariffs for both agricultural and industrial goods in Germany (1879, the so-called “iron and rye” tariff) and Sweden (1888) (Simmons, 2006). In the first case, floating voters from the agricultural sector changed the balance in favour of protectionism (Lehmann, 2010). In the second, the largest farmers – later joined by smallholders and middling farmers – were the main supporters of tariff increases (Lehmann and Volckart, 2011).====In the case of Italy, Federico and Vasta (2015) suggest that the country was, generally speaking, quite open.==== However, they also acknowledge the existence of some episodes where Italian policy makers were not acting following a “liberal spirit”. The 1905 rejection of the Spanish-Italian trade agreement by the Italian Parliament can be one of them. The Italian authorities called for amending the 1892 ==== with Spain in a context of a rapidly increasing bilateral trade deficit and a parallel wave of trade policy “modernization” (Italy had to face agricultural protectionism abroad). Following the rules agreed in the 1892 treaty, Italy announced its willingness to end the bilateral agreement, opening a six-month window for negotiations. Discussions between the two delegations were long. The major difference included in the final agreement, signed by the Italian government on 8 November 1905, was a drastic cut on tariffs for wine imports in Italy. The Italian Parliament had to vote on the agreement in a heated political and social climate. A double roll call vote on the general Government performance and on the trade treaty was held on 17 December 1905. While the Government won the former, it lost the latter. The trade treaty was rejected by the Italian Parliament.====The roll call nature of the votes is reflected in the minutes of the Parliament, where every MP’s vote is recorded (differently from the usual sum of “in favour”, “against”, and “abstentions”). The double roll call vote allows both to empirically separate government support from the trade agreement support and to fully exploit the variation between the two votes.====The “Italian case” is important for several reason. First, it provides the first quantitative analysis ever on a roll-call vote in Italy during the first globalization, where detailed qualitative analysis is also limited: only Garcia Sanz (1994) reconstructed the Parliamentary debate within the wider perspective of the Spanish-Italian diplomatic relations. Other studies touch upon the issue: Lupo (1998) describes the event as the result of successful lobbying of constituency interests, namely those stakeholders associated with wine production. Orsina (2002) and Tomasoni (2011) highlight the importance of the wider political framework, such as the MPs interests in tumbling the Fortis’ government.==== Second, it helps to understand the drivers of an important public policy decision, leaving Spain and Italy without a trade agreement for almost a decade (until 1914). Third, it does so in a period (the beginning of 20th century) where organized interests, such as trade, business and industry associations, started to actively participate in the policy-making process. Finally, the “Italian case” has been studied from different perspective, therefore this study adds to the vast literature analysing the course of Italian tariffs (e.g. Coppa, 1970; Federico and Vasta, 2015; Tena-Junguito, 2010a; Tena-Junguito, 2010b; James and O’ Rourke, 2011; Federico and Tena, 1998; Federico and Tena, 1999) providing an in-depth case study.====To summarize, in this paper I aim to empirically estimate whether constituency interests played a role in determining the result of a double roll call vote on the (failed) ratification of an international trade treaty lowering tariffs, and in particular tariffs on wine. If this is not the case, constituency interests should be orthogonal to the voting patterns. In doing so, I exploit a new database, assembled from a variety of primary and secondary sources.====Results show that constituency interests had a role in determining the result of the vote on the trade treaty. Moreover, constituency interests were also important for the “vote switchers”, i.e. those MPs that supported the overall government policy stance in the first round, but opposed the Spanish-Italian trade agreement in the second.====The rest of the paper is organised as follow: Section 2 revises the literature on political economy and the determinants of (MPs) voting behaviours; Section 3 describes the historical context in which the rejection of the treaty matured; Section 4 details the data sources and the methodology used; Section 5 illustrates and interprets the results and provides a battery of robustness tests and extensions; and Section 6 concludes.",Staying dry on Spanish wine: The rejection of the 1905 Spanish-Italian trade agreement,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300409,25 April 2020,2020,Research Article,183.0

We find that, in both cases, the higher the number of firms, the higher the incentive to abate. However, while in the first case, either both types of firms coexist or all firms switch to be green, in the other case, there exists a minimum the number of firms below which all firms remain polluting.","Environmental protection is arguably one of the most debated political issues of our times. Over the last decades, the increasing number of scientific studies assessing the gravity of the situation of our planet and the growing awareness about the environmental damages caused by pollution raised large political support for a more environmentally friendly economy and strict environmental regulations. Nevertheless, despite the commitments of many governments and the signature of several international agreements, progress on environmental regulation has fallen far short of expectations, and instead, in many areas, the trend seems to be for regulation to be relaxed rather than restricted.====There are several reasons why it is difficult to persuade politicians to approve environmental regulations. The first one is their alleged negative effect on the competitiveness of firms. Indeed, despite the lack of any compelling supporting evidence (Jaffe et al., 1995; Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017), it is conventional wisdom among many politicians that higher regulations reduce the competitiveness of firms, leading to offshoring and job losses. A second reason is the increasing political polarisation of the debate about environmental protection in almost every developed country (Dunlap et al., 2016; McCright et al., 2016). This left-right division has resulted in a progressive shift of the respective political platforms, with the consequence of diminishing the possibility of approval of new regulatory policies.====This paper investigates this issue from a different perspective. In fact, we focus on the effects of lobbying carried out by the industries that would be affected by stricter regulations, given that such activity has significantly intensified over the past 20 years. Consider for example the expenditure in lobbying made in the U.S. by firms belonging to the Oil&Gas and Transport sectors, two of the industries most affected by environmental regulations.==== Fig. 1 reports the total amount of money spent in lobbying by these two interest groups in the period 1998–2018.====It is clear from the figure that the expenditure in lobbying of both industrial groups is significantly higher in the second decade than in the first one. It is worth to notice that the major event that occurred between these two decades was the election of President Obama whose political program included vigorous measures to fight climate change. In particular, the transport sector spent more than $240 million annually during President Obama's first term of office, while from 2007 to 2009, the Oil&Gas sector doubled its spending. Nevertheless, aggregate expenditure, however impressive it may be, does not make it possible to isolate the political preference of these groups. Therefore, Fig. 2 shows the electoral contributions made by these two groups to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party for each election year in the period 1990–2018.====The situation emerging from the figures shows how these two industrial sectors have greatly increased their spending in financing electoral campaigns over time, and in both cases with a clear preference for the Republican party, traditionally opposed to environmental regulation. The phenomenon is particularly evident in the years of presidential election, 2012 and 2016, and the midterm election of 2014 in which the GOP regained the control of the House of Representatives and obtained the majority of the Senate. Brulle (2018) investigates the amount of lobbying spending in influencing climate legislation and provides further evidence that the vast majority of climate lobbying expenditure comes from the sectors majorly affected by regulation (transportation, utility and fossil fuels sectors). In addition, he also finds that the expenditure of the renewable energy sector and environmental organisations is about one tenth of the contribution by fossil fuel actors.====The first aim of this paper is to study how much the possibility for polluting firms to rely on lobbying is effective in preventing the implementation of environmental regulation by the government. Moreover, since the effectiveness of lobbying can be influenced by the degree of market competition (Hillman et al., 2001; Bombardini and Trebbi, 2012), a second objective is to analyse how the incentive for a single company to participate in the lobby varies according to the number of firms active in the market.====To answer these questions, we develop an oligopoly model where the government can impose a tax to induce firms to internalise environmental damage caused by their production process, and firms can fight this policy through lobbying. The main novelty of our contribution is to explicitly take into account the individual choice of each company between internalisation of externality and the participation to the lobbying against taxation. In particular, we consider a four-stage game. In the first stage, each firm chooses whether to internalise the environmental damage or to join a polluting lobby. In the second stage, the polluting lobby pays the political contribution while in the third stage the government, given its policy objective and the contribution, decides the tax level. Finally, in the last stage of the game firms compete in a Cournot oligopoly.====We analyse two policy objectives. In the first case, which we refer to as the Pigouvian motive, the government wants to minimise the environmental externality. This case provides the strongest case in favour of environmental regulation in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement. In the second case, the government takes also into consideration the consumers' surplus. It could be observed that this government's behaviour is misbehaved since it does not aim to fully internalise the externality. However, this political objective can also be considered as a common goal sought by real regulators. We show that with this consumers' standard motive, the government is more vulnerable to lobby activities since the cost advantage of polluting firms results in higher equilibrium quantities and higher consumers' surplus.====For each case, we firstly define a benchmark tax rate, as the one set up by the government when lobbying is absent. Then, comparing with the benchmark, we study the tax rate as obtained in the lobbying game. Finally, we provide a characterisation of the equilibrium share of firms that decide to switch to be green, depending on the number of firms.====The main result of the paper is that, regardless of the policy objective, a positive share of polluting firms is always present in the market, as long as the number of firms is not too large. Yet, Pigouvian and consumers’ standard motives differ significantly in terms of possible equilibria. Indeed, in the first case, a share of green firms is always active regardless of the number of firms. In the second one, if competition is too weak, the outcome is a situation where no firms switches to green. Thus, our results suggest that concentrated oligopolies could be a significant barrier to the implementation of effective environmental policies.====The paper is organised as follows: after the survey of the related literature in section 2, section 3 presents the model in its general setup. Section 4 analyses the common, final stage of the game, while sections 5 Pigouvian motive, 6 Consumer standard motive solve the game in two different specifications. Finally section 7 concludes the paper.","Market competition, lobbying influence and environmental externalities",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300343,24 April 2020,2020,Research Article,184.0

Our hypothesis is that media contribute to shaping the value system of a person, which affects support for redistribution. A theoretical model is proposed which combines demand- and supply-driven media bias. On the demand side, the model considers two types of individuals: non-partisan, whose values are influenced by the media, and partisan, who have strong opinions not affected by the media. We assume that although partisan individuals prefer unbiased information, they hold beliefs that they like to be confirmed; therefore, they tend to consume media with an ideological position similar to theirs. On the supply side, we focus on interest groups’ pressure on media coverage. Our results suggest that the anti-equality lobby is willing to pay more than the competing lobby. Moreover, we show that media bias is a decreasing function of the advertising revenues and an increasing function of the relative weight of ideology ==== pluralism in individuals’ demand for media. Adding a second media outlet reduces the likelihood of media bias but not its extent. Finally, if both lobbies are active, the two outlets’ ideological positions are polarised.","This paper seeks to identify the role of mass media in shaping preferences for redistribution. The political economy literature, originated from the seminal paper by Meltzer and Richard (1981), has emphasised the self-interest motive, whereby preferences for redistribution depend on income. Individuals with income below the mean favour redistribution policies, and individuals with income above the mean oppose them. Majority voting, in turn, would entail that higher income inequality translates into more redistribution. However, empirical evidence suggests that there is much less redistribution than what Meltzer and Richard’s results would imply. Several explanations have been proposed to explain the so-called ‘limited redistribution puzzle’ (see discussion of the related literature in the next section). Among non-economic variables, the literature has demonstrated the important role played by culture and values as determinants of preferences for redistribution (Tabellini, 2007; Bénabou and Tirole, 2006).====In this paper, we focus on the influence of individuals’ values on preference formation and particularly on preferences for redistribution. Our hypothesis is that individuals who think that ‘everybody should have equal opportunities in life’ are more favourable to redistribution than individuals in the same socio-economic situation but with different beliefs about fairness. Thus, we interpret an individual’s attitudes towards equality of opportunity==== as an indicator of his/her value system.====If values do influence preferences for redistribution, the question of what determines individuals’ values becomes important. Values are partly exogenous (i.e. depend on individual characteristics) but are also influenced by media (Besley, 2008). The question of media bias thus gains importance for understanding the side effects of media exposure. Characteristics of the media market, such as concentration, ownership, and pluralism, contribute to the possibility of information manipulation by interested parties.====We propose a theoretical model to formalise our vision of how preferences towards redistribution are formed. Our hypothesis is that mass media affect the value individuals attach to equality, and in particular equality of opportunity, which translates in their preferences for redistribution. In greater detail, we assume that values depend on an individual’s characteristics and media influence. We consider two types of individuals: non-partisan, whose values are influenced by the media, and partisan, who have strong opinions and are not affected by media consumption. Non-partisan individuals consume media regardless of their ideological position. By contrast, for partisan individuals, media demand depends on ideology and media bias. ==== they prefer unbiased media; however, they hold beliefs that they like to be confirmed; therefore, they tend to consume media with ideological positions similar to their own, which reinforces their ex ante opinions.====If media affect values and preferences for redistribution, then politicians, companies, and interest groups have an incentive to manipulate media to influence preferences over redistribution policies. We model media bias as the outcome of a lobbying game, along the lines of Bernheim and Whinston (1986) and as already applied in a similar context by Petrova (2008, 2012). In our framework, partisan individuals have an interest in attempting to influence non-partisan individuals’ values and political preferences through the media.====In the case of a single outlet, we show that the anti-equality lobby is willing to pay more than the competing lobby and that the contributions offered compensate the media outlet for the audience loss. Moreover, we show that media bias is a decreasing function of the advertising revenues and an increasing function of the relative weight of ideology ==== pluralism in individuals’ demand for media. Adding a second media outlet reduces the likelihood of media bias but not the extent of media bias. Finally, if both lobbies are active, the two outlets’ ideological positions are polarised.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we relate our contribution to the literature that has addressed such topics as preferences for redistribution and media influence on political preferences; in section 3, some stylised facts, derived from the European Social Survey, are offered as motivating evidence for the theoretical model, which is presented is section 4; concluding remarks follow in section 5.",Mass media and preferences for redistribution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300355,23 April 2020,2020,Research Article,185.0

Among the different transfer schemes, fiscal transfers (to subnational governments) yield the highest levels of consumption, but direct transfers (to people) are the most effective in preventing conflict. By averting conflict, transfers can improve ex ante welfare; however, only a subset of the ex ante welfare optimal transfers is optimal ex post and thus self-enforcing. Among them, those that avert conflict by reinforcing repressive regimes are of particular policy interest.","The jury is still out on whether oil is a gift from god or the devil's excrement.==== There are instances where it has supported a well-functioning welfare state; but, in many other cases, oil wealth has ended up feeding corruption, rent-seeking behavior, and often it has led to conflict. There is probably nothing intrinsically good or evil in oil–or in any other natural resource for that matter; however, unlike other natural resources that are diffused spatially, oil reserves are typically concentrated (point resource). As a result, oil rents are often captured by a small elite, which can lead to grievances.====Then, one may ask, if the goal is to prevent rent-seeking and political violence, should oil revenues be kept under the control of the central government, as in Kuwait, Qatar, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Libya, given back to the people, as in Norway and Alaska,==== devolved to regions, as in the United Arab Emirates, or wasted as in …so many places? This paper tries to answer these specific questions from the perspective of conflict prone countries. Doing so, it shows why the devolution of oil windfalls with potential opposition groups sometime has decreased the likelihood of conflict and sometime it has increased it. In addition, it also explains why transfer schemes that may be effective in averting conflict may also be difficult to implement.====The reason why transfers may either increase or decrease the likelihood of conflict is that they affect the incentives to fight in two opposite ways: on the one hand, they reduce the amount of resources that are up for grabs and, thus, the incentives to fight for them (the “rent dissipation” channel); on the other, they increase the resources available to competing groups, making it easier to finance a rebellion or a conflict (the “opportunity cost” channel). Hence, we are in the presence of a trade-off and, depending on which of the two channels is stronger, transfers can increase or decrease the likelihood of political violence.====To study such an important trade-off, we build upon Besley and Persson (2011) model of contest and political violence (BP hereinafter), where two groups, which compete for power and the associated control of natural resource wealth, have to decide whether to abide by the democratic rules or to take up arms to fight for power. In such a setup, we introduce different transfer schemes and study how they affect the likelihood of conflict.====Our main result is that the effect of transfers on the likelihood of conflict depends on how large the transfers are as a proportion of the rent. More precisely, we show that in oil rich countries, large (enough) transfers decrease the likelihood of conflict, while small(er) transfers increase it. We then compare direct transfers, that is, unconditional cash transfer to the people, and fiscal transfers, that is, central government transfers to subnational entities, and show that whereas the former tend to be more effective in reducing the likelihood of conflict, the latter allow for higher levels of consumption and provision of public goods.====Building upon such results, we characterize the transfer schemes that would be agreed by the two parties ex-ante, that is, before knowing which group ends up controlling power. Of course, absent enforcement mechanisms, the party in charge will be tempted to renege on many transfer schemes agreed ex-ante, but not on all of them. Indeed, we show that those transfers that enforce repression as the equilibrium outcome, when the incumbent reacts first, and those that enforce peace, when the opposition does, may be self-enforcing.====Our work builds on a vast body of literature. The idea that natural resource rents may divert resources away from productive uses and foster rent seeking behavior has been studied, among others, by Gelb (1988), Lane and Tornell (1999), Bourguignon and Verdier (2000), Powell (2006), and, more recently, by Nunn and Qian (2014), Lei and Michaels (2014), and Berman et al. (2017). Such a rent seeking behavior often takes the form of appropriation through armed rebellion, civil war, or oppression.==== The relationship between oil, wealth, and conflict onset constitutes a special branch of the literature. Particularly relevant for problems related to institutional weaknesses in oil endowed countries are Chaudhry (1997), Karl (1997), and Ross (2012), and for problems related to regime survival strategies in oil rich countries Lynch (2012), and Colgan (2015). Paine (2016) considers both aspects in a unified framework to analyze the relationship between center-seeking civil war onset and oil wealth.====The role of transfers in preventing resource-related conflicts, which is the focus of this paper, is analyzed by a relatively smaller literature. The two papers that are particularly relevant to our analysis are Azam (1995) and Beviá and Corchón (2010). The former considers a contest model where one of the two players (the incumbent) can credibly commit to transferring a portion of windfall revenues to the other (the opponent). In the absence of such transfers, military expenditures are excessively high from a social point of view. Beviá and Corchón (2010) also consider transfers before the contest, and they show that they decrease the likelihood of conflict by increasing the opportunity cost of waging a war.====We also consider the role of transfers in a contest model and, unsurprisingly, we find that transfers between players may indeed decrease the likelihood of conflict. However, unlike Azam (1995) and Beviá and Corchón (2010), we do not consider a winner-takes-it-all contest. In our model, natural resource windfalls can be appropriated, but non-resource income cannot, and conflict does not wipe out non-oil income. This is an important difference because it allows the opportunity cost of conflict to be decreasing in income (e.g., because some of the costs of building an army are fixed); consequently, transfers could increase or decrease the likelihood of conflict. The net effect depends on the size of the resource windfalls ==== total wealth.====Another important novel aspect of our model is that we consider more than one strategic interaction between players:==== a contest for the appropriation of revenue windfall and a public good provision game. The latter follows the recent aggregative public game literature, particularly Jensen (2006), Kotchen (2007), Cornes and Hartley (2007), and Acemoglu and Jensen (2013). An interesting implication of this modeling choice, and the reason why we adopted it, is that our results depend on the magnitude of total transfers, not on how they are allocated among the different parties. This simplifies the comparative static exercise and makes it less arbitrary.====The paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides some stylized facts (and estimates) about the relationship between transfers and (likelihood of) conflict; section 3 introduces our basic model of conflict and finds the thresholds (in terms of institutional resilience) for the emergence of conflict, unrest, or peace as the equilibrium outcomes in the absence of transfers. Section 4 introduces different transfer schemes and discusses how they can influence such outcomes. Section 5 provides a welfare analysis of the different transfer schemes both from an ex-ante and an ex-post perspective; finally, section 6 concludes.

Upgrading the quality of human capital in the workforce is widely seen as a key challenge faced by countries looking to escape the “middle income trap.” Growing attention has been paid to public-private partnerships (PPP) between individual firms and schools as a powerful tool for meeting this challenge, but key facilitators of PPP thought crucial in existing studies – strong, independent employers’ associations and ==== – are often missing in such settings. To explore the emergence of PPP in skill development in the developing world, we draw on recent reform experiences in Russia’s regions that have led to a surge in complex, costly forms of PPP despite weakly developed business associations and unions. We argue that variation in the administrative capacity of regional governments and their political accountability explains this surge. Strong administrative capacity reassures all parties that regional authorities can monitor their counterparties’ compliance with agreements, while political accountability creates incentives for authorities to do so. We test our argument using original data on the existence and content of firm-school partnerships across all Russia’s regions for 2013.","A key challenge faced by many governments in developing economies is escaping the middle income trap: protracted, stagnant growth common to countries emerging from low levels of development (Doner and Schneider, 2016). For many, the problem stems from a fundamental dilemma: wages and incomes are too high to compete with lower-cost, exporting countries but worker skill levels are too low to compete with advanced economies (Kharas and Kohli, 2011). Emerging work on the political economy of development suggests that the most obvious solution – upgrading workers’ skill – is extremely challenging (Doner and Schneider, 2016; Agénor and Canuto, 2012), despite widespread understanding by firms that deficits of qualified labor is a significant obstacle (ManpowerGroup, 2016).====One solution gaining growing attention is to directly link firms and schools through public-private partnerships (PPP) that allow the former to tailor curricula to their own needs in exchange for material assistance and hiring guarantees (Hoffman and Schwartz, 2015; Newman and Winston, 2016).==== Setting up such arrangements is institutionally challenging, however, because of difficulties in aligning the incentives of employers, schools, and governments. Existing research on successful PPP’s largely focuses on Coordinated Market Economies, emphasizing the role of key actors – strong and independent business associations and labor unions – that are absent or weak in most developing countries (==== Hall and Soskice, 2001, Thelen, 2004, Busemeyer and Trampusch, 2012; Busemeyer, 2015). Thus we know little about how successful PPP can be forged in low- and middle-income settings.====What research exists suggests that PPP’s for skill development are hard to build. First, investments in human capital are costly and risky for firms, since trained employees can be easily poached by rivals. (Thelen, 2004; Iversen and Soskice, 2001; Acemoglu and Pischke, 1998). Second, co-investments by firms with the state are problematic. Because the state is the final arbiter of contracts on its own territory, investors have little recourse in the event of disputes. Consequently, co-investments require strong, credible commitments that the state will abide by agreements (North and Weingast, 1989; North et al., 2009). The literature on Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) suggests that the solution to these problems for PPP lies with the role of labor and business associations. The latter can monitor member firms to police poaching (==== Streeck, 1992; Estevez-Abe et al., 2001) and use the threat of collective action to hold the state accountable (Finegold and Soskice, 1988; Crouch et al., 1999). Labor unions perform similar functions for employees. Such associations tend to be weak in the developing world, however, limiting their value.====In this paper, we examine the paradoxical existence of meaningful, high-cost forms of PPP in TVET in Russia, where business associations and labor have traditionally been weak. A burgeoning literature on the political economy of Russia has documented a turn in Russian firms’ strategies from a rather myopic, asset stripping approach to management to one concerned with boosting competitiveness and pursuing long term development strategies (e.g.Frye, 2017; Gans-Morse, 2017). Within this framework, finding solutions to skills shortages has become a crucial concern (==== Price Waterhouse Cooper, 2014). Recent reforms by the federal government devolved significant authority over the content and organization of TVET to regional governments to improve skill development outcomes (Remington, 2017). As a consequence PPP’s in Russia vary across regions from those with little educational content to those with shared responsibility over instruction and costly investments of time and money by firms. Meantime, Russian business associations and labor unions are generally regarded as weak and dependent on the state (Crowley, 1997; Ashwin and Clarke, 2003; Duvanova, 2013), resulting in a weak role in encouraging PPP in TVET (Remington and Marques, in press). Thus, Russia is a useful case for exploring how middle-income countries can foster PPP in TVET, enhance human capital, and improve economic development in the absence of cohesive intermediary organizations.====In this paper, we treat the problem of encouraging firms and schools to engage in meaningful forms of PPP as a two-sided cooperation dilemma and attempt to understand the conditions under which both sides invest in costly (in terms of time or money) forms of partnership. We emphasize the role of government in encouraging investment in skill, arguing that its ability to resolve cooperation dilemmas hinges on two issues. First, firms and schools depend on each other to take costly actions to implement agreements and must be assured that their counter-parties will also do so. Firms know that altering long established curricula, installing new equipment, and hiring or retraining instructors is time consuming and costly for schools. Similarly, school officials may be wary of exerting such efforts absent a belief that firms will not opportunistically renege on promised investments or commitments to hiring graduates. We argue that both sides can be reassured if the state itself has strong administrative capacity, which we define as the ability to monitor and coordinate its agents, formulate coherent policies, and enforce its decisions (Mann, 1993; Colton, 2006; Hendrix, 2010).==== Such capacity can help ameliorate each side’s fears that the other will renege on commitments (Mccubbins et al., 1987; Weingast and Moran, 1983).====Second, both sides must also believe the state will actually use its capacity to enforce PPP. Work on the political economy of investment has long emphasized the importance of strong institutional constraints that give actors access to power or enable them to pressure the state to credible commitments and investment, even in non-democracies (==== North et al., 2009; Gehlbach and Keefer, 2011). Although we examine the oft-studied role of traditional political competition in this paper, we also examine a recently proposed alternative emerging from studies of investment under authoritarianism: formal and informal channels of access to policymakers. Authoritarian legislatures, in particular, have received growing attention as a means of influencing policymaking in authoritarian settings, whether through direct representation by firms or opportunities to build informal political ties to sitting legislators (Gehlbach and Keefer, 2011). We argue that this channel may be of particular importance to credible commitment in countries like Russia, which, despite regional variation in political competition, is nevertheless a “competitive authoritarian” regime (==== Sharafutdinova, 2006; Panov and Ross, 2013). For firms and schools, this can also ameliorate commitment problems and make meaningful co-investments in human capital more attractive.====To test our hypotheses, we take advantage of a unique dataset of performance reports on PPP from 1654 Russian secondary vocational education facilities for the academic year 2013. We aggregate these reports to the regional level in order to identify the number of different forms of costly (in terms of time and material) practices present in a region in 2013, as well as the percentage of schools within regions that have adopted such practices. The former is a good, if imperfect, proxy for the ==== to which regions have broadly encouraged adoption of meaningful co-investment practices among firm-school partners, while the latter is a reasonable proxy for ==== these practices are within regions. Empirically, we focus on Russia due to the wide variation in TVET practices across its regions and their distribution. This variation is not well explained by existing work and it makes sub-national analysis of the Russian case attractive methodologically.==== Moreover, focusing on a single country ameliorates a wide range of potentially unobservable – legal regimes, social capital, historical legacies, or culture, etc. – that would complicate cross-national analysis.====To preview our findings, we find evidence that administrative capacity is strongly associated with both our measures of the extent to which costly PPP are present in regions and how common they are across regional schools, while firms’ access to power – here measured via business representation in legislative bodies – is associated with the former. We find little evidence that subnational variation in political competition (i.e. elections) matters. Recognizing the potential for endogeneity, we introduce a new instrument for administrative capacity, which takes advantage of the strong links between Soviet-era industrial structure and contemporary administrative state capacity (Gehlbach, 2008) and exploits the wholesale disruption of industrial relations and structures in the regions that accompanied the Soviet collapse. Although no plausible instrument exists for firms’ representation in the legislature, it is robust to a number of plausible alternative explanations and controls, as well as to placebo tests of the mechanism. Thus, despite the cross-sectional nature of our data, our findings shed light on how states can encourage functioning PPP under conditions thought to be inhospitable to co-investment.====Theoretically, our work provides an explanation for how the state can encourage cooperative forms of human capital development. It thus joins a growing literature on the formation of educational and skill formation systems (==== Thelen, 2004; Ansell and Lindvall, 2013; Gift and Wibbels, 2014; Busemeyer, 2015) but with particular relevance for the developing world. It also highlights the importance of non-democratic mechanisms of accountability as factors affecting economic policy. Empirically, we evaluate our hypothesis – as well as a number of alternative explanations – through statistical analysis of an original dataset of PPP in Russia’s regions. We believe our new measures capture key characteristics – the nature of investments being made and their diffusion – of how TVET is organized. Substantively, our work suggests the conditions under which states can expect firms to engage in PPP in skill development, make costly investments, and thus help to produce the skilled workforce critical to economic development.====The next section briefly discusses existing work on PPP in TVET and introduces the paper’s main hypotheses. Section three describes the data and research design. Section four presents our results and Section five provides a series of robustness checks of our main findings.

This paper studies whether ideological diversity in the boardroom affects firm performance.

This negative effect is still present when diversity is measured excluding top management, and when diversity is defined in terms of the difference between firms' management and non-executive directors. In conclusion we consider the implication of these findings given the recent growth in both political polarization and ideological segregation.","This paper studies whether ideological diversity in the boardroom affects firm performance. We find that whilst a board with a broader range of political opinions and beliefs is correlated with better performance ====, that the causal impact of such an increase in diversity is negative and substantial.====This finding is in contrast to the largely positive effects documented by the previous literature on the effects of diversity in the boardroom, whether defined in terms of race and ethnicity, gender, education, or age (Bernile et al., 2018).==== But, perhaps, this is to be expected. Pew (2016) documents that 70==== of Democrats say Republicans are ‘Closed-Minded’ while fully 46==== of Republicans say Democrats are ‘Immoral’, ‘Lazy’, and ‘Dishonest’.==== Around 40==== of highly engaged members of both parties say it would be hard to get along with a neighbour who was a member of the other party. This paper shows that these negative perceptions and social difficulties play out in the boardroom too. One implication of this finding is that the continued increase in the degree of political polarization maybe impacting average firm performance.====There are good reasons why the positive effects associated with increasing other forms of diversity may not apply to political beliefs. Firstly, there is less reason to expect efficiency gains. Secondly, political division may hamper the performance of the board.====As we will see it is not the case that boardrooms are the exclusive preserve of those of a particular political persuasion. Thus, the efficiency concerns about other aspects of boardroom diversity, e.g. that talented women are being excluded to the advantage of less talented men does not apply in the same way. Moreover, the related concern that boards drawn from a narrow range of backgrounds may lack a sufficient range of experience does not seem as appropriate here. Not least as individuals with very similar backgrounds often have quite different politics.====In terms of the downsides, there are several reasons why such diverse political beliefs in the boardroom might hamper performance. Following Akerlof and Kranton (2000) the literature on economics and identity has emphasised that individuals' identities and perceptions thereof may affect behavior in ways that lead to outcomes quite different from those predicted by standard models. While, political affiliation cannot be conflated with race or gender as a basis for discrimination, the survey results above make it clear that it is a very real divide.====Similarly, differences in political beliefs can be thought of as creating groups in the boardroom. Goette et al. (2006) shows that such groups can form rapidly, even when the composition is arbitrary. Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo (2009) show that the existence of such groups leads to discrimination against non-group members, and lower aggregate levels of trust. Lee et al. (2014) provide evidence for this effect in the boardroom. CEOs who are politically aligned to independent directors are associated with lower firm performance, but a reduced likelihood of dismissal, and a weaker link between pay and performance.====Fig. 1 shows the distribution of ideological positions of US corporate elites, measured on the basis of which politicians they donated to. (This measurement is discussed in more detail below). We can see that while both the mean and the median are positive, and that there is a substantial peak around 0.9 implying that the average member of the corporate elite is right-of-centre.==== The distribution is not quite uni-modal, however, with another peak at around −1 suggesting that there is also a second smaller group of left-of-centre executives and board members. Fig. 2 reports the average ideology by firm (for 2012). In comparison with Fig. 1 we can see that there is now, as might be expected, more mass in the centre of the ideological distribution but again a pronounced right of centre mode, with still a perceivable, albeit attenuated, left of centre mass point. In the presence of random assignment of directors and senior management to firms, we would expect to see (given the Central Limit Theorem) substantial shrinkage to the mean of the distribution and a normal distribution of average firm ideologies around it. That we do not observe this implies that assignment is not random, and that instead there is some process of assortative matching. The purpose of this paper is to understand the consequences of this matching for the performance of firms.====Given the results of the Pew (2016) survey it is not hard to imagine reasons for such a matching process. Such views of members of the opposite party may, unconsciously, bias firms towards hiring those with similar political views. Symmetrically, individuals may be more likely to pursue or take roles at firms that they feel are an ideological ‘fit’. The implications of such assortative matching in people's personal lives have been studied by Economists and Political Scientists, for example, Hitsch et al. (2016), Banerjee et al. (2013). In the context of the large firms we study, the concerns are different, and are more similar to those studied in the literature on other forms of diversity and firm performance. Even in those states, such as New York or California, where overt discrimination on the basis of political belief is illegal, in the same way it is on the basis of race or gender, more subtle biases may remain. Aside from the obvious moral implications, Economists have argued since Becker (1957) that such discrimination is inefficient and should be associated with reduced performance, for recent evidence see Weber and Zulehner (2014).====This research contributes to a growing literature on the politics of corporate leaders. Bonica (2016) documents, using the same Bonica (2014) database we build on, a number of important stylised facts about the political donations of corporate elites. Noting, that individual donations are commonplace and that there is substantial political heterogeneity within and across firms. Bayat (2017) shows that conservative CEOs are associated with larger dividends, other things equal. Chin et al. (2013) show that liberal CEOs are more likely to pursue corporate social responsibility initiatives. Political values also influence remuneration policy, and conservative boards pay CEOs more than their liberal equivalents.====Perhaps the closest paper to this work is Kim et al. (2013) who also study how ideological diversity affects firm performance. Using data for 500 randomly selected firms for the period 1999–2005 they find that ideologically diverse boards are associated with better firm performance, lower agency costs and reduced discretionary power of inside directors over firms' PACs. However, the data they use to build their diversity measure is much less rich than ours and they do not provide convincingly causal estimates.====This paper builds on this prior work by employing the dataset of Rockey and Zakir (2018), as well as some methodological refinements, to measure precisely ideological heterogeneity within firms, and between the board and senior management.====A key advantage of our approach is that we are able to exploit the variation in political orientation within the Republican and Democratic parties as well as between them. Given that moderates of both parties may have more in common with each other than they do with the more extreme wings of their parties, this is vital to measure the ideological heterogeneity of firms accurately. To see this consider the following two examples. The board and senior management of Firm A only make donations to Republicans, however half of the board are moderates and donate to centrist Republicans (we think of Susan Collins or Charlie Baker) whilst the other half are extremists and donate only to very right wing Republicans. Previous measures, such as that of Kim et al. (2013), based only on the share of Republican donations, will record this firm as being ideologically homogeneous. Our measure, will capture the heterogeneity accurately. Similarly, consider Firm B of which the board and senior management only make donations to moderates, in approximately equal amounts to those of both parties, i.e. 50==== to centrist Republicans and 50==== to centrist Democrats. A measure based on the share of Republican donations would record Firm B as being maximally ideologically heterogeneous. While our measure will capture the differences between those who support the Republicans and those who support the Democrats, but the small, if any, distance between them will mean the measured diversity will be very low.====A second important advantage is that we have data on not only directors and CEOs but all of each firm's top management. This allows us to study if ideological diversity exacerbates the principal-agent problem faced by the owners of a firm, as studied in the context of CEOs and independent directors by Lee et al. (2014). We also have a substantially larger sample than previous studies, we study all publicly traded companies over the period 1980–2012 since they became public.====This paper is organised as follows.

Instead, I propose that fiscal rules and transparency promote better budget balances because domestic political actors use fiscal institutions to constrain executive policymaking. I test these competing hypotheses of why these fiscal institutions are effective – financial markets vs political competition – and find that country budget balances are increased not as a consequence of financial markets, but when the level of political competition and civil society engagement is sufficiently high.

I present a model to explain the behavior of an incumbent redistributing public goods and cash transfers. According to the model, politicians use the government budget as a portfolio for electoral investment and diversify expenditure in order to target different groups of voters at the same time. I construct a unique data set of the promises made by the president of Colombia from 2002 to 2010 to municipalities throughout the country's various regions. The empirical results show some evidence that promises of cash transfers targeted swing voters, promises of public goods simultaneously targeted both core and swing municipalities, while opposition municipalities received few promises of cash transfers and public goods, which is consistent with the prediction of the model.","The distribution of governmental resources among the regions of a country has been a constant concern in the literature on political economy and several papers agree that political interests drive this distribution of resources.==== Political ambition leads politicians to promise distribution and allocation of resources to regions that are strategically important for elections.====This paper explores the behavior of a politician distributing public resources and analyzes the factors that shape decisions about the distribution of the two types of public spending:====. I use a simple model based on a standard probabilistic model to explain the relation between elections and distribution. This model incorporates further details on how politicians target distributions to appeal simultaneously to different groups of voters. I study the composition of government spending to shed light on the analysis of the behavior of politicians in office and to contribute to a more thorough study of public spending.====I use a unique dataset to test a model of distributive politics which is based on promises made in town-hall meetings conducted by President Uribe (2002–2010) throughout Colombia. These meetings involved weekly visits to different regions of Colombia that would last for an entire day. During these visits, the president would promise to redistribute resources to the municipality he was visiting as well as to surrounding municipalities.==== His administration meticulously documented his promises on a publicly accessible website; this information gave me the opportunity to construct a detailed database.====The richness of the data makes it possible to go a step further in exploring two questions about tactical distributions: what form do they take and who are the targeted beneficiaries. I conducted a more rigorous study of distribution, dividing it into two categories: cash transfers and public goods. The results are consistent with the prediction that cash transfers are used to persuade swing voters while public goods target core and swing municipalities. However, it is important to interpret carefully the coefficients as correlations.====Following Lizzeri and Persico (2001), I argue that cash transfers are a quicker and easier method of targeting voters, since they offer immediate gratification. This makes them an ideal instrument to persuade municipalities with indifferent voters. On the other hand, an incumbent with public goods can make long-term and slow-moving investments that are useful to reward partisans in both swing and core municipalities.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 is the introduction.

We distinguish them according to their ability to hedge against these disturbances and assume that they derive their optimal fiscal decisions by using a robust control approach. Results show that governments being highly vulnerable to spending disturbances set excessive tax rates, thereby exacerbating the fiscal pressure detrimental to output and obliging the central bank to conduct an expansionary ","Uncertainty about key macroeconomic aggregates and relationships governing the economy is an important challenge for policymakers and substantially influences their choices.==== In recent years, uncertainty seems to have become particularly challenging for fiscal policy-makers, and this, especially in the European Monetary Union (EMU) member countries. Fiscal authorities may face uncertainty stemming from lots of factors, including bond markets pressures as well as factors due to economic, social or political instability. The analysis of the implications of the fiscal policy-makers’ uncertainty on macroeconomic outcomes thus represents a crucial topic to be put into the agenda of academics and practitioners. As far as we know, only two theoretical studies have dealt with this issue. Di Bartolomeo et al. (2009) and Di Bartolomeo and Giuli (2011) develop a model where monetary and fiscal authorities face uncertainty about the parameters describing their policy effectiveness. They qualify Dixit and Lambertini (2003)'s result obtained under the ==== by showing that, under multiplicative uncertainty, even if monetary and fiscal authorities share identical targets for output and inflation, the achievement of these targets is no longer guaranteed.====In this paper, we consider a monetary union (MU) where national governments face uncertainty about the exact amount of public spending to be financed. More precisely, when setting their fiscal policy, governments fear some spending disturbances they do not necessarily have under control and which may alter or invalidate their budget projections. In addition, we assume that their spending can only be financed by taxation.==== To model their fiscal decision-making under this type of uncertainty, we use the ==== approach.==== Through this approach, we assume that governments are unable to define any probability distribution to spending disturbances. To set an optimal tax rate under these circumstances, they seek to select a fiscal policy that is robust to the most pessimistic perspective, i.e. that remains optimal even under the worst possible outcome of spending disturbances.====We allow for some asymmetry among the MU governments in the sense that we consider that some of them have lower ability to hedge against spending shocks and are therefore more vulnerable to budget uncertainty than others. This vulnerability can be so high that they are obliged to attach priority attention to spending stabilisation. Their fiscal policy is then constrained as it mainly focused on short-term spending imperatives at the expense of the economy's output performance. We refer to this type of governments as “fiscal-constrained”.====Obviously, each national government's spending uncertainty affects its fiscal decisions but not only. It is also likely to interfere in the common central bank's decisions and thereby affect the MU partner countries' situation. In this paper, our objective is twofold. First, we seek to outline the consequences of the governments' spending uncertainty for their fiscal decisions and, through it, for macroeconomic outcomes in the MU member countries. Second, we study the implications of this uncertainty for the macroeconomic effects of monetary institutions. In particular, we examine how the central bank's degree of inflation aversion as well as the number of MU member countries affect macroeconomic performances – in terms of inflation and output – in the presence of budget uncertainty.====It appears from our analysis that when the MU governments are vulnerable to spending disturbances, they set high tax rates. This exacerbated fiscal pressure translates into low output in the member countries, obliging the central bank to be accommodating by conducting an inflationary monetary policy. In an asymmetric MU, this result implies that countries where the government has high ability to hedge against spending disturbances will rapidly feel inconvenienced by the too inflationary monetary policy set by the central bank in reaction to the bad output situation in the partner countries whose government has lower ability to hedge against spending disturbances.====Our analysis also examines how changes in the monetary institutional environment can affect the governments' fear of spending disturbances. Results reveal that an increase in the central bank's concern about inflation exacerbates this fear, leading fiscal-constrained governments to set higher taxes at the expense of output. If these governments are in the majority in the MU, the central bank is induced to be more accommodating by conducting an inflationary monetary policy. Therefore, quite counter-intuitively, an increase in the central bank's concern about inflation can result into higher inflation. By studying the macroeconomic effects of a MU enlargement, we show that the entry of new countries aggravates the heterogeneity of the current members' output situation. Moreover, if the new entrants suffer from greater budget uncertainty than the current members, the latter may also experience an increase in the MU-inflation rate.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop a MU-model with monetary-fiscal strategic interactions in which we integrate the issue of budget uncertainty. The implications of this uncertainty for the member countries' economic outcomes are discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents the macroeconomic effects of changes in the monetary institutional environment in the presence of governments’ budget uncertainty.

In such a setting, there are two sources of inefficiency. First, monitoring is beneficial to the principal and costly to the agent. The resulting incentive problems and solutions are well described in the literature. However, since cheating is a hidden act, the incentive effect worsens and standard solutions fail to establish an efficient outcome. Second, agencies may prefer a particular outcome of the contest and may prefer their own compatriots to prevail over others, which we label the bias effect. We show that the proper monitoring design can solve both problems and transform the bias effect into intrinsic motivation.","Serena and Steffi compete in a tennis match to determine the new owner of their club's tennis championship trophy. Steffi's mother oversees the game as the umpire. Depending on the perceived integrity and the competitiveness of the game, such an arrangement might very likely raise concerns, especially among Serena's supporters. Now assume that the match is not being held at the local tennis club, but at the Wimbledon Championships in London, which offers a much bigger trophy and millions in prize money. Even if the reputation of Steffi's mother as an umpire were beyond all possible doubt and even though the influence of an umpire in tennis is arguably smaller than that of other sports, such as soccer, she would be very likely the last living umpire to be considered for the job of monitoring the game.====It does not require an expert in tennis (or economics) to identify the potential conflict of interest.====While this observation may be straightforward, there are numerous such examples in economic situations, in which the same wisdom is ignored. The task of monitoring international competitors is often delegated to national entities. While such agencies are assumed to be fair and neutral, obvious conflicts of interest occur.====Examples include the enforcement of environmental or trade regulations, the pursuance of patent protection, and arguably most prominently, national anti-doping work in sports. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) delegates anti-doping enforcement to national anti-doping agencies. These national agencies should enforce a doping-free environment in their respective countries. However, by doing so, they would decrease their athletes' winning chances, since doping enhances the competitiveness of athletes. Again, it does not require a prudent economist to notice that this could undermine an agency's incentives to conduct its anti-doping tasks thoroughly.====Aggravating this situation, with regard to compliance with rules, it is often the case that neither the actions of the agency nor the supervised players are observable by the public. Non-compliance, cheating, and doping are usually hidden acts, even ex-post. Therefore, the public or sports federations rely on instructed supervisors to enforce compliance and to gather information regarding the conduct of supervised competitors. Furthermore, because of the non-observability of the supervisor's and competitors' efforts, it is difficult to implement external control of the supervisor's work.====There is a wide branch of economic literature that analyzes cheating and sabotage in contests. Examples include, but are not limited to, the labor market, the sports market, and elections. Consequently, cheating and sabotage have been the subject of intensive research.==== Although the literature is wide ranging in the topics addressed, its conclusions can be summarized pointedly as follows: people cheat.====Consequently, with the aim of reducing the extent of cheating, a wide strand of literature analyzes different anti-cheating schemes for monitoring agencies. Goetsch and Salzmann (2018) introduce ex-post auditing strategies for agencies. In their setting, they allow the agency to store and retest doping samples in the future after the introduction of technological advances. They show that such retests are a suitable measure to reduce cheating. Kirstein (2014) analyzes the influence of different audit strategies on doping incentives. In his setting, a possible fine for doping for two competing athletes is based not on actual doping tests but on imperfect signals. He finds that the degree of compliant behavior is maximized by charging fines only if the signal implies doping abuse. Berentsen et al. (2008) shows that the implementation of a whistle-blowing mechanism can be used as a cost-saving measure to reduce cheating.====Another strand of the literature deals with the undesirable consequences of anti-cheating regulations. Berentsen (2002) and Gilpatric (2011) analyze the implications of higher monitoring effort on legal effort. In their settings, stricter anti-cheating measures could decrease legal effort investments. Gilpatric and Reiser (2017) consider the effects of a zero-tolerance policy on misconduct. They find that cheating may be minimized in situations in which a specific amount of cheating is allowed and that subsequently, a zero-tolerance policy may even increase the extent of cheating. Hirschmann (2017) argues that higher sanctions can serve as an entry barrier in contests and thus, can reduce the number of participants in a contest. Meanwhile, in the setting of Mohan and Hazari (2016), more anti-doping effort may even increase overall doping abuse. Music (2020) shows that a harmonization of anti-cheating regulations leads to more doping.====However, while these studies analyze the pros and cons of different anti-cheating schemes, they ignore incentive problems for the supervisor. Agencies that are tasked with supervision are seen as benevolent regulators without bias or personal agendas. Regarding this aspect, the literature neglects the fact that the delegation of a task may induce incentive problems, which are well described in the literature on delegation (see Tirole (1986), Strausz (1997), and Rahman (2012)). Since the actions of different players are not observable to the public, the problem obviously applies in the context of cheating in contests. Therefore, our analysis focuses on two problems. 1) How can a supervisor be motivated to make proper effort? 2) How can institutional bias be neutralized or even used in this quest? Our analysis shows that biased agencies can even be viewed as “best monitors” from a principal's perspective, since—if managed with the right incentives—they provide high intrinsic motivation to conduct effort.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and analyzes the implications of a Tullock contest among supervised competitors. We show why observable detections are not a good indicator for the efficiency of an agency and we show additional information problems that occur in a contest setting. We find that using the contest situation and institutional bias can help to motivate an agency to conduct proper testing. Lastly, we show that a slight change in supervision allocation can tackle motivation and bias problem simultaneously, and can even induce the agency to invest more monitoring effort than a non-biased principal would invest. Section 3 discusses further examples for which our proposed contract design could help to prevent illicit actions. Section 4 discusses the introduction of legal effort.

Though protest's importance for democratic change is acknowledged, disentangling its effect is a challenging analytical exercise for at least three interconnected reasons.====First, empirical studies often describe the democratization process as a one-step transition from autocracy to democracy. At most, they also accommodate democratic consolidation. However, the democratization process could also be described by more gradual institutional changes where political regimes evolve in sequential phases, each characterized by its own institutional features and equilibria among the involved actors (Huntington, 1968; Epstein et al., 2006; Diamond, 2002; Levitsky and Way, 2002). Each transition from a given phase to another carries therefore its particular structure of interaction between protest and the democratization process and requires that the evolution of political institutions be considered as dependent of the specific stage of the process.====Second, when analysing the protest's impact on the democratization process, the two actor-centric theoretical frameworks highlight the unobservable nature of actors' strategies and behaviours. The first framework refers to the role of protest ====, namely spontaneous mass demonstrations where citizens are the pivotal actor. Some authors emphasize that actual political protests are an effective tool on the way to democratization (Linz and Stepan, 1996; Bermeo, 1997; Schock, 2005; Bunce and Wolchik, 2006). Other authors observe, however, that actual demonstrations are not always needed. The democratization process, they argue, can be set in motion by latent political protests that press for the advancement of democracy through a threat that the incumbent elites are unwilling to suppress with force (Conley and Temimi, 2001; Boix, 2003; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001, 2005; Dorsch and Maarek, 2015). Taking a leaf from both sides, other scholars (Bermeo, 1997; Wood, 2000) suggest that actual and latent political protests can be both relevant for the democratization process.====The second framework analyses the role of protest within elite-driven regime changes. Democratization theories ==== explain institutional changes as the elites' decision to concede democratic reforms (O'Donnell et al., 1986). Within this framework, the analytical challenge is to capture empirically the elites' propensity to democratize and to influence citizens' protest since they vary in unobserved ways and over time across the different phases of the democratization process (Lizzeri and Persico, 2004; Llavador and Oxoby, 2005; Jack and Lagunoff, 2006; Haggard and Kaufman, 1995). For instance, behind closed doors, elites might agree to concede a minimal level of democracy, but oppose further democratic concessions.====Third, defining democracy as a sequential process calls for a distinction between peaceful or violent protest. A recent literature argues that as peaceful and violent protests carry different opportunity costs, incentives to democratize operate quite differently among the involved actors and across the different political phases, thus yielding different chances of success (Schock, 2005; Bunce and Wolchik, 2006; Chenoweth and Stephan, 2011; Celestino and Gleditsch, 2013; Bayer et al., 2016; Aidt and Franck, 2019).====Keeping in mind these three challenges, our contribution is to analyse how peaceful and violent protests affect the democratization process when i) the latter is described as a sequence of phases, and ii) systematic, and potentially time-varying, unobserved heterogeneity stemming from elite's behaviours is taken into account.====A part from a standard endogeneity issue,==== unobserved heterogeneity might give rise to sample selection bias when combined with a sequential democratic process (Cameron and Heckman, 1998–2001). Such problem has received little, if any, attention in the empirical literature because phases (whether two or more) are independently modeled (e.g., Epstein et al., 2006; Alemán and Yang, 2011). However, countries that are “at risk” of moving to higher phases of the democratization process form a selected sub-sample from the original one. Since these higher phases are likely to be systematically related to previous ones via the over time variation of elites’ unobserved behaviour, ignoring the latter might generate sample selection bias.====To address endogeneity and sample selection bias, we develop a specific and novel empirical strategy.==== Firstly, we model the sequential nature of the democratization process by allowing countries to pass through gradual phases of democratic reforms and assuming a common unobserved heterogeneity among the different phases. Second, in order to attenuate a potential endogeneity issue, we propose to jointly model the citizens' decision to protest and the elites' decision to concede democratic reforms. More specifically, we use a system of equations that simultaneously estimates the probability of protest and democracy at different phases while capturing the unobserved heterogeneity through a latent variable described by a finite mixture of types. On a sample of 171 countries from 1970 to 2010, having controlled for both protests’ endogeneity and unobservable factors that affect the sequential levels of democracy, we find evidence that protest plays a fundamental role in how the democratization process unfolds. In particular, initial phases of liberalization are generally driven by both violent and peaceful protests. Then, while the latter matter also for subsequent democratic reforms, violent protests seem to threaten democratic consolidation.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature on the role of peaceful and violent protest on the democratization process and on the difficulties that emerge if unobserved heterogeneity is not accounted for. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy the paper pursues and illustrates how it departs from the existing models in order to take into account the sequential nature of the democratization process and unobserved heterogeneity. Section 4 introduces the data used in our empirical estimation and the variables employed. Section 5 reports the results of the empirical estimation and presents the main findings.

We study “horse race” news (news on candidates' chances in an upcoming election) from six major online outlets for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential campaigns. We find robust evidence that horse race headlines were slanted congenially with respect to the preferences of the outlets' typical readers. However, evidence of congenial slant in the timing and frequency of horse race stories is weaker. We also find limited evidence of greater within-outlet demand for headlines most congenial to outlets' typical readers, and somewhat stronger evidence of greater demand for relatively ==== headlines. We discuss how various aspects of our results are consistent with each of the major mechanisms driving slant studied in the theoretical literature, and may help explain when each mechanism is more likely to come into play. In particular, readers may be more likely to click on uncongenial headlines due to inferring that these stories are particularly informative when they stand in contrast to an outlet's typically congenial slant.","Over the last decade, the economics literature has made substantial contributions to the debate about the causes and consequences of political media slant (Gentkzow et al., 2015; Puglisi and Snyder Jr., 2015a). This literature has focused on studying political slant ==== news outlets, and effects of such slant.==== However, the ways in which news is slanted, and variation in slant across outlets, issues, and over time, are, of course, still not fully understood. Furthermore, the investigation of ====-outlet demand for slant has been largely neglected so far. It is unclear whether, for a given trusted outlet, readers prefer more politically “congenial” news—news favoring one's preferred policies or party—or if consumers are indifferent to the slant of individual stories from a preferred outlet.====This topic is important because it relates directly to the question of how well the market for news contributes to a well-informed citizenry. Even if consumers primarily get news from ideologically aligned outlets, and even if such outlets distort their news to favor one side of the spectrum, consumers may still be reasonably well informed if they read a variety of stories, including “uncongenial” stories, from such outlets. On the other hand, if consumers restrict attention to congenial news within their favored outlets, then the echo chambers problem, and concerns about voters lacking information, would be more severe.====In this paper, we contribute to filling this gap in the literature. We construct a novel data set and use it to analyze both across-outlet slant and the within-outlet relationship between news slant and demand. Since both slant and consumer demand are correlated with news topics, it is crucial that our analysis also holds the news topic fixed. We do this by identifying a news issue reported on repeatedly by major outlets across the political spectrum: “horse race” news (news on competing candidates' chances of winning an upcoming election). We study horse race news for the 2012 and 2016 US presidential elections, constructing an original data set by scraping six news websites for each year. The sites are: the New York Times (NYT), Fox News, Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and Yahoo! News (Yahoo) in both 2012 and 2016; Google News and the Washington Post (WashPost) in 2016; and USA Today (USAT) and the Huffington Post (HuffPost) in 2012. For each year, we have two sites typically perceived as left-of-center (NYT and HuffPost in 2012, and NYT and WashPost in 2016), two perceived as right-of-center (Fox News, WSJ), and two perceived as relatively neutral, with readerships that are aligned, though not completely, with these reputations.====We use the term slant to refer to favorability of headlines (which we focus on in our analysis, rather than article content, as we explain below) to one party or the other's chances in the election. This definition of slant is a natural one for our context, though somewhat distinct from definitions used in other papers in this literature, discussed below. Our definition does not necessarily imply distortion from truth; however, horse race headlines indeed might distort, mislead, or simply emphasize different factors about a given state of the horse race in various ways via framing and selection. Two headlines about a given poll result can send different messages via different word choices, or by emphasizing different aspects of polling information, such as changes in polls versus levels, particular states versus national results, results for particular demographic groups, or even results for some polls versus others. Outlets can also shape the horse race news they produce by simply deciding when, and to what extent, to report on polls at all. Slant can be driven by psychological and information-based demand side factors and/or supply-side factors, which we discuss in more detail below.====While we do not have micro-level click data for our main analysis, we use an innovative measure of demand: the websites' publicly reported lists of most popular articles. In addition to public availability, another advantage of the “most viewed” list data over most micro data is that the most viewed lists capture demand for the entire market, and not just a sample of users observed. We interpret our results carefully in light of the aggregate nature of the data and discuss how reader heterogeneity could affect results in various parts of the paper. Furthermore, to better understand individual reader behavior, we conduct a complementary micro-level analysis, using data from incentivized surveys based on real-time, quasi-randomized news for a closely related, but distinct, topic, the presidential debates.====We discuss our web data in Section 3. Since articles attain most viewed status based on clicks, which are primarily based on headlines, we code the partisan congeniality of headlines, and not the entire article.==== Headlines are short, so we find it is most effective to use content analysis (human coding) rather than computational analysis to code them. We used a team of highly incentivized and closely supervised master MTurkers for this content analysis. We examine general patterns in slant of the outlets' reporting, and confirm that slant of all six outlets varies over time within each year, and each outlet's slant was correlated with poll averages in each year.====In Section 4.1, we present the across-outlet analysis. We assess slant on both the intensive and extensive margins (slant in headlines actually reported, and slant in the decision of whether to report on the horse race at all, respectively). We find robust and substantial evidence of intensive margin congenial slant for the HuffPost in 2012, the NYT in 2016, and Fox in both 2012 and 2016. The evidence for congenial extensive margin slant is weaker and less consistent. Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest evidence of extensive margin slant was for the WSJ, which appeared more likely to report horse race stories when polls were more favorable to Democrats (i.e., uncongenial to Republican readers) in both years.====In Section 4.2 we present the within-outlet analysis. We use simple linear probability models, regressing a dummy variable for making an outlet's most popular list on slant-outlet interactions, with outlet and day fixed effects to account for general variation in article popularity driven by these factors. We find non-robust and only marginally significant evidence that stories more congenial to typical readers were more popular for just one outlet, in one year (Fox in 2012). Point estimates for the NYT and HuffPost that year are near zero, with reasonably high precision. For 2016, we find somewhat more significant and robust evidence of non-null effects—that news that was more ==== for typical readers was more likely to be popular—for both the NYT and Fox. The survey results also largely fail to yield significant results indicating preferences for congenial news from ideologically aligned outlets.====Thus, our main results are that outlets did often slant stories in a way that was congenial to their typical readers, but only on the intensive margin, and there was still variation in slant across stories within outlets. Moreover, stories that were most congenial to an outlet's typical readers were not most likely to make it to the outlet's most viewed list. In Section 5, we discuss interpretation of our results with respect to the broader question of what drives supply and demand for slant, based on the framework provided by Gentkzow et al. (2015). Why does variation in slant across outlets make different outlets appeal to different readers? Do media consumers prefer to get news from ideologically aligned outlets because such news “feels good” due to a psychological mechanism, or because consumers perceive this news to be truly more informative? Within the information category, there are two distinct mechanisms: instrumental value for decisions and trust; can we comment on which, if either, our results support? And to what extent do outlets impose slant on consumers for supply-side reasons, i.e., reasons favoring an outlet's interests other than attempts to appeal to consumer preferences?====Congenial across-outlet slant could be due to outlets pandering to the psychology mechanism. Readers may click on more congenial stories because they “feel good” and the slanted distribution supplied by various outlets may maximize their clicks. But we cannot immediately rule out that across-outlet slant is driven by informational factors either in addition to, or instead of, psychological factors. While it seems implausible that news reported with systematically congenial slant would provide greater instrumental value for decisions, it could be more trusted, as consumers may have perceived congenially slanted horse race stories as more informative (if consumers had priors biased toward their preferred candidate being more likely to win). However, the incentive for outlets to pander to these priors would decline as the election approaches, and we find it was not the case that actual slant declined in this way.====We interpret the lack of within-outlet demand for additional congeniality for typical readers, and possible within-outlet demand for uncongeniality, to be likely due to satiation of the psychology mechanism and perceptions that less congenial stories were relatively credible and informative. Some outlets' stories may have been slanted, on average, more than the optimal slant with respect to maximizing readers' preferences due to supply-side factors like an outlet's desire to promote a bandwagon voting effect, or simple miscalculation. Heterogeneity of reader behavior may also help explain these within-outlet demand results: demand for news that was more uncongenial to typical readers may have been driven partly by relatively moderate or even “counter-partisan” readers (though we argue this latter possibility is unlikely to be the main explanation).====Moreover, we discuss how the extensive margin (WSJ) results perhaps best support the instrumental information theory of slant demand. We also discuss how several subtle contextual factors could influence the relevance of each mechanism. Our results hence fail to support a simple, but ==== plausible, story in which the most partisan stories on partisan outlets were most popular for purely psychological reasons. By contrast, our results provide support for each of the major mechanisms potentially driving slant considered in prior literature, arguing against an either/or approach to understanding drivers of slant.",The supply of media slant across outlets and demand for slant within outlets: Evidence from US presidential campaign news,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300252,8 April 2020,2020,Research Article,194.0

This is particularly true at subnational level; maintaining fiscal discipline in a decentralized setting is challenging and subnational government fiscal rules are considered one of the most valid solutions to the problem. While theoretical and empirical literature has mainly focused on their effectiveness in containing subnational deficit and/or debt, little attention has been paid to the possible trade–offs and side effects of the rules on the composition of subnational expenditure. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by exploiting the case of Italian municipalities, which have been subject for fifteen years (1999–2015) to a set of rules called Domestic Stability Pact. The Italian DSP framework – imposing rules only on municipalities above a population threshold (5000 inhabitants) – allows us to implement a quasi–experimental technique to investigate the unintended composition effects of the rules. A difference–in–discontinuities design permits to find rigorous empirical evidence that the switching in 2007 to rules which are more binding in terms of fiscal discipline leads to a recomposition of municipal expenditure against investment spending. The analysis is then integrated by evaluating the impact of the rules on six categories of investment expenditure. Investment in human capital and infrastructure seems to be the most affected.","Most of the recent empirical literature on Subnational Government numerical fiscal Rules (SGR) has focused on which typologies, strictness and coverage features of the rules are the most suitable to constrain the subnational deficit and/or debt. It aims at verifying whether the rules are truly effective in pursuing this objective. We propose here to investigate whether those rules that are supposed to have a stronger positive (intended) effect on fiscal sustainability may also have (indirect and unintended) effects on the expenditure composition of the SubNational Governments (SNG).====The issue is relevant, especially as the trends towards fiscal decentralization have been strengthening over time in many countries; numerous EU Member States have actually been affected, though almost exclusively on the expenditure side. OECD (2018) provides data on spending decentralization in EU countries updated to 2015. It is worth pointing out that decentralization has involved not only constitutionally federal states (Austria, Germany) but also unitary countries (Italy, Nordic Countries) as well as those unitary and traditionally centralized (France). In 2015, the subnational government spending to total general government expenditure ratio is above 60% in Denmark and 30–40% in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy and Spain. Breaking down subnational expenditure according to the ECOG reveals that investment accounts for more than 50% in most countries, with peaks close to or above 70% in Belgium and Germany (Allain-Dupré, 2017). As far as expenditure functions are concerned, according to the European Commission (2012) environment and housing are typically assigned to the SNG – about 60–80% of the general government expenditure in these areas is carried out at the subnational level – followed by education, culture and recreational services (more than 40%).====Although the SNG have been undoubtedly gaining importance in public finance, the assignment of functions to subcentral authorities is not unproblematic. Several conflicts may arise, which have their roots in the different suitability of each level of government to perform the three key functions – allocation, redistribution and stabilization (Musgrave, 1959) – of the public sector. The highlighted decentralization trends are explained by the importance the public sector attaches to the optimal resources allocation (Pedone, 2008). The allocative function is the activity against which the SNG seem to have the main advantage over the central government (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1972) without conflicting with its objectives, as it is likely to happen with respect to the other two functions. The very fact that the SNG mainly deal with environment, education, culture and recreational services is consistent with the traditional theory of fiscal federalism (European Commission, 2012). The spending items included in these functions concern services which are more efficiently organized on a fairly small scale, as the heterogeneity of preferences is likely to be more pronounced. This focus on service differentiation according to the local needs has been deemed one of the driving forces of the decentralization trends.====Fiscal federalism, however, brings about two problems. On the one hand, it usually leads to lower uniformity in provided local public goods/services; economic disparities and differences in taxing capacity among the SNG often result in an unbalanced provision. On the other hand, a risk for opportunistic behaviours does emerge, as the single entities are usually not able to assess the impact of their decisions at the general government level. This second point is crucial; it is at the root of the introduction of SGR mainly aiming at fiscal discipline. Inducing subcentral authorities to share the responsibility of fiscal sustainability and fiscal discipline with the central government has indeed become overriding. To a certain extent, it represents a strong push towards (re)centralization. Actually, at the EU level and especially after the last financial crisis, the SNG have been actively involved in public finance consolidation.====The fact that the SNG play a key role in public spending, however, would require special attention to the setting of the rules. This is a non–secondary aspect. The OECD (Sutherland et al., 2005; Fredriksen, 2013) has indeed built (and recently updated) a summary indicator of the quality of various countries’ SGR. One of the criteria for the index construction is the effect of the rules on spending, that is their suitability to support spending allocative efficiency. Actually, among the relevant criteria to evaluate the overall quality of the SGR, allocative efficiency has the same weight as fiscal sustainability. A comparison across countries of the SGR currently in force reveals that these objectives might be at odds. For instance, according to Fredriksen (2013) Danish SGR score high as regards sustainability, while performing poorly as for allocative efficiency. The opposite happens at the Belgian state level. The OECD indicator is valuable in this regard; the conflict it reveals between the different objectives of the rules points to the basic conflict in the allocation of functions to the SNG.====However, obtaining a proper balancing of the various demands is not an easy task. On the one hand, greater autonomy may lead to a shift of costs to the general government, potentially resulting in sustainability issues. On the other hand, an excessive emphasis on fiscal consolidation may lead to distortions in spending, by slowing down “the supply of infrastructure and public services in the economically most vital part of the country without reducing, or perhaps even accentuating, the shortcomings of the most disadvantaged parts” (Pedone, 2008, p. 210). In other words, a conflict of priorities worthy of deeper consideration does appear.====Our aim here is to contribute to the empirical literature investigating whether such a conflict does emerge in the presence of binding SGR. In particular, we intend to add to the research on possible SGR trade–offs and side–effects affecting subnational expenditure choices and spending composition. In fact, although these effects are well known in literature, the related empirical contributions seem to call for a deeper analysis rather than arriving at widely accepted results. We therefore aim to fill this gap by rigorously evaluating rule–induced changes both in the proportion of subnational current and capital spending and in the resources allocated to specific expenditure functions. As far as we know, these effects are still not fully investigated in literature. Our case study is the Italian municipalities, which constitute an attractive setting for our purposes. They have in fact always played a key role in public expenditure – as similarly happens in other EU countries – while at the same time being subject for several years to imposed fiscal rules primarily aiming at fiscal discipline; a Domestic Stability Pact was indeed in force between 1999 and 2015.====The way such rules are devised gives rise to an ideal setting for a quasi–experimental design. The DSP has indeed envisaged a threshold (5000 inhabitants) for several years such that only the municipalities above have actually been subject to the rules. Unfortunately, the presence of a confounding policy at the same threshold – the higher wage of the mayor (and of the members of the municipal executive body) in the municipalities above 5000 inhabitants – prevents us from adopting a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Nevertheless, we can still remove the confounding policy by exploiting the fact that we have years ==== the introduction of the rules. In other words, we can exploit both the discontinuity at the threshold and the time variation (before/after estimation) through a difference–in–discontinuities estimator (Grembi et al., 2016).====We mainly focus on the effects of the rules on composition of subnational expenditure classified according to the ECOG. In particular, we find rigorous empirical evidence that switching to rules which are stricter in terms of fiscal discipline leads to a recomposition of municipal expenditure against investment spending. In fact, according to our preferred specification, while per capita total expenditure – accrual basis of accounting – experiences a decline between 7 and 11%, per capita investment spending is between 32 and 38% lower. Clearly, a recomposition of the expenditure arises. It similarly happens with regard to the cash basis of accounting: per capita total expenditure experiences a 6–8% decline, while per capita investment spending is 24–25% lower. The previous analysis can be usefully integrated by evaluating the impact of the rules on investment spending categorized according to a COFOG–like classification. As we shall see, the sharpest reductions regard per capita investment spending in human capital, infrastructure and pure public goods (respectively -43/-31%, -50/-33% and -40/-32% as for accrual basis of accounting). These results survive a series of robustness checks. In particular, we test the two fundamental assumptions behind the implementation of the diff–in–disc design. As we shall see, one of the hypotheses can be directly tested thanks to the specific Italian framework; as regards the other, a series of indirect tests still permit to asess its plausibility.====The remainder is structured as follows. Sections 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 defines the institutional framework behind our analysis.

Our findings suggest that a player does not always regard the winning probability as an acceptable settlement rule. He accepts a division according to winning probability when the destruction caused to him in conflict is more than a threshold, which in turn depends on cost of conflict to the opponent and the size of the population. Further, our analysis shows that the norms with positive weight to disagreement payoff are effective against conflict, and incentivize peace. Contrary to the findings of extant studies carried out in finite population evolutionary game setting, the settlement possibility set is identical under both ESS and ==== in our model with settlement norms.","Social scientists have expended considerable efforts to inquire how rational players can engage in conflict (Hirshleifer, 1991; Grossman, 1991; Skaperdas, 1992; Esteban and Ray, 2011) and explore the factors that cause parties to choose conflict or settlement (Fearon, 1995; Skaperdas, 2006; Beviá and Corchón, 2010). There are many factors that may cause parties to choose costly conflict in a rationalist framework (Fearon, 1995). As conflict involves destruction of resources==== that could otherwise be used for production, it is warranted to investigate the factors that incentivize settlement. Skaperdas (2006) shows that destruction associated with open conflict acts as a deterrent for fighting and an incentive for peaceful settlement.==== Humankind, however, has witnessed the wars as deadly as world wars despite the considerable cost involved. Even today, conflict abounds in society in many forms like interstate wars, civil strife, litigation, strikes, and lockouts. It suggests that the role of destruction in incentivizing settlement seems to be limited and needs to be examined more carefully. In this paper, we revisit the role of destruction in mitigating conflict. In our framework, there is also a possibility of settlement between contending parties according to some settlement norm in addition to settlement through open conflict. Particularly, we explore if parties prefer to settle peacefully with winning probabilities as the division rule under the shadow of conflict. While doing so, we adopt a decision rule that is shaped by evolutionary forces. Our analysis suggests that in an evolutionary setting, players do not always regard winning probabilities as acceptable settlement norms as they do in Nash framework. In an evolutionary setting, a player accepts winning probability as division rule only when he is more vulnerable in conflict than a threshold level of vulnerability that in turn depends upon vulnerability of the opponent and size of the population. If an adversary is less vulnerable than this threshold, he demands more share than prescribed by winning probabilities. We also investigate the role of different settlement norms when contending parties choose enforcement efforts and decide to undertake open conflict or settlement. It turns out that any norm that puts positive weights to both disagreement point and egalitarian division, mitigates the possibility of conflict just like it does in a rationalist setting (Skaperdas, 2006). With any such settlement rule, settlement possibility sets are identical under both Nash equilibrium and Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) in our model. Contrary to this, the extant literature about analysis of contests in evolutionary setting for finite population has demonstrated ESS to reduce the set of possibilities of settlement compared to the Nash equilibrium (Konrad and Morath, 2016).====Conflict is generally modeled as a contest game where adversaries make irreversible expenditures to increase their respective probabilities of winning. The majority of research in the theory of contest and conflict is based on rationalist approach and uses Nash equilibrium as a solution concept. Applications of evolutionary game theory in theoretical models of contest generally utilize the equilibrium concept called Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS).==== These applications commenced only after Schaffer (1988) had formulated generalized version of ESS for finite population, and varying size of contest. The standard conceptualization of ESS is formulated for a pairwise contest in an infinite population and generally interpreted as a refinement of Nash equilibrium. However, conflict typically involves a finite number of players, and in that case, ESS may or may not be one of the Nash equilibrium strategies (Leininger, 2003). Nash equilibrium and the standard formulation of ESS are essentially based on agents maximizing their absolute payoffs, whereas in case of the finite population ESS, agents maximize their relative payoffs giving rise to a more aggressive and spiteful behavior on the part of the agents involved (Schaffer, 1988). In case of finite population ESS, players may choose the actions that decrease their own material payoffs if that causes more reduction in material payoffs of the opponents. Leininger (2003) and Hehenkamp et al. (2004) provide two early applications in evolutionary analysis of rent-seeking contest models.==== Their findings suggest aggression and over-dissipation of rents on the part of the adversaries in rent-seeking contest games compared to Nash equilibrium behavior.====Conflict always brings a destructive cost with it in addition to the cost of acquiring enforcement efforts e.g. arms in case of war. This additional cost may reflect through several consequences of conflict like destruction of property and resources, casualties in terms of lives of fighters or activists from each side and civilians, cost of economic opportunities foregone, and post conflict problems related to migration, health and nutrition etc. of affected people from each side. This additional destructive cost can be different for different players depending on their vulnerabilities in conflict.==== Hence, in our framework of conflict, contending parties always have an option to settle peacefully and we take parties with different costs of conflict to analyze how the asymmetric costs of conflict affect the decisions of parties involved. In the latter part of the paper, we formulate the cost of conflict as a portion of contested prize that is destroyed in war. In this setting, destruction caused in conflict is kept same for both the parties to investigate the role of different settlement norms in mitigating conflict.====We find the analysis undertaken recently in Konrad and Morath (2016) to be the closest to our work. They have investigated the threshold level of share that parties accept to settle peacefully in an evolutionary setting in order to avoid the wasteful expenditure in acquiring enforcement efforts. However, we incorporate the destruction caused in fight in our model explicitly in addition to the cost incurred in acquiring arms and we explore if this destruction drives them to accept the winning probabilities as acceptable division rule in an evolutionary setting. Our model differs from their model in terms of the chronology of different events as well. In their setting, contestants acquire costly enforcement efforts only when they fight. In our model, however, contestants expend their resources in acquiring the costly enforcement efforts even before going for a negotiation. This is the result of the assumption in our model that the enforceability of contracts between parties on arming is difficult or impossible. This assumption of incomplete contracting gives rise to a special kind of peace that has been referred to as “armed peace” in literature.==== By the armed peace, one means that the peaceful settlement is under the threat of conflict and as a result of this, parties always expend their resources into acquiring enforcement efforts even in the case of negotiated settlement. This is also consistent with the usual rule of bargaining process that the player who has a higher expected payoff in the event of an open conflict- due to his higher fighting strength or lower cost of fighting (higher efficacy in fighting)- would be given a higher share of the contested prize in case of peaceful settlement, and vice versa. Hence, some fraction of productive resource always goes into appropriation. However, how much resource is devoted to appropriative activities will depend upon actual rule of division under settlement and other factors. In addition to this, we also investigate the role of different settlement norms, i.e. the rule of division under settlement, in the level of enforcement efforts that adversaries choose, and in mitigating the possibility of open fight in evolutionary setting.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2, describes the basic model of conflict in an evolutionary framework. In section 3, we describe evolutionary equilibrium in our model and investigate if the destruction associated with war- that seems to be deterrent to open conflict under usual rationalist approach- is still an effective deterrent in evolutionary setting as well. Section 4, presents the framework in presence of settlement rules and section 5 defines evolutionary equilibrium under settlement norms and compares the conditions for settlement obtained from Nash equilibrium and evolutionary equilibrium.

In so doing, we develop measures of the effectiveness and efficacy of these recruit training methods. A dividing line for choosing between the two is characterized in terms of the degree to which onsite training augments an operative’s probability of mission success. In comparing our results to data on terror-tactic lethality, one implication is that terrorist organizations are likely to consider Internet training as sufficient for any tactic that is less complex and less lethal than vehicular assaults, and will require onsite motivation and training for more complex missions such as multiple-operative mass shootings and suicide bombings.","There are different ways that a terrorist organization can reach out to motivate and train individuals to act on its behalf. By motivating and training, we mean “developing and enhancing a recruit’s psychological, technical, and physical capability in order to conduct effective terrorist operations” (Nesser, 2008). Given that Al Qaeda lost much of its infrastructure and training camps in Afghanistan, and more recently ISIS has lost strongholds in Iraq and Syria, the Internet has become a focus of concern, primarily as a means for promoting and facilitating acts of terror. In using the term ‘Internet’ we broadly include (as most commenters seem to) a whole variety of associated methods and applications, from websites to forms of social media that provide assistance and a virtual location where groups and individuals can meet and exchange information. As such, the Internet provides a platform that enables individuals to learn, gather information, and strengthen their beliefs and ties to those with similar beliefs. In addition, it can aid and facilitate the meeting of those who are similarly disposed to act violently to further their beliefs. The Internet also serves as a means to propagandize terrorist attacks as well as to reward, record, memorialize, and pay tribute to those carrying out attacks.====In their examination of the public records surrounding 223 convicted UK-based terrorists from the post-IRA era to 2014, Gill et al. (2017) found that fully 100% of those who killed others in an event had some form of online contact with a terror organization. According to their study, the Internet provides opportunities for both individuals and terrorist organizations to seek out, join and recruit, and confirm beliefs. The Internet is also used for instrumental purposes (e.g. training, reconnaissance, or disseminating propaganda). Moreover, once on the Darknet (a network constructed for the purpose of preserving the anonymity of users) individuals can use the hidden wiki (the directory of links to online router sites) to anonymously access recruitment sites for terror organizations, and download training and propaganda videos. Indeed, it has been reported that ISIS hosts a ‘help desk’ on the Darknet to assist supporters in carrying out attacks (Kremling and Parker, 2018). As the Darknet facilitates access to weaponry, technology, and instructions as to how to use them, counterterror enforcement must focus on how these inputs factor into a terrorist organization’s production function (Faria, 2014).====Much of what may be accomplished over the Internet in the service of terrorism may, in fact, be an imperfect substitute for the traditional alternative – actual onsite training and motivation of terrorist cadres. Simply put, despite recent evidence that the Internet may actually assist in the process of planning, organizing, and conducting a terrorist attack, from its inception all the way to a minute-by-minute direction of the actual attack (New York Times, 2017), it remains possible that recruits trained onsite, in physical ‘boot camps’, may be more effective than those trained through the Internet. In this paper we examine this proposition theoretically and explore some of the key issues involved.====Online recruiting is a bottom-up, rather than top-down or seek-out process whereby potential candidates self-select and identify themselves (Weimann, 2006). Due to the ease in which security agencies can infiltrate some websites, candidate recruits must be carefully vetted prior to an organization encouraging them to travel to a remote site where further indoctrination and training takes place. Subsequent to successful vetting, the following pecking order for training exists (Napolitano, 2019). First, if a candidate can emigrate to an area where onsite training is available, then this is the organization’s preferred option. Second, for recruits that cannot emigrate, the alternative is to continue with Internet training domestically. Clearly, the phenomena under study differ from that of ‘lone wolf’ terrorism because, by definition, lone wolves are not part of any terror network (Hankiss, 2018). By necessity, lone actors may learn tactics on the Internet, because they have fewer resources to turn to (Gill et al., 2017). Yet, online interaction with like-minded individuals and subsequent actions by the lone wolf cannot necessarily be construed as acting on behalf of a terrorist organization.====The paper proceeds as follows. We begin with a brief overview of the literature on the agency-theoretic approach to terrorist organizations, as well as that pertaining to the motivation and training of operatives. We then introduce a model of a terrorist organization with onsite motivation and training. This model is subsequently modified to capture the effects of Internet motivation and training. The two training alternatives are compared via a variety of measures, including the level of effort exerted by recruits in the conduct of the attack, the likelihood of success, and the costs and benefits of each method to the terrorist organization. In particular, we characterize a dividing line for choosing onsite versus Internet-based training. When compared to data on terror-tactic lethality, this dividing line suggests that tactics such as multiple-operative mass shootings, combined shootings and explosions, and suicide bombings will likely require onsite training, whereas below the line, terrorist organizations likely consider Internet training as sufficient for any tactic that is less complex and less lethal than vehicular assaults.",Terrorist training: Onsite or via the Internet?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300264,28 March 2020,2020,Research Article,197.0

To gain comparative evidence on public preferences for education spending, we conduct representative experiments with information treatments in Switzerland using identical survey techniques previously used in Germany and the United States. In Switzerland, providing information about actual spending and salary levels reduces support for increased education spending from 54 to 40 percent and for increased teacher salaries from 27 to 19 percent, respectively. The broad patterns of education policy preferences are similar across the three countries when the role of status-quo and information are taken into account.","Education policy is one of the few domains of state action that is mainly determined nationally or even regionally and has so far successfully evaded attempts of international cooperation. Implementation of international cooperation is currently limited to the higher education sector, where the Bologna Reform in 48 mostly European countries has been a step towards a common higher education area. However, coordination of policy at the compulsory education level and cooperation between countries or groups of countries on different continents or even between developed and developing countries are largely lacking. Certainly, international comparative tests of student performance (e.g., PISA), adult competencies tests (PIAAC), and teacher surveys (e.g., TALIS) have induced some implicit pressure on countries' education systems. But while the definition of basic competencies and the measurement of achievement are coordinated by organizations such as the OECD, this has in no way led to coordinated policies in the development and reform of education systems.====Although international benchmarking studies and best-practice analyses would provide insights for increased international cooperation and coordination, education policy continues to have a national character and hardly adopts impulses from abroad.==== Different arguments have been put forward to explain this lack of international cooperation and coordination. Some argue that knowledge is not transferrable from one country to another, so that any international cooperation is unnecessary from the outset. A host of examples of successful knowledge transfer around the globe puts this argument into question. A second argument is that educational systems have grown historically and reflect the fundamentally different cultures of the people living in the countries concerned. Relatedly, a third argument is that differences in citizens' policy preferences across countries make the implementation of coordinated education policies politically infeasible. This is the argument we address empirically in this paper.====Specifically, focusing on the three OECD countries Germany, Switzerland, and the United States, we test empirically whether citizens' preferences for key education policies—the level of school spending, teacher salaries, and the allocation of resources in the education production process—differ systematically across these countries. Going beyond the description of these preferences, we investigate whether randomized information provision equalizes citizens' preferences across countries.====Recent evidence on transatlantic differences in policy preferences for education by Lergetporer et al. (2018a) suggests that such preferences might be rather universal. In particular, they show that while citizens in the U.S. and Germany underestimate current spending levels, they respond quite similarly to the provision of information on education spending. However, this similarity in preferences for education spending may not generalize to other policy or cultural contexts beyond the two countries.====This paper extends the available international evidence on preferences for education policies by presenting results from a large-scale representative public opinion survey on education in Switzerland. The Swiss survey was conducted online in 2015 and interviewed a total of 6262 participants aged 18 years and older. Within the survey, we implemented three randomized experiments on how the provision of information affects support for education spending. These survey experiments were coordinated with the German and U.S. opinion surveys analyzed in Lergetporer et al. (2018a) to provide comparative evidence across the three countries.====The analysis of Swiss policy preferences adds insightful evidence on an education and political system with important similarities and differences to the German and U.S. systems. In the political system, direct democracy plays a much more important role in Switzerland than in the other two countries, with important implications for information effects on preferences across countries.==== By contrast, the federalist system with delegation of decision power to the States, Länder, and Cantons is an important feature of education policy-making in all three countries. The Swiss vocational education system is similar to the German system but not to the U.S.. Moreover, public education finance in Switzerland differs in a number of ways from public education finance in the U.S. and Germany. Among others, Switzerland has high overall spending levels (similar to the U.S. but higher than Germany) coupled with high teacher salaries (similar to Germany but higher than the U.S.). As such, it is interesting to test whether previous results found for the other two countries extend to the Swiss context.====Our results show that baseline support for increased education spending is somewhat lower in Switzerland than in Germany and the United States. In the control group that did not receive any information, 54 percent of Swiss survey participants favor increases in government funding for public schools. The first survey experiment shows, however, that informing respondents about the current level of annual public education spending per student does away with this majority and reduces support by 14 percentage points (or 26 percent relative to the control mean). The information treatment brings the level of support in Switzerland much more in line with the U.S. and Germany.====Our second survey experiment examines preferences for increases in teacher salaries. Despite relatively high teacher salaries in Switzerland compared to the other countries, 27 percent of respondents in the uninformed control group are in favor of increasing teacher salaries in the future. However, when respondents are informed about current salary levels, the share who support increases in teacher salaries falls by 8 percentage points (or about 30 percent relative to the control mean). This pattern is similar to Germany but at a much lower level than the U.S., where current teacher salary levels are also much lower.====These results are robust to a series of sensitivity checks. Findings by Lergetporer et al. (2018a) suggest that the effect of providing information on policy preferences reflects genuine effects of being better informed, rather than effects of being primed to think about monetary values. Extending this analysis, we show that the specific framing of the spending information has no impact on the estimated effects. Results are almost identical when the information treatment refers to annual, total, or relative spending. Moreover, consistent with previous work, we find little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects across population subgroups defined by gender, age, education, income, employment, and parental and minority status. This suggests that our results hold for the population at large instead of being driven by a particularly large effect for a specific subgroup.====Our third experiment examines how preferences for specific categories of education spending react to the provision of information on the tradeoffs involved when choosing among them. When asked how best to allocate additional education spending, respondents' preferences shift away from class-size reductions towards alternative spending categories—teacher salaries and new books and technology—when participants are informed about the relative costs of the different spending categories.====Overall, comparison with results for the U.S. and Germany reveals that public preferences are indeed largely similar when the role of status-quo and information are taken into account. Interestingly, the reduction in support for more education spending due to information provision is very similar in relative terms (27–29 percent) in all three countries, whereas differences in treatment effects are somewhat larger for increases in teacher salaries (28–41 percent). With information about actual spending levels, the differences across countries in the overall support for the two reform proposals become smaller, and the remaining differences are consistent with differences in current spending and salary levels across the three countries. In light of these results, our evidence provides little support for the claim that substantial cross-country differences in preferences for education policies should prevent the possibility of international policy cooperation in this area.====This paper extends the comparative study of preferences for education spending in Germany and the U.S. in Lergetporer et al. (2018a) with representative experimental evidence from Switzerland. Thereby, it contributes to several strands of the economics literature. First, it adds to the comparative political economy literature that studies cross-country differences in the public's policy preferences (e.g., Alesina and Angeletos (2005), Alesina et al. (2004); Alesina et al. (2001); Alesina et al. (2006)). While these papers focus on areas such as redistributive policies, attitudes towards the welfare state, and working hours, we advance this descriptive literature towards the domain of public preferences for education spending.====Second, we contribute to the recent experimental literature that studies the effects of information provision on policy preferences in large-scale surveys (e.g., Cruces et al. (2013) and Kuziemko et al. (2015) on preferences for redistribution, Roth et al. (2019) on the demand for government spending, Haaland and Roth (2017) on preferences for immigration policies, and Lergetporer et al. (2018b) and Lergetporer and Woessmann (2019) for preferences for education policies). Nearly all papers in this literature are single-country studies, and only a handful conduct parallel survey experiments in different countries (e.g., Grigorieff et al. (2020) on attitudes towards immigration and Bublitz (2016) and Alesina et al. (2018) on preferences for redistribution). Thus, our parallel survey experiments in three countries add to the small set of experimental cross-country studies.====More generally, our paper complements the theoretical literature on the political economy of education spending (e.g., Glomm et al. (2011)). The finding that information consistently reduces public support for education spending in the three countries we investigate suggests that downward-biased perceptions of spending levels is a rather universal phenomenon. Incorporating voters' misperceptions could therefore constitute a meaningful extension of existing political-economy models.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides institutional and theoretical background. Section 3 introduces the data and experimental design. Section 4 reports our main results concerning the effect of information provision on support for education spending and teacher salaries in Switzerland and provides a comparison with the U.S. and German results presented in Lergetporer et al. (2018a). Section 5 investigates the role of information framing by reporting evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects by the type of spending information provided. Section 6 examines the effects of highlighting the tradeoffs between different spending categories on preferences.

Our ==== strategy exploits the geographical diffusion of fiscal rules across countries. The intuition is that reforms in neighboring countries may affect the adoption of domestic reforms through peer pressure and imitational effects. We find that the mere existence of fiscal rules correlates with lower deficits, but the positive link disappears when endogeneity is correctly addressed. However, when considering the strength of rules through a continuous index of fiscal rules’ design, we show that well-designed rules have a statistically significant impact on fiscal balances. We conduct several robustness tests and show that our results are generally robust and not affected by weak instrument problems.","It is well documented that the introduction of fiscal rules is correlated with better fiscal performance (International Monetary Fund, 2009). Several empirical studies have shown that countries with fiscal rules tend to have better fiscal outcomes, including by running smaller fiscal deficits (Debrun et al., 2008; Tapsoba, 2012; Bergman et al., 2016). However, it is harder to establish causality between institutional variables and fiscal outcomes, as both could be shaped by similar factors: countries with fiscal rules may have certain observed or unobserved characteristics that foster good fiscal policy, such as a preference for fiscal prudence, whether or not a rule is in place (Poterba, 1996). In other words, countries self-select into rule’s adoption. Moreover, countries might adopt fiscal rules in periods of economic stress or crisis, or after consolidation episodes to lock-in the gains, generating reverse causality. As pointed out in a recent meta-regression analysis by Heinemann et al., (2018), the positive correlation between rule’s adoption and fiscal outcomes tends to disappear once the analysis correctly address the issue of endogeneity.====Most of the studies on fiscal rules addresses endogeneity by using generalized methods of moments (GMM) estimators or instrumental techniques involving political economy variables (see for example a recent study by Reuter, 2019). Debrun and Kumar (2007), for instance, use lagged fiscal rules and an indicator for countries with commitment to centralize budget process as instruments to study the impact of several types of fiscal rules in 25 European countries. Badinger and Reuter (2017) find a significant impact of fiscal rules that reduce deficits using checks and balance, government fragmentation, and inflation targeting as instruments in a sample of 74 countries over 1985–2012. Some recent studies adopt treatment effect techniques to address the endogeneity issues. Caselli and Wingender (2018), for example, use inverse probability weighting to study the impact of the 3 percent deficit ceiling on the entire distribution of fiscal balances in European countries. Guerguil et al. (2017) use propensity score matching to mitigate the traditional self-selection problem. Grembi and Nannicini (2016) exploit a quasi-experimental design in Italy and study the effect central fiscal rules on municipal governments.====This paper contributes to the empirical literature on the effectiveness of fiscal rules by developing a new instrumental variables strategy.==== We argue that the introduction of a fiscal rule in neighboring countries can trigger domestic reforms and in turn the adoption of a domestic fiscal rule. Building on this idea developed in the political science literature, our instrument is therefore constructed as a count variable accounting for the number of neighboring countries that adopted a fiscal rule in previous years.==== Different channels discussed in the political science literature can be at play: economic competition, learning, socialization, mimicking, and coercion (Dobbin et al., 2007; Shipan and Volden, 2008; Markoff, 1996; Weyland, 2008; Buera et al., 2011; and Giuliano et al., 2013). From an econometric point of view, the presence of rules in neighboring countries captures an exogenous source of variation in domestic rules that does not directly impact the fiscal balance. A set of weak instrument tests is performed and confirm that our instrumentation strategy is relevant. While we cannot test ==== for the exogeneity of our instrument, we discuss the channels that can invalidate our exclusion restrictions and we address potential caveats.====Our analysis yields two main results. First the effect of (any) rule on the fiscal deficit cannot be precisely estimated (that is, it is statistically insignificant) once the potential endogeneity is adequately controlled for. We address the endogeneity problem arguing that the adoption of fiscal rules in nearby countries can influence the home country’s adoption, and that changes in existing fiscal rules, i.e. in the quality of the rules, can also influence changes in the home country. Considering an index that captures a continuous measure of fiscal rule strength (Schaechter et al. 2012), our second main result is that well-designed fiscal rules do have a significant impact on the fiscal balance. Moving from a relatively weakly designed fiscal rule to a better designed fiscal rule can increase the fiscal balance by some 0.6 percent of GDP.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related literature and present our instrumental variables strategy. Section 3 presents the empirical set and the data used in the estimation. In Section 4 we discuss the results with the new instrumental variable and possible weaknesses of our empirical strategy and address those with a set of robustness exercises in Section 5. Section 6 extends the analysis to the design of fiscal rules. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.",Do fiscal rules cause better fiscal balances?

Under centralization, full information transmission is typically impossible. Under decentralization, however, the number of receivers is decisive: decentralized communication with one receiver is completely uninformative, but decentralized communication with multiple receivers can be fully informative. We analyze the extent of such fully-informative communication, and apply our results to the issue of transparency in advisory committees.","The cheap-talk model and its many variants have served as workhorse models of communication across the social sciences, from political science to linguistics, for decades.==== Austen-Smith (1992) provides an early summary of the literature in political science that includes applications to veto threats, debate and advice by committees, campaign rhetoric in elections and lobbying, to name a few. In the canonical model a ==== (e.g., a committee, a candidate, or a lobbyist) has private information that is decision relevant for a ==== (e.g., the entire legislature, the electorate, or a representative). The sender chooses a message from a set of available messages, and the receiver, who observes this message, makes a decision that determines both participants' payoffs. Communication is called cheap talk if the set of available messages does not depend on the sender's information, and if his choice of message does not directly influence payoffs. The central question in the cheap talk literature is, how much information can be credibly communicated?====One main conclusion is that, unless sender and receiver preferences are sufficiently aligned, it is not possible to credibly communicate all the information. There are two well-known exceptions: when there is one sender communicating with multiple receivers (Farrell and Gibbons, 1989), and when there are multiple senders with different preferences and perfect information about a multidimensional state, communicating with one receiver (Battaglini, 2002).==== In this paper we show that a third case exists: the combination of multiple senders with common preferences and multiple receivers with different preferences creates the opportunity for enhanced information aggregation beyond what can be achieved by the addition of either variation alone.====Our paper is focused on the possibility of information transmission from advisory committees to decision makers and, in particular, on whether or not transparency requirements can facilitate information transmission. There is a large literature examining the costs and benefits of transparency in agency relationships,==== and recent studies have demonstrated a clear cost to transparency in terms of its effect on information aggregation (Fehrler and Hughes, 2018; Gradwohl and Feddersen, 2018). Modeling the members of an advisory committee as senders we show conditions under which the addition of a second receiver with substantially different preferences than the first permits the advisory committee to transmit more information to both decision makers. In addition, whereas transparency is an impediment to information transmission in the case of a single receiver, it becomes an essential feature that permits full information revelation when there are multiple receivers. Thus, our formal analysis provides a rationale for mandated transparency in advisory committees.====To make things more concrete, suppose there are two cities, each of which must decide whether or not to build a solar power plant. If the plant is cost effective both cities prefer to build the plant, and if the plant is not cost effective they prefer not to build. However, the city managers for each city are unsure whether the plant is cost effective or not. The cities differ in their attitudes about the relative importance of each of the two possible kinds of errors. The manager for the first city is very concerned about building the plant when it is not cost effective and only wants to build it if there is at least a 75% chance that the plant is cost effective. The manager for the second city is more concerned with failing to build the plant when it is cost effective. She wants to build the plant if there is a 25% chance the plant is cost effective. The city managers do not know the probability that a plant will be cost effective, but there are several experts, each of whom has an independent assessment about the probability the plant is cost effective. Unfortunately, the experts also have preferences about whether solar power plants should be built. They prefer that cities build plants if the probability the plant is cost effective is 50% or more.====Together the experts may possess information that is sufficient to persuade both city managers to build the plant or to not build it. The question is, can the experts persuade the managers? Imagine the experts serve on an advisory committee and vote simultaneously on whether to recommend building the plant. The advisory committee uses a ==== process if each expert's vote is observable to the city managers and uses an ==== process if the committee only issues a binary recommendation, e.g., to build the plant or not. Since the committee is only advisory the results of the vote or recommendation are not binding. City managers observe the results of the committee deliberation and then update their beliefs about the probability the plant is cost effective.====In an earlier paper, Gradwohl and Feddersen (2018) showed that when there is a single decision maker (DM) whose preferences are even moderately different from the experts' a transparent process produces no useful information. For example, if the experts communicate only with the manager who has the 75% threshold for building the plant, then each expert anticipates that in the event her signal is pivotal it must be the case that many others have observed signals indicating that the plant is cost effective. Thus, she strategically disregards her own signal and always votes in favor of the plant. An opaque process, on the other hand, can produce partial information, and so is preferable to the transparent process. However, it is not first-best from the manager's perspective.====In this paper we show that the addition of a second DM with preferences sufficiently different than the first changes the result entirely, but only when the committee uses a transparent process. In our example above with two managers, consider an expert who is contemplating whether to vote in favor of building the solar plant. Since the two city managers have different preferences there are two possible pivotal events. In one pivotal event the votes of the other experts are sufficiently positive that the addition of one additional positive vote will cause the pessimistic city manager to want to build the plant. In the other pivotal event the votes of the other experts are sufficiently negative that one additional negative vote will induce even the optimistic city manager not to build the plant. Under the transparent process each expert must try to figure out which pivotal event is most likely. We show that there is an equilibrium in which the expert's positive signal is evidence that the additional positive vote will cause both managers to build the plant while a negative signal implies that an additional negative vote will cause both to not build the plant. This implies that full information revelation is an equilibrium.====In our formal analysis we provide conditions under which full-information transmission is possible, and apply this result to argue for the benefit of mandating transparency in advisory committees. In particular, we show that if the committee's information is of low quality—there are few members or their signals are not very accurate—then transparency leads to higher welfare for both the committee and the DMs. In this case, there is no need to mandate transparency, as the committee would voluntarily choose to act transparently. In contrast, if the information is of high quality, then the committee prefers opacity while the DMs prefer transparency. In this case, the DMs benefit from mandating transparency.====The mechanism underlying our result can be understood quite intuitively without reference to committees by considering a very simple interaction between an informed sender and an informed receiver. Consider first a sender who observes a good or bad signal, and must decide which of two messages to send to a receiver. The receiver observes the sender's message, obtains additional information about the realization of an event, and then decides either yes or no. To make things simple, suppose that there is only one event ==== in which the receiver might be influenced by the sender's information. If it is the case that the sender and receiver's preferences are aligned in that event then the standard result in the cheap-talk literature is that there exists an ==== in which the receiver learns the sender's information prior to making her decision.====Let's assume instead that, in the event ====, the receiver prefers to choose yes if the sender's signal is good and no otherwise. However, the sender, knowing that event ==== has occurred, prefers that the receiver choose yes regardless of his signal. In this case the cheap-talk model predicts that the sender will be unable to credibly reveal any persuasive information to the receiver. The intuition is that if there were a message the sender could send that would cause the receiver to believe he had observed the good signal (and, as a result, persuade the receiver to choose yes) then the sender would send that message even when he observes the bad signal.====Now suppose that there is a second event, ====′, in which the receiver might be influenced by the sender's information. Like event ====, in event ====′ the receiver would like to choose yes if and only if the sender's signal is good. But unlike event ====, in event ====′ the sender would always like the receiver to choose no. If, in addition, the sender's signal is sufficiently correlated with the events ==== and ====′, then the sender may prefer to truthfully report his signal. More specifically, if observing the good signal causes the sender to believe event ==== is more likely than event ====′, while observing the bad signal induces the opposite inference, then truthful reporting may be incentive compatible.====In this paper we consider an environment in which there are multiple senders with common values, each with a bit of information, and each sending a cheap-talk message to a receiver. From the point of view of each sender, the receiver observes not just that sender's message, but also an event that consists of the other senders' messages. Hence, when the receiver's preferences are known and sufficiently different from the senders', truthful revelation is not incentive compatible: If each sender truthfully reports his information, the event ==== in which his message matters is one in which he wants the receiver to make the same decision, regardless of his signal. However, when there are multiple receivers with preferences different both from the senders' and from each other, then truthful revelation may produce two different kinds of events: ones in which the senders all want to lie in one direction (====), and ones in which they want to lie in the other (====′). We show that senders' signals are sufficiently correlated with the events, leading to the possibility of truthful reporting in equilibrium.====We will compare a setting in which information is centralized, with a single sender obtaining all information, to one in which it is decentralized, with each of several senders obtaining some information. In terms of the application to advisory committees, centralized information corresponds to an opaque committee, whereas decentralized information corresponds to a transparent committee.====Under centralization, standard cheap talk analysis concludes that, regardless of the number of receivers, one of the following occurs: either no persuasive information can be credibly transmitted, or there is partial but not full information transmission.==== Which of the two possibilities is realized depends on the quality of information, as characterized by the number and accuracy of the sender's signals. Under decentralization, however, the amount of information transmitted depends on whether there is one receiver (and so one pivotal event, ====) or multiple receivers (and so multiple pivotal events, ==== and ====′). As discussed above, in the former case ==== persuasive information can be communicated in equilibrium, whereas in the latter case ==== information may be communicated. This comparison is summarized in Fig. 1, where the contribution of the current paper consists of the second column of each table.====As noted above, we apply these results to the study of transparency in advisory committees, and show conditions under which mandating transparency is beneficial. We then analyze the robustness of such beneficial transparency, and of fully-informative communication in general. We show that the result relies critically on the lack of observability of communication between each sender and the receivers. That is, if communication with the receivers is sequential rather than simultaneous, informative communication is once more unattainable.====Finally, in an extension we consider the possibility and extent of partially-informative communication when senders value the actions of one receiver significantly more than those of the other.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Immediately following is a review of the relevant literature. Section 2 describes our model of receivers, and Sections 3 Centralized information, 4 Decentralized information contain our model of and main results on centralized and decentralized senders, respectively. These are followed by Section 5 on advisory committees. The extension to partially-informative communication is in Section 6, followed by the conclusion in Section 7. Most of the proofs are deferred to the Appendix.==== This paper fits into the large literature on cheap talk (see Farrell and Rabin, 1996; Sobel, 2013, for excellent surveys). It is most closely related to a model of cheap talk in which there are multiple receivers, introduced by Farrell and Gibbons (1989), in which fully-informative communication may be possible (see also Goltsman and Pavlov, 2011). The driving force behind their possibility result, however, is distinct from that of our paper. In particular, in our model with multiple receivers fully-informative communication will not be possible unless there are also multiple senders and a transparent committee process. In effect, the multiple senders and transparent process ensure that, from the perspective of a sender, the receivers have private information. In Appendix G we formalize the distinctions between the main insight of Farrell and Gibbons (1989) and that of our paper.====Our paper is also related to the large literature on cheap talk with multiple senders. There are two strands of this literature, depending on whether the senders have identical or different preferences. The first case has been extensively studied in various contexts, including legislative politics (Gilligan and Krehbiel, 1987; Austen-Smith, 1993; Li et al., 2001), polling (Morgan and Stocken, 2008), public protests (Battaglini, 2017), expect advice and advisory committees (Wolinsky, 2002; Gradwohl and Feddersen, 2018). The main conclusion from this literature is that preference differences between the senders and the receiver lead to losses in the informativeness of communication. In Gradwohl and Feddersen (2018) (henceforth GF), for example, we show that regardless of the structure of communication between the senders and receiver, no communication is possible in equilibrium.==== The current paper builds on the model of GF, and shows that this conclusion is reversed when there are multiple receivers.====A second strand of the literature on multiple senders considers the case in which senders have different preferences. Battaglini (2002) shows that full information transmission is possible when the state space is multidimensional and the senders each have perfect information. In subsequent work, Battaglini (2004) studies imperfectly-informed senders and Ambrus and Takahashi (2008) consider a restricted state space, and both show that the possibility of fully-informative communication in those settings is limited. Meyer et al. (2019), in contrast, show that when the receiver additionally faces uncertainty about the sender's preferences, fully-informative communication is possible.====Our paper is also related to work on information aggregation in committees, (e.g. Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996; Gerardi et al., 2009; Plott and Llewellyn, 2015) and particularly to the paper of Austen-Smith and Feddersen (2006). They show that when legislators deliberate prior to voting, preference uncertainty increases their ability to reach informed decisions. Our paper expands their insight to a general cheap talk environment.====Finally, the paper fits into the large literature on the costs and benefits of transparency to decision making (e.g. Hansen et al., 2014; Fehrler and Hughes, 2018; Gradwohl and Feddersen, 2018; Paetzel et al., 2018; Shambaugh and Shen, 2018, and many others).",Decentralized advice,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300197,20 March 2020,2020,Research Article,200.0

Taking historical Rome as the archetype of a city that centralizes political power to extract resources from the rest of the country, we present evidence that urban concentration, as proxied by the limited number of cities with national soccer league titles in a country, negatively affects long-run economic development. Utilizing cross-country data from 103 countries observed over half a century (1960–2009), we show that there is a strong and robust negative relationship between concentration of economic ==== and political power across urban nodes and long-run economic outcomes, including log per capita income and average years of schooling. The explanation that best seems to fit the evidence runs from centralization of economic power to lack of inter-elite political competition across space to inferior economic outcomes in the long-run. To establish causality we use identification through heteroskedasticity, which does not rely on standard exclusion restrictions.","At its zenith around the second century A.D., Rome had become by far the largest city in the world with a population well in excess of 800,000. Roman law had, quite early on (123 B.C.), entitled each citizen to receive a certain quantity of wheat at a fixed price. By 58 B.C. a succession of amendments to the law had reduced this price to zero. By 45 B.C. no fewer than 320,000 Romans received a free daily ration of bread that varied from 1 to 1.5 kg (yielding calories that would exceed the daily needs of an average adult, see Bairoch, 1988, p. 81.) Though, it has been estimated that by this time between 30 and 40 percent of the residents of Rome were either unemployed or underemployed, “[t]he state distribution of bread never bore, and would never bear, the least resemblance to assistance. Nothing indicates that the poorest citizens were given preference;…everything points to the reverse” (Veyne (1976) cited in ibid. p. 84). Rome used its military and political might to suppress potential competitors to its rule and to extract resources from its empire. The result was that “the parasitic character of the Roman metropolis was not only responsible for a weakening of the Italian economy; it also played a central part in bringing about the disequilibrium that may later have precipitated the collapse of the empire” (Bairoch, 1988, p. 105).====The parallels between the remarkably extreme concentration of urban population and political power in the Roman Empire, and similar patterns observed in the developing countries of the modern world have led Bairoch (1988) to label such modern cities “Romes without empires”.====The primary objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the role played by urban concentration in long-run economic development. Taking historical Rome as the archetype of a city that centralizes political power to extract resources from the rest of the country, our core hypothesis is that higher urban concentration is associated with the centralization of political power, and this would, ceteris paribus, hurt economic outcomes in the long run. More specifically, urban concentration, by effectively centralizing economic and political power==== leads to “equilibrium” policies that are detrimental to economic development.====While there are likely to be several political economy mechanisms that may account for the suggested negative effects of centralization, in this paper we emphasize the “voice” mechanism elaborated by Hirschman (1970). To fix ideas, it might help to think about lobbying, the paradigmatic example of “voice” in our context. Taking as our premise the empirically well-supported observation that urban centers tend to specialize in different types of industries, it should be clear that their economic interests will be represented in the political arena by “lobbies” that support policies promoting these competing interests. For example, US steel producers, which are primarily located in Pennsylvania and Ohio, successfully lobbied President George W. Bush for the imposition of a tariff on imported steel, which took effect on March 20, 2002. However, counter-lobbying by primarily Michigan-based US automakers (as well as a ruling by the WTO) was instrumental for the lifting of the tariff on December 4, 2003. One can easily enumerate these examples by considering other types of concessions, including public investments and government expenditures. What is important for our purposes is the recognition that competition in the political arena to promote special economic interests is closely tied to geographical concentration. Thus, in this paper, we propose a specific type of political competition, which is political competition tied to certain geographies, where special interest groups are located in different urban locations. Our argument is that urban concentration would effectively mean lack of political competition across space, or conversely, a decentralized urban structure with several different powerful nodes would mean greater political competition. Thus, the claim we want to defend empirically in what follows is, just like in the case of US steel producers and automakers, that lower levels of urban concentration are associated with higher levels of politico-spatial competition, avoiding highly distortionary levels of rent seeking and extraction that would otherwise give rise to inferior economic outcomes for the country.====The connection between urban concentration and economic outcomes has a long history in the literature. In the field of development economics, starting with the seminal paper of Williamson (1965), the literature has focused on agglomeration economies as the main mechanism between urban concentration and economic development. Williamson put forward a non-monotonic relation between the two, whereby at early stages of development, high urban concentration is helpful by conserving expenditure on infrastructure and by enhancing information spillovers at a point when the economy suffers from a severe scarcity of infrastructure and information. With the development of the economy, infrastructure and information spread into the hinterland, while rising costs in congested urban areas push producers and consumers out of these erstwhile centers. This pattern of income growth is supported by a number of empirical studies (El-Shaks, 1972; Alonso, 1980; Rosen and Resnick, 1980; Wheaton and Shishido, 1981; Mutlu, 1989; Ades and Glaeser, 1995; Junius, 1999; Davis and Henderson, 2003; and Moomaw and Alwosabi, 2004). In a different approach, Henderson (2003) formulates the question as the “so what” of urban concentration, and studies the quantitative effects of both urbanization and urban concentration on productivity growth. Henderson finds evidence that there is a level of urban concentration that maximizes productivity growth and that this level depends on the development and the size of the economy. Our difference from this literature is our explicit focus on the concentration of political power that is associated with urban concentration. As such our work lies squarely in the strand of the literature that focuses on the connection between political factors and urban concentration (Henderson, 1988; Ades and Glaeser, 1995; Krugman and Elizondo, 1996; Henderson and Becker, 2000; Davis and Henderson, 2003). This literature emphasizes the favoritism of a ruling elite for a capital or central city in terms of investment, granting of loans, licenses, etc. at the expense of the hinterland, allowing the bureaucrats in the center to compete more effectively in the extraction of rents against rivals in the provinces. In our paper the political mechanism on which we focus combines the urban concentration emphasized by this latter strand of the literature with the political competition highlighted in, say, the papers by Grossman and Helpman (1994) and Mitra (1999), who show that the higher is the number of economic interest groups represented in the political arena (lobbying in their case) the smaller is the level of distortions introduced (see also Persson and Tabellini, 2000, ch. 7).====In addition to our focus on political economy mechanisms, we depart from the existing literature in another major respect: measurement of the concentration of political power. We adopt a novel measure of the distribution of titles across cities in national soccer leagues to proxy urban concentration of wealth and the consequent lack of political competition. In particular, we adopt a Herfindahl-based index of national soccer league championship distribution among different cities within a country over the period 1960–2009, named SOCCER. Normally, an ideal metric of political competition across space should measure the levels of political influence by lobbying groups located in different urban nodes. Considering some past studies in this vein, Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandopadhyay (2000), in testing the Grossman and Helpman's (1994) “Protection For Sale” model for the United States, used political contributions of different industry groups to categorize the industries that are politically organized. Similarly, in empirically testing the same model for Turkey, Mitra et al. (2002) used the membership roster of TUSIAD, an influential businessmen association, to identify the politically organized industries. However, these studies do not take into account the spatial distribution of interest group lobbying and/or political power. For our purposes, constructing analogous political contributions or businessmen association-type data for a large number of countries over time in a consistent fashion, incorporating also their spatial distribution, is extremely difficult, if not impossible. An alternative metric of politico-spatial competition would be an index that is based on parliamentary records or executive deliberations that indicate which spatial interest groups received what types of concessions (in terms of tariffs, public expenditures, or other investments). Once again, this type of data cannot be meaningfully constructed without major limitations. Taking a different avenue, one can look at the literature on urban population concentration for a measure. In that literature researchers typically adopted the urban primacy measure, which is the share of the largest metropolitan area in total population. If this share is higher than 25%, urban primacy correlated highly with other broad-based population concentration measures. In the data set that we use, average urban primacy is only 14%.==== Other alternatives to measure concentration of power in certain nodes relative to the rest of the country require more detailed data, such as the population or GDP of each state/province. The problem with these data is that for many countries they typically never add up to 1 across different jurisdictions (especially, for developing countries). Even the availability of more recent subnational GDP and income distribution measures (e.g., C-GIDD, 2014) does not help because of their short time span. Most importantly, none of these population-based measures necessarily provide a fine metric of the distribution of resources or of wealth among cities and, thus, need not correlate well with the political power they wield in the national political arena. The arguments we formulate are predicated on the use of a finer measure of urban concentration ==== within the country.====Our soccer league titles data are especially attractive for our purposes given that soccer is the world's most popular sport (as measured by spectators and the number of people playing), and in professional premier leagues teams competing for title have traditionally been associated with urban centers, each city worth its salt being represented by at least one team in the league. Successful teams in these leagues are the ones that can hire the best talent, a feat which requires command over relatively large resources that need to be raised from businessmen, fans, supporters, merchandise sales and broadcast revenues. Typically most of these sources are local. Even when there is revenue sharing among teams in the league, studies have found that this does not have a statistically significant effect on the survival probabilities of the teams. Thus, a study of several European leagues, where broadcast revenue sharing is more significant than in other countries, concludes that “…as long as teams are located in ====, cross-subsidization of weak-drawing teams neither provides profit incentives for team owners nor does it promote the survival of weak-drawing clubs. The traditional soccer team financing strategy, the so-called Spectators-Subsidies-Sponsors-Local model, remains by far the dominant one despite attempts by teams to switch to what is called a Media-Magnates-Merchandising-Markets-Global structure. As Frick and Prinz (2004) shows, success and the availability of local resources are highly correlated (see also Dobson and Goddard, 2001). It, therefore, appears to be safe to conclude that teams that credibly contest championships are the ones located in cities which command relatively more resources. One could then exploit the correspondence between soccer champions and the relative economic importance of the cities which these teams represent to tease out the geographical distribution of wealth and consequent politico-spatial competition within a given country.====At this point, it is instructive to mention what soccer league titles data do ==== measure. First, as already indicated, SOCCER is somewhat correlated with urban primacy, but we find strong evidence that it outperforms empirically its population-based alternatives, including urban population primacy and Zipf's coefficient of population distribution, thus throwing empirical support for our notion that its domain is sufficiently distinct from population concentration. Second, SOCCER is not simply another measure of institutions or institutional quality within a country. Specifically, we present evidence that SOCCER is different than democracy, constraints on the executive, or political party competition. Once again, SOCCER has non-zero correlations with these variables, but we find strong empirical evidence which indicates that it is a specific type of political competition indicator and its realm relates distinctly to politico-spatial competition (or, rather, its lack). Third, SOCCER does not measure media-based political influence; we show that SOCCER is correlated with newspapers' headquarters concentration, but the latter is primarily driven by education and schooling in a country. Fourth, we present several evidence that SOCCER is not primarily driven by sports interest, competing sports branches, or length of its existence in a country.====It turns out that empirically the league titles data capture the voice mechanism remarkably well. Utilizing cross-country data from 103 countries observed over half a century (1960–2009) and controlling for the selection problem in which soccer may have been introduced in a country in a non-random way, we show that there is a strong and robust negative relationship between SOCCER and economic development outcomes in the long-run. Our long-run development measures are log per capita income in 2009 and average years of schooling in 2010. Moreover, consistent with our conjectured theoretical mechanism, we present strong evidence that SOCCER is associated with greater average share of trade taxes in total revenue as well as higher average ad valorem manufacturing tariff rates in a country during 1960–2009. By contrast, the relationship between urban concentration as measured by soccer league titles data and agricultural tariff rates is insignificant. These findings are consistent with the detrimental effects of distortionary lobbying undertaken by particular urban nodes at the expense of the rest of the country. Taken together, the explanation that best seems to fit all this evidence runs from centralization of economic power to lack of political competition across space to inferior economic outcomes in the long-run.====The next part of the empirical analysis follows an identification strategy that goes beyond correlations. We exploit heteroskedastic residuals in the first-stage regression of soccer league titles to obtain an exogenous shift in this variable. The major appeal of this approach (i.e., identification through heteroskedasticity a la Lewbel (2012)), is that identification is immune to the standard exclusions restrictions problem. In this context, terrain ruggedness, a variable with several economic and historical connotations, drives, quite intuitively, the non-spherical distribution of errors in the first-stage. In other words, we find that the variance of the residuals from a regression of geographical concentration on terrain ruggedness is higher in lower levels of ruggedness and lower in higher levels of ruggedness. Thus, our estimates go beyond correlations to the extent that exogenous variations in terrain ruggedness affect settlement dispersion across a country's territories, such that the variation of soccer league title outcomes tend to be higher in lower levels of ruggedness and vice versa. Our estimates are also economically meaningful. They suggest that countries with the highest vs the lowest scores of concentration (e.g., Paraguay vs Germany) feature about six years of difference in their average years of schooling in 2010, and about six percentage point higher average manufacturing tariff rates over 1960–2009. This outcome is anticipated if a handful of urban nodes claim a high stake in national resources at the expense of the rest of the country. Finally, we provide further supportive evidence for deleterious consequences of the concentration of urban political power: soccer league titles held by capital cities, which are the centers of decision-making and lobbying, exert significant negative effects on long-run economic outcomes.====We then undertake numerous robustness checks. The robust negative effect of soccer league titles goes through even when we control for population-based geographical concentration measures. It is also maintained when we account for other possible omitted variables related to geographic concentration of wealth and economic power, such as agglomeration economies, or urbanization. Overall, we find robust empirical support for the hypothesis that a lower degree of urban concentration is highly positively correlated with long-run development.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background of the question, the related literature, and elaborates on the mechanisms involved. In section 3 we describe our empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the sensitivity analysis. Section 5 includes some short case studies while Section 6 concludes.","Romes without empires: Urban concentration, political competition, and economic development",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300185,15 March 2020,2020,Research Article,201.0

However, while several studies have concentrated on the difference between democracies and autocracies in this respect, an important topic overlooked so far is the differences between varieties of authoritarian regimes. This study uses the political variation across sub-national regions of the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin to understand how differences in the extent of elite fragmentation in autocracies affects the influence of resource abundance on economic growth in the short run. We find that polities with fragmented elites underperform those with consolidated elites and link this effect to higher costs of fights over rents due to higher political uncertainty.","The effects of natural resource abundance on economic performance are strikingly different across the world. The literature frequently conceptualizes resource abundance as a ‘resource curse’ (Sachs and Warner, 2001), yet a growing body of research questions the existence of the negative effect of resource endowment on growth or argues that the effect of resource endowment differs depending on the characteristics of a polity (Rosser, 2006; Van der Ploeg, 2011; Havranek et al., 2016; Badeeb et al., 2017), particularly political regimes (Robinson et al., 2006). This paper investigates how political regimes condition the effect of a resource price shock on economic growth. Our focus is the short-term growth effects of changes in resource revenue flows and the role of political regimes in this context.====Whereas previous studies have focused on the differences between democracies and autocracies, this paper aims to unpack the differences between distinct varieties of authoritarian regimes. The general label ‘authoritarianism’ hides substantial variation in the political organization, power reproduction mechanisms, and hence, policy outcomes observed in individual countries (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2005; Besley and Kudamatsu, 2008; Wright, 2008; Mattes and Rodriguez, 2014; Pepinsky, 2014). We examine how different types of autocracies influence the growth effects of natural resources (Eifert et al., 2002), focusing on the level of elite consolidation vs. fragmentation.====To investigate this topic, we use subnational data from the Russian Federation for the period 2004–2009. Subnational data offers several important advantages, most notably, reducing unobserved heterogeneity and allowing for a more detailed investigation of underlying mechanisms (Snyder, 2001; Van der Ploeg and Poelhekke, 2017; Pepinsky, 2019).==== Russia, as we show in what follows, comprises individual regions that have developed distinct political regimes with different levels of elite consolidation or fragmentation. We concentrate on ==== in the various regions of Russia, which is a crucial source of rents for the Russian economy in general and for several of its regions in particular.====The paper finds that larger resource revenue negatively impacts short-term growth in regions of Russia if one controls for region fixed effects. This finding is consistent with some arguments in the resource curse literature. More importantly, we find that the negative effect of resource revenue is stronger in authoritarian regimes with fragmented elites. We explain this by the lower predictability of regional politics, spurring wasteful competition for rents among elite factions. Thus, our contribution to the extant literature is twofold. First, we expand the understanding of how political regimes condition the growth effect of natural resources, suggesting that the variety of authoritarian regimes requires consideration. Second, we provide yet another piece of evidence that variation in both resource endowments and institutions at the subnational level must be examined to explain economic growth (Boutilier, 2017).","Varieties of authoritarianism matter: Elite fragmentation, natural resources and economic growth",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300173,5 March 2020,2020,Research Article,202.0

General government data includes, however, the state and local level. Using new data for general and central government over the period 1995–2016, I reexamine political cycles in budget composition. The results suggest that, both at the general and central government level, leftwing governments spent more on education and less on public services than rightwing governments. Defense expenditure was somewhat lower under leftwing than rightwing governments and in election years; especially in federal states. Effects of government ideology on the individual expenditure categories are larger at the central than general government level. Scholars need to re-examine results on ideology-induced effects that have been derived from general government data where central government data should have been used.","Electoral motives and government ideology may influence budget composition. Election-motivated politicians are more likely to increase expenditure that is visible to voters in the short-run like social spending than invisible forms of spending like infrastructure investment. Leftwing governments are expected to increase spending on income redistribution (social transfers) to a larger extent than spending on public goods like public safety and order. Since the 2000s, scholars have used data on different types of public expenditure such as the OECD’s Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) to examine political cycles in budget composition (Potrafke, 2006, 2011a; Enkelmann and Leibrecht, 2013; Castro, 2017; Castro and Martins, 2018; Bojar, 2019).==== The empirical evidence is mixed – I return to these studies in section 2.====The OECD data on budget composition was only available for general government, which includes national, state and local government expenditure. Castro and Martins (2018: 45) describe: “Ideally, as De Haan et al. (1999) argue, we are better off using data for the Central Government as it relates to those expenditures that are directly controlled by government ministers. However, as far as we are concerned there is no data by functions available for the Central Government”. The shortcoming of previous studies is that general government expenditure includes expenditure determined by state and local governments, but the electoral motives and government ideology relate to national government.==== It is very well possible that previous studies reported the effects of national governments’ electoral motives and ideology on budget components that the national governments do not influence.====The OECD now provides new data on general and central budget composition. I use this new data to re-examine political cycles in budget composition in OECD countries. Using more “noisy” data (general instead of central government data) is likely to give rise to biased estimates of political-economic variables such as government ideology. For example, the true effects of national government ideology on central governments’ budget composition may be larger than previous studies suggested when state and local government expenditure was not influenced by government ideology. The true effects of national government ideology on central governments’ budget composition may be smaller than previous studies suggested when politically aligned state and local governments were responsible for ideology-induced effects on general governments’ budget composition. I employ the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) estimator (Zellner, 1962) which considers that expenditure in the individual categories of both general and central government are likely to be correlated. I investigate whether the coefficient estimates of the government ideology and election year variable differ between general and central government for every individual expenditure category. The results suggest that, both at the general and central government level, leftwing governments spent more on education and less on public services than rightwing governments. Defense expenditure was somewhat lower under leftwing than rightwing governments and in election years; especially in federal states. Effects of government ideology on the individual expenditure categories are larger at the central than general government level.

I exploit the success of “Civic Lists” in Italian municipalities and use them as a comparison group for party-affiliated politicians, to test whether national parties affect fiscal discipline. Using a ==== (RDD), I show that party-affiliated mayors are more fiscally responsible: they run lower deficits, accumulate less debt and reduce expenditures. The effect is significant only for municipalities not constrained by fiscal rules. This suggests that national parties act as a substitute for fiscal rules in constraining politicians. Besides, I provide evidence that the discipline of party-affiliated politicians is linked to better career prospects: party-affiliated mayors have a higher probability of being re-elected and better chances of being promoted to higher levels of government. Alternative stories find less support in the data.","In recent years many countries have seen a decline in the popularity of national political parties, which are perceived as distant from the needs of voters. This decline in popularity is particularly evident in local politics, with the emergence of independent local political organizations without links to national parties, which are now able to compete and to nominate candidates. Examples of independent local politicians can be found in both developed countries (e.g. Germany, as described by Koethenbuerger, 2012) and developing countries (e.g. Peru, as described by Aragon et al., 2019), and the success of these local political organizations can be particularly strong in countries where the value of national parties’ brand has been negatively hit by corruption scandals (Daniele et al., 2018).====The success of these independent organizations raises questions about the importance and the role of national political parties. In regards to this, the main argument that can be found in the literature (Riker, 1964; Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya, 2007; Persson and Zhuravskaya, 2016; Ponce-Rodriguez et al., 2018) is that national parties can discipline politicians by affecting their career prospects. However - despite the importance of this topic - only a few studies (Koethenbuerger, 2012; Folke, 2014; Aragon et al., 2019) have tried to compare the behavior of party-affiliated politicians with that of independents, as a test for the disciplining role of national parties. The general evidence from this literature, which is mainly focused on fiscal policies, is that party-affiliated politicians do not behave differently from independent ones, raising doubts about the ability of national parties to discipline politicians. However, some of these studies (Koethenbuerger, 2012; Folke, 2014) are more focused on the behavior of local councilors, whose limited power, if compared to local governments, may explain the lack of difference between party-affiliated politicians and independents. Also, as in the case of Aragon et al. (2019), local governments are very often subject to fiscal rules that constrain their capacity to collect taxes and incur debt.====In this paper, I take advantage of the success of Italian local independent movements (“Civic Lists”) which, after a huge corruption scandal (“Clean Hands”) negatively hit the national parties system (Daniele et al., 2018) in the period 1992–1994, and after the introduction of the direct election of the mayor in 1993, have been able to elect a vast number of mayors completely independent of national parties. As we can see in Fig. 1, the percentage of mayors affiliated to national political parties has declined significantly in recent years in Italian municipalities.==== This offers an interesting framework that can be used to test whether national political parties can discipline politicians by affecting their career concerns. I also exploit the fact that, from 2001, Italian municipalities below 5000 inhabitants were not subject to fiscal rules, which have been effective in limiting the capacity of municipal governments to run deficits and accumulate debt (Grembi et al., 2016).====The focus is on municipal budget outcomes, with special attention to fiscal discipline, which represents a local outcome with national relevance, given that fiscally undisciplined local governments generate negative externalities for the rest of the country. This is typically the case in decentralized countries in which local governments, largely financed through grants from higher levels of government, may not entirely internalize the cost of spending, with clear incentives for over-spending.==== Thus, given the lack of incentives from national parties, we should expect independent mayors to be less fiscally responsible, as their interests may not be aligned with national interests. On the other hand, national parties may have an important role in disciplining local politicians, aligning local and national interests.====The main measure of fiscal discipline used in this paper is the average deficit run by the mayor, divided by total average municipal revenues (i.e. deficit as a fraction of total revenues available). As a second measure, I use the accumulated debt over the term, which is equal to the sum of yearly deficits/surpluses over the five years of the term, as a fraction of total average revenues. To solve endogeneity issues and to isolate the causal effect of national parties on budget outcomes, I employ a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), which compares municipalities in which mayors affiliated to national parties barely won with municipalities where they barely lost. The dataset is composed of mixed electoral competitions between party-affiliated and independent mayors for the Italian municipalities with a population below 15,000 inhabitants==== and electoral mandates between 2000 and 2012.====The main results show that party-affiliated mayors are more fiscally responsible. In particular, on average party-affiliated mayors run deficits as a fraction of total revenues which are between 1.1 and 1.7% points lower, compared to those of independents. The effect is substantial from an economic point of view and it is comparable to the effect of fiscal rules estimated by Grembi et al. (2016) for Italian municipalities. Party-affiliated mayors also tend to accumulate less debt during the entire legislative term compared to independents, with a relative reduction of debt as a fraction of total revenues of around 8.5% points. The lower deficits of party-affiliated mayors are obtained by reducing capital expenditures by approximately 21%, while local taxes are reduced by approximately 8%. These results suggest that party-affiliated mayors reduce deficits and accumulate less debt by cutting expenditures more than taxes.====A series of heterogeneity mechanisms are then analyzed to understand which are the channels driving the main results. First, I show that the effect on the deficit is statistically significant only for municipalities below 5000 inhabitants, which since 2001 are not subject to fiscal rules (Grembi et al., 2016). These rules, launched in 1999 under the name “Domestic Stability Pact” (DSP), were introduced by the Italian government to impose limits on municipal debts and deficits. The central government removed the rules in 2001 for municipalities with less than 5000 inhabitants.==== The results show that party-affiliated mayors reduce the deficit by around 1.5% points in the municipalities that are exempt from the fiscal rules, while the effect is not statistically different from zero for municipalities above the 5000 threshold. This suggests that national parties are a substitute in constraining local politicians where fiscal rules do not apply.====Then, I provide empirical evidence that political parties can discipline politicians by affecting their career concerns (Riker, 1964; Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya, 2007; Ponce-Rodriguez et al., 2018). More in detail, I show that party-affiliated mayors have a higher probability of being re-elected for a second term and of being promoted to higher levels of government. I also show that these differences in career perspectives can be connected to the differences in fiscal discipline. Specifically, I show that national political parties can discipline local politicians by affecting their career prospects in two ways. First, exploiting the fact that in Italy a mayor can be elected only for two consecutive terms (De Benedetto and De Paola, 2018), I show that the effect of national parties on the deficit is statistically significant only for mayors who can be re-elected for a second term. I also demonstrate that when independents run higher deficits, this occurs when they have won a second term. This evidence indicates that the higher deficits run by independent mayors are due to re-election incentives, and it is consistent with the literature that connects deficits to re-election incentives (see Aghion and Bolton, 1990) or to politicians’ pandering to voters (see Maskin and Tirole, 2004). Besides, this evidence, in connection with the result that party-affiliated mayors have higher probabilities of re-election, suggests that party-affiliated mayors run lower deficits because they have an electoral advantage, represented by the financial and non-financial support from the national party, which can be used to win municipal elections.====Second, I show that, among the mayors promoted to higher levels of government, there are no differences in terms of fiscal discipline between party-affiliated and independent first citizens, and that even independent mayors reduce the deficit if they have higher chances of being promoted. This evidence suggests that national parties use politicians’ aspirations for promotion as a disciplining tool, which can affect both party-affiliated and independent mayors. The intuition is that, while independent politicians can run at municipal level on their own, they must go through national political parties if they want to be promoted to higher levels of government. Thus, all the mayors who want to be promoted must keep the deficit low, even independent ones. Besides, this evidence, in connection with the fact that party-affiliated mayors have a higher probability of being promoted to higher levels of government, provides a further explanation of why party-affiliated mayors run lower deficits, compared to independent ones.====Finally, I also provide empirical evidence that seems to exclude that the main results are driven by other potential alternative mechanisms: 1) I show that the results are driven neither by the political orientation of the national parties (Pettersson-Lidbom, 2010; Ferreira and Gyourko, 2009) nor by their alignment with the central government (Brollo and Nannicini, 2012; Bracco et al., 2015); 2) I demonstrate that the main results of this paper are not driven by the presence of Mafia-style criminal organizations (Acconcia et al., 2014; Galletta, 2017; Di Cataldo and Mastrorocco, 2019); 3) I exclude that the main results are driven by different levels of unobserved political ability between party-affiliated and independent mayors (Ferraz and Finan, 2011); 4) I provide evidence that unions of municipalities do not represent a confounding factors for my estimates.====This study contributes to two main lines of research. First, it is related to the literature on the role of national parties at the local level and how these can discipline local politicians by affecting their career perspectives (Riker, 1964; Eslava, 2011; Primo and Snyder, 2010; Persson and Zhuravskaya, 2016; Ponce-Rodriguez et al., 2018). In this literature, recent papers have analyzed the differences in terms of fiscal policies between party-affiliated and independent local politicians. The general evidence from this literature is that there are no differences in terms of fiscal policies, and specifically in terms of fiscal discipline. However, as already explained above, this can be explained by the role of fiscal rules (Galindo-Silva, 2015; Aragon et al., 2019), which constraint different types of politicians to behave in similar ways, or by the fact that some studies have analyzed the behavior of local councilors rather than the behavior of local governments (Koethenbuerger, 2012; Folke, 2014). This paper contributes to this literature by showing that, where fiscal rules do not apply, municipal governments manged by party-affiliated mayors are more fiscally disciplined than municipal governments led by independent mayors. It also shows that this different behavior in terms of fiscal discipline can be connected to differences in terms of career perspectives.====Second, this paper, providing evidence that national political parties may have an important role in reducing the deficits run by local governments, contributes also to the literature on the political economy of fiscal deficits (Alesina and Perotti, 1999; Neyapti, 2010; Eslava, 2011; Oto-Peralías et al., 2013; Alesina and Passalacqua, 2015).",Do national political parties matter?

In this lobbying game, industrial interests are opposed by an environmental interest group. We compare political outcomes under two institutional arrangements. In the first, firms must join an organization that represents the interests of the ====. In the second, firms would lobby the government individually. The two arrangements result in strikingly different equilibrium outcomes. Only a small fraction of firms join the lobby group under collective lobbying, but all firms participate in lobbying activities when there is no such group. Thus, an attempt by firms to solve the apparent collective action problem through coordination would effectively backfire. The reason is that coordination among firms would increase the leverage available to the government, to demand high political contributions. We also evaluate the desirability of the two lobbying regimes from the private perspective of individual firms, and from the perspective of society as a whole. This permits us to evaluate possible restrictions on lobbying activities.","Lobbying is considered to be an increasingly important part of a policy-making process in modern democracies.==== In particular, industrial interests lobby against stringent environmental regulations. Delmas et al. (2016) estimate that, in the U.S., major fossil-fuel producers (e.g., ExxonMobil and Chevron), industrial goods manufactures (e.g., General Electric) and some utility firms (e.g., PG&E), each spent $20–30 million dollars lobbying against climate change legislation around 2008–2009. Industrial interests are often represented by consortiums of firms, including trade associations (e.g., American Iron and Steel Institute) and peak business associations (e.g., National Association of Manufacturers). For instance, in 2008 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent more than $60 million on climate change lobbying (Delmas et al., 2016).====The political influence of “special interest groups” (or SIGs) through lobby contributions is usually modeled as “menu-auctions” in the recent political economics literature, following the seminal works of Bernheim and Whinston (1986) and Grossman and Helpman (1994). A menu-auction model of lobbying activities is based on the idea that lobby contributions buy influence in policy-making processes.==== Since its adoption by Fredriksson (1997) and Aidt (1998), this “common agency” approach has steadily gained in popularity in the field of environmental economics as well. For instance, it has been used to analyze the interaction between international trade and environmental policies (Eliste and Fredriksson, 2002; and Lai, 2007), and the influence of domestic lobbying on international environmental agreements (Habla and Winkler, 2013; and Marchiori et al., 2017).====In most models that utilize the common agency framework, the organizational aspects of respective lobbyists are taken for granted. Little attention has been paid to how lobby groups are originally formed. In his early survey of the literature, Persson (1998) describes the assumption of exogenous lobby groups as a crucial and difficult question to which there is no satisfactory answer. In his more recent survey, van Winden (2008) considers it a strong assumption of existing common agency models to suppose that “interest groups are exogenously given, of fixed size and are assumed to behave as unitary actors.” Indeed, it is quite probable that different institutional settings induce very different forms of lobbying organizations, which in turn lead to varied efficiency implications and distributional impacts.====Since Persson (1998), there have been several papers that address the issue of endogenous formation of lobby groups, based on the common agency model. The main strand of work focuses on a fixed cost which must be incurred by economic entities when they choose to participate (Mitra, 1999; Damania and Fredriksson, 2003; and Laussel, 2006).==== These studies reveal how the characteristics of the fixed cost impacts on lobby formation and the resulting political equilibrium. They also clarify the conditions required for uniqueness of equilibrium in a lobby formation game.====In contrast with this previous work, our main interest is in the way that lobbying activities are actually conducted and its organizational implications, not only in the participation decision of a potential lobby group ====. Damania and Fredriksson (2000) treat the formation of a lobby group as equivalent to each firm independently offering the government a political contribution schedule.==== This situation is considered in this paper to be the case of “individual lobbying.” Under individual lobbying, each decision-maker can decide whether or not to conduct lobbying activities, and also how it would lobby if it enters the lobbying game.====In addition, we also analyze a different case where firms coordinate their lobbying activities before they begin. We refer to this as “collective lobbying.” As is described above, consortiums of business entities often have a powerful lobbying presence on environmental issues, as in other areas of economic and societal policy. Under collective lobbying, those who share the same interest first organize a unified lobby group to conduct their lobbying activities.====One reason for collective lobbying could be explicit or implicit institutional restrictions on the lobby formation, such as a minimum size requirement for being qualified as a lobbyist. We explore the impacts of this type of institutional restriction on social welfare, as well as on other outcomes such as a lobby participation and the resulting payoff for each firm. A restriction on the minimum size and, consequently on the number of lobbyists, might be socially desirable when there are significant transaction costs involved in each lobbying process. In addition, affected parties may also benefit from such a restriction if they can take advantage of scale economies in organizing an interest group and conducting lobbying activities through sharing resources. However, while transaction costs and scale economies could be important for lobby formation incentives, we suppose that potential lobbyists do not take these benefits into account, so as to focus on the effects of different lobbying environments on the organizational aspects of lobbying activities.====In summary, as opposed to the existing literature, we compare the two distinct institutional environments for lobby organization; collective and individual lobbying. Our main research questions are as follows. If there are multiple entities with common interests, how will lobbying activities be conducted? Would they be better off lobbying together or independently? What are the implications for social welfare?====The difference in lobbying regimes produces strikingly different equilibrium properties. While only a small fraction of firms engage in lobbying activities under the collective lobbying regime, all firms choose to lobby in the unique equilibrium under individual lobbying. As for the collective lobbying regime, we find that the equilibrium outcome is unanimously less preferred by all firms to the outcome where all of them collectively engage in lobbying. This result is related to the classic observation made by Olson (1965) that, when interests are shared, rational actors should prefer to free-ride and let others pay the cost of goods that will benefit everyone. In our model, this collective action problem cannot be solved by an opportunity to join a collective lobbying organization that would act in the joint interest of member firms.====In contrast, in the unique equilibrium under the individual lobbying regime every firm voluntarily chooses to lobby for a policy which benefits not just itself but all those with an interest in a laxer environmental regulation. Rather paradoxically, seemingly “coordinated” mutually-beneficial actions by lobbyists take place only when the group formation process is not pre-coordinated. If lobby formation is more loosely organized, the industry can achieve a better result for each one of its members.====From the social welfare perspective, a restriction that an individual firm has no political access to the policymaker can be desirable, although it would be harmful to each individual firm. If such a restriction is imposed, however, certain types of social interests might be significantly underrepresented. This possibility should be taken into account in designing a legal structure governing lobby formation.====The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we set up a simple model of an environmental policy-making under lobbying activities, focusing on the two distinct institutional environments for lobby formation. In the following section, we derive and compare the political equilibrium outcomes under the different cases, and discuss the implications for possible institutional designs. The final section concludes the paper.",Collective vs. individual lobbying,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300070,18 February 2020,2020,Research Article,205.0

There are several reasons to expect such an interaction effect. On the one hand, studies have shown that weak property rights discourage entrepreneurs from reinvesting their profits, even when they own the collateral required to obtain external finance (e.g., Johnson et al., 2002). Hence, to the extent that corruption weakens the enforcement of property rights (Acemoglu and Verdier, 1998), it is plausible to expect that corruption dilutes the growth-promoting effects of financial development. Moreover, corruption in the financial system may redirect credit to unproductive or even wasteful projects (Ghirmay, 2004; Arcand et al., 2015), thereby attenuating the positive impact of financial development on economic growth. On the other hand, a potentially positive interaction between financial development and corruption in their effects on economic growth has been suggested by Ahlin and Pang (2008). Modelling corruption as the size of the bribe that firms have to pay, and assuming that the bribe should be paid in advance (or the timing of the bribe payments is unknown), Ahlin and Pang (2008) show that corruption raises the firm's need for liquidity. As a result, financial development could exert a stronger impact when the level of corruption is high and corruption becomes more detrimental to firm growth in a less developed financial system. For these reasons, the net effect of the interaction between financial development and corruption remains to be an empirical question.====The only study that we are aware of that provides firm-level evidence on the joint effects of corruption and financial development on economic development is that of Wang and You (2012). Using data on Chinese firms, Wang and You (2012) document that both corruption and financial development enhance the growth of firms. Moreover, they find that financial development and corruption are substitutes in their growth-promoting effects, i.e., the marginal effect of financial development is high when the level of corruption is low, and vice versa. These results are in contrast to the cross-country evidence documented in Ahlin and Pang (2008). Wang and You (2012) also underscore that the observed positive effect of corruption on firm growth is not consistent with worldwide evidence. It is rather a typical character of the “East Asian paradox” where rapid economic growth is recorded in the midst of flourishing corruption cultures. Therefore, it remains unclear if the results in Wang and You (2012) on the joint effects of finance and corruption on firm growth are specific to Chinese firms, or if they represent a worldwide phenomenon. In particular, are financial development and corruption substitutes in their effects on firm growth even in countries where corruption is detrimental to firm growth? In this paper, we aim to fill this gap in the literature by examining the joint effects of financial development and corruption on firm growth in Vietnam—a country for which studies have consistently documented the negative repercussions of corruption on firm growth (e.g., Tromme, 2016).====Three main reasons make Vietnam an interesting country for conducting such a micro-level study. First, as an emerging economy, Vietnam has exhibited rapid growth both in the real and financial sectors during the last three decades. In the 2000s, the GDP per capita increased at an average rate of 6.4 percent a year, which was among the fastest in the world (World Bank, 2016). Moreover, despite the uncertainties in the global economy, such as financial crises, Vietnam has kept growing at a rate of more than 6 percent over the past decades and transformed itself from one of the poorest economies to a lower middle-income economy. Similarly, the financial sector has grown steadily since the government launched the renovation policy in the 1980s. Currently, the financial system is considered to be large for a lower middle-income country with total assets of nearly 200 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 (World Bank, 2014).==== Second, despite these achievements, the Vietnamese economy continues to be challenged by widespread corruption in all levels of the administrative structure. For instance, according to the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index for the period 2009–2013, Vietnam was ranked between 112nd (in 2011) and 123rd (in 2012) out of 168 countries. The Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI) from 2009 to 2013 indicates that petty corruption has become less frequent but macro corruption has worsened.==== Third, while existing empirical studies on Vietnamese firms (e.g., O'Toole and Newman, 2017; Anwar and Nguyen, 2011; Rand and Tarp, 2012; Nguyen and Van Dijk, 2012) examine the finance-growth and corruption-growth relationships separately, none of them has considered the joint impacts of these factors on firm growth.====We employ a large firm-level panel dataset from the Vietnam Enterprise Survey covering more than 40,000 firms from 2009 to 2013. Our main empirical strategy to identify the causal impacts of financial development and corruption on firm growth is the heteroskedasticity-based identification of Lewbel (2012). We find that province-level financial development has significantly positive effects on firm growth in terms of the growth rates of sales, investment and sales per worker. On the contrary, corruption affects firm growth negatively. Most notably, financial development and corruption interact negatively in affecting firm growth: While corruption weakens the growth-promoting effect of financial development, financial development exacerbates the growth-retarding effect of corruption. Our results on the substitution relationship==== between financial development and corruption on firm growth corroborate the firm-level evidence in Wang and You (2012) despite the fact that our results are obtained for a country where corruption impedes firm growth.====In Section 2, we briefly review studies on the finance-growth relationship, on the corruption-growth nexus and on the joint effect of financial development and corruption on economic growth. We provide descriptive statistics of the data in Section 3, and outline the estimation methodology in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the empirical results and provide robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.

We analyze these “golden-passport” programs as a study in the political economy of conflict and cooperation in an international meta-club. Seen through the lens of club goods theory, the EU is a club of nations, each of which can be interpreted as itself a club. Each single nation reserves the right to govern the admission of new individual members into its own club, and new members automatically benefit from the EU wide meta-club good. We characterize the unique equilibrium when individual clubs that may differ in membership size are free to choose the terms on which they admit members, and evaluate it from the point of view of the wellbeing of the set of clubs as a whole. We identify club size and benefits as well as differences in cost externalities as the key determinants. We also consider how the set of clubs as a whole can respond to the economic inefficiency problems such a situation creates.","In the European Union (EU), Member States have the sovereign right to decide whether or not to grant citizenship to anyone they choose. Several of the current member states make special use of this freedom. They operate “golden passport” programs that enable wealthy investors from outside the EU to acquire citizenship of a member state. In exchange for a golden passport, they charge fees that increase the revenue to the government budget and/or request large financial investments that benefit the national economy more generally. The amounts for a single citizenship==== and the aggregate amounts==== are substantial. Unlike comparable programs for countries outside the European Union, as a further effect of the golden passport for a member country these wealthy new citizens also acquire citizenship of the European Union (Article 20, ====). They benefit from the services provided by the EU to all citizens of the Union. And given the EU principle of freedom of movement, they can freely choose their place of residence within the EU. This additional benefit is at the center of the interest in our analysis.====The selling of citizenship or permanent residency raises political economy issues of conflict and cooperation at the European level and has given rise to discussions and controversies between the central EU government level in Brussels and the individual member states. There seemingly is political opposition to selling ‘golden passports’, and the opposition is becoming stronger as the size of this activity increases (and with that its salience). Voter dissatisfaction following the mass migration in Europe in 2015 has been discussed, for instance, by Hillman and Long (2018). Selling passports to very rich foreigners might also generate political opposition, for several possible reasons. One source of this might be ideological opposition based on fairness considerations. Less wealthy citizens of the country concerned might think that selling what is given to native citizens as their birth right is inappropriate or unfair. Some might think that attaching a monetary value and tradeability to citizenship might debase it. The possibility of buying citizenship may depreciate an immaterial value attributed to it by the native population, much like the concept of aristocracy by inheritance might be threatened by the sale of aristocratic titles through adoption and it might weaken or water down the valuable norms of allegiance among regular citizens.==== Furthermore, a cost can emerge if the demand for ‘golden passports’ is motivated by considerations of tax evasion and money laudering. Selling of ‘golden passports’ might then affect the international perceptions and stereotypes about the country and reduce the value of what is sometimes called the ‘national brand’.====Empirically, the political opposition is documented in a report published in 2019 by the European Commission (2019). It describes the European discussion process, the critical assessment by the European Parliament of the member states' procedures for selling and issuing citizenship and the commercialization of citizenship by individual states. The same report (p. 10) points to possible dangers (“…in particular, risks to security, including the possibility of infiltration of non-EU organized crime groups, as well as risks of money laundering, corruption and tax evasion.”) and discusses these concerns in more detail.==== In view of these considerations, the Commission intends to monitor the citizen admission practices of the individual states and reserves the right to take possible steps.====In our formal analysis, borrowing from the economic theory of clubs, we subsume such political costs under the term ‘congestion costs’, although the rivalry in use of club facilities that motivates this term in club good theory is not actually the typical type of cost that our analysis addresses. We allow these costs to differ between countries and to increase with the activity level of selling ‘golden passports’. In economic terms, countries can be interpreted as clubs. Their citizens are club members. They pay fees and benefit from the club-good benefits provided to members. Also the club controls and governs the right to choose the terms for the admission of further members and executes this right in the interest of the club's incumbent members.====With the foundation of the EU several clubs joined what could be seen as a meta-club, or a club of clubs.==== The meta-club might be seen as the provider of a club good that is funded by its members and provided to its members. And like other clubs, the meta-club has a governance structure that also describes the rules and procedures for the admission (or exit) of a member club. In the end, of course, the funders and beneficiaries are the members of the single clubs. If these single clubs reserve the right to govern the admission of new members into their own club, and if new members automatically benefit from the meta-club good, this creates a possible externality: while “entry fees” for new members of a club go to the incumbent members of that club, the new members benefit also from the meta-club good that is funded not only by the single club which they joined, but also by the members of all the other clubs. It is these potential externalities that we study in this paper by means of identifying market equilibrium outcomes. We are aiming at a better understanding of the implications for the meta-club of allowing the right to admit members into one of the member clubs. Moreover, we pose the question of whether this allocation of admission rights can cause conflict between the EU layer of government and the single member countries, analyze the distortions the existing allocation of admission rights implies, and suggest what would be a more suitable regime.====Clubs of clubs are not uncommon, at the intra-national as well as international levels. The EU is not a unique example. Different meta-clubs apply different rules about the governance of admission rights for new individual members. The United States of America, for instance, can be seen as a meta-club of states. Notably, the US rules for granting citizenship to new members are very different from the rules that apply inside the EU: admission decisions are mainly made at the federal level. On the other hand, conflicts may arise, as with differences in the enforcement of laws on unauthorized immigrants and so-called “sanctuary” states and cities.====On a much smaller, intra-national scale, the national golf associations or associations of clubs in other sports are clubs of clubs. There the clubs govern the right to grant membership to their club. And much as in these clubs of states or clubs of nations, the members of a golf club benefit from the meta-club good: they benefit from the actions of the national golf association, and they have specific rights to use the facilities of other member clubs of the national association. Some of these user rights are not for free. A member of one golf club might play on another golf course, but for a fee (“green fee”). The national association might be selective about whether a particular club that seeks admission is “worthy” in terms of adding facilities that are of comparable level to those of other clubs.====These two examples suggest that the allocation of admission rights for new individual members might be chosen differently in different meta-clubs. But it highlights that these choices are important ones. This further motivates an analysis of whether the specific rules that apply inside the European Union in the context of golden passport programs are functional or dysfunctional.====At this point it is important to distinguish the problem we analyze from the study of the phenomenon of mass migration towards the EU. While the concerns in the Commission Report of the EU about the dangers of golden-passport-citizens, quoted above, sound similar to the ones sometimes articulated about the phenomenon of mass migration towards Europe more generally, the “golden passports” issue needs to be distinguished from the general political controversy and academic debate about mass migration. Migration of politically or religiously persecuted persons, or of persons who seek a better life in view of the poor economic conditions in their home country, relates to different motives. It typically concerns a completely different and disjoint group of persons. Also, admission to the EU rests on completely different elements of the legal framework for immigration to the EU, such as the right to apply for asylum or regulation of labor market immigration.====More closely related to our analysis is the work of legal scholars and scholars from neighboring social sciences. Shachar and Bauböck (2014) brings together a number of papers from a multiplicity of disciplines which discuss the philosophically-oriented normative question “Should Citizenship be for Sale?”. In this wide-ranging volume, Ayelet Shachar reflects upon the relationship between citizenship and wealth. She surveys several of the regimes by which Cyprus, Portugal, Spain and Malta offer either a residence permit or actual citizenship to high-net-worth applicants in what she calls “unfettered cash-for-passport exchanges”, arguing critically that citizenship for sale may change important moral, social and cultural aspects of the very nature of citizenship.====Another contributor to the 2014 vol, Peter Spiro (2014), spells out this aspect more explicitly: citizenship in one of its member states opens “a backdoor to the rest of Europe”. He emphasizes that national citizenship remains within the exclusive competence of the member countries. Magni Berton (2014) in the same volume agrees that this allocation of competence is debatable and invites free-riding of some countries on the efforts of others. Maas (2016 p. 544) observes a contradiction between national sovereignty over its own citizenship on the one hand, and citizenship of a member state as being the only way to become an EU citizen on the other. He also takes up the argument according to which citizenship in a member country of the EU provides access to a different type of good: “…functional needs driven by free movement of individuals are coupled with the growing realization that EU citizenship creates a new political sphere that is ‘above’ that of the member states and whose subjects, EU citizens, have rights and a status that similarly transcends the member states.”====Carrera (2014, p. 426), analyzing what he refers to as the “Maltese Citizenship-for-Sale Affair”, concludes by posing the question: “Can EU Member States” actions on the acquisition and loss of nationality still be freely practised without any EU supervision and accountability?” He claims that: “Contrary to preliminary assumptions, the Commission and the European Parliament have successfully claimed co-ownership over citizenship matters, especially when domestic regulations have an impact over supranational citizenship, individual freedoms and the EU general principle of sincere cooperation.”====We focus in this paper on the political economy of the dilemma presented by the simultaneous existence of the two “basic rights” that emerge from the meta-club structure: the right of members of one club to move freely between clubs inside the meta-club which brings about externality issues between the clubs, and the sovereign right of individual clubs to grant membership on criteria of their own choosing. The EU is a prominent example of this structure as a club of clubs, or meta-club, with the property that membership of any one club automatically entitles one to membership of them all.====The formal analysis in this paper is related to the economic theory of clubs that studies production of public goods with crowding externalities, the allocation of these goods to an exclusive set or ‘club” of users, and the number of such clubs. Sandler and Tschirhart (1980, 1997) survey a large part of this literature. Hillman and Swan (1983) contribute to the important role of participation rules. An important aspect of this theory is the objective of clubs when admitting members: how much of the club good should be produced and by how many members should it be financed. A club might, for instance, maximize the average utility of its members, or the overall social welfare, or might be governed by profit-maximising managers as discussed in Scotchmer (1985). In our framework the club goods, both the national club goods and the international, Europe-wide good, are produced and given already. And the different countries already have given incumbent populations. The objectives of the nations will be the maximization of utility of this ex-ante given set of incumbent members who share any surplus from adopting further members.==== The club-good theory mostly concentrates on club goods without direct spillovers for other clubs. In our context, an exception is Sterbenz and Sandler (1992) who consider two clubs that each allow their members to use the facilities of the other club. In their framework there is no meta-club good the access to which single clubs can sell, and their clubs differ in their objectives, but the golf-club example discussed above reveals a similarity in spirit with the overselling of golden EU passports in our institutional framework. Our framework is also related to the idea of functional federalism as an institutional framework with multiple overlapping clubs discussed in Casella and Frey (1992).====The formal analysis in this paper can be seen as an endorsement of Carrera's argument for co-ownership at the level of European governance. The ethical issue of making citizenship a commodity is not, as such, our main concern, since, as we learn from other clubs and associations, membership fees and strong and stable citizenship ties need not be mutually exclusive. We focus rather on the externalities that emerge inside a union of clubs if these, by selling their own membership, sell entry to the union as well. In contrast to the ethical discussion of the negative side effects of the commodification of citizenship, this paper is the first to provide an economic analysis of the implications for the political economy of a union of countries. It highlights weaknesses of the current golden-passport regime and provides an economic basis for explicit agreements on the levels of sales that individual countries may undertake. We draw on economic theory to suggest possible forms for these agreements, and to that extent our analysis is also normative. We describe the unique Nash equilibrium that exists if all countries independently choose the price of citizenships they want to sell and offer them to anyone prepared to pay this price. We identify an externality that implies that too many passports are sold from the point of view of the union as a whole, and we rationalize why the small countries among the members of the union are particularly likely to engage in this business. We then go on to analyze the “back door” problem identified by Spiro, and draw on the classic Edgeworth/Bertrand model of oligopoly==== to suggest how it can be solved.",Passports for sale: The political economy of conflict and cooperation in a meta-club,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300033,1 February 2020,2020,Research Article,207.0

The jury of the old Salon decided on submissions with a bias in favor of conservative art of the academic insiders, erecting entry barriers against outsiders as the Impressionists. With a difference-in difference estimation, we provide evidence that the end of the government-controlled Salon contributed to start the price increase of the Impressionists relative to the insiders.","For more than two centuries the Paris Salon organized the art exhibition where French artists selected by an official jury could display their works. Such a system controlled by the on-going regime ended with the liberalization of 1880, which started the creation of a variety of privately organized salons. The artistic innovations of Impressionist painters, such as Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Paul Cézanne as well as Édouard Manet, had been marginalized in the government-controlled Salon and in the Paris art market, which were dominated by more traditional Academic artists. We argue that the liberalization was crucial to lower entry barriers in the market, create demand for outsiders as the Impressionists, and start the increase of the prices of their works relative to those of the insiders of the Salon. For this purpose, we analyze transactions of paintings in Paris at the end of the 1800s and advance a difference in difference analysis based on the year of the liberalization and the market prices of insiders of the Salon and the Impressionists.====The organization of the Salon during the 1800s was based on the submission of paintings and acceptance or rejection decided by a jury whose members were chosen by the government and a restricted Academy (Mainardi, 1987, 1994). Their purpose was essentially to promote history paintings for public commissions in support of the ideology of the government and to defend the classical tradition of the academic painters. While other genres and styles could be traded in the market, mainly through few dealers and auctions, the Salon acted as a focal point signaling the kind of paintings that were valuable, with prizes awarded by the jury and major purchases decided by the government for public display (see Boime, 1971; Kearns and Mills, 2015). Hence, market demand was largely shaped by the decisions of the jury and virtually confined to the painters who were accepted at the Salon. As Galenson and Jensen (2002) have noticed, the “Salon’s monopoly of the legitimate public presentation of new art thus gave it almost complete control over who would be allowed to become a painter in 19th-century France.” For this reason acceptance of a submission at the Salon was crucial for marginalized painters as the Impressionists. As long as the Salon was the only access to the public attention and the Impressionists were repeatedly rejected, they could not reach any critical or monetary recognition (Rewald, 1973).====The government-controlled Salon ended in 1880, when the Republicans had just obtained the political majority and adopted reforms in favor of ==== policies and against state monopolies. In particular, after the elections of 1879, the reformer Jules Ferry was appointed Minister of Public Education and Fine Arts and he soon attacked the academic jury for its conservative decisions, announced a new policy of “liberty in art” and abolished the public control of the Salon liberalizing the organization of art exhibitions starting from 1881 (see Mainardi, 1994; Brauer, 2013). According to a prominent art historian, the privatisation of art exhibitions was a “Third Republic creation, aiming to provide a market place for art whose very quantity and diversity would be a measure of democratic ‘liberty’” (Green, 2000, p.39). A private association of artists took control of the old Salon electing its jury under more transparent rules, and new private salons were soon organized in Paris in competition with each other, while various art dealers started to promote group exhibitions and even the first solo exhibitions (Brauer, 2013). The main consequence of this liberalization was that painters that had been marginalized at the official Salon could finally display their works in multiple exhibitions and reach the public through them. Our main claim is that the end of the government-controlled Salon in 1880 was the turning point that reduced entry barriers in the Paris art market and allowed for an increase in demand and prices of ==== painters as the Impressionists relative to the insiders of the Salon.====We have collected a unique dataset on transactions of paintings by artists active in Paris between 1859 and 1914 from a variety of art historical sources. While the discrimination of the Salon against the Impressionists represents an ==== judgment based on art historical accounts, we look for evidence that entry barriers in the art market of Paris associated with the admittance to the Salon had an immediate economic impact. If this was the case, we expect that each acceptance of a painting by an outsider as an Impressionist at a given Salon increased visibility and demand for the other paintings of the same artist traded in the market in that year, therefore increasing their prices. On the other hand, the acceptance of a painting of an insider is expected to have a much smaller impact on his or her prices given the limited signaling value of the acceptance of an already widely known artist. Accordingly, we analyze the Salon system before 1880, and show that the exhibition of an additional painting by an Impressionist painter at an average Salon increased the market price of his or her artworks by about 30% during the same year, while there was no significant impact for the insiders of the Salon and other artists.====We then look at the impact of the liberalization of 1880 and apply a difference in difference identification strategy on a sample including paintings traded in the last four decades of the century by Impressionists and a control group of insiders, identified as the winners of major prizes at the government-controlled Salon (namely Medals of Honor, and First and Second Class Medals). Controlling for common changes in prices with time dummies, fixed effects for artists and buyers, and other control variables, we show that the prices of the Impressionists started to increase compared to the insiders just after 1880, when the liberalization took place. The difference in difference estimate reveals an economically and statistically significant impact of the liberalization. This result is confirmed in a battery of robustness checks, such as using more restrictive definitions of Impressionists and insiders, alternative controls for time effects and the size of paintings, an extended dataset including the beginning of the new century and a reduced one limited to transactions with buyers from Paris, as well as controlling for painting fixed effects through a restricted sample of repeated sales. We also run placebo tests for the date of treatment, investigate alternative methodologies for the endogenous identification of structural breaks and run an interrupted time series analysis, which strenthens our evidence that a change in price dynamics did take place right after the liberalization of art exhibitions.====While our focus is on a liberalization of artistic policy that has not been studied in the economic literature, our work relates to multiple strands of research. At a preliminary level, it belongs to the recent interdisciplinary literature on the economic determinants of artistic creativity (Hulst, 2017; Borowiecki and Greenwald, 2018), including works by Galenson (2006, 2007, 2009) on the careers of artists, David et al. (2014) on the role of art dealership, Borowiecki (2015, 2017) on the origins of cultural supply and the creativity of music composers, Etro, 2018, Etro, 2020, Etro and Pagani (2012, 2013) and Etro and Stepanova (2015, 2016, 2017) on a Schumpeterian approach to artistic creativity. Moreover, we relate to the economic history literature that has examined the importance of market organization for economic evolution, from the work of Mokyr (1990) and North (1990) on the impact of social environment on technological progress, to the literature on the political economy of institutions and their reforms to enhance development (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2001). Our analysis is also related to the literature on market liberalization (e.g., Roland, 2000), which emphasizes its benefits, in terms of competition and innovation, as well as of eliminating barriers to entry and cronyism associated with government favours in a market under goverment monopoly. Difference-in-difference analysis is a common tool in the study of policy changes. Important works that are methodologically related with ours are those of Card and Krueger (1994) or Myers (2017) on labor market reforms, Slaughter (2001) on trade liberalization and Mastrobuoni and Pinotti (2015) on immigration policy.====The first quantitative approach to the evolution of French art during the 1800s is in the sociological analysis of White and White (1965), who have pointed out a transition from an academic system based on the Salon in the first half of the century to a decentralized “dealer-critic system” in the second half. Galenson and Jensen (2002) have amended this view emphasizing the emergence of various group exhibitions by few key artists that created their own market, starting with the exhibition of the Impressionists in 1874. An alternative view is that the 1886 exhibition on the Impressionists in New York was the real catalyst of new unbiased interest in the ====, and this contributed to generate an international art market where Impressionists and other innovators could be rewarded (Patry, 2015). Building on the art historical analysis by Mainardi (1994) and especially Brauer (2013), we argue that it was the liberalization of the art exhibitions of 1880 that was the key event that shifted the structure of the art market from imperfect competition between insiders toward a contestable market. In this new setting, all artists had the chance to differentiate their products and attract buyers by exhibiting in alternative salons and through competition between dealers. While the anecdotal evidence on the discrimination of the Impressionists at the Salon and their slow appreciation is well known in art history (see for instance Rewald, 1973), we are not aware of any systematic analysis on art pricing that goes beyond descriptive statistics.==== In a period of a generalized increase of the prices of paintings, we believe that it is important to analyze the behavior of relative prices and how the liberalization of 1880 affected them. The next section frames the organization of the art market in Paris during the 1800s and the institutional change taking place since 1880. The subsequent section presents the data. The next one describes econometric methods and results. The last section provides final remarks.",Liberalizing art.

Indeed, a rich academic literature provides strong theoretical reasons to believe that political transitions are driven by distributive conflicts.==== Yet, the recent consensus among empirical social scientists is that there is very weak statistical evidence of a relationship between income inequality and the likelihood of democratization (Gassebner et al., 2013; Houle, 2009; Teorell, 2010).==== We argue that social scientists have not found a statistically significant relationship between economic inequality and political transitions to democracy due to the typical (implicit) assumption that the effect of inequality is homogenous across states of the macroeconomy. In this paper we explore the statistical importance of that assumption. We demonstrate an empirically robust effect of inequality on the likelihood of democratization following economic downturn periods, when autocratic regimes may be particularly weak (and a “revolutionary threat” may be amplified). As growth periods are more frequent, then, the null result that is typically found in the literature is not surprising from an econometric standpoint. Adverse economic shocks that open windows of opportunity have a positive impact on the probability of democratization when inequality is high enough.====Our empirical investigation is guided by the general theoretical notion that, whatever the popular grievance with an autocratic regime, democratization is more likely to be extended during transitory “windows of opportunity,” during which a regime cannot credibly placate a revolutionary threat with concessions. In general, there are many popular grievances to examine and a multitude of reasons that the window of opportunity may open (Dorsch and Maarek, 2014). In this paper, we focus on what has emerged as the “new economic view” of democratization, in which distributional grievances drive the revolutionary threat and that macroeconomic downturns open the windows of opportunity Acemoglu and Robinson (2000, 2001, 2006).====In the canonical economic model of political transitions to democracy, Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) describe democratization as an equilibrium outcome of a non-cooperative game between a politically elite, rich class and a disenfranchised, poor class [we henceforth refer to the Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) paper as AR]. A key element of the AR model is how the revolutionary threat depends on the economic costs and benefits for the disenfranchised of pursuing democratization through revolutionary activity. The economic benefit of democratization for the disenfranchised is greater for larger degrees of income inequality, since there would be a greater redistributive potential for a democratically-determined fiscal policy (following the classic results from the democratic political economy literature of Meltzer and Richard, 1981, Roberts, 1977, and Romer, 1975). AR consider the opportunity cost of revolting to be pro-cyclical and thus argue that the diminished earnings opportunities of revolutionaries during economic downturns temporarily strengthens the revolutionary threat and opens a window of opportunity for democratization. Crucially, the elite can prevent a revolution through tax concessions during normal times, but cannot during transitory downturns: the elite cannot credibly commit to such a redistributive policy when the economy returns to normal and the future threat of revolution abates.==== Rather than have their assets destroyed and/or confiscated in a revolution, the elite may preemptively enfranchise the population during periods of heightened revolutionary threat.====According to the economic view of the AR model, a distributional grievance is required for a revolutionary threat to exist and given a revolutionary threat, an economic downturn is required to prompt the elite to democratize.==== The effect of income inequality on the likelihood of democratization is ==== the window of opportunity being open. Or, saying it differently, the impact of an economic shock on the likelihood of democratization should be positive only for countries in which the distributional grievances are strong enough. Thus our empirical strategy is simply to isolate the impact of inequality during periods when the window of opportunity is open (eg, during growth downturns).==== Without examining the effect of inequality conditional upon the productive state of the macroeconomy, empirical research on the determinants of democratization has been ignoring an important non-linearity, which may explain the largely null results concerning the effect of inequality on transitions to democracy that have been found in the literature.==== An alternative interpretation is that we estimate the impact of an economic shock conditionally on the degree of inequality, having in mind that when the window of opportunity opens, it should increase the incentive to revolt (and thus lead to a preemptive democratization) only when distributional grievances are sufficiently high. Despite the large number of studies that empirically examine the new economic view of democratization, we are not aware of any other papers that have made this simple observation. ====Our empirical study is quantitative in nature and relies on panel regression analysis. However, it is worth mentioning a few of the many historical examples that illustrate well the underlying narrative of our paper. Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) begin their classic study of why the elite voluntarily democratize by describing the transition of 19th century Britain from an elite-dominated oligarchy with rising income inequality to a democratic society whose government instituted large scale progressive taxation that reduced inequalities by more than 30 percent (as measured by the Gini coefficient) in England and Wales by the turn of the 20th century (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000). In an ambitious study, Haggard and Kaufman (2012) and Haggard et al. (2012) review 65 democratic transition cases between 1980 and 2000 and conclude that more than half of them can be unambiguously classified through causal process observation as “distributive conflicts”. For example, the popular protest movement in Brazil was spearheaded by labor unions and pushed democratization “from below” during the severe economic crises of the early 1980s that had left Brazilian real wages falling, inequalities rising, and drove workers out to the streets. In response to the labor-led protest movement, the Brazilian military rulers allowed for a significant democratic improvement in 1985 (when the net Gini coefficient was 50.0). A second example of a distributive conflict transition from Haggard et al. (2012) is Zambia in the early 1990s. In the wake of collapsing copper prices and a deep recession, there were strikes among labor unions and students, as well as urban riots, that developed into a more widespread democracy movement. In fiscal crisis and presiding over a severely unequal distribution of income (net Gini of 57.4), the ruling cabinet defected from the regime under the pressure from civil society and agreed to multi-party elections in 1991. In this paper we take a more systematic look at empirical regularities concerning the role of income inequality in conditioning the effect of economic shocks on the probability of democratic improvements in the modern era.====Controlling for country and period fixed effects, over a panel of autocratic countries from 1973 to 2012, we estimate a statistically significant relationship between inequality and the likelihood of democratic improvements following economic downturns (when the window of opportunity is opened). Interpreting the conditional relationship alternatively, we find that economic downturns have a positive impact on the probability of democratization in high inequality countries. In order to identify a causal relation between economic downturns and the probability of democratic improvements, conditionally on the degree of inequality, we employ an instrumental variable strategy that identifies exogenous shocks to per capita income levels. Following Bazzi and Blattman (2014), we use an index of commodity price variation weighted by each commodity's share in the export basket as an instrument for economic downturns, which we also interact with the inequality variables to instrument the conditional impact of downturns. International commodity price variation is likely to be exogenous to the probability of democratic improvements. In some specifications we also instrument the degree of inequality in a country with an agricultural endowment variable that was proposed by Easterly (2007). The ratio of land suitable for sugar cane to land suitable for wheat correlates with the existence of large scale plantations and slave labor that instruments for deeply rooted inequities. We alternatively instrument for inequality with the percentage of cultivated farmland that can be considered family farms from Vanhanen (2011). Our main result is robust to the use of several alternative indicators of democratization, to the use of alternative constructions of our macroeconomic downturn variable, and to alternative conceptualizations of inequality. Our result provides a simple explanation for why previous literature has found largely null results concerning inequality and democratization and offers new evidence in support of the new economic view's empirical predictions.====Our paper contribute to two literatures. First the impact of economic shocks on the probability of democratization. Many papers have tested the idea that economic shocks open a window of opportunity and lead to democratization. Aidt and Leon (2016), Brückner and Ciccone (2011), and Burke and Leigh (2010) find evidence of such a mechanism using commodity prices and precipitation as instruments for economic shocks over a panel of countries. However, none of those papers examine a conditional impact with inequality.==== Another literature examines the impact of inequality on the probability of democratization and does not find strong evidence of such a link (Gassebner et al., 2013; Houle, 2009; Teorell, 2010).==== We argue that inequality should play a role only when the regime is threatened and the window of opportunity is open. This explains the null result generally found in the literature, which does not test for the conditional effect.====Our paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the panel data set that we use. The third section presents our baseline results, a battery of sensible robustness checks, and a brief discussion with reference to the empirical literature on democratization. The final section offers our concluding remarks. In an Online Appendix, for the reader not familiar with the AR framework we present a much simplified theoretical reprise of the AR model of political transitions, in which we derive equilibrium comparative statics that are appropriate for an empirical investigation of binary democratization indicator variables. The Online Appendix also includes more details about the data set, further robustness tests, as well as the first stage regressions of all the two-stage specifications (and their reduced-form counterparts) that we present below.","Economic downturns, inequality, and democratic improvements",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268020300045,31 January 2020,2020,Research Article,209.0

The empirical analysis leverages on a unique manually collected dataset that includes all the development banks headquartered in Europe, for the period 2002–2015.==== of development banks cannot be supported as a general rule, it finds empirical evidence in flawed democracies, where large development banks actually tend to increase their lending activity in election years.","The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the lending activity of development banks headquartered in Europe is affected by political influences. The topic is of utmost relevance given the strategic role that contemporary development banks are playing in Europe, coupled with the ancestral fear that these public subjects may distort the allocation of resources.====Development banks are “legal entities carrying out financial activities on a professional basis which are given a mandate by a member state or a member state’s entity at central, regional or local level, to carry out development or promotional activities” (European Commission, 2015b). While there is a general consensus on the role of development banks in mitigating market failures (De Olloqui et al., 2013; de Luna-Martinez and Vicente, 2012; Foray et al., 2012; Yeyati et al., 2004; Gutierrez et al., 2011), the issue traditionally raised is whether this positive contribution is more than offset by misallocation of resources and destruction of value due to political interference and inefficiencies.====As a matter of fact, according to the so-called ==== of government bank ownership, perverse effects due to political motivations may prevail on the desirable contribution of government ownership to promote socially valuable projects (Hart et al., 1997; Kornai, 1979; La Porta et al., 2002; Shleifer and Vishny, 1994, 1997). While state-owned, non-financial enterprises can be used by politicians to provide jobs and direct resources to friends and supporters, state-owned banks can be induced by the incumbent policymakers to finance favored enterprises (Sapienza, 2004; La Porta et al., 2002) and, more generally, to increase their lending activity during election periods in order to seek and retain the favor of the voters (Dinç, 2005).====This may result in misallocation of funding motivated by two main hypotheses: the “soft-budget constraints hypothesis” and the “rent-seeking hypothesis.” The “soft-budget constraints hypothesis” (Kornai, 1979; Lin and Tan, 1999) suggests that abundant and lenient capital from the state increase the likelihood that state-owned banks may approve bad investments and use public funds to bail out companies that would otherwise fail. Slightly differently, the “rent-seeking hypothesis” (Ades and Di Tella, 1997; Claessens et al., 2008) argues that funds are channeled to politically connected industrialists, who indeed receive substantially preferential treatment in terms of interest rates and access to credit even though they do not need subsidized capital. In both cases, firms will obtain capital for reasons other than the inherent financial potential of their own project, resulting in economically inefficient uses of public resources (Dinç, 2005; Micco et al., 2007; Lazzarini et al., 2015; Khwaja and Mian, 2005). It is just to prevent these negative side effects and the misallocation of resources that the European Commission itself underlines the need for development banks to adopt proper policies and best practices (European Commission, 2015b; European Parliament, 2016).====Extant empirical literature has already analyzed the lending behavior of state-owned banks with the aim of assessing whether their activity is influenced by political considerations, with results that generally support the political view of government bank ownership. In particular, Sapienza (2004) finds that the lending behavior of state-owned banks in Italy is affected by the electoral results of the party affiliated with the banks’ top executives. Khwaja and Mian (2005) observe that state-owned banks in Pakistan tend to lend more to firms with politically connected directors. Dinç (2005) empirically analyzes government-owned banks in 43 countries across the world and finds that the lending activity within developing countries is influenced by politics, while this is not the case in developed economies. Similar results are shown in Micco et al. (2007), where the authors observe that state-owned banks located in developing countries increase loans during election years, while state-owned banks in developed countries do not.====However, all these studies focus on government-owned financial institutions, while development banks are rather a different type of financial institution (although they are also owned by the government (see Section 2.1)), with consequences in terms of political distortion that are largely unexplored as of yet.====So far, the only empirical paper directly testing the political view on development banks is Lazzarini et al. (2015), who concentrate on the Brasilian Development Bank (BNDES) and analyze the performances of firms receiving its financial support. While confirming that political influences matter, they find that the BNDES does not appear to systematically channel funds to underperforming firms, although targets do not display any consequent beneficial effect in terms of performance and investment.====We adopt a distinctive perspective from Lazzarini et al. (2015), since we focus on European countries (including both developed countries and economies in transition) and we investigate how the lending activity of development banks changes around elections compared to other financial institutions. The empirical analysis leverages on a unique, manually collected dataset that includes all the development banks headquartered in Europe. Financial information is benchmarked with a selected sample of more than 4,200 financial institutions for the period 2002–2015.====Results show that the ==== of development banks is not supported as a general rule. In particular, in full democracies no empirical evidence is found of opportunistic manipulation of development banks’ activity for electoral purposes. By contrast, there is evidence of politically motivated lending from development banks in European countries with weaker political institutions, in the form of increased lending in election years relative to the rest of the banking system.====A battery of robustness tests confirms our results. The adoption of alternative measures for the main variables of our interest and the recourse to alternative econometric approaches produce very consistent findings.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates the specificities of development banks and introduces the hypotheses. Section 3 describes our sample and the dataset. Section 4 defines the methodology.

The empirical strategy, a Difference-in-Discontinuities design, takes advantage of the fact that the policy applies to cities above a population threshold, and that this threshold has been modified over time. I find that the quota policy has a substantial impact on the share of female candidates and elected politicians, but fails to promote female mayors and list leaders, even in cities that have been exposed to the policy for 13 years. Women do not reach leadership positions because they are more likely to resign than male politicians. This higher propensity of women to leave politics is correlated with local gender norms concerning the place of women in society, and also varies with individual characteristics such as age and professional background. In a second part, I show that quotas have little effect on the composition of municipal councils in terms of socio-economic background, age, and political experience.","Despite recent advances, women are still under-represented in the political sphere, particularly in local governments. For instance, in the US, women's share of local council seats ranged from 20 to 30 per cent over the last two decades (Holman (2017)). In Italy, this share was comprised between 13 and 16 per cent between 1996 and 2007, and it was equal to 13.5 per cent in Brazil in 2012 (Correa and Madeira (2014)).==== France is no exception: in 1995, women represented only 21.7% of councillors and 7.5% of mayors.==== Yet, women's representation in politics is important for democratic purposes. Furthermore, there exists some evidence that women behave differently than men in local political office, particularly in developing countries (Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) and Brollo and Troiano (2016)).====To address the issue of gender imbalance in political office, several governments worldwide have introduced gender quotas in local elections. India, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and some Arab states have adopted a system of reserved seats (Dahlerup (2005)). The Indian case has been extensively studied in the literature (see, for example, Beaman et al. (2009) and Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004)).====Another policy instrument is to set quotas for candidates. In proportional list systems, quotas generally apply to candidate lists. This is the case, for example, in France, Italy, and Spain.==== The Spanish and Italian cases have also been largely documented in the economic literature (see Section 2). This paper studies the impact of the French quota policy on the composition of municipal councils.====French municipal elections are based on a proportional list system for large cities (more than 3500 inhabitants for elections before 2014, and more than 1000 inhabitants since 2014). Municipal elections in these cities are subject to a quota policy that specifies that roughly 50% of candidates on candidate lists should be women. Furthermore, in order to prevent political parties’ strategic positioning of women on electoral lists, it requires each candidate list to strictly alternate between men and women (“zipper” quotas). On the contrary, elections in small municipalities are based on individual candidates and no quota policy could be introduced. The quota policy as it is implemented in large municipalities in France is thus particularly stringent, and the literature has shown that these features of the quota policy are usually effective in raising female representation in politics (Jones (2004)).====This paper precisely aims at estimating the causal impact of the French quota policy for municipal elections on female political representation and on the composition of municipal councils. The empirical strategy exploits the discontinuity in the application of the quota policy: in 2008, the quota was imposed on candidate lists running for municipal elections in cities with more than 3500 inhabitants, and for the 2014 elections the population threshold was decreased to 1000 inhabitants. I use data from the national registry of elected politicians (Registre National des Elus) and employ a Difference-in-Discontinuities design that compares cities just above and just below the population cut-off and exploits the change over time in the threshold to assess the impact of the policy on female political representation and on the characteristics of elected politicians (age, experience in politics and socio-professional background). It is important to note that since the quota scheme is tied to the electoral system being based on candidate lists, the term “quota policy” should be understood as the combination of two policies - the ‘zipper” quota regime and the proportional representation system with closed-lists - and in this paper I estimate the effect of introducing the bundle of policies.====First, I find that the quota policy increases the percentage of female candidates and of women sitting in municipal councils by 7 points. However, I show that quotas fail to promote more women to the head of municipal councils, or more female lists leaders, even after 13 years of exposure to the policy. In addition to the possible presence of voter and party bias, I propose one explanation for this absence of impact of quotas on the promotion of female leaders: female politicians are more likely than their male counterpart to leave politics after one mandate, preventing them from acquiring the necessary political experience to access leadership positions. At the local level, I show that the difference in propensity to leave is correlated with general attitudes regarding the place of women in society and the labour market, but not with political variables such as the level of competition or voters's attitudes towards female leaders. At the individual level, I show that this different propensity to leave politics differs with socio-professional background and age of politicians, suggesting that opportunity cost of time may differ between gender, and varies with age.====In terms of composition of municipal councils, I show that men elected in quota municipalities are older and have more political experience than those elected in non-quota municipalities, but the overall effect of quotas on all elected politicians is null. I also show that the policy has no impact on the composition of municipal councils in terms of socio-economic background of elected politicians.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows.

One of the most popular models explaining the motives behind grant allocation from central to local governments is the ==== model by (Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987). The model's main prediction is that tighter elections among political parties during electoral campaigns drive up the transfers targeting swing municipalities.====However, given the varied voting regimes that exist around the world, competition should be measured differently in different systems. In the 1990s, many countries introduced the ==== system, including Japan in 1994, New Zealand in 1993 and Italy in 1993 (later abandoned in 2005) (Farrell, 2011). Along with other former Communist countries, Hungary introduced a variant of the mixed-member proportional system after the fall of Communism (Benoit, 2005). The initial system was imposed by the Allies in Western Germany after World War II to avoid extreme proportionality and to implement the advantages of Anglo-American systems (Farrell, 2011). In these systems, voters typically cast two votes: one cast in their constituencies on a individual candidate, the other cast on a party list. The main idea is that these party lists compensate for the disproportionality that may occur due to the plurality rule in single-member districts.====According to some political scientists, such as (Søberg Shugart, 2005) and (Farrell, 2011), this system includes the best characteristics of both plurality and proportional electoral rules: a closer relationship between voters and candidates, since a portion of candidates are directly elected by single-member districts, and also proportionality, since the party lists allocate part of the parliamentary mandates through proportional electoral rule.====One of the most common measures of political competition is the closeness of each dominant party's vote share at the municipal level. However, I propose using (Myerson, 2000)'s pivotal probability to measure competition instead. The main reason prompting this choice is that closeness is only a good measure of political competition under plurality systems, in which parties focus only on winning and are not concerned with increasing their ====. Under mixed-member proportional systems, and proportional systems in general, the difference in votes received by each candidate is important, so we need a measure that incorporates the number of votes, not simply the difference in vote share. Pivotal probability reflects this reality. Using pivotal probability instead of closeness is a new way to measure political competition because it allows us to test the probabilistic voting model of systems in which the ==== matters in the mandate allocation, such as the ==== system or proportional systems in general. Thus, this paper aligns with other empirical papers in offering new measures for political competition.====I analyse whether intergovernmental transfers==== were politically motivated in Hungary between 1999 and 2006. The theoretical underpinnings of my analysis are (Dixit and Londregan, 1996) and (Dixit and Londregan, 1998), as well as versions of probabilistic voting models discussed by (Lindbeck and Weibull, 1987), (Coughlin, 1992). The transfers were determined by the yearly Budget Law, approved by the Hungarian Parliament. In principle, objective factors like the number of pupils in the local schools should determine the amount of money transferred from the government to each municipality. However, according to the probabilistic voting model, municipalities with intense political competition are expected to receive more support. The underlying mechanism driving these transfers is the desire to win votes in swing constituencies, municipalities that tend to change political allegiance, by providing more municipal funding. In poor regions, it is less costly to obtain votes in this manner than it is in rich regions.====So far in empirical studies, these theoretical predictions have either been confirmed - (Case, 2001) (Johansson, 2003) (Strömberg, 2008) and (Banful, 2011) - or rejected, as in (Larcinese et al., 2013). The empirical studies commonly use more sophisticated measures of political competition than the vote difference between dominant blocks; survey data is typically used to uncover the distribution of political preferences at the municipality level. The ==== allows us to partially disentangle party preferences from preferences for individual politicians, though some contamination exists between individual and party choice. Voters have two votes: one is cast on their district candidate and the other on a party list. The latter allows us to directly measure party preference under this voting system. Since no Hungarian survey data is available at the municipality level, I use the pivotal probabilities calculated at the municipality level to measure political competition. In tighter elections, this probability should be high, as it is more probable that only one vote may decide the final outcome. While large differences in the competing blocks’ vote share, suggesting that the municipality favours one side, should have a negative effect on the amount of funding transferred, I do not find any. I also test for alignment effects in my robustness analysis. However, I do not find any indication that party preference creates political favouritism.====In my analysis, I found significant effects for both political competition (measured by pivotal probabilities) and income per capita on the size of intergovernmental transfers. The signs are in line with the predictions of the Dixit and Londregan models: more intensive competition leads to larger transfer amounts and poorer municipalities receive larger transfer amounts. The effects are large relative to other factors such as schooling. However, the effect is only significantly different from 0 in the case of less populous municipalities - in larger municipalities, any targeting of voters most likely took another form. Overall, around 40% of the regional electorate shows evidence of political targeting.

Using these data, we document for the first time a differential effect of diversity on electoral turnout depending on household equivalent income. Specifically, we show that ethnic diversity in the neighborhood reduces the political participation of the poor, while it fosters that of the more affluent. These results highlight a potential democratic deficit stemming from reduced and unequal electoral turnout in increasingly heterogeneous neighborhoods.","As a consequence of the surge in immigration flows, Western countries are growing ethnically more diverse. This raises concern about possible implications in terms of reduced social cohesion, trust and pro-social behavior, such as civic engagement and political participation (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000; Putnam, 2007).====A related issue is that of the impact of ethnic diversity on electoral turnout. This is particularly important, as changes in participation, especially insofar as they imply lower turnout concentrated among some specific group of voters (say the poor), may bring about gaps in democracy and an increase in political inequality.====In this paper we consider the possibility that the impact of ethnic diversity on one's propensity to vote depends on individual resources. Indeed, it is quite reasonable to expect that exposure to ethnic others should have larger impact on the less affluent, who are more easily exposed to undesired contacts with immigrants and more vulnerable to competition with them. Thus, the marginalization effect of local ethnic diversity may well be stronger for the poor than for the rich. Potential mobilization mechanisms may also work differently across income groups and overlooking heterogeneous effects may bias empirical results. Though important, this issue has been neglected in the literature so far, arguably because of the limited availability of reliable joint information on individual turnout, income and contextual characteristics of the neighborhood.====We are able to address these questions due to the availability of an original dataset on local elections in Bologna, a medium-sized municipality in the Center-north of Italy, which merges information on socio-economic characteristics of about 370,000 residents with individual electoral participation in two consecutive administrative elections in 2004 and 2009. Our dataset represents an extraordinary and, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented opportunity to investigate our research question as we had access to information on ==== turnout from official electoral lists matched with data on ==== and other individual characteristics, taken from official income tax files and registry office records.====Several goals can be achieved through our dataset. First, using registry office records we are able to measure diversity at the micro-level, in the precinct (neighborhood) of residence. In particular, we can construct different measures of contextual ethnic diversity by aggregating individual information at the electoral precinct level. Second, exploiting information on personal income and household composition, we can allow for heterogeneous effects on individuals' propensity to vote, depending on equivalent family income. Finally, the availability of repeated information on individual turnout, income, and ethnic diversity across the 2004 and 2009 elections enables us to identify heterogeneous effects of ethnic diversity through income, net of omitted variable bias due to any unobserved time-invariant individual and contextual characteristics.====As discussed in Bellettini et al. (2016), our case of study is particularly well suited to investigate the effect on turnout of increasing exposure to ethnic others in local contexts. In fact, between 2004 and 2009, Bologna received huge inflows of immigrants and the share of foreign residents increased from 6,8% to 11,6%, in line with national and other European countries' trends. The variability of foreign residents' share across precincts was indeed sizable, ranging between 0 and 30%; moreover on average the share has increased 3 percentage points over the period. Another advantage of our case of study is that voters are almost all Italians born by Italian parents==== and a large share of the non-franchised immigrants (Asian and African citizens) are visibly different, somatically and culturally, from them. Thus, our estimates can capture a purely contextual effect of inter-ethnic exposure on turnout, unrelated to political competition mechanisms which, instead, are at work when eligible voters belong to different ethnic groups.====The main result of our empirical analysis is that the effect of ethnic diversity on individual propensity to vote is ==== across income groups. In particular, we find that ethnic diversity in the neighborhood of residence ==== the probability of voting for low income individuals. This effect becomes weaker for individuals with higher income, turning to null moving up the income ladder and ==== for upper income classes.====Our main result is consistent with the argument that vulnerability and economic insecurity enhance the sense of social alienation related to exposure to ethnic others which, in turn, reduces pro-social behavior and electoral turnout. Voters with larger means may be less sensitive to negative cues, have greater opportunities to avoid undesired casual contact with others (e.g. by avoiding public transports, spending holidays out of town rather than in public parks, buying in small specialized shops rather than in discounts, and so on), and generally have fewer reasons to face or fear competition from immigrants, in the labor market and in access to public services.====As far as the positive effect of ethnic diversity on turnout of the more affluent is concerned, notice that, in our case of study, the explanation is unlikely to be related to political competition or intra-ethnic group mobilization mechanisms, as discussed above. Rather, it is plausible that local ethnic diversity increases the salience of immigration as a social issue, eliciting turnout among voters to voice their concerns.==== In particular, ethnic diversity may bring to the polls those who perceive immigrants as a threat and fear that they are attracted to the municipality to enjoy the inclusive local welfare policies there implemented by the left-wing coalitions that have long held office in Bologna.==== Such mobilization effect may be moderated by conflicting interests prevailing among the less affluent: poor voters may refrain from supporting left-wing parties, feeling jeopardized by immigrants; at the same time they may not want to vote for right-wing parties, as they reckon them as not aligned with their interests.====Similar mechanisms, that tend to disproportionally depress turnout among the less affluent, may well be generalized to other contexts, beyond our Bologna case. The marginalization effect related to vulnerability is clearly a general one; the moderation effect due to conflicting interests among the poor may also be relevant in other circumstances, both at the local and at the national level, as long as inclusive policies and pro-immigrants attitudes typically coexist in left-wing coalitions' programs.====Although the focus of our paper is on ethnic diversity and income, our analysis considers other potential determinants of electoral participation. Consistently with existing studies, we find that the eldest, the natives (i.e. those who are born in the municipality), those who are married, and those who live in the city-center are more likely to vote. These characteristics are somehow related to the degree of integration and sense of belonging to one's community which may also be influenced by ethnic heterogeneity. As Blais (2000) puts it, “the socioeconomic profile of voters and abstainers provides support for a sociological interpretation of the act of voting as expressing one's sense of belonging to the larger community” (p. 52).====Overall, our results suggest that both individual and contextual socio-economic characteristics are important determinants of electoral participation and that increasing ethnic diversity of residential neighborhoods may be a driver of disaffection for politics among the less affluent while boosting participation among the rich, with overall negative effect on turnout. Insofar as reduced and unequal political participation translates into unequal political representation, these results point to a potential democratic deficit in increasingly diverse communities.====The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.

We show that previous analyses of the nexus between population size and government size are incorrectly specified and fail to consider the influence of cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity and cointegration. Using a panel time-series approach that adequately accounts for these issues, we find that population size has a positive long-run effect on government size. This finding suggests that effects of population size that increase government size (primarily due to the costs of heterogeneity, congestion, crime and conflict) dominate effects that reduce government size (primarily due to scale economies).","Government size – or, interchangeably, the ====, i.e., government spending as a fraction of total GDP – is an important macroeconomic variable. For instance, the size of government may affect factor accumulation and productivity (e.g., Dar and AmirKhalkhali, 2002), macroeconomic volatility and economic growth (e.g., Glomm and Ravikumar, 1997; Afonso and Furceri, 2010; Bergh and Henrekson, 2011; Carmignani et al., 2011; Jetter, 2014) and life satisfaction (Bjornskov et al., 2007).====Given its role in determining many important socio-economic outcomes, a considerable theoretical and empirical literature has sought to identify the determinants of government size, investigating, inter alia, the role of a country’s level of economic development, the nature of its political institutions as well as of its degree of ethnic fragmentation, demographic conditions and history of war and conflict (e.g., O’Reilly and Powell, 2015; for a brief review, see Shelton, 2007: 2234–2240). Among the potential determinants of government size, ==== has gained some prominence in the literature.====There exist conflicting hypotheses about the effect of population size on government size. For one, it is argued that more populous countries benefit from scale economies and reduced exposure to the risks of international conflict and trade and can thus afford smaller governments (e.g., Alesina, 2003: 303–304). For another, more populous countries may rather necessitate larger governments to counter congestion, heterogeneity costs and the ill effects of a larger population size on domestic conflict (e.g., Oakland, 1972; Alesina, 2003: 304–305). The empirical evidence reflects this theoretical ambiguity, with some studies reporting a negative population-government size relationship (e.g., Alesina and Wacziarg, 1998) and others reporting positive or non-significant associations (e.g., Ram, 2009; Jetter and Parmeter, 2015).====Our paper adds to the diverse empirical evidence on the population-government size nexus in two fundamental ways. First, we uncover methodological shortcomings associated with “traditional” approaches to the population-government size nexus. Specifically, traditional approaches rely on pooled OLS and fixed-effects models, thereby not accounting for ====, ==== and (panel) ====. Corresponding misspecifications result in invalid inferences about the population-government size relationship. Second, we address these methodological shortcomings by employing a novel ==== (the common correlated effects mean-group error-correction model) that accommodates cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity and (panel) cointegration. To preview our main finding, the estimates from this approach indicate that larger population size is ==== related to government size, suggesting that the costs of size (due to congestion, crime, conflict etc.) dominate its potential benefits (e.g., from scale economies).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the theory and evidence related to the population-government size nexus. In Section 3, we introduce the data and test the variables measuring population and government size for cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity and (panel) cointegration, showing that all of these issues matter. Section 4 investigates the effect of population on government size using the “traditional” pooled OLS and fixed-effects approaches. Sources of misspecification when employing this approach are identified and discussed. Section 5 introduces the common correlated effects mean-group error-correction model. We show how this model eliminates various sources of misspecification. Using this model, we provide a number of novel insights into the government size-population size nexus.

We apply a meta-analytical framework surveying 188 studies (2047 models) covering 36 years of research in the field. We also compare the effect of democracy on growth with the effect of human capital on growth in a sub-sample of 111 studies (875 models). Our findings suggest that democracy has a positive and direct effect on economic growth beyond the reach of publication bias, albeit weaker (about one third) of that of human capital. Further, the growth effect of democracy appears to be stronger in more recent papers not surveyed in Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008). Finally, we show that the heterogeneity in the reported results is mainly driven by spatial and temporal differences in the samples, indicating that the democracy and growth nexus is not homogeneous across world regions and decades.","The relationship between democracy and economic growth has been the subject of a vast literature in the social sciences with contrasting results. Researchers adopting a variety of identification strategies, estimation techniques and different samples of countries and periods have claimed either a positive (e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2019; Gründler and Krieger, 2016; Madsen et al., 2015) or a negative (e.g. Przeworski, 2000; Gerring et al., 2005) or a non-significant relationship (e.g. Baum and Lake, 2003; Murtin and Wacziarg, 2014).====Early empirical investigations of the institutional determinants of economic growth (e.g. Barro, 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992) already showed mixed findings. However, this is not surprising: as Sala-i-Martin (1997) noted, economic growth theories are usually not explicit in stating which are the factors that matter most for a country to prosper. Therefore, despite the accumulation of empirical evidence, the consensus among scholars on this issue was far from being reached. As Sirowy & Inkeles stated “many of the central questions pertaining to the developmental consequences of political democracy remain, by and large, unresolved”; furthermore, “the relevant quantitative, cross-national research continues to be plagued by conflicting findings” (Sirowy and Inkeles, 1990, p. 127). A few years later, similar conclusions were reached by Przeworski & Limongi: when it comes to the nexus between democratic institutions and economic development “social scientists know surprisingly little” (Przeworski and Limongi, 1993, p. 51).====In an effort to solve this puzzle, further attempts moved their focus mostly on identification strategies, proposing alternative solutions to the embedded endogeneity of institutions (e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2001). This led to a further diversification of model specifications, estimation techniques and even measures of democracy. Such process led to a tentative consensus for a positive effect of democracy on growth among economists (Acemoglu et al., 2019). However, despite the democracy and growth ==== benefited from renewed attention – and from the introduction of novel econometric techniques, machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and new measures of democracy – the key question remained somehow unaddressed (Gerring et al., 2005; Knutsen, 2012). Finally, the recent increase in empirical evidence in economics supporting the causal link from democracy to economic growth is yet contrasted by a few papers claiming that democracy follows the increase in income (e.g. Gundlach and Paldam, 2009; Murtin and Wacziarg, 2014).====Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008) delved into the debate by performing the first meta-analysis on the issue based on a sample of 483 point-estimates included in 84 studies. They concluded that “democracy does not have a direct impact on economic growth. However, it has robust, significant and positive indirect effects through higher human capital, lower inflation, lower political instability and higher economic freedom” (Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu, 2008, p. 61). This conclusion supported earlier evidence provided by Tavares and Wacziarg (2001) and spurred further research (such as, for instance, Gründler and Krieger, 2016; Dahlum and Knutsen, 2017; Acemoglu et al., 2019).====Our contribution to this debate follows Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008) and takes advantage of the increased production of quantitative scientific papers on the topic as well as advances in meta-analytical techniques. We collect all point estimates available in both published and unpublished studies and find no evidence of publication bias in this literature.==== We then address the effect sizes' hierarchical dependence (Stevens and Taylor, 2009) – through multilevel modelling and clustering techniques – and assess the robustness of our findings against a variety of specifications and estimators.====Finally, we collect all point estimates relating to human capital included in our sample of studies. Human capital is a widely accepted key factor in the process of economic growth and “a significant amount of research has been devoted to the education-growth nexus” (Benos and Zotou, 2014, p. 669) in both the neoclassical and the endogenous growth literature; furthermore, several attempts investigating a causal mechanism of transmission of democracy on growth focus on human capital (e.g. Saint-Paul and Verdier, 1993; Tavares and Wacziarg, 2001; Dahlum and Knutsen, 2017). By comparing the strength of the association between democracy and growth with the magnitude of the effect of human capital on growth, we provide a direct comparison to support the interpretation of the results of our meta-analysis.====In brief, the novel contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we collect the largest and most up-to-date sample of studies investigating the democracy and growth nexus, consisting of 188 papers and 2047 effect sizes; second, we provide a comparison between the estimated effect of democracy on economic growth with the effect, on growth, of human capital; third, we show that the growth effect of democracy appears to be stronger in more recent papers not surveyed in Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008).====The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a survey of the main issues in the ==== literature; Section 3 outlines the procedures followed to collect the sample of studies providing descriptive evidence and discusses the methodology; Section 4 provides results and findings of both meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis as well as predicted values from our preferred specification of the effect of democracy on growth.

Summer and Winter Olympic Games, FIFA World Cups, and Universal Expositions are considered. Results show that, when we take the year of the celebration of the event as the turning point, there is no robust evidence in favour of a positive impact on perceived corruption. However, when we take the election date of the host country as the threshold, the magnitude of the effect is lasting, reaching its maximum value 1–2 years before the celebration itself, and increasing the perceived level of corruption by about 4%.","Does the opportunity make the thief? One can argue that the temptation to steal increases with the potential gains, and that human nature tends to succumb to temptation. This incentive game could play an important role in the corruption panorama, a term denoting the level of “abuse of public or entrusted power for private gain”. When the public budget of the incumbent increases, the funds that can potentially be diverted also increase. In fact, the classic principal-agent problem describes bureaucrats as seekers of larger budgets in order to increase their power. But is bureaucratic power the only decisive element, or do the potential monetary gains, illegally obtained, also matter? In this context, the question arises: are politicians encouraged to engage in corrupt activities when the public budget increases temporarily? Such budget increases can originate from many causes, whether associated with expansionary public policies, or changes in the structure of public expenditures, or simply in response to an expansionary business cycle. One source, not necessarily included in these categories, is the hosting of mega-events, such as the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cups, and the Universal Expositions, which seem to be a perfect breeding ground for bribery or, at least, to increase citizens’ suspicions of politicians’ behaviour. Investment opportunities, mainly linked to the building of communication infrastructures, arenas, venues, or residential buildings, and other concession contracts, generate under-the-counter opportunities for both public and private participants.====Some recent examples spring to mind. At the international level, the so-called ==== investigates bribery, money laundering, and other frauds committed by officials of this international association, from the early 1990s, related to various FIFA World Cup championships. Even the selection of the next World Cup, which will be held in Qatar in 2022, has given rise to suspicion about the possible purchase of votes of the electors. Furthermore, several members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have been prosecuted for accepting bribes from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, responsible for hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Broadcasting TV rights are also in the public eye, with scandals such as the “International Sport and Leisure” case of fraud. Another common scheme is the commissioning of incumbents from private companies, mainly to win construction or services contracts. We will focus on this kind of corruption because it directly affects the perceived corruption at the country level, in contrast to the illegal or unethical behaviours of other stakeholders, such as individuals and international corporations that spread their effects across the globe.==== There are examples of illicit activities (with the trial underway or completed), for almost all recent mega-events, and it only requires a glance at the local media of a host country to realize the magnitude of the problem. Huge contracts awarded by two friends of the Russian Prime Minister for the Sochi Winter Olympics Games, or the allegations of bribery against Lula Da Silva involving the company Odebrecht after the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, are just two examples of this kind of corruption (Matheson et al., 2018). Sometimes, the illegal activities do not directly implicate politicians, but the lack of public regulation and control encourages public speculation, as is the case of the allegations of anticompetitive behaviour of multinational companies in South Africa and Brazil concerning the celebration of the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Games, respectively. Nevertheless, developing countries and sports competitions are not the only affected cases. For example, the investigation of the recent Universal Exposition held in Milan (Italy), resulted in the arrest of several ex-members of the parliament accused of influencing public tenders.====The Academic literature is aware of the severe effects of corruption. The consequences of corruption are innumerable and, generally, negative (against the so-called “greasing hypothesis”). Economic consequences of corruption are quite varied and well-documented: corruption erodes economic growth (Mauro, 1995; Méon and Sekkat, 2005; Aidt, 2009), mainly through the effects on investment and productivity (Salinas-Jiménez and Salinas-Jiménez, 2007), hinders economic development (Bardhan, 1997), worsens equality in the distribution of income (Gupta et al., 2002), affects the composition and efficiency of public expenditure (Del Monte and Papagni, 2001; Hessami, 2014), and increases the inflation rate (Al-Marhubi, 2000). A review of these economic effects can be found in Gupta and Abed (2002). Another victim of corruption is political stability, one of the transmission channels that, in turn, affects economic growth. Prior studies have analysed this issue, from the early work of Johnston (1986), on reconciling the various - and contradictory - lines of research into the political consequences of corruption, to the more recent contributions of Anderson and Tverdova (2003) and Bowler and Karp (2004), who shed light on the social crisis generated by corruption, and on the discredit of political institutions. Corruption is not restricted to the socio-economic and institutional spheres, but spreads its tentacles across the environment (Oliva, 2015) and public health (Ambraseys and Bilham, 2011; Hanf et al., 2011).====For all of these concerns, and in order to get to the heart of the problem, many existing papers have tried to identify the causes of corruption. Though we do not pretend to provide a comprehensive review of the literature, we can highlight several determinants. Most of the existing literature agrees that per capita income is the main factor in the level of corruption, maintaining a negative relationship (Ades and Di Tella, 1999, and Treisman, 2000, among many others). Other analyses highlight the trade-off between perceived corruption and factors such as the distribution of income (Paldam, 2002), commercial trade (Ades and Di Tella, 1997), financial flows (Wei and Shleifer, 2000), and globalization (Badinger and Nindl, 2014). On the other hand, the inflation rate (Braun, 2004) and the size of government (Kotera et al., 2012), especially in weak democracies, positively impact the country-level of perceived corruption. As for institutional determinants, the transparency of government (Elbahnasawy, 2014), its efficiency, the degree of intervention (Goel and Nelson, 2010), the level of political decentralization (Fan et al., 2009), and the social rights attained in the country (Brunetti and Weder, 2003) can all affect perceived corruption. Cultural factors may have an influence on corruption, since it has been demonstrated that ex-British colonies, countries ruled by common law (Herzfeld and Weiss, 2003) and countries where Protestantism is widespread (North et al., 2013), have lower levels of perceived corruption. Other determinants that appear in the literature include the level of education (Glaeser and Saks, 2006), ethnic diversity (Dincer, 2008), political stability (Lederman et al., 2005), and the availability of natural resources (Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010).====Hosting mega-events results in a ==== set of effects. The positive consequences of the celebration of mega-events for the host country are related to the tangible and intangible legacy (Gratton and Preuss, 2008). For the tangible legacy, the large amount of money spent on the organization of mega-events and other involved expenditures and changes exert an impact on the main economic variables.==== Brückner and Pappa (2015) identify some important macroeconomic outcomes of hosting the Olympic Games: investment, consumption, and output increase before the event in bidding and hosting countries, and continue to grow after the event in hosting countries. Rose and Spiegel (2011) study the trade effects, finding that a country where a mega-sport event is held, or simply if the country bids to host the event, increases exports by 30%. However, Langer et al. (2018) remark that these studies suffer from mis-specification problems, since they do not account for certain relevant determinants of income growth, and problems of comparison among heterogeneous countries (also noted in Maennig and Richter, 2012). Coates and Humphreys (2008) review the economic literature, showing that related analyses, nearly unanimously, do not find increases in wages, sales, or taxes when a mega-event is celebrated. Preuss (2004) states that the economic impacts of the Olympic Games are often overestimated, and Baade and Matheson (2016) assert that only under specific circumstances does a host city not lose money. In addition, there are other negative consequences: from social criticism arising from urban regeneration, to tourism sectors that do not benefit (Mitchell and Stewart, 2015) and cost overruns (which are always present in the Olympic Games, according to Flyvbjerg and Stewart, 2012). In fact, the population is aware of these adverse consequences and the recently-proposed public referenda in Vienna or Hamburg have decided against the hosting of the Olympic Games (Maennig, 2017), which could discourage politicians from bidding for such mega-sport events (Zimbalist, 2016).====The relationship between the hosting of mega-events and the level of perceived corruption has attracted academic interest but, generally, the analyses focus on specific case-studies, or evaluate the relationship from a normative perspective. For example, the OECD postulates that deficiencies in materials and worker conditions could be a result of payment of bribes by concessional companies (OECD, 2016). Maennig (2016) notes that mega-sport events financed without public funds lead to lower levels of corruption, because the opportunities for bribery are reduced, while identifying other proposals to reduce corruption in the context of hosting sports events. When control mechanisms work, non-monetary costs grow, so expected net utility decreases. However, to the best of our knowledge, scholarly attention has not focused on the quantitative relationship between the hosting of mega-events and the level of corruption perceived by citizens. Thus, on the face of it, the study and quantification of this potential relationship seems sensible.====In this research, we analyse the relationship between perceived corruption and the timing of the mega-events hosted by 34 OECD members, from 1996 to 2017. The selection of developed countries allows us to consider a homogeneous sample and, therefore, to choose the appropriate determinants of the perceived corruption, in order to isolate the effects of hosting mega-events. The estimation results of the empirical model show that, in countries where a mega-event has taken place, the level of corruption perceived by citizens increases, not after the opening of the event, but before, from the first announcement of the choice of the host country. This effect is dynamic, since perceived corruption increases, from the selection date, to reach the maximum, about 4% above the previous level, 1–2 years before the event takes place. Estimates suggest that the impact on the perceived corruption extends to the long run. This outcome is confirmed when several robustness checks are performed, which include changes in the sample, in the indicator of the perceived corruption, and the inclusion of additional covariates. Our results confirm the hypothesis previously established: opportunity increases illegal behaviours or, at least, increases the public perception of corruption.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and the methodology employed. Section 3 shows the main results and the robustness checks applied. Finally, Section 4 summarizes our main conclusions.

This paper studies the impact of regional governors’ tenure in office and their local ties on procurement performance in Russia. To identify the causal effect, we construct instruments for governor’s tenure by exploiting the regional vote share of ruling party in past parliament elections. We find the evidence that governors who do not have pre-governing local ties in the region (outsiders) demonstrate predatory behaviour, compared to governors with local ties (insiders). Namely, governors-outsiders restrict the competition at awarding stage significantly more than governors-insiders. Moreover, for governors-outsiders this restriction becomes stronger with tenure in office, while governors-insiders do not demonstrate such negative tenure effect. We argue that this restriction of competition by governors-outsiders cannot be explained by the intention of better contracts execution: the delays in execution and the probability of contract termination either increase or keep stable with tenure for governors-outsiders and these outcomes decrease with tenure for governors-insiders.","The quality of regional governance and regional institutions is considerably important for state–business relations. Public procurement constitutes one of the main mechanisms of state-business interactions and it plays a significant role in national economies.==== In imperfect democracies and autocracies, the personal role of governors is crucial for state-business interactions because the quality of regional governance is largely determined by governors and it depends on their incentives. These incentives evolve over time and are vulnerable to the risk of the governors losing power. Traditionally, the explanation of autocrat’s behaviour is related to the theory of ‘stationary’ and ‘roving’ bandits (Olson, 1993). A ‘stationary’ (looking-forward) ruler limits rent-seeking behaviour in the short-run to exchange the larger portion of a revenue for a smaller portion of a larger revenue (Tullock, 2002), while a ‘roving’ (myopic) ruler enjoys the short-run rent-seeking behaviour in the face of a forthcoming loss of power. The empirical testing of this theory, on both the national and sub-national levels, has led to controversial conclusions. On the one hand, the stability of an autocrat’s power, as measured by his∖her tenure, is favourable for shaping the business environment and improving institutions, whereas political uncertainty, as measured by incidents of turnover, negatively impacts economic growth and investment. On the other hand, a high rate of turnover may produce higher accountability of rulers, decrease political distortion in the economy and increase institutional quality. The more focused studies have shown that the latter effect is more pronounced when a ruler has local business interest or local ties, so that good quality of institutions would ‘insure’ that he/she would not lose his/her property after a turnover. Therefore, in addition to tenure and turnover rate, the ruler’s local ties play an essential role in shaping regional institutions.====This paper analyses the impact of autocratic governors’ tenure and their biographical local ties on public procurement performance on a sub-national level. It is quite natural to use the procurement outcomes of the subordinated local public organizations as governor’s performance indicators. Local public contracts are financed from the local budgets and, therefore, the contracts’ allocation may reveal the governor’s incentives. We conduct our analysis for sub-national regions in Russia that are of interest by several reasons. First, due to the transparency requirements in Russia, the information about population of procurement contracts is open. Second, Russia is characterized by weak democracy, where the federal center either directly appoints and dismisses regional governors or has strong control over regional governors’ election. Third, the governors’ stability in office is mostly determined by their political loyalty to center, while governors have enough freedom to shape regional economic development. Combination of these factors enables to use Russia as wonderful example to study the role of autocratic governors for public procurement performance.====We collect the contract-level data for population of procurements of road construction and repair works in Russian regions during 2011–2014. These procurements were conducted by regional and municipal authorities and, potentially, could be supervised by regional elites. The database accounts for more than 120,000 contracts. Our main focus is to study the impact of governors’ tenure in office==== and local ties on the level of competition at auctions. However, to have an unambiguous interpretation, we also study executional stage of the contracts. Procurement competition is measured by the number of bidders at auctions. At the executional stage, we consider delay and termination in contract execution. Since tenure in office is endogenous, in order to have causal interpretation, we construct instruments for governor’s tenure by exploiting the regional vote share of ruling party in past parliament elections. The choice of road construction and repair procurement is motivated by two reasons. First, this type of procurement constitutes a significant part of annual regional budget expenditures.==== Second, road construction projects are close to the financial interests of local elites. Two are the examples of corruption scandals in procurement of road constructions works resulting in the arrest of governors Alexander Solovyov==== and Boris Dubrovsky.====We find the evidence that the local ties and the tenure of governors are important to explain the level of competition at auctions and contracts’ execution. The auctions conducted during the period of governors with local ties (‘insiders’) being in office, on average, demonstrate a 5% higher level of competition than the auctions of governors without local ties (‘outsiders’). Moreover, for governors-outsiders, we observe a negative effect of tenure on competition, with a reduction of competition by 2.5% for incumbent governors, while for governors-insiders there is no effect of tenure. The restriction of competition by governors-outsiders may be interpreted in two different ways. The first interpretation says that the restriction of competition indicates favouritism in contract allocation. The second interpretation argues that the deliberate restriction of competition is aimed to exclude incompetent and non-qualified participants, so the contracts are better executed. To disentangle these two interpretations, we further analyse the executional stage of the contracts by considering delays and terminations of the contracts. On average, delays in contract execution are 16% (of contract duration) lower for governors-insiders, while the probabilities of contract termination are equal for insiders and outsiders. For governors-insiders longer time in office causes the reduction of both delay and probability of contract termination. For governors-outsiders, the delays increase by 20% for incumbent governors and probability of contract termination keeps stable over time in office. Therefore, we do not find a support for the second interpretation of competition restriction by governors-outsiders and conclude that there is favouritism in their behaviour.====The paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, this study is closely related to that of Coviello and Gagliarducci (2017). Authors use Italian procurement data and show that longer time in office of municipal majors cause lower procurement competition with a higher probability of contracts being allocated to locally based firms. Unlike Italy, the electoral accountability of Russian governors is significantly lower. Therefore, our analysis is for a different political setting – autocracy, where the stationary and roving bandit theory can be tested. Moreover, following the literature, we take into account local ties together with political stability of governors, which makes this paper different from that of Coviello and Gagliarducci (2017). Second, the paper adds to the strand of empirical literature on stationary and roving bandits by considering public procurement as governors’ performance outcomes, while other papers consider the quality of regional institutions as outcomes (investment activity, taxation, corruption, and property rights). The paper confirms that governors-outsiders demonstrate ‘predatory’ behaviour (Libman et al., 2012) and that the presence of local ties reduces this negative effect (Polishchuk and Syunyaev, 2015).====The article is structured as follows. The next section presents an overview of the literature and state the hypotheses. Section 2 explains the institutional background in Russia. Section 3 is devoted to a description of procurement and governors’ data. In Section 4, we formulate the empirical strategy, and the results are presented in Section 5.

This paper argues that educational background plays an important role in shaping leaders' ideas and beliefs, which in turn matter for policy making in the long run. Using a cross-country data covering 137 countries and regions over 1960–2005, the paper documents a robustly positive relationship between leaders educational attainment and faster liberal reforms, regardless of regime type. The effects are more salient for leaders who majored in economics, social science, and natural science. Moreover, the effects of education seem to be orthogonal to alternative channels such as partisan politics, geopolitical factors, and public opinions.","The triumph of capitalism is one of the most significant events in the 20th century (Frieden, 2007; Shleifer, 2009). Economic liberalization has become a compelling choice for policy makers around the world, notwithstanding debates about its growth impacts (Estevadeordal and Taylor, 2013; Heybey and Peter Murrell, 1999; Rodrik, 2006). Conventional wisdom attributes the prominence of the liberalization paradigm to institutional, geopolitical, and partisan factors (Berger et al., 2013; Dutt and Mitra, 2005; Giavazzi and Guido, 2005; Giuliano et al., 2013; Haggard and Webb, 1994). By contrast, more recent literature focuses on how political leaders may play an active role in driving policies and economic performance (Dreher et al., 2009; Jones and Benjamin, 2005).====These explanations for economic liberalization stem from two different views on political leadership. The first, the representation view, emphasizes that leaders behave within constraints and their behaviors are motivated by specific interests. According to this view, polarized policy positions are a reflection of divided economic interests (Lipset and Stein, 1967; Grossman and Helpman, 1996; Roemer, 1999). The second, the autonomy view, suggests that leaders exert impacts on policies (Schumpeter, 1942, 2010; Przeworski, 2014). The second view has an obvious implication for scholars to pay more attention to the effects of leaders’ characteristics on policy making.====This paper aims to add to the second route of the literature by studying how political leaders’ educational attainment and fields affect their choices of economic liberalization. We understand education as a source of ideas, a belief about how the economy works. Ample evidence from experiments and surveys shows that the behavior of students who are economics majors more often exhibits individualism and self-interested motivation (Bauman and Rose, 2011; Carter and Michael Irons, 1991; Frank et al., 1993; Hausman and McPherson, 1993; Kirchgässner, 2005). It is not obvious, however, whether more education must promote pro-market values. After all, highly educated “intellectuals are disproportionately opposed to capitalism as compared with other groups of similar socioeconomic status within capitalist society” (Nozick, 1998). There has been little empirical research on how educational attainment affects the policy preferences of political elites.====The paper addresses this issue by analyzing the relationship between national leaders’ education and economic liberalization among 137 countries for 1960–2005. We combine two sources of data. First, we construct a data set covering the biographic information for 841 heads of national government. The data set documents a rich set of personal characteristics of leaders, such as years and level of education, fields of study, career paths, and family backgrounds. We follow the coding criteria of existing data sets, most notably Archigos (Goemans and Chiozza, 2009), and supplement them with manually collected information. Second, we rely on a data set on economic liberalization, as measured by changing statutory contents over time, constructed by the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Giuliano et al., 2013).====Our analysis establishes a robustly positive relationship between leaders' total years of education and reforms toward economic liberalization during the leaders’ tenure. This relationship holds in democracies as well as autocracies, and in parliamentary as well as presidential systems. Further investigation on the fields of study suggests that the effect is more pronounced for economics (and business), social science, and natural science. By contrast, higher education in engineering, humanities, and the military does not produce a strong effect of inducing liberalization relative to less educated leaders.====The empirical investigation provides tests of potential bias in the estimates due to nonrandom selection of leaders. First, we examine whether the effect of education could be correlated with pretrends of reforms in a dynamic model. The test finds no evidence that reform is correlated with the trajectory of reform prior to the leaders' entry. Meanwhile, years of education have a persistently positive impact of inducing reforms throughout a leader's tenure. We also follow Jones and Benjamin (2005) in estimating the effect of education years on a small sample of unpredicted leadership transitions. We find that transitions to more highly educated leaders tended to bring forth reforms, and the magnitudes of the estimated effects are considerably larger than the baseline results.====The paper also tests for alternative confounding channels. We find the following. First, although affiliation with left-wing parties lowers the pace of reform, the effect of leaders' education is orthogonal to the influence of political parties. Second, the effect remains robust when accounting for regional and geopolitical factors. Third, the effect of education does not seem to be driven by leaders' responsiveness to public opinions related to economic liberty. These results are consistent with the theoretical explanation that education affects leaders’ policy preferences through shaping their ideas rather than interest politics.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the overall patterns of leaders’ education and economic liberalization from the 1960s to the 2000s. Section 4 introduces the data. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy. Section 6 reports the baseline results, which is followed in section 7 by tests on the dynamic effects of education. Section 8 proceeds with tests on alternative channels. Section 9 concludes.","Empowering knowledge: Political leaders, education, and economic liberalization",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019300795,31 October 2019,2019,Research Article,218.0

Some blame the EDP for imposing too much fiscal ====. Others question whether the EDP has any disciplining power at all. To test its actual effects, we construct a real-time database of EDP recommendations and estimate augmented real-time and ex-post fiscal reaction functions for a panel of EMU member states. Overall, we find that a 1% of GDP larger EDP recommendation leads to 0.8–0.9% of GDP of additional fiscal consolidation plans, and 0.6–0.7% of actual consolidation. This result does not extend to countries subject to financial support programs: we find that, while they did implement substantial consolidation measures, in these countries required and delivered consolidation efforts are less connected. Overall, our results suggest that EDP recommendations have substantially shaped fiscal policies in the euro area, especially in the years 2010–2014, when EDP recommendations were most frequent.","The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) combines centralized monetary policy with fiscal policy at the national level. With monetary policy responding only weakly to the economic circumstances in individual countries, it was recognized early on that this could incentivize countries to run overly expansionary fiscal policies (see e.g. EC, 1990). Furthermore, it was suspected that the counterforce against unsustainable fiscal policy provided by market forces “might either be too slow and weak or too sudden and disruptive” (Delors, 1989). For these reasons, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 introduced supranational fiscal rules in the form of the (in)famous 3%- and 60%-thresholds for the government deficit and debt, respectively.====European fiscal rules were operationalized in 1997 in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). As the concerns regarding market discipline proving prescient (Buti and Carnot, 2012; De Grauwe and Ji, 2012), the importance given to EMU's supranational fiscal rules only increased over time. Notwithstanding amendments to the SGP in 2005 and 2011, the 3%-threshold for the government budget deficit has played a pivotal role throughout.==== In short, countries whose budget deficit exceeds or is projected to exceed 3% of GDP end up in the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), where they receive binding recommendations on the annual fiscal adjustments to be undertaken. Countries failing to live up to these recommendations can, eventually, be fined.====The SGP, in particular the 3%-rule and its focus on cutting back high deficits rapidly, has been criticized from opposite ends. Some view the SGP and its EDP recommendations as an unwelcome restriction, limiting the scope for fiscal stabilization at the national level (e.g. Buiter et al., 1993; Bofinger, 2003; Truger, 2013). Others, however, question whether the SGP and its procedures have any actual disciplining power, as deadlines for reducing deficits below 3% of GDP are regularly missed and fines have never been imposed (Schuknecht et al., 2011).====Remarkably, the effect of EDP recommendations on the fiscal behavior of EMU member states has never been analyzed in a direct manner. Some authors use the 3%-threshold to define the applicable fiscal governance regime, generally finding that – at least – forecasted deficits fall faster when this threshold is exceeded (Beetsma and Giuliodori, 2009; Cimadomo, 2012; Frankel and Schreger, 2013). However, this does not do justice to the fact that EDP recommendations vary in size and timing between countries, depending on e.g. economic circumstances.==== Other papers infer the effectiveness of European fiscal rules from a comparison of fiscal policy before and after the introduction of the SGP, or between countries in- and outside the euro area.==== These approaches are also not without complications. The introduction of the SGP was not a standalone event and the run-up to EMU hardly qualifies as neutral benchmark, given that it was characterized by a fiscal push to meet the convergence criteria.====In this paper we take a different route and directly analyze the impact of EDP recommendations on forecasted and actual fiscal policy. Based on the incentives generated by the EDP, we hypothesize that i) EDP recommendations will induce governments to consolidate, ii) recommendations will induce countries to forecast a larger adjustment than delivered, and iii) medium-sized recommendations will be obeyed best.====To bring these hypotheses to the test, we construct a new real-time database of all country-specific EDP recommendations issued since the introduction of the euro, taking account of the fact that recommendations are often revised and changed. Additionally, we expand the real-time database of the European Commission's (EC) fiscal forecasts constructed by Gilbert and De Jong (2017) to include Autumn Forecasts, and three additional years of data.====Then, we estimate both real-time and ex-post fiscal reaction functions for a panel of EMU member states over the period 1999–2017. To capture the usual determinants of fiscal policy, we allow discretionary fiscal policy to react to the past budget deficit, the debt level, the output gap, and – to account for potential political business cycles – planned elections.==== Moreover, we control for market pressure, by including sovereign yield spreads as a regressor, and for the presence of financial support programs. We then include EDP recommendations applicable at a specific forecast vintage as an additional explanatory variable, to test whether EDP recommendations affect fiscal policy once regular determinants are controlled for.====Countries in an EDP, however, almost by definition have budget deficits exceeding 3% of GDP. High deficits may be correlated with factors inducing a change in fiscal behavior other than EDP recommendations. To the extent that this is not picked up by our control variables, we allow the shape of the fiscal reaction function to vary with the level of the deficit in an extension of our regression model.====We find that EDP recommendations significantly affect both planned and actual fiscal policy. A 1% of GDP larger EDP recommendation leads to about 0.8–0.9% of GDP of forecasted additional fiscal consolidation, and 0.6–0.7% of actual consolidation. This result does not extend to countries subject to financial support programs: for this group we find that, while they implemented substantial consolidation measures, the exact amount was unconnected to the adjustment demanded. We furthermore find evidence of a non-linear reaction of fiscal policy to the level of the budget deficit, but this does not affect our estimated effect of EDP recommendations. Our results are robust to a number of sample and specification choices.====We finally present some suggestive evidence that ‘medium-sized’ recommendations are lived up to better than either small or large recommendations. Non-compliance with small recommendations can arguably be relatively easily set aside as the result of data measurement problems, while large required adjustments might be too difficult or politically painful to be carried out in full.====Overall, our results suggest that the SGP cannot be dismissed as ineffective: EDP recommendations have had a significant effect on fiscal policy in EMU member states. This implies that in particular in the post-2009 period, when a large majority of member states was subject to an EDP, the SGP has shaped fiscal policies in the euro area. Whether the SGP in its current form is also a desirable way of disciplining member states however requires more research into the effects of the SGP on macroeconomic stabilization as well as into the effectiveness and consequences of the newer elements of the SGP, such as the debt-brake and the preventive arm.====Section 2 of this paper provides a description of the European fiscal framework, explains how this framework affects incentives for national fiscal policy, and presents an overview of related literature.

We also point to several additional unintended consequences of cash elimination.,"In recent years, policy makers throughout the world are promoting the idea of eliminating cash with the aim of suppressing unreported economic activity====. This move is supported by some research. Rogoff (2015) suggests that cash viewed as “anonymous money” is a facilitator of tax evasion and illegal activity. According to Rogoff’s estimates “a large percentage of currency in most countries, generally well over 50%, is used precisely to hide transactions.” Phasing out cash raises a heated policy debate (Rogoff, 2015, 2017).====While there are reasons to believe that eliminating cash might interfere with the effectiveness of the non-observed economy (NOE), or simply an informal sector====, there are other possible implications of eliminating cash that have been, to the best of our knowledge, overlooked. We divide them into two broad categories.====The first category is purely economic. Eliminating cash can generate segmented markets. Our main claim is based on the Ricardian argument. Going cashless can diminish opportunities to specialize, thus reducing the comparative advantage of productive inputs and yielding misallocation of resources. This can even lead to a decrease in the size of the observed economy. We do not consider tax evasion====, which has been extensively discussed in the literature in this context (Rogoff, 2015).====There are other implications of eliminating cash that are beyond the scope of the simple economic model. We group them in the second category, socio-political. Reliance on enforcement mechanisms within an informal sector to back up future promises and emergence of new illicit ways to create fictitious value in the formal sector are a few such examples. We discuss them in section 3.",Towards a cashless economy: Economic and socio-political implications,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019301843,1 October 2019,2019,Research Article,220.0

To do that, we measure the impact of competition between state and non-state legal authorities on the number of disputes and on the amount of fines charged per dispute. Our results suggest a potential negative externality between regimes for civil disputes that is, an increase in the cost of apprehending a person and a reduction in the amount of fines per dispute collected when two regimes operate in the same village. This indicates that a potential benefit to the local people from multiple competing regimes is a reduction on expected authoritative expropriation.","As is often the case in post-colonial societies, Sierra Leone is an example of a nation governed under multiple legal regimes, one instituted by the nation-state when administered by a colonial power and one existing before the state came into being. The traditional legal regime evolved within local rural communities and existed over many years, while the colonial legal regime was transplanted from the ruling European power (here, the United Kingdom) by means of its establishment primarily within a colonial capital (here, Freetown). With time, there was an attempt to diffuse the authority of the state regime outside of the capital, through the establishment of a set of rural authorities (labelled the “Paramount Chieftaincy”) (Jackson (2011)). For most of a hundred years, the two regimes have operated in tandem, albeit with a significant amount of popular dissatisfaction regarding their method and mode of operation.====In Sierra Leone, the outcome of any legal claim frequently results in a benefit primarily for the court authority (either by reason of the authority placing a general fine or labour penalty on the person concerned, or by asserting a claim on behalf of the rights of the same elite). Evidence for this sort of practice is observed in the relationship between legal disputes==== and the work cycle, where the elite’s need for workers is seen to be related to the number of actions being prosecuted (Mokuwa et al. (2011)). This practice is also evident in the prevalence of claims for items such as “woman damage” (adultery), where the elite makes use of their rights over women to generate actions against unentitled men.==== Unlike places where courts are reactive, claims prosecuted within these sorts of legal regimes are more proactive====, and can be used as a general mechanism for placing claims upon the labour or other resources of the subject populace.====This paper attempts to analyse how the two legal regimes state and non-state that coexist in Sierra Leone are used for expropriation of the populace. Similar to other research that has examined the roles of legal regimes in Africa (Gennaioli and Rainer (2007), Platteau (2009), Glennerster et al. (2013), Logan (2013) and Cecchi and Melesse (2016)), we examine how these two institutional authorities have interacted in their administration of villages in a given region the Gola forest in postconflict Sierra Leone and whether multiple legal regimes increase or decrease authoritative expropriation.====To conduct our empirical analysis, we exploit the consequences of a historical event. Sierra Leone’s long civil war (1991–2002) severely damaged both the country’s state and non-state legal regimes (Fanthorpe (2006), Bellows and Miguel (2006) and Mokuwa et al. (2011)). The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) sought out and killed many of those who administered the law. In rural areas, the state legal structure was entirely destroyed during the war. In certain villages, the non-state legal system also suffered a significant weakening of capacity due to the killing of large numbers of village chiefs and elders (the primary administrators of non-state courts) (Jackson (2011)).==== The entirety of both regimes was moved back towards “year zero” by the end of the conflict.====Following concerted efforts by international donors, the state legal infrastructure was completely rebuilt from 2005, and commenced functioning as a newly initiated state regime. At the same time, the non-state system was also reestablished in many places, and new chiefs and elders came into being. Yet, in some villages in the Gola forest, the non-state system took years to be reestablished or was not reestablished at all. By indiscriminately killing village chiefs in many areas, the rebel forces destroyed the traditional justice system in some villages and not others. This allows us to compare villages where there were two legal regimes, with villages where only the state regime operated.====We examine two ways in which legal regimes can interact: on the number of disputes and on the amount of fines collected per dispute. Our results suggest that there are negative externalities for civil disputes between regimes; that is, the number of disputes per person is smaller when two regimes operate than it would be if there were no externalities. We also show that there is reduction on the magnitude of fines per dispute when state and non-state regimes coexist. Overall, this indicates that legal competition might reduce the expected amount of authoritative expropriation that occurs in this society.====Building upon the idea of governance systems or authorities in newly developing areas (see Olson (2000), McGuire and Olson (1996) and van Besouw et al. (2016)), we offer a possible interpretation for our empirical results.==== We focus on competition based on quantities (number of disputes) and model both regimes as organs seeking to assert authority over the same populace in a given territory.==== Each unit would like to maximise its area of governance and the number of people from which it is able to appropriate rents (or fines in this case). A regime may attempt to exert authority over a population, but be limited in its ability by reason of the costs of doing so. One reason that there may be costs in asserting authority is the spatial cost of governance; that is, a regime’s ability to exercise authority may be potentially wasting with distance. Another reason that the costs of asserting authority may vary is the existence of other, competing regimes. It might be the case that multiple governance regimes complement one another in enforcement, resulting in reduced costs at the intersection. Alternatively, it could be the case that the intersecting regimes create interference for one another, resulting in extra costs. Here, we see pluralism more like a contest between regimes competing to assert governance, and their interaction may create costs to one another.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 relates this paper to existing literature.

Players bargain over policies in an infinite horizon. In each period, a sequential protocol of proposal-making and voting, with random proposer recognitions and a simple majority, produces a policy that becomes the next period's status-quo; the status-quo is endogenous. The construction relies on ==== strategies determined by ==== computed by the ==== we provide. A strategic bliss point, the dynamic utility ideal, is a moderate policy relative to a bliss point, the static utility ideal. Moderation is strategic and germane to the dynamic environment; players moderate in order to constrain the future proposals of opponents. Moderation is a strategic substitute; when a player's opponents do moderate, she does not, and when they do not moderate, she does. We provide conditions under which the simple strategies induced by the strategic bliss points computed by the algorithm deliver a Stationary Markov Perfect equilibrium, and we prove its existence in generic games with impatient players and in symmetric games. Because the algorithm constructs ==== equilibria in simple strategies, we provide their general characterization, and we show their generic uniqueness.","Many real world policies and spending programs persist and evolve in time, are determined repeatedly, and their changes are enacted under the shadow of the extant legislation that is revised and becomes the new status-quo. Dynamic legislative bargaining models reflect these features. The models build on static non-cooperative models of legislative bargaining in the spirit of Baron and Ferejohn (1989). In these models negotiations follow a sequential protocol of proposal-making and voting, either in ==== bargaining over the allocation of benefits, or in ==== bargaining over choices of policies. The static models assume bargaining terminates upon an agreement being reached. The dynamic models instead embed the static decision-making protocol as a stage game in an infinite horizon repeated interaction. In each stage game the status-quo is the policy last enacted, making the current decision future status-quo and inducing a dynamic, not just repeated, strategic situation.====Starting with Baron (1996), the dynamic legislative bargaining literature has been steadily growing (see next section for an overview). Kalandrakis (2004b) was the first to characterize the Markov equilibrium for the dynamic version of the distributive model. In the absence of applicable existence theorems for Markovian equilibria, his characterization constitutes an existence proof as well. In the continuing absence of the existence theorems, and due to the lack of similar characterization for the spatial model, the existence and properties of Markov equilibria in the dynamic spatial model remain unknown.====In this paper we prove, using constructive arguments, the existence of Markov equilibria in a dynamic spatial legislative bargaining model. A group of legislators repeatedly sets policy in a one-dimensional policy space. The preferences of the legislators are quadratic, characterized by ====, the most preferred policies. In each period of infinite horizon a randomly selected legislator puts forward a proposal. Majoritarian voting between the proposal and the status-quo determines the winning alternative that yields utility to the legislators and becomes the status-quo for the subsequent period. The status-quo evolves endogenously and depends on the identity of the proposer and the votes of the entire legislature in every period.====We start the equilibrium construction by defining ==== stationary Markovian proposal strategies. A Markovian proposal strategy maps the state, the status-quo, into a policy proposal. A simple stationary Markovian proposal strategy depends on a single parameter, the policy a player proposes when the status-quo gives her ample bargaining power. In the static setting this parameter would be the player's bliss point, the policy maximizing the static utility of a player. In the dynamic setting this parameter is the ====, the policy maximizing the dynamic utility of a player. The crux of the construction is an ==== generating the strategic bliss points.====The construction allows us to prove two main results. Theorem 1 shows that a Stationary Markov Perfect equilibrium (SMPE) in simple strategies exists if and only if the algorithm produces strategic bliss points that satisfy a condition we derive. Thus, an SMPE exists when the condition holds. Theorem 2 provides several less complex and easier to verify conditions that imply SMPE existence. In particular, we prove that an SMPE exists either generically in games with impatient players or in symmetric games under a mild restriction on the players’ patience that ceases to bind as the number of players increases.==== Although not generally, the construction also works and an SMPE exists outside of these two classes of games. One must, however, specify a meaningful class of games for which it does.====The algorithm produces ==== profiles of strategic bliss points that support an SMPE in simple strategies. Our analysis of the profiles from the algorithm thus provides a general characterization of all SMPE in simple strategies for any dynamic spatial legislative bargaining game. And the analysis shows that the algorithm produces multiple profiles under non-generic conditions.==== and its ==== nature are at the core of our equilibrium construction. This is the main insight of the paper. A player moderates when she proposes her strategic bliss point, which is a more moderate policy - closer to the median - than her (static) bliss point. A player moderates in order to constrain opponents; by moving the status-quo closer to median's bliss point, future proposals are constrained to be moderate as well. When the opponents ==== moderate, they are effectively constraining themselves, so that the player has no incentive to moderate. If the opponents ==== moderate, the player herself has an incentive to do so; that is, moderation is strategic substitute. As a result, all the equilibria that we construct induce asymmetric moderation (in terms of who moderates and to what extent), even if the underlying game is symmetric.====Moderation and its intensity are the result of two opposing forces. The first force is standard; proposals are pushed towards the proposers’ stage utility optimum, their bliss points. The second force is strategic; proposals are pushed towards the bliss point of the median player, with proposers aiming to constrain the future policies of all other players. These two forces cancel out at the strategic bliss point. The strategic force gains prominence and the extent of moderation increases with the patience of the players and with the higher probability of recognition of direct opponents - those with bliss points on the other side of the median.",Simple Markovian equilibria in dynamic spatial legislative bargaining,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018303082,21 September 2019,2019,Research Article,222.0

To answer this question, we use a survey data set that offers information on respondents’ support for referendums as a procedure to decide on tax policy, their income levels, socio-economic characteristics, and, most importantly, their expectation about the majority’s support for higher ","There is a well-established literature in political economics that analyzes the effect of institutions and constitutional rules on economic and social outcomes (see Persson and Tabellini, 2003; Acemoglu et al., 2005; and Voigt, 2011 for surveys). More recently, however, researchers have started to ==== the choice of these institutions, explaining the emergence of different “rules of the game” as the outcome of a struggle between different interests in a heterogeneous society. Diverse as they may be, these contributions share a common logic: individuals prefer those procedures which maximize the likelihood that the eventual political-economic equilibrium furthers their material interests.====While the logic underlying these contributions is consistent with economic reasoning, it does not go uncontested: for example, Rodrik (2014) deplores the rather negligent treatment of “ideas” in the political-economic analysis of policy innovations, arguing that “… much human behavior is driven by abstract ideals, sacred values, or conceptions of loyalty that cannot be reduced to economic ends” (Rodrik, 2014:191). In a similar spirit, political science, psychology and behavioral economics offer a wealth of alternative motives beyond pure material interest that contribute to understanding the choice of decision-making procedures. Given the potential relevance of ==== motives, which evaluate procedures with respect to their transparency, fairness, practicability etc., but not with respect to their consequences for individual payoffs, the importance of ==== motives, emphasized by standard economic analysis, is ultimately an empirical question.====In this paper, we put the idea that material interests are important in shaping individuals’ preferences over alternative decision-making procedures to a test: we use data from a self-designed survey among German residents that asks individuals whether they support the use of referendums as a procedure to decide on redistributive taxation. Along with the answer to this question, the survey provides us with information on respondents’ income and other socio-economic characteristics. Most importantly, the survey asks participants whether they expect a ==== of the population to be ==== or ==== higher taxes. Unlike other empirical studies of endogenous constitutional choice, we thus do not have to rely on a mere ==== that individuals are able to correctly anticipate the political-economic equilibrium emerging from different procedural alternatives. Instead, these expectations are explicitly addressed in the context of the survey, and we can test the simple hypothesis that individuals with a low (high) income are more (less) likely to support referendums if they expect a clear majority to be in favor of higher taxes. If the support (or rejection) of direct democracy was predominantly driven by intrinsic motives – say, the belief that referendums are an optimal procedure in terms of fairness, transparency and practicability – neither individuals’ incomes nor their expectations about the majority’s position on redistribution should play a role for their preferences over procedures.====Our empirical results offer a mixed picture: we find that respondents who report a monthly net household income below 1700 Euros – i.e. clearly below the population average in Germany – and who expect the majority of the population to be in favor of higher taxes are 23 percent ==== likely to support referendums as a procedure to decide on taxation than low-income respondents who do not share these expectations. However, we do not find that the expectation of a majority in favor of higher taxes makes respondents with a net household income above 4000 Euros ==== likely to support referendums than individuals with an average income who share these expectations. In fact, there are some respondents who support a referendum as a method to decide on redistributive taxation even if this would be very likely to lower their after-tax income. We cautiously interpret the latter finding as evidence that some individuals assign an intrinsic value to direct democracy, which complements – and sometimes even dominates – material interests.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys the relevant literature, while Section 3 presents a simple model that motivates the subsequent empirical analysis. Section 4 introduces the structure of our survey data set. In Section 5, we provide some first descriptive evidence on the relationship between individuals’ income, their expectations on the majority’s position, and their choice of procedure. Section 6 then presents the results of multinomial logit regressions which analyze how a combination of household income and majority expectations affects respondents’ procedural choices.

We use micro data on residents of 25 European countries and employ alternative measures of judicial quality as perceived by the residents of these countries. As an instrument for judicial quality we employ the procedures with which prosecutors and judges are appointed to their posts in each country. As alternative instruments, we employ an index of de jure institutional quality as well as its components, which provide similar results. The findings show that an increase in the perception of the quality of judicial institutions, such as an improvement in judicial independence or the impartiality of the courts, has a deterrent effect on dishonest and criminal acts. A higher perceived quality of the judicial system also makes individuals less likely to find acceptable a variety of dishonest and illicit behaviors, suggesting that institutions help shape the beliefs of the society. We obtain the same results when we analyze the sample of immigrants, whose cultural attributes should be (more) related to their countries of origin, rather than their countries of residence, and thus should be arguably uncorrelated with the factors that can impact the instrument. We show that people’s beliefs in the importance of the family, in the fairness of others, and the importance of being rich are not impacted by judicial quality, suggesting that judicial quality is not a blanket representation of underlying cultural norms and beliefs in the society.","There are substantial differences between countries in the extent to which people consider illegal or dishonest behavior acceptable. For example, to the question “How wrong is it to buy something you thought might be stolen?” only 3.8 percent of people in Denmark respond to indicate that it is “Not wrong at all” or “A bit wrong”. The approval rate of the act of buying a stolen good is 12.4 percent in the Netherlands, 18.1 percent in Bulgaria, 22.4 percent in France, and 30.4 percent in Russia. While 13.2 percent of Ukrainians find that bribery is “not wrong at all”, or “a bit wrong”, only less than one percent of people in Iceland think that bribery is acceptable behavior. The approval rate of bribery is 3.2 percent in Germany, 5.7 percent in Belgium, and 6.8 percent in Spain.====As there are significant differences between countries in the rate at which people tolerate dishonesty, there is a similarly sizable between-country variation in crime rates, corruption, and other illegal activity. There were 1750 reported thefts per 100,000 inhabitants in Italy in 2011, but the rate was 931 in Portugal, and 605 in Poland.==== The murder rate was 0.88 in Denmark, 1.08 in Portugal, and 2.29 in Turkey in that same year. While some of these differences in crime rates can be explained by variations in deterrence, labor market conditions, and income levels between countries, a significant amount of variation in illegal activity remains unexplained.====Motivated by these observations, and to provide new insights into the question of “Why does ==== and ==== vary so much between countries?”, in this paper we investigate the extent to which differences in the perceived quality of judicial institutions between countries help explain the differences in ====, as well as the ====. Specifically, we analyze whether the quality perception of a country’s legal institutions has an impact on individuals’ propensity to engage in illicit activity in that country, ranging from falsifying official documents to buying stolen goods to concealing the defects of a second-hand product when selling it. We also investigate whether people’s beliefs about the appropriateness of dishonesty are impacted by the quality of judicial institutions to which they are exposed. Examples of such beliefs are the extent to which people agree or disagree with such statements as ==== The full list of the variables used in the analyses and their definitions are provided in Table 1.====We use micro data on the residents of 25 European countries who are surveyed between 2004 and 2011 to investigate whether indicators of perceived judicial quality, such as the independence of the country’s judiciary, the impartiality of the courts, or the protection of property rights have an impact on citizens’ proclivity to break the law or to engage in dishonest activity, and on the extent to which people believe that dishonest behavior is acceptable.====The paper contributes to the economics of crime literature by adding the quality of the judicial system to the economic analysis of criminal decision-making. Research in economics has produced a significant amount of credible information regarding the causal impact of key determinants of criminal activity (Mocan and Bali, 2010; Drago et al., 2009; Corman and Mocan 2000, 2005; Machin and Meghir, 2004; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004; Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001). The variation in crime rates ==== countries, however, cannot be fully explained by making use of the causal estimates of the determinants of crime obtained from existing studies. Thus, between-country variation in judicial quality might help improve the understanding of the variation in illicit activity between countries.====The paper also contributes to the literature that investigates the determinants and the evolution of culture. Cultural beliefs and values of a society, even those that are based on superstition, can be persistent across generations (Mocan and Yu, 2017). Yet, cultural beliefs are also malleable and they react to the economic and social environment.==== Specifically, institutions can impact individual behavior and the beliefs and cultural values of the society because institutions can create incentives/disincentives for people to behave in certain ways, and common behavioral patterns lead to the formation of cultural norms in the society. For example, it has been hypothesized that the creation of modern states in Europe was the conduit through which the citizens of those states adopted the norms of law-abiding and civility (Elias, 1994), and modern societies can be defined as those in which citizens abide by the rules of law, because these rules of behavior, produced by institutions, have become a cultural norm (Foucault, 1995). More formally, building on the work of Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001) and Bisin et al. (2004), Tabellini (2008) developed a model to analyze the endogenous evolution of norms and values, where parents choose the values to pass on their offspring and they assess their children’s welfare using their own values. The model generates strategic complementarity between behavior and norms. In this setting, well-functioning legal institutions generate good values in society, implying that institutional quality and culture are complements. On the other hand, the model of Aghion et al. (2010) suggests that formal institutions and heavy regulations can diminish the marginal returns to being honest and trustworthy. Thus, institutions can crowd out honesty. It is therefore theoretically unclear whether high quality institutions would foster or impede honest behavior and better values.","Quality of judicial institutions, crimes, misdemeanors, and dishonesty",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018305081,12 September 2019,2019,Research Article,224.0

As infrastructure expenditures are considered a bi-partisan priority, we hypothesize that divided governments expand infrastructure spending compared to governments under true Democratic or Republican control. We test this hypothesis using U.S. state-level data over the period 1970 to 2008 and find that divided governments indeed increase expenditures for these budget categories. Specifically, divided governments spend more on transportation than unified Democratic governments, and more on education and social services than unified Republican governments. The effect is most pronounced for the core infrastructure of transportation and even stronger when only looking at capital outlays instead of total expenditures.","In recent years, America's allegedly ‘crumbling infrastructure’ has been a prominent topic of public debate. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act following the financial crisis, large amounts have been spent on infrastructure maintenance and upgrades. Still, the American Society of Civil Engineers graded America's infrastructure only as D+ in their latest national report card issued in 2017.====In 2018, President Donald Trump has reinforced that infrastructure expenditures are a key priority also under his presidency. According to his infrastructure plan unveiled in February 2018, USD 200 billion in federal money should generate total expenditures of USD 1.5 trillion by leveraging local and state taxes and private investment for repairing and upgrading America's infrastructure.====Expenditures on infrastructure are often considered a bi-partisan priority, in contrast to other government policies such as public welfare, which are subject to partisanship. Therefore, government expenditures for infrastructure may be particularly high in situations of divided government, when at least one chamber of the legislature is not controlled by the party that holds the governorship. In this situation, parties are not able to implement their preferred policies, but need to find a consensus with the opponent party (see, e.g., Alesina and Rosenthal, 1995, 1996, or Bjørnskov and Potrafke, 2013). Higher infrastructure spending may be one potential outcome of this balancing of policies between the opposing parties. In particular, compromise may take the form that each party allows the opposing party some additional spending in policy domains of key interest.====We test this hypothesis based on U.S. state-level data on infrastructure expenditures over the period 1970–2008 from the U.S. Census Bureau. In addition to looking at total capital outlays as an overall measure of infrastructure expenditures, we adopt a relatively broad concept of infrastructure and analyze the impact of divided government on three types of infrastructure with relevant expenditures at the state level: transportation, education, and social services infrastructure (the latter being hospitals, parks and recreation facilities). Based on a panel regression set-up with state and year fixed effects, we exploit changes in true party control of government within the different states over time. We also control for a state-specific linear time trend and a number of state- and time-specific variables, including contributions from the federal government. Particularly for transportation, intergovernmental transfers from the federal government are an important funding source for expenditures at the state level.====The empirical findings suggest that divided governments indeed increase infrastructure spending compared to governments under true Democratic or Republican control. For total capital outlays, the increase under divided government compared to unified Democratic governments amounts to 2–5 percent, depending on the empirical specification. More specifically, divided governments tend to increase transportation expenditures compared to unified Democratic governments, and to increase expenditures for education and social services in comparison to unified Republican governments. These results are in line with the partisan preferences of the two parties.====The observed increase in infrastructure spending is reflected in a modest average increase in the total state budget. Divided governments tend to increase their budget by around 1.6 percent compared to Republican governments, and by 0.6 percent compared to Democratic governments, though the latter estimate is not statistically significant. These results suggest that the need for political compromise requires slightly larger budgets. At the same time, the magnitude of the estimates implies that the spending increase under divided government is largely confined to infrastructure.====We test the robustness of our main results in several ways. We verify that the results also hold when controlling for the level of debt and deficit, as well as when aggregating the observations at the level of two-year and gubernatorial election cycles. Moreover, we estimate the impact of divided government on infrastructure expenditures in a dynamic panel framework, where we find smaller, but still economically and statistically significant effects. Finally, we verify that the main effects are orthogonal to the political business cycle.====Our study contributes to the literature on the political economy of government expenditures with a systematic account of party influences on infrastructure expenditures in the U.S. Studies so far have mainly focused on the impact on total government spending, with mixed findings (see, e.g., Besley and Case, 2003, for an overview), or they have looked at total capital outlays as a crude measure of infrastructure spending only. Our paper is the first that examines the impact of parties on specific infrastructure types.====In addition, our findings inform the current debate about the benefits and drawbacks of divided government. In recent years, and at the latest since the government shutdown in the U.S. in fall 2013, the challenges related to divided government have regained attention in the public discourse. Commentators often argue that divided governments lead to political gridlock as parties block each other in the political process. Several theoretical and empirical studies have investigated this issue, again with mixed findings (see Burden and Kimball, 2004). Our analyses suggest that higher expenditures on infrastructure are one specific channel how divided governments may at least arrive at some political compromise that may be beneficial for the economy.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant literature. Section 3 outlines the empirical strategy. Section 4 introduces the data.

The relationship between supply and demand for military goods has, however, only been examined on aggregate level or in formal models yet. I investigate how the supply of military goods by arms-producing companies and the demand for military goods by both the national government and foreign governments are related by using a panel of up to 195 arms-producing companies in 21 countries for the period 2002–2016. The results show that if the demand for national defense spending increases by 1%, the arms sales by a country’s largest arms-producing companies increase by up to 1.2%. If exports of major conventional weapons increase by 1%, sales increase by up to 0.2%. Arms imports do not affect domestic arms sales because imported and domestically produced arms are complements, and countries mainly import those arms they do not produce themselves. Country-specific estimation results suggest that differences among countries in geopolitical conditions and international relations determine whether a country’s arms ==== serves economic rather than security purposes.","Scholars have estimated demand functions for national defense spending (Dunne and Perlo-Freeman, 2003a; 2003b; Collier and Hoeffler, 2007; Albalate et al., 2012; Blum, 2018, Blum, 2019; George and Sandler, 2018; Blum and Potrafke, 2019) and examined determinants of international arms trade (Smith and Tasiran, 2005; Comola, 2012; Akerman and Seim, 2014; Kinne, 2016; Brender, 2018; Thurner et al., 2019) for a long time. The effect of arms trade on national defense spending has been investigated, too (Pamp and Thurner, 2017; Pamp et al., 2018). Both national defense spending and arms trade express the demand for military goods by the national government and foreign governments while the supply of military goods is provided by the arms industry.==== The market for military goods with arms-producing companies on the supply side and domestic and foreign governments on the demand side has, however, only been considered in formal models yet (Glismann and Horn, 1992; Levine et al., 1994; Levine and Smith, 1997; Dunne et al., 2007).==== This paper is original in establishing the link between supply and demand for military goods and estimates the effect of national defense spending and arms transfers on the sales of military goods by arms-producing companies.====The empirical analysis applies three databases from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): the ‘SIRPI Arms Industry Database’ containing the sales of arms and military services by the worlds’ top 100 arms-producing and military services companies, the ‘SIPRI Arms Transfers Database’ containing trend indicator values (TIV) for the exports and imports of major conventional weapons and the ‘SIPRI Military Expenditure Database’ containing data on national defense spending. These three databases have not been linked to each other yet. Smith and Dunne (2018), however, provide a parsimonious model describing world arms sales as a function of world defense spending; they find an arms sales elasticity of defense spending of 1.5. The authors conclude that “it is surprising that there is not more quantitative work using arms industry data” and encourage scholars to investigate the economics of arms at the firm level (Smith and Dunne, 2018).====I examine how a country’s demand for defense spending and the foreign demand for military goods from that country relate to the sales of military goods by its arms-producing industry. The sample includes up to 195 arms-producing and military services companies in 21 countries for the period 2002–2016. Arms orders for the own armed forces and arms exports determine the sales of military goods by arms-producing companies. In industrialized countries, arms orders are placed well in advance (especially larger procurement projects have long lead times) and exports previously need to be approved by the government. Companies thus produce ‘on demand’ rather than stockpiling arms, and company sales describe the outcome of orders by the domestic government and by foreign governments. This chronological order between orders and production of military goods makes reverse causality in this supply-demand model less likely. I use panel data models with fixed effects and in first differences. The fixed effects results indicate that if national defense spending increases by 1%, arms sales by a country’s largest arms-producing and military services companies increase by up to 1.2%. If exports of major conventional weapons increase by 1%, arms sales for these companies increase by up to 0.2%. Estimation results in first differences are similar for national defense spending, however, estimates for exports of major conventional weapons are considerably smaller. Arms imports are not shown to affect domestic arms sales, because countries mainly import arms they do not produce themselves. Imported and domestically produced arms are, thus, complements rather than substitutes. Country-specific estimation results suggest differences among countries in how the arms industry serves security or economic purposes. These differences are likely to be based on geopolitical conditions and international relations: the results suggest that, for instance, the United States’ arms-producing companies primarily serve security purposes, while arms-producing companies in Germany primarily serve the export market.","Arms production, national defense spending and arms trade: Examining supply and demand",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019301314,7 September 2019,2019,Research Article,231.0

In the experiment these lobbyists can give recommendations to their contestants. The results show that recommendations do not increase contest intensity even though most contestants follow them rather closely. However, the lobbyists effectively undermine nonbinding agreements that aim at reducing contest expenditure between the conflict parties.","Conflicts typically generate external effects on third parties. The negative externalities of wars, e.g. the death of noncombatants or economic destruction, are well known. However, some bystanders also benefit from conflicts, e.g. if it helps spreading their favorite ideology or establishes access to new markets (as in the times of colonialism). These biased third parties free-ride on the efforts of their preferred conflict side. Since they do not bear the costs of conflict, they have an incentive to lobby for higher conflict expenditure and undermine conflict resolution. Anecdotal evidence suggests that biased bystanders also foster non-militant contests. For example, partisan lobbyists apparently enhance the legislative confrontation in the US Congress (Binder, 2015; Mann and Ornstein, 2016). These activists exercise pressure on the legislators but they do not bear the electoral costs.====However, the causal link between conflict resolution and partisan activism by lobbyists is not clear cut. Politicians may seek partisan advice because they actually have a strong preference for their specific agenda. Conflict parties seek the endorsement of partisan bystanders because they seek legitimacy. This paper investigates this identification puzzle with experimental data. The experimental approach avoids the persistent endogeneity problems in field data and allows for a better insight into the underlying behavioral mechanisms in the relationship between conflict parties and their respective partisan lobbyists.====The experiment uses a standard Tullock contest as a model of conflict (Abbink, 2010; Tullock, 1980)==== but takes into account that each conflict party has another person, the ‘lobbyist’, on her side who does not bear the costs of conflict but benefits from a victory. The first treatment dimension distinguishes whether this additional person is a passive observer or an advising communication partner. As a second, orthogonal treatment dimension, some of the contestants in some conflicts can talk with each other in a certain interval during the experiment in order to settle the conflicts. The lobbyists can read the communication but cannot send their own messages to the other side. This additional dimension studies whether, and how, such partisan lobbyists can undermine conflict resolution via communication between the contestants.====The results of the experiment show that partisan lobbyists do not increase conflict intensity. However, they effectively undermine nonbinding agreements between the conflict parties. While communication between the conflict parties can lead to temporary conflict settlement even in the case of partisan advice, such an outcome is almost always unstable. Contestants typically revert to the conflict mode after the cross-party communication stops. Interestingly, the effect is driven by the communication between the lobbyist and the contestant.====The paper provides novel perspectives on communication and decision making in conflict and contest environments. It contributes to our understanding of the contest behavior of individuals (as reviewed in Dechenaux et al. (2015)) because the lobbyists are more or less passive bystanders who just give advice. In this context the paper replicates some typical results from previous studies, e.g. that average contest expenditure exceeds standard equilibrium predictions (see also Kimbrough et al. (2017)) while individual investments differ substantially over time and across subjects (see also Gill and Stone (2010)). Exchanging messages between contestants reduces expenditure (Brandts et al., 2015, e.g. Cason et al., 2012; Harbring, 2006; Leibbrandt and Sääksvuori, 2012). This impact lasts well beyond the end of communication (Eisenkopf, 2018).====However, the preceding contest studies never took the role of biased third parties and their advice into account. In noncompetitive environments, the evidence from sender-receiver games reveals that receivers often follow recommendations by the sender (in this case the lobbyist) even if the economic incentives suggest that such statements are misleading (e.g. Dreber and Johannesson, 2008; Gneezy, 2005). Baliga and Sjöström (2012) show theoretically that cheap talk of a hawkish extremist increases the likelihood of a conflict between two parties if investments are strategic complements.==== The rapidly growing literature on group behavior in contests (see the review by Sheremeta (2015)) also points for such an impact. It is well known that communication within groups leads to more competitive behavior, while communication between the opposing sides reduces contest expenditure (Cason et al., 2012; Leibbrandt and Sääksvuori, 2012; Sutter and Strassmair, 2009). The lobbyists in the experiment resemble the group managers in Eisenkopf (2014) as they do not contribute directly to the contest. Communication cannot evoke concerns of positive inequity aversion among the contestants because the experimental design ensures that any lobbyist is better off than the related contestant. However, unlike in Eisenkopf (2014), any communication between lobbyist and contestant does not facilitate coordination because only the contestant faces an investment decision. In this context it does not even allow for reciprocal concerns (or conditional cooperation). This suggests that the effect of communication derives from preference alignment, a typical explanation of the ‘in-group’ effect (Charness et al., 2007; Chen and Chen, 2011; Chen and Li, 2009; Hargreaves Heap and Zizzo, 2009; Hewstone et al., 2002). By talking with each other contestants apparently incorporate, to some extent, the benefits of the lobbyists into their own utility function.====The paper also provides a novel perspective on lobbying. The related literature typically studies a scenario in which competing lobbyists try to win a majority among ex-ante neutral legislators for their cause (Grossman and Helpman, 1994). Recent experimental contributions also study how a single lobbyist tries to induce competing politicians to agree on a policy that benefits the agent (Groβer et al., 2013). In these studies lobbyists provide money and other resources in order to align the interests of the politicians with their own ones. The results benefit both the lobbyists and the politicians and impose the costs on tax payers or consumers. In my paper neither the lobbyists nor the politicians are neutral. More specifically, a lobbyist wants to guide ‘her’ politician towards a behavior that leaves politicians as a group worse off. They want politicians to fight rather than to cooperate because they do not bear the cost of adversarial politics.====The paper proceeds as follows: The next section describes the experiment in greater detail and section 3 provides the behavioral predictions.

In direct democracies voters are uncertain about the future state of the world, while in representative democracies they are uncertain about the degree of ideological bias of the candidates, even if they know towards which policy each candidate is biased. We show that representative democracy is preferred if ==== the majority of voters are pragmatic (the common component prevails), and ","Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, a group in the European Parliament, ====, April 6, 2019.====For some years now, many social movements asking for a more direct participation of citizens in the political process are emerging in several countries around the world. The idea that decisions should be made by the citizens themselves rather than being delegated to some elected representative is gaining supporters in recent times.====The purpose of this paper is to analyze under which conditions voters prefer representative democracy to direct democracy. In order to achieve our research goal we propose a model in which there are two possible policies, ==== (left) and ==== (right), to choose from. One of these two policies is ====, that is, it is the one that better fits the realized state of the world. In direct democracy voters choose a policy among the two alternatives, while in representative democracy voters select a candidate who, once elected, chooses a policy having observed which is the realized state of the world. Voters and politicians' payoffs depend on a common component which is positive when the policy fits the state of the world, and on a private ideological bias towards one of the policies. We say that a voter (politician) is pragmatic when the common component prevails, while she is ideological when the private component predominates. In direct democracy voters are uncertain about the economically efficient policy, while in representative democracy they are uncertain about whether candidates are pragmatic or ideological, even if they know towards which policy each candidate is biased.====We find the conditions under which the majority of voters prefer a system of representative democracy. In this system, the economically efficient policy is always implemented with higher or equal ex-ante probability than in direct democracy. Consequently, pragmatic voters always prefer a system of representative democracy. The first case in which a society prefers a representative system is therefore when the majority of voters are pragmatic. Since the majority of voters are interested in the implementation of the economically efficient policy and politicians have better information about it, voters are willing to delegate the decision making process to representatives. The second case in which a system of representative democracy is preferred is when the majority of voters are ideological but the median voter is pragmatic. This occurs when the electorate is ideologically polarized between left and right. The intuition is the following. In this situation, the policy chosen in a direct democracy is the one that, ex-ante, is economically efficient with higher probability because the median voter is pragmatic. Assume, without loss of generality, that such policy is ====. Thus, voters who are ideologically biased towards policy ==== along with pragmatic voters constitute a majority that continues to prefer representative democracy. Overall, ideological voters biased towards the policy that is not chosen in direct democracy prefer that the decision is made by an expert to try to avoid that the outcome of the vote is opposite to the one that they wish: representative democracy thus constitutes a moderating element between both ideologically opposed sides.====On the other hand, societies in which the majority of voters and the median voter are ideological, implying that the majority of voters have the same ideological bias, are inclined to a system of direct democracy. The reason is that the members of this majority group know what is their preferred policy, not needing the superior information available from the experts. These voters have common aspirations that will remain invariant regardless of what that information is. Thus, for this type of electorate a representative system does not suppose any type of advantage against the direct democracy; arguably, quite the reverse. Such majority of ideological voters are not willing to allow politicians to make decisions because there exists the risk that they end up choosing something totally different to their ambitions. This risk follows from the fact that with some positive probability the elected candidate is pragmatic and the policy different from the ideological bias of these voters is economically efficient.====It is noteworthy that this configuration of the electorate is nothing but a society in which there is a majority group of homogeneous voters in terms of their ideals and with interests opposed to the minority group constituted by the rest of the citizens in that society. In this sense, it is easy to directly connect our results with the populist rhetoric, which has traditionally defended the mobilization of a majority (the people) against a minority (the elite). Understanding this electorate as a populist society, we would be offering a theoretical explanation for the growing interest in the use of instruments of direct democracy shown by societies in which populist movements succeed.",Demand of direct democracy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019301892,24 August 2019,2019,Research Article,233.0

Historical evidence finds revolutionary governments in the first decade of twenty-first century to be three times more vulnerable to mass protest than a hundred years ago. What can explain this trend? This paper relates the stability of newly emerged revolutionary governments to the political composition of the protest that brings a new incumbent to power and in factors that can shape it. Our theoretical model, incorporating protest into a dynamic Downsian framework, features the significant role of protest coordination, communication technology, ideology, and the coercive capacity of the regime. This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it discusses a new historical trend of instability of revolutionary governments. Second, it proposes a model that helps to understand the growing instability of revolutionary regimes, as well as conditions that undermine stability. In equilibrium, it is possible to have a revolutionary government overthrown by popular uprising, despite the fact that it gained power on the wave of popular support. Third, we demonstrate that under a set of conditions, the new incumbent would always come from a different part of political spectrum compared to the current leader.","Revolutionary and post-revolutionary regimes of the past century tended to be rather stable. For instance, authoritarian regimes including those in Mexico (83 years), the USSR (74 years), China (68 years and counting), Vietnam (64 years and counting), and Cuba (59 years and counting), were born during revolution. However, more recent governments, that gained power on the wave of popular protest, fail to achieve this stability (e.g., Philippines in 2011 or Egypt in 2011). In the past, the main danger for new governments lay in elite coups. The data for 316 political regimes between 1945 and 2002 suggests that most of the non-constitutional exits of the newly established governments were caused, almost exclusively, by them (Svolik, 2009). It is not surprising then, that existing formal literature on the subject focuses on coups as the primary way of non-constitutional political replacements (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith, 2015; Gehlbach et al., 2016). At the same time, the beginning of the 21st century saw major popular protests against new incumbents who gained power on the wave of popular protests against the previous incumbent. In this paper, we suggest that it is not a coincidence, but a new trend that is worth scientific exploration. A century-long trend reveals that newly emerged revolutionary governments face popular unrest with greater frequency than before (see Fig. 1). We investigate the vulnerability of newly emerged revolutionary governments to popular protest by looking at 66 countries that experienced almost two hundred cases of revolution from 1920 to 2013. In order to do so, we used the Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive (====, Banks and Wilson, 2017).==== The data==== suggests that new incumbents who came to power as a result of a revolution in the first decades of twenty-first century were three times more vulnerable to mass protest than a hundred years ago: in 1920s new revolutionary governments faced mass protests in less than 10 percent of all cases. This number has exceeded 30 percent in the first decade of the millennium. This trend is visible in the data with different specifications of time periods and in different subsamples (Figs. A1 and A2). The susceptibility of the incumbents who came to power on the wake of popular protests to new waves of popular unrest during the Arab Spring is a good example of this historical trend. A case in point is first post-Mubarak government in Egypt, which swiftly collapsed in mid-2013 after a year of almost uninterrupted protests. Scholars have explored the role of social media and links it creates in a society in a spontaneous collective action which drives mass urban mobilizations and brings together disparate groups of individuals who previously did not engage in anti-regime behaviors (Beissinger, 2013; Steinert-Threlkeld, 2017; Tufekci and Wilson, 2012).====At first glance, this historical dynamics seem to be explained by the change in the ideological nature of the revolutionary leaders. Indeed, socialist governments of the twentieth century are believed to not tolerate anti-government demonstrations. In contrast, modern revolutionary leaders appealing to the values of democracy should allow citizens to stage anti-government protest. This explanation, however, is not supported empirically. The historical increase in the chance for the newly established governments to face protest collective actions appears to be extremely robust to the exclusion of revolutionary cases that brought at least some democratization to a nation's political regime. We check this hypothesis by combining CNTS data with nation's polity score from Polity 4 Project (Marshall et al., 2017). We follow the methodology proposed by Colgan (2012) that codes “democratizing” revolutions as those that increased country's polity score by at least five units. We further check if this trend survives by changing the thresholds for “democratization” and the time period that defines the rapidity of occurrence of protests against new incumbent. The sensitivity analysis in Figs. A1 and A2 finds that the time trend remains the same after revolutions that increased nation's democracy by five, four, or less units are consecutively excluded from the sample. It also shows that the trend survives if only the first year or two of the new government are considered. Similar (though less stable) trend is observed if only successful new protests are considered (see Fig. A3).====To explain the rising susceptibility of new revolutionary governments to mass protests, we consider changes in availability of communication technologies, protest coordination and coercive capacity of the state. We develop a new theory that focuses on the political composition of the protest that brings the new government to power and on how factors above shape it.====We continue the work of Guriev and Treisman (2018), Levitsky and Way (2013), Meirowitz and Tucker (2013) and other scholars to address the question of stability of governments, and propose a novel way of looking at the stability of newly established revolutionary regimes. First, our theory helps to understand why some newly introduced revolutionary governments face antigovernment demonstrations and exit the office in a short period of time, while others establish political regimes that last for decades. Second, it explains why these governments are becoming more vulnerable to mass protest in the historical perspective.====In order to do so, we take regularities that were observed during modern protests (widely discussed in context of the Arab Spring (Khondker, 2011; Lynch, 2011; Mourtada and Salem, 2011) and the Ukrainian revolution of 2013 (Diuk, 2014) as building blocks and provide a theoretical model that accounts for different types of equilibria. Our building blocks are the emergence of communication technologies that are not easily controlled by the incumbent, the leaderless nature of the protests, and the ability of incumbent to employ his or her coercive capacity to suppress the popular protests. The resulting model allows for the possibility of unsuccessful protests, and protests that are “one-shot deals”, bringing stability after the incumbent is replaced (Meirowitz and Tucker, 2013). It also features protests that occur even after the successful change of leadership. In our model, the political dynamics of protests depends on the combination of several factors: the coercive capacity of the incumbent, the policy position of the leader in power, the opportunity costs of participating in protests, and the efficiency of communication technology. We solve the model under the assumption that the citizens are impatient, and leave the remaining cases as open problems.====There are several moving forces in the model. First, the expected revolutionary incumbent is determined as the Condorcet winner: he or she comes from the median of the protest. Recent cases of revolutions illustrate validity of this assumption. For example, the median activist headed the anti-government movement in Ukraine's 2004 “Orange Revolution”. While anticipating upcoming presidential elections, ideologically diverse Ukrainian activists jointly mobilized citizens against the current prime-minister and the head of the cabinet, Viktor Yanukovich. This spectacular mobilizational success was largely due to two factors. They included the common belief in the rigged nature of the upcoming elections and the ability of opposition activists to construct a negative coalition across diverse policy groupings (Beissinger, 2007). The prominent activists of the united opposition included Oleksandr Moroz (====), Petro Symonenko (====), Yulia Tymoshenko (====), Volodymyr Lytvyn (====), Yury Zahorodny (====), and Viktor Yushchenko (====). The head of ====, Viktor Yushchenko, was recognized as the leader of the united protest. After authorities announced the results of elections, mobilized protesters took control over the major governmental buildings and abandoned the official score. While it is challenging to approximate the distribution of political preferences of the revolutionary citizens of 2003 and 2004, it is possible to infer policy positions of groups they led by reading their political manifests for 2002 parliament elections. According to comparative manifesto project (Werner et al., 2018), for most of the existing scales Victor Yushchenko's ==== movement hold exactly the median position across opposition forces.====Second, emergence of the new incumbent is possible at the opposite side of the policy space. To the extent that the subset of protesters is smaller than the set of population, the expected new incumbent would not be representing the median of society on the whole. This would not cause political instability if the participation in revolution was difficult, or if the incumbent has high capacity to suppress the protest. As information technology makes it easier to inform population about the protest, the greater share of people who are interested in changing the incumbent are taking to the streets. Those protests become more numerous and harder to suppress, even if the share of population that benefits from changing the incumbent remains small. These protests can bring to power the incumbent that is actually further from the median bliss point of society, generating instability. Thus, the role of communication and information technology is the second crucial moving force in our model that significantly influences the outcome.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. It discusses a new historical trend of instability of revolutionary governments. It also proposes a model that helps to understand the growing instability of revolutionary regimes, as well as conditions that help ensure stability. We demonstrate that under a set of conditions, the new incumbent would always come from a different part of political spectrum compared to the current leader.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly outlines the existing literature on the incumbent's survival in the context of mass protests. Section 3 contains the theoretical model, while section 4 discusses implications of the model's findings to a set of cases. The final section concludes. In Appendices we provide additional empirical evidence, formal proofs of statements, and consider extension for the model with endogenous incumbent.",Stability of revolutionary governments in the face of mass protest,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626801930045X,23 August 2019,2019,Research Article,234.0

The “grease the wheels” hypothesis holds that corruption increases economic growth because corruption circumvents inefficient regulations. When regulations on starting businesses are tight, bribing politicians and bureaucrats is likely to give rise to vibrant economic activity. The “sand the wheels” hypothesis maintains, by contrast, that corruption decreases economic growth because corruption prevents efficient production and innovation. The empirical evidence tends to suggest that corruption decreases economic growth, especially in countries with low investment rates and low-quality governance (e.g., Mauro, 1995, Mo, 2001, Aidt et al., 2008, Méon and Sekkat, 2005, Hodge et al., 2011, Swaleheen, 2011, D'Agostino et al., 2016a and D'Agostino et al., 2016b, Huang, 2016, Tsanana et al., 2016, Chang and Hao, 2017, Cieślik and Goczek, 2018a and 2018b – see Campos et al., 2010 and Ugur, 2014 for surveys).====Since the 2000s, many empirical studies examining the determinants and the economic and political consequences of corruption in the public sector used Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI). Examples include Paldam, 2002, Paldam, 2019, Aidt, 2009, Goel and Nelson, 2010, Lessmann and Markwardt, 2010, Méon and Weill, 2010, Bjørnskov, 2012, Potrafke, 2012a, Potrafke, 2019, Cooray and Schneider (2018), Debski et al. (2018), and Vadlamannati and Cooray (2016). The studies on corruption and economic growth by Méon and Sekkat, 2005, Swaleheen, 2011, D'Agostino et al., 2016a and D'Agostino et al., 2016b, Huang, 2016, Tsanana et al., 2016, and Cieślik and Goczek (2018a) also employed the CPI. Studies using the CPI in panel data models ignored that the CPI was not comparable across countries and over time before 2012. In particular, including fixed period effects in panel data models does not solve the incomparability problem because the CPI in individual years before the year 2012 included data for different components and time periods to measure perceived corruption across continents. We believe that measuring corruption in the public sector by the CPI is suitable. However, one cannot conclude from previous studies that corruption decreases growth, because the earlier version of the CPI is not comparable across time. Another important issue that many previous studies ignored is that economic growth may also influence corruption, because increasing living standards and incomes are often accompanied by an increasing quality of political institutions (Lipset hypothesis). We use jack-knifed regional averages of corruption for each country-year observation as instrumental variables for national corruption. Empirical evidence shows that corruption in an individual country or region is positively correlated with corruption in neighboring countries or regions (e. g., Becker et al., 2009, Faber and Gerritse, 2012, Jetter and Parmeter, 2018, Borsky and Kalkschmied, 2019). Spatial dependence is a vigorous instrumental variable for corruption.====We employ the new CPI for 175 countries over the period 2012–2018 to re-examine the nexus between corruption and economic growth. Our study relates to new empirical growth models, which use annual dynamics in log real per capita GDP to examine determinants of economic growth (see, e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2019).==== The cumulative long-run effect of corruption on growth is that real per capita GDP decreased by around 17% when the reversed CPI increased by one standard deviation. The effect of corruption on economic growth is especially pronounced in autocracies and countries with low government effectiveness and rule of law. Corruption is also found to affect foreign direct investment and inflation, which suggest that those variables may be channels of transmission from corruption to growth.",Corruption and economic growth: New empirical evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019301156,22 August 2019,2019,Research Article,235.0

(2004) found that negative rainfall shocks (measured as negative year-on-year rainfall growth) had caused civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa over the 1981–1999 period. Since then, the rainfall and conflict data they used had undergone multiple revisions. We show that rainfall shocks are no longer statistically significant for civil conflict when the revised data are used. This is true whether we employ a different functional form for rainfall, extend the sample to include more recent observations, use longer lags for rainfall shocks, employ dynamic panel regression, or panel regressions that take into account of cross-sectional dependence. Using rainfall shocks as instruments for growth, we also find that growth is insignificant for civil conflict if the revised data are used. Upon further investigation, we find that updates in the rainfall and conflict data for one or a few countries may alone cause rainfall shocks to lose statistical significance.","Over the last 50 years, nearly half of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSAs in short) have experienced at least an episode of civil conflict. Because civil conflict has severe implications for economic development, researchers have devoted themselves to understanding its causes and origins. In an influential paper, Miguel et al. (2004) show that for the period between 1981 and 1999, civil conflict in the SSAs is associated with negative rainfall shocks. This result is consistent with the opportunity cost hypothesis of conflict (Collier and Hoeffler, 1998). In sub-Saharan Africa, many countries are economically dependent on the agricultural sector. As such, negative rainfall shocks, which reduce agricultural output, would lead to a fall in income (Barrios et al., 2010), and thus, the opportunity cost of conflict participation.====In this article, we explore if the statistical significance of rainfall shocks for civil conflict, first reported by Miguel et al. (2004), is robust to the use of recently revised rainfall and conflict data. Miguel et al. (2004) construct rainfall shocks using data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project version 2.0 (GPCP 2.0) and employ conflict data from the Armed Conflict Database version 2004 (ACD 2004). Since then, these datasets have undergone multiple revisions (e.g. from GPCP 2.0 to GPCP 2.1 and 2.2, and from ACD 2004 to ACD 2010 and ACD 2015), which affect the data for many countries. For example, conflict and war incidence have been re-coded for many countries by later ACD datasets, and precipitation has been updated for all countries by later GPCP datasets. However, how these updates may affect the conclusion that rainfall shocks matter for civil conflict is yet to be explored.====Focusing on the same countries and years considered by Miguel et al. (2004), we show that rainfall shocks are statistically insignificant for civil conflict if we use recently revised rainfall and conflict data (i.e. GPCP 2.2 and ACD 2015). Moreover, the statistical significance of rainfall shocks cannot be restored by employing a different functional form of rainfall (as opposed to rainfall shocks), extending the sample period to 2009,==== including the second lag of rainfall shocks as a regressor, and estimating a dynamic panel model. Additionally, Miguel et al. (2004) two-stage least squares estimates of the effects of growth on conflict, where rainfall shocks serve as instruments, also cease to be statistically significant. Finally, rainfall shocks and civil conflict could be cross-sectionally dependent.==== However, using the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) estimator of Pesaran (2006) that accounts for this data feature again fails to restore the statistical significance of rainfall shocks.====Next, we investigate if the loss of statistical significance is caused by updates for a particular country, for a few countries, or countries in the sample in general. We find that the updates on Niger's conflict incidence in the ACD, where three observations (or 0.4% of the sample) are re-coded, are enough to cause rainfall shocks to lose statistical significance. We also find that the updating or re-coding of the GPCP and ACD data for a few countries alone can cause rainfall shocks to be statistically insignificant. Since a small number of updates may substantially weaken the association between rainfall shocks and conflict, the statistical significance of rainfall shocks observed in the literature could be an artifact of measurement error.====Our paper is not the first to examine the robustness of the effects of rainfall shocks on conflict. Earlier, Ciccone (2011) has shown that extending the sample period to 2009 and using revised rainfall and conflict data (i.e. GPCP 2.1 and ACD 2010) can eliminate the statistical significance of rainfall growth or levels on civil conflict.==== However, Miguel and Satyanath (2011) counter that using an extended sample period may diminish the relevance of rainfall shocks as an economic shock, as Africa has enjoyed new growth areas outside the agricultural sector in the 2000s.==== Our paper departs from Ciccone (2011) and Miguel and Satyanath (2011) as it considers the implications of using rainfall and conflict data from GPCP 2.2 and ACD 2015, which were previously not available to them.====It is important to emphasize that the main objective in Miguel et al. (2004) is to show that rainfall shocks can be used as instruments to identify the effect of growth on conflict. Nonetheless, their reduced-form results are important as they allude to the relevance of climate change for conflict. Since then, several studies (e.g. Burke et al., 2009; Hsiang et al., 2011; O'Loughlin et al., 2014) have provided further evidence that weather conditions, such as precipitation or temperature levels, are statistically significant for conflict outbreaks in the SSAs.==== For example, using a meta-analysis, Hsiang et al. (2013) find that studies in the literature converge on identifying climate (e.g. extreme rainfall) as a cause of interpersonal violence and intergroup conflict (see, also, Hsiang et al., 2014). However, Buhaug et al. (2014) argue that their conclusion might be driven by the design of the meta-analysis itself; when these issues are addressed, there is no evidence that studies are converging to the conclusion that climate affects conflict. To date, there is a lack of consensus on the size and direction of the effect of climate on conflict. In this regard, it would be important to revisit the robustness of the reduced-form results of Miguel et al. (2004), given that they have motivated the literature on climate and conflict.====Finally, our paper is related to literature that considers using weather variations as instruments or proxies to examine the impact of riots and economic conditions on democratic change. For example, Aidt and Leon (2016) show that riots induced by drought lead to democratization in the SSAs. Additionally, Burke and Leigh (2010) argue that adverse weather shocks that cause economic contractions may raise the short-run likelihood that a country is democratized. Similarly, Brückner and Ciccone (2011) find that negative transitory economic shocks, as proxied by negative rainfall shocks, may lead to political transition from autocracy to (partial and full) democracy.====The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data sources and explores how rainfall and conflict data may differ across the different versions of the GPCP and ACD datasets. Section 3 explores how the data revisions may affect the statistical significance of rainfall shocks on conflict and war. Section 4 explores whether using a different model specification, together with the revised data, may help rainfall shocks regain statistical significance. Section 5 looks at which updates in the GPCP and ACD data are responsible for causing rainfall shocks to be statistically insignificant.

The economic literature has so far explored several channels through which corruption may affect economic outcomes. Some authors highlight its effects in terms of distortion of private decisions, such as investments (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Mauro, 1995) and human capital accumulation (Mo, 2001). Others focus on the activities of the public sector, documenting relationships between corruption and inefficiencies in the composition of government expenditure (Mauro, 1998), lower productivity of public investments (Del Monte and Papagni, 2001) and higher shares of goods and services procured by the public administration on non-competitive markets (Hessami, 2014).====In this paper we analyze the impact of corruption on workforce selection and personnel allocation in the public sector. More specifically, we address two issues: first, we examine whether corruption affects the ==== of individuals with different levels of human capital; second, we examine the relationship between corruption and the ==== of differently educated individuals to jobs with different skill content. Poorer recruitment and misallocation of human resources within public agencies might have significant and long-lasting consequences on the quality of the administration's activity and on the effectiveness of services provided by the public sector. Nevertheless the impact of corruption through these channels has so far remained surprisingly uninvestigated. Moreover, corruption might also induce rent-seeking activities, involving unproductive use of resources and causing social losses (Aidt, 2016).====The empirical analysis is based on two complementary data sources containing information on Italian public and private employees and exploits several measures of corruption. We examine whether areas characterized by higher values of our corruption indicators show peculiar patterns of skill-based selection into and allocation within the public sector. Although we rely on cross-sectional variation, the empirical strategy by which we study workforce selection is made robust to potential omitted-variables bias by the inclusion of a rich set of geographical and profession-related fixed effects. The impact of corruption on personnel allocation is addressed through a specification that mirrors a difference-in-differences approach, in which the treatment is represented by the intensity of corruption at the local level, and exposure to the treatment is determined by whether workers are employed in the public or private sector. Moreover, to address the obvious reverse causality issue – the possibility that corruption itself is the consequence of poor selection and allocation of human resources by the public administration – we instrument corruption with two variables that are positively correlated with corruption, but which predate the hiring of current public employees: past dependence on public spending and the historical relevance of foreign domination.====We find that public employees are, on average, more educated and obtained higher grades at school than their professional counterparts in the private sector. However, in areas with higher corruption the relationship between educational attainments and the likelihood of working in the public sector is substantially weaker. The negative impact of corruption is concentrated among those with higher skill content jobs, such as managers and highly skilled professionals. As for the allocation process, we find that a higher level of corruption is associated with an increase, relative to the private sector, in the likelihood of mismatch between individual educational attainments and the skill content of the job one is assigned to. This mismatch comes mostly in the form of under-education – individuals being assigned to jobs that are, on average, undertaken by more qualified personnel – rather than over-education. We also show that under-education is not only a “mechanical” consequence of poorer selection processes or of inflation in the number of managerial positions. Finally, we show that corruption also leads to a relatively lower effort by public employees, as measured by hours worked. As a whole, our findings point to corruption inducing a lower quality and a reduced efficiency of the public sector.====The literature has already partially dealt with the relationship between corruption and occupational choices. Murphy et al. (1991) and Acemoglu and Verdier (1998) argue that corruption magnifies rewards to rent-seeking activities and subtracts valuable human resources to entrepreneurship. Concerning selection into the public sector, experimental evidence suggests that more corrupt environments encourage entry by dishonest people into the public sector: Banerjee et al. (2015) and Hanna and Wang (2017) find negative self-selection into the Indian public administration, while Barfort et al. (2017) find positive self-selection into the Danish public sector. Colonnelli et al. (2018) find that political patronage is a key determinant of employment in the public sector.====Our paper innovates upon the existing literature along several directions. First, the economic impact of corruption has typically been investigated using cross-country evidence (at a single point in time). However, cross-sectional relationships might be severely biased, as corruption and the other variables of interest are likely to have common correlates that cannot all be credibly controlled for.==== To address this issue, some papers introduce country fixed effects by exploiting panel data. However, the reliability of those estimates clearly depends on the longitudinal (within-country) variation of these factors that, in the case of a persistent and structural phenomenon like corruption, is arguably low. Moreover, panel data alone do not fully address endogeneity concerns, as a variation in corruption and in the outcome variable might reflect common, country-specific shocks. To tackle these difficulties, we exploit a different identification strategy that hinges on the differential impact of corruption among individuals living in the same area, while controlling through area fixed effects for any other potential omitted variable correlated with corruption.====Second, the measurement of corruption itself may be problematic either from a cross-sectional or a longitudinal point of view. Indeed, one may question the capacity of international surveys to capture the intensity of corruption equally well in all countries, due to differences in culture and social norms or to other perception biases. Similarly, official data on reported crimes might not be comparable across countries due to differences in laws or in the availability of harmonized crime statistics. The extent of these measurement issues can also vary over time. However, our analysis is based on various measures of corruption within a single country, thus exploiting (sub-national) territorial variability while using homogeneous and comparable indicators.====Third, previous studies on the relationship between corruption and workforce sorting have used experimental evidence and focused on whether workers’ personal propensity to dishonesty makes them more likely to self-select into the public sector. In contrast, we rely on hard data and drive the attention towards the impact of environmental levels of corruption on sorting based on human capital and personal allocation.==== Personal attitudes towards unlawful behavior are undoubtedly of the foremost importance in determining the quality and impartiality of public services. However, poor human capital endowments and occupational mismatch might also hinder the effectiveness of economic decisions by public agencies on a number of relevant dimensions, such as the level and the composition of public expenditure, the effectiveness of public investments and the quality of services provided to households and firms.====Finally, even if we cannot observe individual performance, we are able to examine the impact of corruption on hours worked, a proxy of effort exerted by employees. We find that corruption is associated with lower levels of effort in the public sector, relative to the private sector.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and the main variables of our analysis, including the construction of corruption indicators. Section 3 details the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents our main findings and some robustness checks.

And if anything, it is likely to ==== corrupt practices, particularly among firms that are established post WTO membership and those that are government owned.","An extensive literature investigates how membership in, or even the accession process to, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), has impacted country-level trade patterns (e.g., Rose, 2004). A distinct literature assesses the effect of trade openness (or, liberalization of trade) on political corruption (e.g., Gatti, 2004).==== However, little is known about the direct causal effect of accession to and membership in the WTO on the level of political corruption in a country. This lack of knowledge persists despite increasing recognition of the importance of institutional quality in explaining heterogeneity in economic growth and development==== and the concomitant rise in membership in the WTO and other international organizations (Acemoglu et al., 2005). Currently, 162 countries are WTO members, with another 22 having observer status.====Several international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), European Union (EU), Organization of American States (OAS), The Council of Europe, The World Bank (WB), and The International Monetary Fund (IMF), went through a rapid and widespread process of adoption of anti-corruption measures in the 1990s. In contrast, Abbott (2001, p. 278) notes that the WTO remained “conspicuously absent from the list.” However, beginning in 2014, the WTO addressed corruption in its rules and regulations for the first time through its Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA).==== The GPA was negotiated between 1997 and 2011, formally adopted in 2012, and entered into force in 2014. The agreement seeks to increase transparency and fairness, avoid conflicts of interest, and prevent corrupt behaviors. That said, only 45 member countries are covered by the GPA.====Despite this recent and partial attempt to address institutional quality in general and corruption in particular, accession to the WTO has long been hypothesized to yield indirect benefits such as improved governance, institutional reforms, increased transparency, and reduced corruption. Along this line, Allee and Scalera (2012, p. 273) state: “[A]ccession to the WTO and other international organizations might have broader indirect effects – such as on domestic political institutions within joiners – perhaps by reducing corruption or increasing transparency.”====One such channel through which institutional improvements may occur is via ====, as noted above. Another channel is via ====, whereby accession allows countries to commit to reforms that may otherwise be infeasible. In this regard, Drabek and Bacchetta (2004, p. 1096) state: “Membership in the WTO should help reduce incentives for corruption by providing countries with what are perhaps the most powerful institutional checks and balances in the international economic sphere. Accession imposes changes both in institutions and policies.”====To the extent that the WTO affects political corruption via trade liberalization, this impact should occur only ====. However, some researchers are of the opinion that the process of policy anchoring takes place during the ====.==== To this end, Aaronson and Abouharb (2014, p. 548, 554) identify three “core values” of the WTO itself that are associated with quality governance: (i) even-handedness or non-discrimination, (ii) access to information or transparency, and (iii) administrative due process. As countries adhere to these core values during and after accession, the authors argue that trade-related governance will improve and the effects will “gradually spill over into the polity as a whole.”====Given this background, in this paper I begin by asking whether membership in the WTO has a ==== on political corruption in countries. The importance of answering this question should not be overlooked. In 2013, World Bank Group President Kim stated that corruption is “public enemy number one.“==== Avis et al. (2016, p. 1) write: “Politicians throughout the world embezzle billions of dollars each year, and in so doing induce the misallocation of resources, foster distrust in leaders, and threaten the very pillars of democracy.” While finding out whether the WTO has a causal effect on corruption or not - and if yes, then whether it is positive or negative - is not a reason on its own to expand or contract the WTO, understanding the ramifications of WTO membership on domestic corruption is crucial as countries endeavor to tackle corruption. Along this line, Costas-Pérez et al. (2012, p. 1) state: “Given the potentially devastating impact of corruption, a better understanding of the institutions that might help to mitigate it seems to be crucial.” In contrast to this, corruption is found to have “facilitating effects” on economic factors like international trade - import, to be precise - in presence of “bad institutions” in importing countries (de Jong and Bogmans, 2011). Hence, if countries assume that WTO membership will reduce corruption, yet the opposite turns out to be the case, then countries will need to strengthen anti-corruption efforts upon WTO membership, not relax them. On the contrary, if WTO membership is found to have no impact on domestic corruption, then policy makers ought to shift their focus away from the usual rhetoric (of WTO membership improving governance) to other plausible mechanisms to curb domestic corruption.====While the question of the causal effect of WTO status on corruption is critical, answering it is not straightforward for two reasons. First, countries ==== into the WTO. Drabek and Bacchetta (2004) provide a good review of both theoretical and practical reasons for why a country might desire to join the WTO. Second, membership status may be ==== due to the length of the accession process and the presence of nonmember participants (Tomz et al., 2007). Moreover, as mentioned above, policy anchoring may take place during the accession period, before a country actually gains the formal membership status. ==== As a result, while formal membership status is perfectly observed, some members of the control group (i.e., non-formal members) may actually be more similar to the treatment group (i.e., formal members). As deciding which non-formal members should be placed in the treatment group is perhaps an impossible task, I instead begin by defining the treatment as ==== but allow for possible measurement error in the treatment status.====In this paper, I also ask whether ==== to the WTO has a causal effect on political corruption in order to examine the policy anchoring hypothesis. To do so, I examine a second treatment, defined as countries that are not formal members of the WTO during the sample period (discussed later), but become formal members in the future. The control group contains countries that are not formal members during the sample period nor at present. Identifying the causal effect of this treatment confronts the same two econometric challenges that plague the first treatment: self-selection and misclassification. Self-selection is obvious; misclassification may arise because it is difficult to know when the process of accession actually begins for countries that become formal WTO members at some future date.====To answer these questions, traditional econometric techniques such as fixed effects and instrumental variables methods are not likely to be viable solutions to the above mentioned two econometric challenges for several reasons. First, neither is likely able to address non-classical measurement error in a binary covariate (Black et al., 2000). Second, WTO membership is not likely to be strictly exogenous due to reverse causation from political corruption to membership status. Drabek and Bacchetta (2004, p. 1096–1097) state: “[A] high level of institutional quality will facilitate the accession while the accession promotes good institutional quality.” Moreover, the parallel trends assumption in difference-in-differences model is not likely to hold due to anticipatory effects of membership. Finally, plausible exclusion restrictions, even in the absence of misclassification, seem unlikely.====To circumvent these econometric challenges, I take a nonparametric partial identification approach following Kreider et al. (2012) and McCarthy et al. (2015).==== Thus, my objective is to ==== the average treatment effect (ATE) of WTO status on political corruption, instead of attaining point identification. The benefit of using a partial identification approach is to explore a range of possible estimates obtained under different sets of assumptions, instead of imposing stringent (and likely implausible) assumptions in the current context – required under panel data or instrumental variables estimation – to obtain point identification (Tamer, 2010; Manski, 2013; Ho and Rosen, 2015).====To obtain sharp bounds on the ATEs under different assumptions regarding the selection process and misclassification of treatment assignment, I use firm-level corruption data from the World Business Environment Survey (WBES, 1999–2000) which contains information on the first-hand experiences of firm managers with bribe payments to public officials. Further, I bound conditional ATEs, allowing for the bounds to vary on the basis of several country- and firm-level characteristics.====At this point, it is important to highlight the rationale behind the choice of data utilized in this paper. First, in contrast to other firm-level corruption data such as the Enterprise Surveys, the WBES data are older when fewer countries were members of the WTO. Thus, the WBES data enable a researcher to answer this particular question at hand by allowing the control group (i.e., non-members of the WTO to be precise) to be of a reasonable size. Taking recourse to any other firm-level data of a ==== (that may also exist in panel form), would essentially ==== facilitate the analysis here as it would further reduce the sub-sample of the countries that are non-members of the WTO thereby leaving researchers with very little variation in the data. Second, WBES data include more developed countries that are absent from the Enterprise Surveys (e.g., Canada, United States, and many western European nations). Third, in contrast to country-level corruption indices, firm-level corruption surveys seem less ad hoc that allow for examination of heterogeneous determinants of corruption across firms within countries and arguably are characterized by lesser measurement errors (see, for example, Choudhury, 2015). While these reasons do not whitewash the shortcomings that might be associated with the WBES data itself, nevertheless, the current analysis cannot be performed any better with other currently available data on political corruption, given the specific nature of the question asked in this paper.====The results are striking. My primary finding is that membership in the WTO is likely to have ==== impact on the overall frequency of bribes paid by firms. And if anything in terms of economic significance, it is likely to ==== corruption. This finding is in stark contrast to the usual conjecture. A plausible explanation for this increase in corruption, perhaps, lies with the behavior of ‘laggard’ firms amidst intense foreign competition due to formal WTO membership (Aghion et al., 2005). These firms tend to substitute innovation by corruption (paying more bribes) to stay viable in the market while facing increased product market competition arising explicitly from trade (Ding et al., 2016).====In a further attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying this result, I reach two additional conclusions. First, my findings do not appear to be driven by policy anchoring during the accession period (which would have entailed a reversion to pre-existing levels of political corruption once formal WTO membership is attained). In fact, accession phase also indicates to a potential increase in the bribe frequency. However, this impact is not statistically significant either, similar to the above finding. Second, the results may be due, at least in part, to a compositional change in the types of entrepreneurs that choose to enter the market after the attainment of formal WTO membership. The evidence points to a greater increase in corruption when the treatment group is restricted to firms that are established after formal WTO membership and it is noteworthy because this impact is statistically significant, unlike the previous findings.====I also obtain a few other intriguing results. First, I cannot rule out the possibility that the ATE is zero in the full sample once modest levels of misclassification are allowed. Thus, allowing for some non-formal members to behave more similarly to formal members creates uncertainty regarding the direction of the impact of the WTO on political corruption. Second, the evidence in favor of an increase in bribe frequency among formal WTO members is stronger (statistically significant to be precise) for firms that are government owned, that operate in countries having high market entry regulations in terms of cost and those with low net outflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). Finally, the sources of the increase in political corruption differ during the formal membership and accession phases.====In sum, my analysis reveals no beneficial effect of WTO accession and membership on reducing corruption overall; membership is most likely to ==== in certain sub-samples, counter to prevailing wisdom.

We propose an explanation based on a retrospective voting model where immigration hurts voters but benefits a rent-seeking policymaker who appropriates part of the income generated by immigrants. To be reappointed, the policymaker must distribute the compensation. With respect to proportional systems, plurality systems make it possible to compensate only a few decisive districts and leave after-compensation rents higher, therefore producing higher immigration. In our model, non-decisive districts receive no compensation at all under both electoral systems, providing a rationale for widespread anti-immigration attitudes. Notably, our results also help to explain why governments often seem more pro-immigration than do voters. Finally, our model predicts that opposition to immigration is more geographically dispersed in plurality systems. Basic evidence supports this prediction.","A broad theoretical and empirical literature in economics and political science has examined the effects of electoral systems since the pioneering contributions of Duverger (1954) and Buchanan and Tullock (1962). This vast body of research ranges from fiscal policy to growth, corruption, income distribution, and even to economic development. Nonetheless, the possible effect of the electoral systems on immigration flows is barely considered in the literature, although this contingency is a matter of the utmost importance. Actually, although immigration is in many ways beneficial,==== its gains are not evenly distributed, and voters are concerned about labor market competition, access to welfare benefits, and threats to national identity. This was tangible in the latest elections for the US presidency, where immigration has been a key issue. In the UK, concerns for immigration have been crucial for Brexit. In the EU, immigration is now perceived as the most important issue facing the Union.==== A recent, 22-country survey shows that 49% of respondents agree that “there are too many immigrants in our country”, and only 19% disagree.====On the other hand, many major corporations call for less stringent immigration rules both in the US and the EU.==== These companies include not only hi-tech firms searching for skilled workers but also farm groups, the construction sector, maintenance industries, and the food services business. Policymakers are, therefore, caught between a rock and a hard place, and they have to find a balance between these contrasting stances. According to the literature, governments are often more pro-migration than voters because they are responsive to corporate lobbying activities (Hanson and Spilimbergo, 2001; Fasani, 2009; Freeman, 1992; Chiswick and Hatton, 2003; Facchini and Testa, 2015). Is it possible that electoral systems play a role in this process also?====If we look at immigration inflows, controlling for per-capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), an overlooked stylized fact appears, namely, inflows into countries with plurality electoral systems are much higher than inflows into countries with proportional systems (see Fig. 1 and Figs. 2 and 3 in the Appendix).==== This striking difference increased from 1996 to 2014. As we show in our empirical analysis (Section 4), simple cross-country regressions on OECD data confirm that a “plurality” dummy has a positive and significant effect on per-capita immigration inflows (see Table 3 in Section 4).==== Section 4 also provides basic checks of this correlation.====What makes the immigration figures so different between different electoral systems? Are plurality systems able to reduce barriers to immigration? How do these systems shape policymakers’ incentives in immigration policies?====The relationship between electoral systems and immigration policy is the object of this paper. While many authors analyze the vote over immigration policies,==== the possible effect of the electoral system on the openness to immigration has been largely neglected. We study this issue through a retrospective voting model à la Persson and Tabellini, 2000, Persson and Tabellini, 2002. The idea of accountability is the cornerstone of this model. According to Persson and Tabellini (2002), “elections discipline politicians through some sort of reputation mechanism, not because of outright enforcement”. For instance, a blatantly corrupted/unfit politician would never be re-elected. More generally, since electoral promises are not credible, voters evaluate politicians ex post. Notice that, in line with this simple reasoning, voters look backward, not forward: accountability is essentially retrospective. This behavior can be formally described by assuming that voters re-appoint the incumbent policymaker if and only if they are provided with a pre-determined reservation utility.====Retrospective voting has been studied extensively since the seminal work of Key (1966), and several authors over the last decades found evidence that voters reward incumbent politicians for good economic performances and punish them for bad economic performances (see Kramer, 1971; Lewis-Beck, 1988; Markus, 1988). Wolfers (2013) and, more recently, Drago et al. (2017) confirm the robustness of this finding.====In our version of the Persson-Tabellini framework, a rent-seeking policymaker uses immigration to increase the fiscal base he can appropriate. In practice, as argued above, politicians benefit from immigration mainly thanks to lobbying activities. Since, for our purposes, it is indifferent whether rents come from tax appropriation or from lobbying, we assume for simplicity direct tax appropriation by the policymaker. The latter, however, cannot set immigration as he pleases. In our model, immigration damages the voters by causing congestion of public goods. To be reappointed, the policymaker must compensate his electoral base for this congestion. The net benefits available after distributing compensation depend on the electoral system. Plurality systems make it possible to compensate only a few “decisive” voters,==== and this allows the policymaker to retain higher after-compensation rents for any immigration inflow. This explains why plurality systems can be more open to immigration.====Another important feature of our model is that compensation occurs either through locally provided public goods (henceforth “public goods”) or through non-targetable, wide-ranging welfare programs that benefit individuals based on their personal characteristics (henceforth “transfers”).==== Therefore, we can also address the bias in public expenditures introduced by electoral systems. In line with many authors, we find that proportional systems bias spending toward extensive, non-geographically-targeted transfer programs, which better fit the need of securing larger majorities.==== However, we point out that immigration may overcome this bias. The overcoming occurs because it is hard to deny transfers on the basis of nationality: immigrants with the same characteristics as the natives cannot be discriminated against forever.====Our approach, based on rent-seeking and compensation, brings to light another consequence; namely, the need to compensate only decisive districts implies that the others receive no compensation at all. In this sense, there is an excess of immigration. Actually, since in both electoral systems non-decisive districts are disregarded, there will always exist an excess of immigration. This distortion is particularly serious in the plurality system, where only the voters of a few decisive districts are compensated.====Summarizing, our model accounts for several stylized facts: it explains why governments tend to be more pro-immigration than voters, and why plurality systems allow for more immigration. In addition, it suggests that large shares of the population are not compensated for the costs of immigration, and this could help to explain the anti-immigration sentiment in the public opinion.====Our result concerning the greater openness of the plurality system is analogous to a finding in Morelli and Negri (2017), who study the relationship between electoral systems and immigration through a model based on Austen-Smith (2000). In their framework, the plurality system implements the median voter's preference, while the proportional system has three parties and may require a coalition to form an absolute majority. Another major difference from our approach is that, unlike in Morelli and Negri (2017) where wage competition by immigrants is crucial, our model does not rely on this effect.==== Finally, Morelli and Negri (2017) take the partition of resources accruing to immigrants and natives as given. As we stressed above, the choice over the redistribution of the fiscal base made available by immigration is at the core of our contribution.====The structural differences we outlined make Morelli and Negri (2017) highly complementary to this paper.

However, empirical evidence on the effects of the public accounting system on fiscal policy is scarce. Following rules by the federal states, municipalities in Germany have adopted accrual-based accounting systems gradually. By exploiting variations over time and across states I find no evidence for an impact on the overall financial balance. However, my findings suggest that ==== has altered the structure of the budget. Revenues from the sales of non-financial assets have decreased significantly. This supports the hypothesis that municipalities had used these one-off measures before to meet fiscal constraints. Using data on entities controlled by the municipalities, the analysis provides no evidence for repercussions on these public funds, institutions or enterprises.","Traditionally, the budget and accounting information of governments have been based on the cash principle. Starting in the 1980s, public sector accounting has experienced some fundamental changes. Private sector-style management instruments have been implemented, and in many countries a move towards accrual accounting has taken place (OECD/IFAC, 2017). Primarily, these reforms aspire to reveal the long-term budgetary impact of policy decisions and to capture public assets and liabilities. With the intention to improve fiscal monitoring, the discussion about accrual standards for public sector accounting has gained renewed interest after the sovereign debt crisis. The European Commission currently intends to introduce harmonized, compulsory accrual-based European Public Sector Accounting Standards (EPSAS) for all member states (European Commission, 2013). The voluntary switch to accrual accounting has already been actively encouraged and sponsored by the Commission.====Despite the relevance of the topic and the prominent political debate, empirical evidence on the effects of the public accounting system is scarce. In particular, there has been little research on the costs and benefits of such reform. There are some studies, mainly from the accounting literature, that primarily analyze the effect of accrual-based accounting on the efficiency of the public sector. They are predominantly based on questionnaires or case studies; see Burth and Hilgers (2014) as well as Kuhlmann et al. (2008) who study perceived benefits and consequences for German municipalities, Paulsson (2006) for experiences of the central government in Sweden, Christiaens and Van Peteghem (2007) for the local level in Flanders, and Carlin (2005) for a case study on Australia, among others. A study by van der Hoek (2005) summarizes experiences from the Netherlands. By using expenditure data, Lampe et al. (2015) quantitatively assess the impact on cost efficiency of local governments in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia in the very short run. Dorn et al. (2019) conduct an empirical analysis on counties in the German state of Bavaria.====Apart from the objective of getting more transparent and comparable fiscal data, the main achievements expected from this kind of reform are to increase efficiency and inter-generational equity by systematically recording assets and liabilities and revealing the long-term budgetary impact of a policy decision. Moreover, to get a more comprehensive picture, consolidated financial statements have been implemented, including controlled entities that already used accrual business accounting standards. These aspects are especially relevant when considering the effects of fiscal rules on policy decisions. There is a strand of literature showing that governments find ways to circumvent fiscal constraints as they target specific budgetary positions or data. Governments can do this, for example, by engaging in off-budget activities (von Hagen, 1991), hiding fiscal policies in less transparent budgets (Milesi-Ferretti, 2004) or by using accounting tricks (Buti et al., 2007). Evidence for such creative accounting behavior has been found in Europe during the run-up to the monetary union (Milesi-Ferretti and Moriyama, 2006) as well as after the introduction of the stability and growth pact and the excessive deficit procedure (von Hagen and Wolff, 2006).====On a related note, the analysis adds to the literature studying how different budgetary institutions affect fiscal outcomes. For example, a higher degree of budget transparency seems to promote the effectiveness of fiscal rules (Bergman et al., 2016) and government effectiveness (Blume and Voigt, 2013). Also multiyear budgeting as a tool to reduce short-sightedness has been identified to increase fiscal discipline (Vlaicu et al., 2014).====This paper studies the effect of the accounting system on (i) the overall effect on the financial balance of the core budget, and (ii) the structure of revenues and expenditures as well as (iii) repercussions on entities controlled by the core budget. I exploit the fact that municipalities in Germany have switched gradually and only partially to accrual-based accounting systems. Therefore, I can use variations over time and across German states in a fixed effects panel model with the share of municipalities using accrual accounting as a continuous treatment variable. Additionally, I estimate generalized difference-in-differences models using a proxy for the length of the treatment. The study is conducted using municipal financial data that is added up at the state level because data on the switching date are not available for all municipalities in Germany. As explained in Section 3.1, the use of such aggregated information also addresses some concerns regarding the comparability of municipal data.====The empirical results indicate no impact of the switch to the accrual-based accounting system on the overall financial balance of the municipal core budget. This suggests that the new model has only a limited impact on overall fiscal discipline. However, the findings imply that the structure of the municipal budget changes. I find a significant decline in revenues from the sales of non-financial assets, which is robust across different specifications. One explanation for this finding is the fact that under cash accounting, it is, in principle, easier to meet the balanced budget rule by selling non-financial assets, see Section 2.1 for more details on the mechanism. The new accounting system therefore seems to have closed a loophole. However, this has not found expression in an improved financial balance. Using data on entities controlled by the municipalities, I find no evidence for repercussions on these public firms.====The study is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting and the data. Section 3 explains the identification strategies and the econometric framework. Section 4 presents the results for municipal revenues and expenditures as well as for entities controlled by the municipalities. Finally, Section 5 discusses the findings and concludes.",Does accrual accounting alter fiscal policy decisions? - Evidence from Germany,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018305147,17 July 2019,2019,Research Article,240.0

Although the UK has been a net contributor to the EU, some regions receive significant amounts of regional aid funds. We find that while Cohesion Policy is positively correlated with the remain vote, this relationship is weak. Most of the variation in the remain vote is explained by economic factors. In contrast, there is a robust negative correlation between Cohesion Policy and ====. We estimate that had there not been this negative relationship, some 2 million more voters would have participated in the referendum, which is more than the winning margin between the remain and leave votes. Our analysis of the 2017 election suggests that Conservatives lost and Labour gained votes in the regions that benefited from Cohesion Policy, while remain-supporting regions showed gains for the Liberal Democrats.","On 23rd June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on continuing its European Union membership. Opinion polls taken before the vote suggested a close victory for the remain side. For example, the Financial Times reported 48% in favor of staying, 46% supporting leaving, and the remaining 6% undecided on the day of the referendum.==== Eventually, the outcome was a 51.9% support for leaving the EU, making the UK the first country ever to express an intention to renounce its membership in the European Union. This unexpected outcome precipitated a sharp depreciation of the pound as well as resignation of the Prime Minister.====The outcome of the Brexit referendum as well as similar successes of populist parties and politicians elsewhere (the most notable example being the election of Donald Trump as US president in November 2016) have engendered a growing body of literature on the causes for the rise of populism in Western countries. Pastor and Veronesi (2018) argue that the growth in electoral support for populist ideas and politicians can be explained by resistance to globalization on the backdrop of rising inequality. Guiso et al. (2017), similarly, suggest that economic insecurity makes voters more receptive to populist ideas and at the same time encourages new populist parties to emerge and mainstream parties to adopt populist ideas. Stockemer (2016), however, observes that the electoral support for populist parties can be shaped by perceived rather than by actual issues encountered by voters, and that perceptions do not necessarily correspond to actual salience of issues. Specifically, he finds that support for far-right parties is driven by subjective views about immigrants, which in turn are uncorrelated with the actual number of immigrants. In other words, populism seems to thrive on perceived rather than actually experienced threats and injustices. This view resonates also with the arguments of Inglehart and Norris (2016) who posit that cultural backlash brought about by the decline of traditional values and their replacement by cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism explains the growing success of populism better than economic insecurity.====Several recent studies address directly the factors explaining the unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum. Multiple common patterns have been identified. Becker et al. (2017), Arnorsson and Zoega (2018) and Alabrese et al. (2019) all point out that the support for leaving the EU rises with age and falls with education.==== Older and/or low skilled voters have struggled economically in recent times (Autor et al., 2019). Correspondingly, Brexit proved popular in less well-off regions which were adversely affected by the decline of manufacturing in the UK in recent decades.==== Eichengreen et al. (2018), furthermore, argue that economic fundamentals fail to explain fully the unexpectedly high support for leaving the EU in the referendum. They document large and volatile swings in voters’ sentiment in the run-up to the referendum. These swings affected all voter cohorts and were therefore crucial for the eventual triumph of the Leave side. They predict that similar swings in sentiment will be critical also for the future relationship between the UK and the European Union.====Several contributors make the rather surprising observation that the support for remaining in the EU bears little relation to the potential benefits from maintaining close economic ties with Europe. On the one hand, Becker et al. (2017) find that the extent of immigration from the EU and strength of trade ties with the EU have had a significant impact on the voting in the Brexit referendum. However, they conclude that these variables have little additional explanatory power once voters’ characteristics are controlled for. Furthermore, receipts of subsidies from the EU do not appear significant in their analysis. Los et al. (2017) go even further by positing that the regions that supported leaving in fact have more to lose by cutting trade ties with Europe than the remain-supporting regions. Similarly, Chen et al. (2018) observe that the UK will be hurt more by the economic consequences of Brexit than any other country in the EU with the exception of Ireland.====The limited role of the potential benefits derived from closer economic ties with the EU was also mirrored in the salience of the main issues in the pre-referendum campaign. The Leave side focused on three main areas.==== First, the EU was presented as infringing on the sovereignty of the UK and its democratic institutions and undermining the British national identity. This was reflected in the slogan ‘Take back control’ adopted by Leave EU, the main campaign group supporting ending the UK's EU membership. Second, the EU membership was presented as costly (with this cost being estimated, and widely publicized, as £350 million per week) and this expense was presented as inefficient (with the proposed alternative being increased funding for the UK National Health Service). Finally, the scale of immigration from the EU to the UK was seen as ‘out of control’ and damaging for the British labor market, with the Leave campaign liberally conflating free mobility of labor within the EU Single Market with refugee flows from Syria and other non-EU countries. The economic benefits from closer integration with the EU, including gains that less-developed parts of the UK enjoy because of the EU regional aid, received limited attention.==== Likewise, there was virtually no discussion as to if and how the missing regional-aid funds would be made up for by the UK government in case of Brexit.====Less than a year after the referendum, Prime Minister Theresa May called a surprise general election, which took place on 8th June 2017. The election was justified by the Prime Minister by the need to strengthen her hand in negotiations on Brexit.==== Correspondingly, Brexit was one of the key issues over which the main parties tried to differentiate their positions. The Prime Minister promised to secure a negotiated exit agreement with the EU that would respect several of her ‘red lines’: no membership in the Single Market or the Customs Union in order to allow the UK to enter into trade agreements with third countries, end to the free movement of labor, and end to (most of) UK's contributions to the EU budget. The Labour Party held an intermediate position, promising that its government would respect the referendum result, while negotiating a new close relationship with the EU, with the customs union explicitly accepted as an option. The Liberal Democrats, finally, supported reversing Brexit and argued that any final agreement negotiated with the EU should have to be endorsed by the voters in a second referendum. Contrary to expectations, the Conservatives lost their majority and had to form a minority government. The main beneficiary of the election was the Labour Party, with the Liberal Democrats also recording modest gains.====In this paper, we revisit the role played by one aspect of the UK's economic ties with the EU: the financial gains that accrue to some UK regions due to transfers under the EU's Cohesion Policy. Although the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, some of its regions have received considerable sums of regional aid from the EU Cohesion Policy. In the 2014-20 EU budget, the UK was set to receive some € 11 billion in Cohesion Policy payments.==== Out of these funds, one quarter has been set aside for the two less developed regions (Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, and West Wales and the Valleys), with another quarter going to the eleven transition regions (Cumbria, Devon, East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire, Highlands and Islands, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Northern Ireland, Shropshire and Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, and Tees Valley and Durham).==== The remaining half of Cohesion Policy funds is to be shared by the other 27 regions (all of which are classified as developed). There are thus significant regional differences in how much the residents of UK regions benefit from regional aid funds (see also the discussion in the next section, and the per-capita figures in Table 1 and Fig. 1).====We carry out our analysis of the electoral impact of Cohesion Policy both in the context of the 2016 Brexit referendum and the 2017 General Election. We also look at the correlation between the regional pattern of voting in the Brexit referendum and the results of the 2017 General Election: this part is intended to show which parties benefited the most from pro-EU sentiment. We look at the actual vote shares in the two votes at the level of NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 regions: the former is the level at which eligibility for Cohesion Policy is determined, while the latter is closer to the level at which the funds are actually spent.====We introduce the data used in our analysis and explain our methodology in the next section. Thereafter, we present our results in section 3, and offer some concluding remarks in section 4.",Can money buy EU love?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018304555,5 July 2019,2019,Research Article,241.0

Potential contestants observe their value and the common opportunity cost of entry, and make entry decisions simultaneously. Theory predicts that whether or not contestants are informed of the number of entrants prior to choosing their expenditures has no effect on entry or ====. We test these assertions in our experiments. We find substantial over-entry in both information structures. However, entry is higher when contestants are informed. Since expenditures do not, on average, differ across information structures, aggregate expenditure is also higher when contestants are informed. Contestants earn on average less than the opportunity cost of entry.","Conflict is a prevalent feature of human interaction. Examples include political campaigns, warfare, rent seeking, price wars, litigation, and many others. All of these diverse examples share some common features. In particular, they all involve the irrevocable allocation of resources, and an increase in expenditures is presumed to increase the probability of prevailing in the conflict, all else equal.====These features are also found in a class of games known as contests, and as a result conflict is often modeled as a contest. In a contest game, contestants simultaneously choose expenditures in an attempt to win a prize, and the contestant who chooses the highest expenditure has the highest probability of winning the prize. The prize is either allocated to the contestant with the highest expenditure (a perfectly discriminating contest) or allocated randomly, with the probability of winning the prize increasing in a contestant's expenditure (an imperfectly discriminating contest). Crucially, expenditures are lost, regardless of whether or not a contestant obtains the prize.====The literature on such contests is large and burgeoning. However, most of this literature has focused on environments where the number of contestants is exogenously fixed and is common knowledge. In practice, these assumptions are unlikely to hold. Potential contestants clearly face opportunity costs of competing, and are likely to self select into a contest. In addition, in some environments contestants are unlikely to know the number of opponents they face, while in others this information is readily available. For example, in political campaigns politicians publicly declare their candidacy. However, when the contest at issue involves rent seeking behavior on the part of firms, each firm is unlikely to know how many other firms are actively competing for the rent. How does behavior in contests depend on whether or not the number of contestants (entrants) is known before expenditures are chosen?====To address these questions, we theoretically and experimentally examine contests with endogenous entry. Potential contestants observe their private values of winning the prize and the opportunity cost of entry before making simultaneous entry decisions, so that they are able to self-select into the contest on the basis of their value. After entry, contestants simultaneously choose expenditure levels, the highest of which wins the contest. We investigate the effect of informing entrants of the total number of entrants there are in the contest before they choose their expenditures.====Experimental investigations of contests usually find that the observed distribution of individual expenditures has a high frequency of expenditures at or close to zero, and a large number of expenditures that are relatively close to contestant valuation of the prize.==== Further, the frequency of aggressive expenditures results in average expenditures which exceed Nash predictions. Further, average payoffs are frequently negative.====One contribution of our study is to see if endogenizing participation in a contest can account for these findings. Since, in the literature with an exogenous number of contestants, contestants who choose expenditures of zero are not given the opportunity to opt out of the contest, will we see such behavior when entry is endogenous? Further, will we continue to see highly aggressive behavior if the number of contestants participating is lower due to endogenous participation? Will the payoffs of contestants exceed the opportunity cost of entry? What is the effect of uncertainty regarding the number of entrants on aggregate expenditures?====We find that potential contestants enter more than predicted, regardless of whether or not they will be informed of the number of entrants. However, entry is higher when they will be informed, suggesting that they prefer such contests. After entry, contestant expenditures, regardless of information structure, exhibits many of the same features found in the previous literature. In particular, expenditures of zero are common, despite contestants having entered at a positive opportunity cost. We hypothesize that this may be driven by potential contestants entering in the hopes of being the only entrant and winning the prize with an expenditure of zero. Extremely aggressive expenditures are also common, such that, on average, expenditures exceed Nash predictions. Contestant expenditures do not, on average, significantly differ between the two information structures. However, the higher entry when contestants are informed leads to higher levels of aggregate expenditures.====There has been some previous theoretical work on entry in contests. Both Corcoran (1984) and Corcoran and Karels (1985) assess the implications of costless entry into an imperfectly discriminating contest, focusing on how the level of aggregate expenditures compare with the value of the prize.==== Gradstein (1995) examine a similar model, but with a fixed entry cost. Fu and Lu (2010), Fu et al. (2015) and Grossmann and Dietl (2015) all investigate the optimal design of complete information and imperfectly discriminating contests when the contestants face entry costs.====Perfectly discriminating contests with entry decisions have also received some attention. Both Moldovanu et al. (2012) and Thomas and Wang (2013) study environments where contestants with low levels of expenditure can be “punished” with a negative prize. Potential contestants can avoid such a prize by declining to participate in the contest altogether.====Another literature of interest deals with exogenous entry in which a fixed number of potential contestants each participate with some exogenous probability. Lim and Matros (2009) and Fu et al. (2011) focus on the optimal disclosure policy of a contest designer wishing to maximize expenditures in such environments. Münster (2006) studies equilibrium behavior in imperfectly discriminating contests, where each contestant has a valuation of zero (does not participate) with some probability. The only experimental study of such environments we are aware of is Boosey et al. (2017), which provides experimental tests of many of the findings of Lim and Matros (2009).====The experimental literature dealing with entry in contests is quite small, and deals with imperfectly discriminating contests with complete information. Anderson and Stafford (2003) examines entry when potential contestants face a common entry fee and finds less entry than predicted, but this part of their experimental design involves a single period. Morgan et al. (2012) examines a similar environment, but with an opportunity cost of entry and finds that when the value of the prize is high, contestant payoffs exceed the opportunity cost of entry, suggesting under-entry, and that the reverse is true when the value of the prize is low.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follow.

We show that the structure of protection emerging in the political equilibrium not only depends on the weight attached by the government to ==== when making its policy decision, but also on the degree of market power of firms and on the terms-of-trade variations due to the degree of pass-through. Our results highlight the importance of preferences in shaping the structure of protection and are consistent with the occurring of protectionism also in unorganized ====.","Over the last decades, as recently documented by Caliendo et al. (2015) and Bown and Crowley (2016), significant progress has been made in the liberalization of international trade regimes worldwide. Yet there are huge variations in the levels of trade protection across countries (with high income countries having more liberal regimes), and within countries across different sectors, with agriculture, textiles, apparel and footwear facing greater import barriers. Moreover, the recent great recession has led to the emergence of protectionist forces. In the aftermath of the crisis, especially in countries strongly hurt by the economic downturn and struggling with a slow recovery, governments have been facing growing political pressure to undertake protectionist measures.====It is necessary for governments to strike a balance between the interests of politically organized groups - e.g. shareholders of large firms as well as their workers, or even voters and consumers with special interests - and those of the society as a whole. Industries and individual firms may ask for protection, and a small tariff may yield positive terms-of-trade effects on top of fiscal revenue, but this also implies higher prices for consumers. Exporters may push for an export subsidy, but this is costly for taxpayers and can erode the terms of trade. Which policy is then socially preferable? And which trade policy will emerge in the political equilibrium? What are the economic forces and the mechanisms that lead to one outcome or the other?====Several scholars have tackled these questions and the literature on the topic is vast. Theoretical models have considered different mechanisms and shed light on many aspects, but some key issues remain open. The empirical literature has tried to verify the main predictions of the models with some success, but a few puzzles remain to be solved.====We contribute to the literature on “protection for sale” by developing a general model of monopolistic competition that simultaneously encompasses several motives for trade protection that have so far been treated separately. With this tool in hand, we seek to understand how the underlying structure of preferences affects trade policy decisions in an environment in which the government must find a compromise between the interests of lobbies and the costs of trade protection for consumers. We highlight the importance of the interplay between demand characteristics and the behaviour of firms, showing how several factors can explain why we observe an outcome in one context and a different outcome in another. We show that the trade policy emerging in the political equilibrium may either be strongly protectionist or more liberal, depending on the degree of market competition, on the import penetration, on the power of lobbies, on the market structure, on the degree of pass-through and on the terms-of-trade effects. By considering such realistic features, our model can help explain some empirical results that may be puzzling under less flexible models.====The literature related to our work dates back to the earlier contributions of Findlay and Wellisz (1982) and Hillman (1982). One of the most influential papers is the one by Grossman and Helpman (1994) (henceforth GH) who develop a formal micro-founded model with clear-cut testable predictions about the cross-sector structure of protection. In their model, trade policy endogenously emerges from the interaction between government and organized sectoral interest groups. GH show that, within a perfectly competitive framework, where free trade is the social optimum, the structure of protection that emerges in the political equilibrium entails an import tariff (export subsidy) in organized sectors and an import subsidy (export tax) in unorganized sectors. Moreover, the level of protection is positively related to the import penetration ratio for unorganized sectors and negatively for organized sectors, while the opposite holds for import elasticity. In a subsequent paper, Grossman and Helpman (1995b) relax the small country assumption and study endogenous protection in a two-country setting where terms of trade are operative. In this context, the optimum tariff (or export tax) argument for protection delivers a motive for taxing international trade also in unorganized sectors.====The main predictions of the GH model are confirmed by many empirical studies, such as Goldberg and Maggi (1999) and Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000). However, the same studies often find that lobbies have an unexpected small weight in the government objective function and, given this result, they seem to get a surprisingly large amount of protection.==== The unexpectedly benevolent government is one of the puzzles of empirical studies on the “protection for sale” type of models. Another piece of evidence, that is hard to squeeze into the GH model, is the small magnitude of political contributions in relation to the efficiency losses due to trade protection. In addition, the GH model predicts that unorganized industries should receive negative protection, while according to the empirical evidence, industries classified as unorganized receive positive levels of trade protection.====These results have been interpreted as an indication that there are other factors influencing the equilibrium level of protection that are left out by the baseline theoretical model. See Goldberg and Maggi (1999), Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000), and Ederington and Minier (2008) and the discussion in Gawande and Krishna (2003). In fact, the baseline GH model overlooks market power, product differentiation and the possibility of incomplete pass-through and of terms of trade effects. In this respect, Gawande and Bandyopadhyay (2000) propose two empirical specifications of the GH model: a parsimonious specification based on the original GH model, and a large specification based on the existing empirical work that nests the GH model and includes other factors, among which market structure and firm concentration.====Broda et al. (2008) provide ample evidence on the positive relationship between the median import tariff in a country and the median inverse elasticity of export supply (where an infinite elasticity would suggest the absence of any terms-of-trade effect). Moreover, they estimate an extended version of the GH model and show that the terms-of-trade argument is at least as important as the lobbying pressure in explaining protection. Bagwell and Staiger (2011) and Ludema and Mayda (2013) also provide ample evidence on the importance of terms-of-trade effects in explaining international trade agreements.====By extending the GH model, we offer a theoretical explanation for the inclusion of variables related to market structure and of terms-of-trade effects in the empirical assessment of the protection for sale model.====A number of further extensions to the GH model have been proposed. For instance, Mitra (1999) endogenizes lobby formation; heterogeneous firms are considered in Bombardini (2008); Matschke and Sherlund (2006) incorporate labour unions and labour mobility into the model; Facchini et al. (2006) develop a quota version of the GH model; trade in intermediate inputs is introduced in Gawande et al. (2012); Paltseva (2014) explores the implications of the existence of demand linkages and inter-industry rivalry among lobbies, showing how in these circumstances the lobbying strategy of organized sectors tends to be less aggressive; Ludema (2001) presents a model with oligopolistic firms that engage in collusion in the domestic market and in political lobbying for import protection; Stoyanov and Yildiz (2015) develop a model in which countries choose whether to participate in preferential or multilateral free trade negotiations under the pressure of lobbies; lobbying activities of multinational firms are investigated by Hillman and Ursprung (1993), Grossman and Helpman (1995a) and Polk et al. (2014) among others. Overall these models demonstrate that additional factors can enrich the original framework and provide some theoretical explanations for the empirical findings that, as discussed, are not always fully consistent with the predictions of GH's protection for sale model.====An interesting extension of the baseline model, closely related to our paper, is found in Chang (2005), who considers the case of monopolistic competition à la Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) and highlights a new motive for protection that has to do with market power.==== The predictions of this model depart from the original ones in three fundamental ways: first, the equilibrium outcome for imports entails protection in all sectors, whether organized or not, while for exports also sectors represented by lobbies may bear a tax on their sales; second, the imperfectly competitive structure of the economy implies that free trade is no longer the welfare-maximizing choice; third, the level of protection always varies inversely with the import penetration ratio (in GH this happens in organized sectors only).==== However, the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model of monopolistic competition used in Chang (2005) lacks flexibility and rules out some realistic mechanisms, such as markup adjustments and incomplete pass-through.==== In particular, we propose a monopolistic competition model that generates price interactions among firms and is flexible enough to encompass several distinct types of utility functions, while preserving tractability. As a consequence, producers display variable markups, meaning that firms adjust their price to sales, thus reacting to market conditions and generating a form of price interaction among firms, even within a monopolistically competitive framework. One immediate implication is that domestic and foreign producer prices reflect government interventions in trade, so that equilibrium trade policies now depend on the rich interplay between different mechanisms, namely: (i) the political motive for trade protection, due to the campaign contributions of special interest groups organized into lobbies; (ii) the imperfect competition motive for trade protection reflecting the non-optimality of free trade in a non-competitive setting; (iii) the terms-of-trade motive for protection related to the existence of a certain degree of tariff (and subsidy) absorption or pass-through. It should be noted that the first force drives the main results in the GH seminal paper, while in Chang (2005) results stem from the second force only. The terms-of-trade motive generated by variable markups and imperfect pass-through is, instead, a specific mechanism of the framework we propose.====Our results can be summarized as follows. For sectors organized into lobbies, the endogenous import tariff is always positive and inversely related to the degree of import penetration. For unorganized sectors the endogenous import policy can be a tariff or a subsidy, depending on the interactions of the underlying mechanisms, with the profit motives and the terms-of-trade gains working towards the introduction of an import tariff, and the relative strength of the lobbying forces pushing towards an import subsidy. For exports, the trade-offs faced by the government are more challenging. On the one hand, the profit motive requires an export subsidy, on the other hand the terms-of-trade effects call for an export tax. Aggressive lobbies and lower degree of pass-through may move the equilibrium towards an export subsidy for the organized sectors and to an export tax higher than the optimal one for the unorganized sectors.====Overall, we show that by making use of a more flexible model of monopolistic competition, it is possible to obtain various trade policy outcomes consistently with the strong variation of trade policy observed across sectors and the occurring of protectionism also in unorganized industries.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our assumptions about the economic environment. Section 3 characterizes the open economy version of the model. Section 4 presents the interactions between lobbies and the government in the light of the GH protection for sale framework.

Using three comprehensive data sets from Switzerland with over 3,500 propositions, we exploit variation in the number of federal and cantonal propositions. Voters know the most about the content of federal propositions when they are exclusively presented and less with a high number of concurrent cantonal propositions on the ballot. Across other outcomes we find no consistent indications that – for the observed variation in the exposure to popular votes – a high number of propositions impedes the quality of decision making in Swiss federal direct democracy. In the medium to longer term, more federal propositions on the ballot rather relate to higher perceived political influence and satisfaction with democracy.","Direct democracy is a most relevant process for collective decision making.==== Like any democratic process it has informational demands and relies on public discourse.==== A meaningful discourse is helping citizens to form a reasoned opinion.==== However, concerns have been raised about uninformed and overburdened voters, overstrained by the number of issues about which they are asked to decide (for discussions, see, e.g., Bowler, 2015; Lupia, 2016; Seabrook et al., 2015). Overburdened voters may be easily swayed and are more likely to follow the endorsements of extremists (see, e.g., the concerns raised in Sartori, 1987).====This reasoning suggests a relationship between the quality of the decision process and the number of ballot propositions within a period of time. On the one hand, citizens might be too infrequently engaged with the political process so that neither the politicians nor the media nor citizens’ networks are prepared for an open and productive discourse. On the other hand, there might be too many issues being debated, which can turn a potentially meaningful discourse into a superficial exchange of slogans. If citizens feel overstrained, the motivation to cast an informed vote might decline, and support for the very process of direct democracy might be undermined.====In this paper, we explore how the number of popular votes affects the quality of the decision-making process in direct democracy. Following Matsusaka's (1995) information theory of voting, we assume that voters are at least partly intrinsically motivated to vote whereby the incentive to vote increases with the confidence in their vote choice. Information increases certainty about the consequences of a proposition. With each additional proposition, voters looking for orientation thus have to gauge whether they should acquire more costly information or search for cues allowing them to use heuristics. On the basis of this theory, we derive indicators that are meant to capture traces of overstrained citizens.====To empirically analyze the consequences of a high number of ballot propositions, we exploit the unique setting of Swiss direct democracy. We rely on the variation in the number of federal propositions on the ballot as well as arguably exogenous variation in concurrent cantonal propositions, that is, propositions from the subfederal state level. For the empirical tests, we use three comprehensive data sets: administrative data (1981–2015, up to 7,080 observations), individual postvote survey data (1981–2015, up to 264,000 observations), and household panel data (1999–2012, up to 114,000 observations).====Our results are threefold: First, we consider the relationship between the number of propositions on the ballot and voters’ knowledge, turnout, blank voting, and use of decision shortcuts. We find that citizens know the most about a federal proposition if it is exclusively put to a vote at a vote weekend. With more than one federal proposition on the ballot, only with a relatively high number of concurrent federal and cantonal propositions voters tend to have less knowledge about federal propositions and to cast more blank votes. Given the deliberate agenda setting of the Federal Council for the federal propositions, the correlations might reflect consequences of the ==== of propositions as well as of their specific ====. Focusing on the consequences of a high number of concurrent cantonal propositions, we measure a positive effect on turnout. This could be because of a mobilization effect, as more issues are likely to affect more citizens to a larger extent. With more propositions on the ballot, citizens are ==== more likely to vote in line with the recommendations of the pole parties. We thus do not find any systematic evidence for polarization. We also do not observe an increase in voting for the status quo.====Second, we assess how the number of propositions within the last 12 months prior to a voting weekend relates to voters’ knowledge and behavior regarding the current federal votes on the ballot. We do not find relationships consistently pointing to citizen overstrain. The coefficients for the effects of past cantonal propositions are close to zero and rather precisely estimated.====Third, we estimate the relationship between the exposure to past and forthcoming popular votes on citizens' perceived influence, interest in politics, and general support of democracy. For the variation in the Swiss federal context, we find no evidence that exposure to popular votes negatively affects citizens’ attitudes toward democracy. To the contrary, our results suggest that citizens tend to feel more influential in politics in the short term around vote weekends. In the medium to longer term, they feel more influential and are more satisfied with democracy when they are more intensely exposed to popular votes at the federal level.====In sum, our large set of results combining behavioral and attitudinal data suggests that even in periods with a high number of popular votes in Switzerland, citizens were not generally overstrained. For the observed variation in the number of propositions, the functioning of direct democracy seems not endangered. It is important to note, however, that a higher number of popular votes could still lead to citizen overstrain.====This paper contributes comprehensive correlational and possibly causal evidence on the effects of exposure to popular votes on behavior and attitudes. Unlike previous work on the immediate effect of the number of votes (see, e.g., Augenblick and Nicholson, 2016), we also consider medium to longer term consequences. Another feature which distinguishes our paper from the previous literature is evidence on an array of behaviors other than turnout (Garmann, 2017) or voting for the status quo (Augenblick and Nicholson, 2016).==== Specifically, we examine the relationship of exposure to a lower or higher number of popular votes with blank voting, citizen knowledge, and reliance on government and party recommendations.====One of our main contributions is that we add evidence on attitudinal measures which capture the general support of and interest in democracy. Evidence from a European setting on the correlation between the intensity of exposure to popular votes and support of democracy is scarce. Previous work by Augenblick and Nicholson (2016) focuses on important choice fatigue effects in the specific setting of California. They show that for votes lower down on the ballot list individuals are more likely to opt for the status quo. People concerned about a high number of propositions, however, are not only worried about potential tiring effects because of cognitive depletion. They fear that citizens, media, and potentially even parties disengage with specific policy issues because of general overstrain leading to dissatisfaction. To assess whether this concern is founded one needs evidence on behavioral, but also attitudinal reactions. The current policy debate lacks such evidence, although the debate may be crucial for the further institutional development of democracies and citizens’ role in politics in particular.====The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the conceptual framework and refers to the previous literature. In Section 3, we explain the institutional setting and present the data. In Section 4, we describe the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the results. We offer concluding remarks in Section 6.",Overstrained citizens?

It uses data on Italian municipalities during the 2000s and shows that: 1) municipalities are subject to political budget cycles in capital spending; 2) the Italian sub-national fiscal rule (Domestic Stability Pact, DSP) introduced in 1999 has been enforced by the central government; 3) municipalities subject to the fiscal rule show more limited political budget cycles than municipalities not subject to the rule. In order to identify the effect, we rely on the fact that the domestic fiscal rule does not apply to municipalities below 5000 inhabitants. We find that the political budget cycle increases real capital spending by about 10–20 percent on average in the years prior to municipal elections and that municipalities subject to the DSP show a pre-electoral increase in capital spending which is only a quarter of the one of municipalities not subject to the rule.","This paper presents evidence suggesting that fiscal rules can help moderate the political budget cycle. The term “political budget cycle” generally refers to increases in government spending or in the deficit, or decreases in taxes, in an election year or pre-election year, which are perceived as motivated by the incumbent's desire for re-election. Fiscal rules can limit the political budget cycle because they reduce the politician incentives to be profligate in order to be re-elected, by increasing the cost of pre-electoral profligacy if elected. The focus of the paper is on Italian municipalities during the 2000s when they have been subject to the sub-national fiscal rule (Domestic Stability Pact, DSP) introduced in 1999.====It is well recognized that the political budget cycle has potentially a number of negative effects. The political budget cycle implies that public spending or taxation policies are tweaked to achieve goals that are different from the social welfare (Alesina, 1987, 1988). It also usually leads to excessive spending and deficits. In the context of sub-national entities, it is important to remind that budget deficits at the national levels can originate at sub-national level of governments.====Recently, the growth of deficit and debt to unprecedented levels in many advanced economies has forced many countries to adopt fiscal rules to contain their further growth. While fiscal rules are usually designed to limit deficits and debts directly, this paper argues that they can also have an effect by reducing politicians' incentives to overspend prior to elections. However, assessing the effects of fiscal rules is not always an easy task. For example, identifying the causal effect of fiscal rules on fiscal aggregates is not simple. The obvious endogeneity problem is that national or subnational governments adopting a fiscal rule might be those more fiscally responsible; therefore, the better fiscal outcomes might be due to the voters’ preferences, more than to the introduction of a fiscal rule.====This paper identifies the effect of the rule on the political budget cycle leveraging on the fact that municipalities below 5000 inhabitants have been exempted from the rule. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the political budget cycle increases capital spending by about 11 percent (in real terms) on average in the three years prior to municipal elections and that the sub-national fiscal rule reduces these figures by about 80 percent. These results are confirmed by a regression discontinuity analysis: the electoral cycle effect estimated at the 5000 threshold using polynomial regression is about 18 percent, while municipalities subject to the DSP show an increase in capital spending in pre-electoral years 75 percent lower. We also provide evidence that the fiscal rule has been enforced by the central government, at least over the period 2004–2006 for which we have data on the municipalities that have breached the DSP.====A number of recent papers have used Italian administrative municipal data to address an array of political economy issues. Cioffi et al. (2012) provide evidence of political budget cycle in capital and overall spending, while Alesina and Paradisi (2017) focus on the revenue side by exploiting the introduction of a new real estate tax in 2011. Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) study the effect of the wage on the performance of mayors. Alesina et al. (2018) show that younger politicians behave more strategically than older ones. Particularly relevant for our purposes is the paper by Grembi et al. (2016), which shows that the relaxation of the DSP for smaller municipalities in 2001 triggered a significant deficit bias.====This paper relates also to three other branches of literature. By assessing how fiscal rules can limit the political budget cycle, our contribution naturally fits in the broad political business cycles literature. See, among many, Rogoff and Sibert (1988), Rogoff (1990), Alesina et al. (1997), Persson and Tabellini (2000), Brender and Drazen (2005, 2008), Shi and Svensson (2006). A number of contributions have assessed empirically the political budget cycle. For a recent one on the political cycle in capital expenditures see Gupta et al. (2015).====Related to our work is also the literature assessing the political budget cycle at the sub-national level. For example, Coelho et al. (2006) and Veiga and Veiga (2007) provide evidence of political cycle at the municipal level in Portugal; Foremny and Riedel (2014) in Germany; Drazen and Eslava (2010) provide evidence on Colombia; Brollo and Nannicini (2012) on Brazil.====Finally, our paper is also connected to the growing literature on national and sub-national fiscal rules (for example, Beetsma and Debrun, 2004, 2007; Debrun et al., 2008). Burret and Feld (2014) nicely summarize the evidence and the literature regarding the role of sub-national fiscal rules in federations, like the US and Switzerland. In this strand of literature, the recent contribution by Grembi et al. (2016) is the first to propose “a quasi-experimental design” to control for omitted and unobservable factors that may affect previous results and to better establish the causal effect of the introduction of the rule.====Our paper contributes to these different literature in several ways. First, it provides evidence on the existence of a political budget cycle on the expenditure side at the local level in Italy and quantifies its effects. Second, it provides new evidence that the central government has enforced the DSP. The fact that the DSP has been enforced by the central government reduces concerns regarding the endogeneity of the rule, although it still leaves open the possibility that omitted and unobservable factors might affect how municipalities have reacted to the imposition of the rule. The regression discontinuity analysis addresses this issue focusing on the behavior of municipalities around the threshold. Finally, and most importantly, it provides novel evidence that the imposition of the rule has reduced the political budget cycle. We believe this is the first paper providing evidence that sub-national fiscal rules can contain the political budget cycle. Importantly, even when the introduction of a fiscal rule proves effective, in the sense that helps contain the deficit, it is very difficult to assess whether it is welfare improving. On the contrary, a rule that mitigates the political budget cycle, at least in this respect, is welfare improving.",Fiscal rules to tame the political budget cycle: Evidence from Italian municipalities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268019300230,11 June 2019,2019,Research Article,246.0

The test is based on the idea that competitive elections represent periodic perturbations to the Tiebout equilibrium of ==== provision and allocation of households to communities, so that their schedule should affect the timing of households' sorting decisions. On the other hand, internal migration flows that have nothing to do with the demand for public goods over which localities vote recurrently ought to be orthogonal to the timing of elections in a reduced-form migration equation. I exploit the staggered schedule of mayoral elections in Italy to analyze migration, elections, and public budget data across several thousands of municipalities, and find evidence of a systematic influence of the electoral calendar on the timing of sorting decisions.","The idea of mobile households sorting across localities according to their preferences for public services, or “voting with their feet” (Tiebout, 1956), has played an influential role in theoretical and applied work in urban economics for decades (Oates, 2006). However, to what extent Tiebout sorting mechanisms actually achieve an efficient provision of local public goods and an optimal allocation of households to communities has been shown to depend on circumstances including the availability of Lindahl pricing in environments of heterogeneous communities (Ross and Yinger, 1999) and the objective function of local jurisdictions (Jehiel and Lamy, 2018). From an empirical point of view, the role of local public goods in influencing households' internal migration decisions besides the well-established ‘push and pull’ factors from labor market conditions remains unclear (Dowding et al., 1994). Part of the scepticism about the practical relevance of Tiebout sorting seems to be due to model specification and estimation difficulties: identifying the effect of decentralised fiscal policy on households' location decisions has proved problematic, and thwarted by endogeneity, reverse causality, and measurement issues (Kuminoff et al., 2013).====In fact, the rare circumstances where the provision of local public goods changes exogenously in a quasi-experimental setting are increasingly seen as the ideal conditions for testing the key predictions of the Tiebout model in terms of capitalization of public amenities into property values and stratification of communities via direct migratory responses.==== Banzhaf and Walsh (2008) use a difference-in-differences approach to test whether the entry and exit of polluting facilities have an impact on population density (through the number of individuals leaving and entering a community) and mean incomes (changing mix between richer and poorer households) of evenly-spaced ‘constructed’ neighborhoods in California, and find evidence of out-migration and impoverishment of communities when the public good air quality deteriorates. Chay and Greenstone (2005) and Greenstone and Gallagher (2008) use quasi-experimental approaches to evaluate the welfare impact of mandated federal environmental policies on US local governments, and provide evidence of capitalization of environmental quality into housing values in hedonic price models that allow for individual preference-based self-selection to locations. Rhode and Strumpf (2003) test instead the long-run Tiebout prediction that the secular decline in mobility costs should increase preference heterogeneity and policy variation across communities. They find no support for those hypotheses on samples of US municipalities and counties, thus challenging the view that community choice be primarily driven by Tiebout incentives. Borge et al. (2014) exploit a partial fiscal decentralization reform in Norway that allowed greater local discretion in the use of public resources, and find higher responsiveness of the local public sector to local demand as well as more intense population sorting after the reform. On the other hand, a recent and growing literature focuses on the impact of discrete changes in local income taxation schedules on the location decisions of high-income taxpayers, generally uncovering large elasticities of internal migration flows to local income tax policy differentials (Schmidheiny and Slotwinski, 2015; Basten et al., 2017; Martinez, 2017; Moretti and Wilson, 2017; Agrawal and Foremny, 2019).====This paper puts forward a novel, reduced-form test of the Tiebout sorting hypothesis that relies on the staggered time structure of local elections as an exogenous and recurrent perturbation to the equilibrium allocation of households to communities. The test is built on the idea that since periodic competitive elections have an impact on the provision of local public services, the calendar of local elections should influence the timing of sorting processes. At the same time, internal migration flows that have little to do with the consequences of elections in terms of local public service provision should not be affected by the timing of local races.====The idea that the periodicity of elections can have an influence on the trajectory of aggregate economic variables (output, unemployment, inflation, and nominal exchange rates) and of public policy (public expenditure, taxation, and regulatory measures) has a long tradition in economics. ==== Nordhaus (1975) was the first to formally argue that the fact that “the government be chosen in periodic competitive elections” (Nordhaus, 1975: 185) can induce incumbent politicians to exploit nominal rigidities and voters' naivety (myopia, adaptive expectation formation, and retrospective voting) and manipulate short-term macroeconomic trade-offs to engineer ‘political business cycles’ of low pre-election unemployment followed by after-election inflation. Rogoff (1990) later provided a rational, dynamic signaling interpretation of the observed effect of election schedules on the economy, pointing to the strategic timing of fiscal policy by competent politician types trying to separate from incompetent types by switching to more salient public consumption expenditures and away from investments right before the elections (political budget cycles). Starting with Rosenberg (1992), a strand of the subsequent literature investigated the presence of such cycles on the larger number of observations that are found in local government data, as in the recent empirical analyses of Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya (2004), Baleiras and Da Silva Costa (2004), Veiga and Veiga (2007), Dahlberg and Mörk (2011), Foremny and Riedel (2014) and Englmaier and Stowasser (2017).====In practice, testing whether the timing of elections has an influence on the timing of household sorting requires high-frequency internal migration data and an exogenous structure of decentralised government elections. The former makes it possible to monitor the trajectory of migration rates in the vicinity of the date of the election, and the latter allows an interpretation of the election date in a given locality as a randomly assigned treatment. I rely here on a large dataset of Italian municipalities (the about 7000 local authorities - ==== - located in continental Italy) and exploit the availability of monthly municipal-level migration data along with the staggered schedule of mayoral elections occurring every fifth year. In particular, I analyze the trajectory of migration in the proximity of the three largest election waves of the past two decades involving about 4000 municipalities and taking place on June 12, 2004, June 7, 2009, and May 26, 2014. Importantly, I can use the set of authorities not holding an election during those years (around 3000 municipalities) as the control group in a difference-in-differences approach, where the electoral treatment can be taken as quasi-randomly assigned due to the fact that the causes of the staggered election schedule date back several decades.====The results of the empirical analysis can be briefly summarised as follows. First, difference-in-differences estimation on monthly migration data around those three large elections provides evidence that the timing of municipal elections influences the timing of households' migration decisions. After accounting for seasonality of the sorting process and using the municipalities that do not hold elections in those years as the control group, average migration rates in the months following the date of the election turn out to be around four to five percent higher than in the months preceding the date of the election in the localities that actually held municipal elections, with the estimated effect standing a number of robustness checks on different samples and model specifications. Second, I investigate a number of potential mechanisms linking the timing of electoral events with households' migration choices. After excluding that the evidence can be explained by mere political uncertainty, actual election results, fraudulent behavior on the part of incumbent governments aiming at maximizing pluralities, or technical reasons such as lags in voters' registration mechanisms, I test the hypothesis that the impact of the electoral schedule on the timing of household sorting is the consequence of a political budget cycle, i.e., fabrication of favorable economic conditions and implementation of generous spending and transfer policies right before the elections, followed by after-election austerity. To test this hypothesis, I employ a large panel dataset of yearly municipal budget and migration data spanning through two decades of Italian mayoral elections. The yearly panel data results reinforce the evidence of an election-driven cycle of sorting, with out-migration rates rising and in-migration rates falling sharply in the years following municipal elections. Moreover, I find that two key indicators of local government policy (the municipal budget surplus/deficit as a percentage of total current revenues and the local income tax rate) follow a time pattern that is compatible with a political budget cycle paradigm and exert a significant impact on out-migration and in-migration flows, thus pointing to the political budget cycle induced by the electoral schedule as the most likely structural cause of the observed time pattern of sorting.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the institutional framework and the dataset of Italian municipalities. Section 3 analyzes the reduced-form impact of local election schedules on the timing of sorting, while section 4 tests a number of hypotheses about the mechanisms linking the timing of elections with the timing of sorting. Finally, section 5 concludes.",The electoral migration cycle,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018304877,8 June 2019,2019,Research Article,247.0

Following Facchini et al. (2017), we interpret this correlation as evidence that labor costs drive public spending. The long-term increase in the labor share observed over this period explains half of the overall growth of central government. The relationship holds when the labor share is instrumented with movements in technological change at the frontier. When decomposing public spending, transfers, not intensive in labor, are the only component not associated with the labor share.","The long-run stability of the shares of national income received by labor and capital was ordained as “stylized fact” by Kaldor (1961). However the global decline in the labor share documented since the 1980s (for example discussed in Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013) has severely undermined this precept, perhaps confirming earlier doubts (Kravis, 1962; Kuznets and Murphy, 1966). Moreover, recent studies provide evidence of an upward trend in the labor share of income from the late 19th Century up until the 1970s in Western countries (Atkinson and Piketty, 2007; Roine and Waldenström, 2015; Bengtsson and Waldenström, 2018).====In a recent paper Facchini et al. (2017) (henceforth FMP) make the case that the recent declines in the labor share contributed to the slowdown in the growth of the size of government in OECD countries since the 1980s, through declining labor costs. In the present paper we take this hypothesis to data for Western European countries from the late 19th Century up until the 1970s. The early and mid 20th Century witnessed substantial state building across Western Europe. Tanzi and Schuknecht (2000) document that average government spending as a share of GDP around 1870 was 10.3%. By 1970 this had risen to 39% in the 11 countries analyzed in this paper - not much less than that observed in the present day.====Fig. 1 depicts the upward trend in both the labor share and public spending for central and general (total) government spending as a share of GDP for historical periods up to 1975 for our sample of countries. Notwithstanding the two world wars, for most countries there is a clear correspondence between the two series. In contrast with FMP the present paper therefore covers a period of time with much greater variation in the dependent variable, and covers the substantive period of government growth. It therefore represents an important examination of the hypothesis that the labor share substantially affects the size of government. Moreover, the idea that the labor share plays a first-order role in determining the size of government can be tested against other prominent theories explaining the growth of government in the 20th Century.====Previous literature predominantly attributes the long-term growth of government in the 20th Century to demand-side factors, such as economic development (Durevall and Henrekson, 2011) in accord with ‘Wagner's law’, democratisation and the extension of the voting franchise (Aidt et al., 2006), rising income inequality (Meltzer and Richard, 1983) or voters' ideology (Pickering and Rockey, 2011; Facchini and Melki, 2014). On the supply side, a literature emphasises the role of efficient tax innovations such as the adoption of personal income taxation in the growth of the government's revenues (Becker and Mulligan, 2003; Aidt and Jensen, 2009). The present paper instead asks whether supply side factors affecting the costs of providing public services also played a part in the dramatic growth in government spending over the period prior to 1975.====We find that the observed increase in the labor share through the period from 1869 to 1975 in countries such as Germany or the UK explains up to half of the total growth of central government spending and around one sixth of the total growth of general government spending, the latter being relatively less labor intensive due to the inclusion of social security composed of transfers. The empirical analysis uses a panel of 11 Western European countries, augmenting the analysis of Aidt et al. (2006) including the labor share as an additional explanatory variable. The labor share is measured as the share of compensation going to dependent employees in total income, using the database provided by Flora (1983). This database provides continuous and comparable annual data and extends the time span by several decades in comparison with existing cross-national datasets starting from the 1970s, thereby covering the period of growth in both the labor share and public spending through the earlier parts of the 20th Century as depicted in Fig. 1.====The size of government is consistently found to be positively associated with the labor share of income. This relationship is robust across a wide set of different econometric specifications, using both general and central government spending as the dependent variable, alternative measures of the labor share taking into account long-term structural changes in the economies and controlling for a number of further factors affecting both the labor share and public spending. In particular, the result holds up when the data are averaged across 5-year intervals to eliminate cyclical variation, a potential source of endogeneity as both the labor share and government size plausibly move with the cycle.==== In addition to the quantitatively sizeable estimate of the importance of the labor share, our analysis reveals that it is the only determinant of public spending that is robust across specifications, reinforcing the hypothesis that the labor share played a first-order role in the growth of government in the 20th Century.====As discussed below, there are other potential mechanisms linking government spending and the labor share: there may be reverse causality, as well as exogenous forces driving both. In order to address this we take two approaches. Firstly, and also in order to address measurement error in the labor share as well as the endogeneity issue, the analysis employs an instrumental variable strategy based on the established view that technological change, whether capital- or labor-augmenting, is one of the main drivers of the labor share (Acemoglu, 2003; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2013). Movements in the technological leader's labor share reflect exogenous technological change at the frontier. As in Acemoglu et al. (2006), the United States is considered as the technological leader from 1945 onwards. Individual (non-leader) country labor shares are then linked to the leader's labor share via technological catch-up. In particular technological change at the frontier is assumed to heterogeneously affect the individual countries' labor shares, depending on their distance to the technological frontier. Following a shift in the leader's labor share, countries that are closer to the frontier, i.e. with small development gaps, are more likely to experience subsequent shifts in their own labor share, whilst countries with larger development gaps will be less affected. Hence we use the interaction of the labor share of the leader with the development gap between individual countries and the leader to instrument for the country-level labor share. The instrumental variable regression results further support the hypothesis of this paper.====The second strategy addresses reverse causality in particular, reflecting the likely presence of lags in the alternative mechanisms, and implements Granger-causality tests proposed by Angrist and Pischke (2008, ch. 5). The results support the hypothesis that the labor share Granger-causes the size of government, but not vice-versa.====A further test of the central hypothesis is provided by disaggregating total public expenditure between security spending (including defence, justice, police), long-term public services (including transport and communication), collective goods (including health, public housing and education) and social transfers. The main argument of the paper applies to labor-intensive sectors of government. However, an increasing portion of total government expenditure in our sample has consisted of transfers, reaching up to around half of total spending in some countries in 1975. As underlined by FMP, these expenditures (generally) do not require labor inputs to the same extent as produced public services. We find that social transfers as a share of GDP is the only component of government spending to be not statistically associated with the labor share. This again supports the hypothesis that the link between government size and the labor share is due to labor costs.====The next section develops a theoretical discussion of how the labor share affects government spending. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy and Section 5 presents the regression results.

In this paper we analyze spatial interdependencies in corruption levels for a large sample of 1232 subnational regions from 81 countries. Based on a spatial ====, which controls for country-fixed effects and corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the error term, we find that a subnational region's corruption level is positively correlated with neighboring subnational regions' corruption levels. Extending the core model and allowing for heterogeneous ","Corruption has a long history of being investigated in economics. Kaufmann (1997) recognises corruption in the public sector as the greatest obstacle to development. Corruption reduces investment and economic growth (Mauro, 1995) as well as productivity growth (Del Mar Salinas-Jiménez and Del Mar Salinas-Jiménez, 2007). It hampers the effects of industrial policies and fosters the evolution of a private sector that violates tax rules, regulatory rules and environmental rules (Ackermann, 1999). According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is published by Transparency International, corruption is still a worldwide phenomenon in 2017.==== The majority of countries in South America, Africa and Asia as well as countries in Southern and Eastern Europe are perceived to have moderate to high corruption levels.====Cross-country differences in corruption levels are explained by a number of factors, including a country's development status, trade openness, religious affiliation, level of education, legal origin, degree and tradition of democracy, size of public sector and wealth in natural resources.==== However, corruption differs not only between but also within countries. In a recent study Mitton (2016) shows that corruption levels can vary significantly within a country. Italy is a prominent example. Northern Italian subnational regions such as Piedmont, Veneto and Bolzano are significantly below Italy's average corruption level, whereas Southern subnational regions such as Campania, Calabria and Sicily show a significantly higher degree of corruption. Subnational income and size of bureaucracies (Dininio and Orttung, 2005; Belousova et al., 2011) as well as levels of inequality and education and wealth of natural resources (Schulze et al., 2016) are factors, which can explain differences in subnational corruption levels.====The level of corruption is not only heterogeneous between and within countries, it also tends to cluster in space on the national and subnational level. Becker et al. (2009), Faber and Gerritse (2012) and Jetter and Parmeter (2018) show that countries’ corruption levels are characterized by a simultaneous spatial dependence. Recent empirical literature indicates that a similar spatial process works at the subnational level. Dong and Torgler (2012), Bologna (2017) and Lopez-Valcarcel et al. (2017) find spatial interdependencies in the corruption levels of Brazilian municipalities, Spanish municipalities and Chinese provinces, respectively. Neighboring subnational regions, alike countries, tend to have similar corruption levels.====Existing literature has either investigated whether corruption spills among countries or among subnational regions within one country. In this paper we answer two research questions: First, we ask whether interdependencies in corruption levels work between neighboring subnational regions in a broader geographic perspective and irrespective of their national affiliation. The assumption that the spatial diffusion does not stop at national borders is plausible and has been inadequately taken into account by the existing literature due to limitations in data availability. We extend the literature by using a novel dataset collected and provided by Mitton (2016) to measure whether corruption diffuses at a subnational level within and also across national borders. Our dataset includes subnational information on economy, geography, climate, natural resources and institutions from a large set of countries around the world. With this data we are able to analyze spatial spillovers among subnational regions within and across national borders, which is especially a merit in world regions that are densely nationalized and in intensive cross-border exchange. Europe is such an example where many subnational regions are located at national borders. Restricting the analysis to within-country information ignores spatial interdependencies which might work among a large set of subnational regions that are neighbors but belong to different countries.====The subnational regions included in our dataset are heterogeneous in their economic, sociocultural, political and geographic characteristics. Recent literature suggests that the strength of spatial impacts is not homogenous across countries, but depends on countries' absolute and relative characteristics (Kelejian et al., 2013; Borsky and Raschky, 2015). Therefore, as second research question we ask whether spatial interdependencies vary across different groups of subnational regions. In this respect, we extend the existing literature by determining subnational regions’ characteristics, which drive or hamper their potential to impact the corruption levels of others.====We base our analysis on a sample of 81 countries including 1.232 subnational regions for which we have data on the corruption levels and a generic spatial model that accounts for the spatial diffusion of corruption on a subnational level. In particular, our models capture two different spatial processes: (i) spatial correlation in subnational corruption levels and (ii) spatial correlation between idiosyncratic common features of subnational regions' environments. To account for the simultaneity problem in the spatial process, we use an instrumental variable procedure following Kelejian and Prucha (1998, 1999; 2004; 2010b) and deploy spatial lags of independent variables as means of instruments for the subnational regions’ corruption levels.====Our results indicate that the degree of exchange between subnational regions has a significant influence on their corruption levels. The impact decreases with geographic distance. We also find that, among the characteristics of subnational regions, population size, land area, degree of market integration and resource wealth have a significant effect on subnational regions’ corruption levels. Further, our results imply that subnational regions are not homogenous in their degree of interdependencies. First, spillovers in corruption levels mainly take place within national borders. Second, rich regions tend to have a stronger impact on the corruption levels of others, which we suppose is due to their higher degree of economic, sociocultural and political exchange. Third, and in line with Kelejian et al. (2013), our results suggest that subnational regions orientate themselves towards those neighbors that have lower corruption levels.====Our findings have important political implications. First, efficient anti-corruption initiatives need to consider spatial interdependencies stemming from apparent spatial interaction as well as regional spatial heterogeneity. In case corruption levels are positively correlated, as suggested by literature and our results, estimates of the impact of anti-corruption initiatives that do not take spatial interdependencies into account, are downward biased. Since federal and regional budgets are constrained and widespread institutional policies may be difficult to implement, the design of economically efficient institutional development policies should consider the impact of the spatial interdependencies among subnational corruption levels. Therefore, effective initiatives to control corruption should be tailored to local circumstances and needs. In Italy, for example, Northern Italian provinces may require different measures to battle corruption than Southern Italian provinces. This is in line with a growing literature on the spatial coordination of policies. Rigg et al. (2009) underline the importance of vertically and horizontally aligned supranational, national and subnational policies for a balanced economic development. In order to achieve a comprehensive strategic policy design, anti-corruption measures should be spatially differentiated. “Spatial targeting” has received much attention in the design of agri-environmental policies (van der Horst, 2006; Gimona and van der Horst, 2007) and urban development policies (Swyngedouw et al., 2002) and is also promising for designing efficient anti-corruption policies. The spatial targeting of anti-corruption measures is of special importance for subnational regions in which direct interventions or treatments are difficult, such as subnational regions with a low level of rule of law or regulatory efficiency. Concentrating measures in countries’ hubs could yield substantial spillover effects in corruption levels of a number of subnational regions, including those where direct measures are not applicable. Hubs are subnational regions characterized by a high degree of connectivity such as capitals, subnational regions with highly integrated markets or with a specific geopolitical position.====The paper is structured as follows: section 2 discusses the economic, sociocultural and political channels, which transmit corruption across space and argues why the strength of spatial interdependencies decreases with geographic distance. In section 3 we present our spatial model, address identification issues and discuss the structure of our spatial weight matrix. Section 4 provides information on the underlying dataset including descriptive statistics and a statistical examination of spatial correlation in corruption levels. Section 5 presents the results for the core model, for the extended models that allow for heterogeneous spatial effects and for a set of robustness exercises.

We examine the expenditure proposals sponsored by Italian Senators from 1994 to 2013 and exploit the 2005 electoral reform that transformed a mainly majoritarian system into a mainly proportional one. First, we find that legislators elected in first-past-the-post districts are more likely to sponsor pork-barrel bills and to put effort into legislative activity than those elected with a closed-list proportional system. Second, more importantly, we show that the effects of the electoral rules are muted in areas with high civicness.","Few political phenomena are more widespread across countries and time than the tendency of elected politicians to indulge in pork barrel expenditure, i.e. to use public money for narrowly targeted projects as a means of favouring local constituencies. However, while pork barrel is a feature of all democracies, several studies suggest that its importance varies systematically as a function of the social and political characteristics of each country.====The fraction of narrowly targeted as opposed to broad expenditure programmes depends on the electoral rule. A positive relationship between majoritarian representation and targeted expenditures is found by Persson and Tabellini (2005) and by Milesi-Ferretti et al. (2002) in a panel of countries, and by Gagliarducci et al. (2011), using Italian legislators' individual data. Electoral rules also influence elected representatives' incentives to engage in self-serving or dishonest behaviour: there is evidence that proportional representation increases corruption (Persson et al., 2003; Persson and Tabellini, 2005; Kunicova and Rose-Ackerman, 2005),==== as well as other less serious forms of misbehaviour, such as absenteeism (Gagliarducci et al., 2011). Of course, the main concern when trying to identify the causal impact of electoral rules is to account for the potential non-random selection of the rules themselves. Persson and Tabellini (2005) address endogeneity via an instrumental variable approach.==== Gagliarducci et al. (2011) exploit a peculiarity of the Italian electoral system: during the period 1994–2005 some members were elected in single-member districts under the plurality rule and the remaining were elected with a closed-list proportional system. They address self-selection in one of the two tiers through regression discontinuity techniques.====In this paper, we use microdata on the Italian legislators as in Gagliarducci et al. (2011), but we follow a different empirical approach, exploiting a novel theoretical insight to inform our identification strategy. According to Persson and Tabellini (1999), electoral competition in majoritarian systems tends to concentrate in districts with a relatively high fraction of swing voters, whose vote can be easily swayed even by a small change in policy platforms. One of the most efficient ways to convince a swing voter to switch side is to increase the amount of transfers specifically targeted to her district (general interest expenditures would also benefit voters in non swing districts, and would therefore be partially wasted from an electoral point of view). Furthermore, as competition tends to be stiffer in swing districts, the authors also show that the marginal cost for candidates of a more self-serving electoral platform is higher. Therefore, in majoritarian systems candidates have a stronger incentive to commit to a high level of both legislative effort and pork barrel bills once elected.====While in Persson and Tabellini (1999) voters are self-interested when choosing among competing platforms, in our model they not only care about their own self-interest, but also about others' welfare. This in turn affects their voting behaviour. We show that this implies that an ==== in the degree of voters' civicness==== ==== the impact of a change in the electoral rule on pork barrel and on politicians' effort. The intuition is relatively straightforward: the fact that in majoritarian elections competition is concentrated in the swing districts is less consequential with civic voters who partly internalize the preferences of citizens living in other districts; the difference in candidates' incentives under the two electoral systems is therefore reduced. This is the major prediction we test in the empirical part of this paper.====For this purpose, we exploit (i) the well-documented (at least since the seminal work by Putnam et al., 1994)==== heterogeneity in civicness across Italian regions and (ii) the electoral reform of 2005, which changed the system for electing the Italian Parliament from one based on single-member first-past-the-post districts to a proportional one based on larger multiple-member districts, where the competition is between closed party lists. Our empirical exercise is structured as follows. First, for each electoral district of the Italian Upper House (Senate), we collect measures of citizens' civicness. Second, we gather data on the sponsorship of legislative bills by members of the Senate before and after the reform, distinguishing between general interest and pork barrel bills. Finally, we check whether (i) the propensity to sponsor pork barrel bills and (ii) politicians' legislative effort, measured by the overall number of sponsored bills, decrease after the reform and whether the magnitude of this reduction is smaller in districts with a high degree of civicness, which is our theoretical ====; this is the main innovation with respect to the existing literature. Our approach helps to pin down causality, as it singles out a specific channel through which electoral rules affect outcomes.==== Indeed, as we have a prediction concerning the ==== between civicness and electoral rules (that varies across both time and space), we are able to control both for time and for district fixed effects, thus addressing various concerns arising in standard comparative politics analyses (e.g. reverse causation and omitted variables).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After a review of previous contributions in section 2, in section 3 we outline a simple theoretical model in which electoral rules and civicness jointly determine the equilibrium level of pork barrel, general interest spending, and political rents.

This optimal allocation is the solution of a donor optimization problem which maximizes recipient countries' GDP per capita to achieve economic convergence in the European Union. Compared to the observed allocation, our solution can identify the recipient countries that can benefit from higher ECF transfers than the observed levels, as those having low relative GDP per capita, large population size and where the ECF has a strong capacity to support economic growth. Result is robust to changes in the specification of the donor's utility function.","One serious challenge of the European Union (EU) is the integration of the former socialist and Southern Mediterranean economies.==== As it is indicated in Fig. 1, relatively to the EU's average, some countries such as Greece, Portugal and Cyprus have a lower GDP per capita in 2015 than in 2007. As well, some Eastern European countries as Slovenia or Estonia are concerned, their significant trade linkages with the Euro area made them deeply exposed to the last European economic crisis.====In 1994, the EU launched the European Cohesion Fund (ECF) to make the European economic integration be successful. This fund is targeted to member countries having a GDP per capita lower than 90% of the EU's average, measured in purchase power parity (PPP). Being part of the EU requires sound fiscal policies as public debt was limited to 60% of GDP. Concerning the poor EU's economies, the ECF alleviates the trade-off between fiscal discipline and the financing of economic development: this fund pushes public investment projects funding up to 85% of the total cost (additionality principle).====The expenditures of the ECF could be considered as productive public expenditures ==== Barro (1990). As a matter of fact, one half of the fund is allocated towards transport infrastructures to establish the Trans-European Transport Networks (TTN) and the remaining haft are concentrated on environmental infrastructures. The ECF's expenditures are even classified as “investment grants” under the European System of Accounts (ESA 1995 and 2000). The productive nature of the ECF leads to suppose that this European fund stimulates recipient countries' economic growth and helps to fasten economic convergence in the EU. The ECF is about €63 billion (in 2014 prices) for the programming period 2014–2020. Fig. 2 displays that Poland gets the lion's share with more than 36% of the total available amount. The two poorest countries of the EU, Romania and Bulgaria, get 16% of the total amount. Small and wealthy countries such as the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Slovenia and the Slovak Republic hold significant shares though: they account for about 15% of the total amount.====Regarding the ongoing strong budget constraints affecting the European budget, we wonder whether the ECF could be allocated in a better way to foster economic convergence in the EU. The EU cohesion policy results in transfers between a global donor i.e. the European Commission, and some recipient countries.==== Moreover, some criticism was addressed to the way European Structural Funds (SF) are allocated between recipient countries, which affects the global effectiveness of the European cohesion policy (Cappelen et al. (2003); Rodríguez-Pose and Fratesi (2004); Ederveen et al. (2006); Becker (2012); Mendez et al. (2013); Tomova et al. (2013); Rodríguez-Pose and Garcilazo (2015); Huliaras and Petropoulos (2016); Crescenzi and Giua (2016)). However, there was no suggestion about an allocation of SF able to maximize the impact of the European cohesion policy on economic growth in order to promote economic convergence. Through a normative approach, our study fills this gap by providing an optimal allocation of the ECF and compare the latter with the observed one.====In this paper, we posit a theoretical problem where an altruistic donor chooses an allocation of ECF to maximize the global welfare of recipient countries. Our analysis is implemented in two steps: First, we estimate the ability of the ECF to stimulate GDP per capita thanks to a growth equation using data covering the 17 ECF recipient countries for the period 1995–2015. Based on GMM estimation, we find that the ECF mostly has a conditional effect on growth, depending on recipient countries' national debt and inflation levels. Second, thanks to the estimation results of the growth equation, we run simulations of the ECF's optimal allocation which corresponds to the solution of the donor's optimization problem. Our results indicate that the ECF should be concentrated on poor countries having a large population, and where the ECF has a strong ability to promote economic growth (i.e. low inflation and low public debt). More precisely, the findings suggest to shift the ECF away from small and wealthy countries (such as the Czech Republic, Malta, Cyprus, Slovenia or the Slovak Republic) and concentrate the fund on bigger, poorer and more efficient countries (Poland and Romania). This result is robust to changes in the specification of the donor's utility function.====The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature on the conditional effectiveness of financial transfers between donors and recipient countries focusing on foreign aid and European Structural Funds. Section 3 provides the theoretical framework where the donor's problem and its solution are exposed. Section 4 describes the data of the growth equation, and presents estimation results. Section 5 is related to the simulation of the optimal allocation of the ECF and policy implications regarding the observed allocation of the fund.

In theory, however, regulation may be either growth-enhancing or diminishing. We therefore empirically revisit the relation between regulation and growth, allowing for both positive and negative effects. In an unbalanced panel of 132 countries over eight time periods, we find evidence of a hump-shape relation between regulation and growth. The estimates imply that for more than 95% of the sample the total effect of regulation on growth is positive. The estimates also imply that about 60% of the sample observations are associated with over-regulation, relative to the growth-maximizing level. Similar findings apply to the (majority) subsample of non-OECD nations in the dataset. However, for the (minority) subsample of ==== nations, both the total and marginal effects of regulation on growth are negative.","Economics offers several explanations for regulation, with opposing implications for efficiency. Welfare economics explains regulation as justified in response to market failure due to ill-defined property rights, market power, or asymmetric information. In this view, regulation compensates for market failure and is a policy tool intended to reduce deadweight losses which would otherwise occur. In contrast, an Austrian approach questions the ability of policy-makers and bureaucrats to possess sufficient information to improve market outcomes and suggests intervention in the market is likely to entail greater costs than benefits. In yet another approach, public choice economics explains regulation as the result of rent-seeking and industry capture of regulators. Regulatory capture by industry implies that extant firms benefit from regulation at the expense of consumers, competitors, or new entrants (Stigler, 1971; Peltzman, 1976; McChesney, 1997). Regulation, in this view, is not a solution to the problem of market failure, but is a result of government failure, and not only creates deadweight loss of the traditional Harberger type, but produces additional allocative inefficiency due to the opportunity costs associated with rent seeking. The public choice approach supposes that inefficient transfers and regulations arise when small groups dominate large groups due to the ability of small groups to overcome collective action problems (Olson, 1965) or because their organizational costs are lesser (Levine and Modica, 2017). Similar to the public choice approach, Becker (1983, 1985) admits a role for special-interest politics in the determination of regulation. However, he denies that small groups dominate large groups and supposes instead that Coasian bargaining occurs between all affected interests. In this view, only those regulations that entail net social gains are adopted or maintained.====Motivated by these disparate explanations for regulation and their corresponding implications for market efficiency, we investigate whether regulation has enhanced or diminished economic growth. It is possible that efficiency effects may be purely static rather than dynamic, such that regulation may affect the efficiency of an economy, but not its rate of growth. In particular, if an inefficiency reduces output by a constant proportion each period, the level of income in each period will be lower than it otherwise would have been, but the rate of growth will not be affected. More likely, however, is that, institutional inefficiencies will affect adaptation to change, capital accumulation, innovation, and/or resource reallocation which would impact dynamic performance (Olson, 1982; Hicks, 1983). The central issue then becomes whether the evidence reveals a positive relation between regulation and growth consistent with the perspectives of welfare economics and Becker's claim of efficient interest group bargaining, or whether the evidence reveals an inverse relation consistent with the perspectives of Austrian economics and traditional public choice. Potentially, there could be some truth to each of the perspectives, such that the evidence reveals something more complicated than a simple monotonic relation between regulation and growth.====Empirically, prior cross-country studies tend to show that greater levels of regulation are inversely correlated with growth (Nicoletti and Scarpetta, 2003; Djankov et al., 2006; Loayza et al., 2010; Cebula, 2011; Haidar, 2012).==== The implication is that less regulation is always better for growth. Taken to the extreme, the implication is that the growth-maximizing amount of regulation is none at all. We question this extreme implication of prior studies. In particular, we hypothesize that prior work may have misspecified the relation between regulation and growth by assuming linearity.==== To the extent there is a kernel of truth in each of the views of regulation articulated above, the relation between regulation and growth may well be non-monotonic if none of the potential effects wholly dominates the others.====In contrast to prior studies, we suppose a quadratic relation between regulation and growth, so that the marginal impact of regulation depends on the level of regulation. Specifically, we hypothesize a hump-shape relation, such that regulation is growth enhancing at lower levels and growth diminishing at higher levels, both on the margin and in total. Our model of a hump-shape relation implies that the growth maximizing level of regulation may be non-zero. Implicitly, this hypothesis entails a presumption that a nation with low levels of regulation possesses institutions that constrain rent-seeking and regulatory capture and facilitate regulation of the growth-enhancing variety. It likewise presumes that a high level of regulation is indicative of a rent-seeking society in which regulatory capture dominates or the information problem becomes overwhelming, so that regulation is of the growth-diminishing variety on the margin and possibly in total. Minimal regulations may represent simple solutions to the worst excesses of the market that are easily correctable, but remaining market inefficiencies require more complex regulations whose outcomes may be more difficult to predict and impose such high costs on market participants that any additional benefits are not worth the costs involved.====We find evidence of the hypothesized hump-shape relation between regulation and growth. More specifically, we find that the growth-maximizing level of regulation is non-zero, albeit low. We estimate that most of the countries in our sample are over-regulated, while roughly one-third are under-regulated. When we stratify our sample by non-OECD- versus OECD-member status, we find a hump-shape relation in the non-OECD nations, but an inverse and monotonic relation in OECD nations. The findings thus suggest that regulation reduces the dynamism of markets in OECD nations. In contrast, in non-OECD nations, regulation enhances growth in some instances. In these cases, regulation may constitute market-enhancing government (Olson, 2000; Azfar and Cadwell, 2003) or a kind of state capacity (Bardhan, 2016) that enables less mature markets to develop and thrive.",The growth-maximizing level of regulation: Evidence from a panel of international data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018303355,16 May 2019,2019,Research Article,252.0

This finding is further corroborated using various complementary measures of individuals’ perception of the chances and risks associated with an unequal distribution of economic resources, such as their perception of the chances of upward mobility. I finally show that those individuals perceiving a high level of wage inequality also tend to be more supportive of redistributive policies and ====. Taken together, these findings suggest that high levels of perceived wage inequality do have the potential to undermine the legitimacy of market outcomes.","Many OECD countries have seen significant increases in inequality in the past few decades, including the United States as well as several continental European countries (e.g. Atkinson, 2008). Besides their direct and obvious impact through the re-allocation of economic resources to and from different socio-economic groups, changes in a country's aggregate distribution might also have repercussions in the political-economic sphere if they influence individuals' beliefs about the legitimacy of market outcomes. Indeed, several theoretical papers (e.g. Alesina and Angeletos, 2005; Alesina et al., 2012; Bénabou and Tirole, 2006) argued that changes in the aggregate level of inequality might influence individuals' attitudes towards social inequality, such as their beliefs about the importance of non-meritocratic principles in determining individual wages.====Against this broader background, this paper presents empirical estimates of the effect of individuals' subjective perceptions of wage inequality in their country of residence on their attitudes to social inequality, focusing on individuals’ subjective beliefs that meritocratic, or non-meritocratic, factors are important in determining wages. In contrast to most previous studies on the topic, however, this paper focuses on a broad array of attitudes the perceived level of inequality potentially affects, rather than only on a single attitudinal measure.====The key conceptual challenge in addressing these questions empirically is the need for an individual-level measure of inequality perceptions. Simply relying on a more or less easily available objective, yet also highly aggregated, measure of inequality would ignore the fact that people appear to hold widely different, and often heavily biased perceptions of the overall distribution of economic resources (e.g. Chambers et al., 2014; Cruces et al., 2013; Gimpelson and Treisman, 2018; Kuhn, 2011, 2015; Norton and Ariely, 2011; Osberg and Smeeding, 2006).==== If we acknowledge that individuals have different, and presumably biased, perceptions of wage inequality, the use of an objective measure of inequality in the empirical analysis would simply fail to reflect heterogeneity of this kind, potentially implying inconsistencies in the estimated effect of inequality on attitudes.==== In fact, the available empirical evidence shows that individuals’ perceptions of wage levels and/or inequality are, in part, directly related to socio-economic factors (e.g. Bavetta et al., 2017; Kuhn, 2011; Schneider, 2012), suggesting that part of the observed variation in individual-level (mis-) perceptions of inequality is indeed of a systematic nature (implying a potential bias when this source of variation is ignored when estimating the impact of inequality on attitudes). To take these issues into account, the empirical analysis of this paper will therefore be based on a simple yet intuitive empirical measure of individual-level inequality perceptions, following the procedure proposed by and described in more detail in Kuhn (2011).====In contrast to the approach chosen in this paper, however, most previous papers studying the impact of inequality on individuals' attitudes used some objective, rather than subjective, measure of inequality as their key regressor – assuming, at least implicitly, that people correctly perceive the prevailing level of inequality (see Clark and D'Ambrosio, 2015, for a comprehensive survey).==== While earlier studies focused on highly aggregated measures of inequality (Verme, 2011, provides a survey of studies focusing on the association between country-level inequality measures and individual-level measures of subjective wellbeing), more recent studies have shifted their focus towards more disaggregated measures of inequality, arguing that people do not care as much about the aggregate distribution of market wages as they care about the comparison to smaller and much more specific reference groups, such as their coworkers, their friends, and/or their neighbors (e.g. Knell and Stix, 2017).==== The latter group of studies does allow for variation in inequality perceptions across individuals, but only because of different comparison groups, not because of biased perceptions of wages or wage differentials per se.====The assumption that people have unbiased perceptions of the prevailing level of inequality has, however, been relaxed in two more recent experimental studies. These studies manipulate individuals' information about wage differentials in a field experiment, and they both provide indirect evidence of people potentially having misperceptions of the true level of inequality, since a minor information treatment is able to influence individuals' attitudes. In the first of these studies, Card et al. (2012) randomize the access to information about coworkers' wages in a sample of university employees, providing arguably more compelling evidence on the causal effect of coworkers' wages on one's job satisfaction than most studies mentioned so far. Consistent with the evidence from the majority of observational studies, however, they also find that comparison income has a strong negative effect on individual job satisfaction. In another randomized field experiment, Kuziemko et al. (2015) manipulate individuals' information about income inequality. They find that providing individuals with this information has large effects on whether inequality is viewed as a pressing problem, but only small effects on individuals' support for governmental intervention with regard to the distribution of income.====In sum, the empirical literature on individuals' perception of inequality consistently shows, using different sources of data as well as alternative conceptualizations of inequality perceptions, that there is a lot of excess variation in how individuals perceive the factual level of inequality. The empirical analysis in this paper goes one step further and asks whether such kind of variation implies any political-economic consequences. A few previous studies have argued that a country's extent of redistribution is driven by inequality perceptions rather than by the factual level of inequality (e.g. Engelhardt and Wagener, 2014; Gründler and Köllner, 2017; Niehues, 2014), but there is almost no individual-level empirical evidence on such effects. One notable exception is the study by Gimpelson and Treisman (2018), who show that inequality perceptions are predictive of individuals' attitudes even after controlling for the factual, aggregate-level of inequality. This study expands this literature by providing evidence on the effect of inequality perceptions on a very broad set of attitudes, based on estimates that control for a full set of country × survey-year effects.====The general pattern emerging from the empirical analysis reported in this paper is that a higher inequality perception tends to be associated with a stronger belief that wages are set in a defect way and that inequality is perceived as a dysfunctional phenomenon. More specifically, I find that higher levels of perceived inequality are significantly and substantively associated with a stronger (weaker) belief in labor markets functioning according to non-meritocratic (meritocratic) principles. In this sense, a higher perceived level of wage inequality indeed appears to subvert the legitimacy of market outcomes. I further corroborate this result using a variety of complementary outcomes reflecting an individual's perceptions of the chances and risks associated with an unequal distribution of wages, as well as his or her attitudes towards the role of government and progressive taxation. In line with the results for individuals' beliefs about the reasons for getting ahead, these additional estimates show that higher inequality perceptions lead to a stronger (weaker) awareness or salience of the risks (chances) potentially associated with inequality, as well as a stronger support of government intervention aiming to reduce existing inequalities and of progressive taxation. Importantly, the results are robust to the inclusion of personal income (and other labor-market related controls, such as education), thereby suggesting that factors beyond mere self-interest are also relevant to understand the political economics of inequality and redistribution.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.

The analysis is based on a panel model of 36 political parties in 18 Western European countries between 1970 and 2015. We find that right-wing parties move leftward in response to globalization, while left-wing parties do not alter their position. Additionally, we find that ideological party positions are affected by foreign parties’ positions of the same ideological bloc. These findings indicate that there is a convergence towards the left of the political spectrum due to right-wing party moderation.","The way political parties select their policy positions has been the focus of debate in both economics and political science. A vast literature has indicated that parties in industrialized democracies adjust their positions in response to voters' preferences (e.g. Downs, 1957; McDonald and Budge, 2005; Adams et al., 2004). However, apart from voter preferences, other factors related to the economy and society can influence party competition. One such prominent factor is economic integration, which is typically conceptualized as trade openness, foreign direct investments and capital mobility. Adams et al. (2009) and Haupt (2010) find a significant effect of global economic conditions on parties’ ideological position, however, they show that convergence or divergence of party positions is conditional on the measure of economic globalization employed. Similarly, Ezrow and Hellwig (2014) find that parties are less responsive when the economy is more integrated with the rest of the world.====Nevertheless, economic integration, is only one aspect of a multifaceted phenomenon, i.e. globalization, a concept which goes beyond the traditional indicators of trade or capital openness and includes social and political aspects.==== Following Clark (2000, p.86), the term globalization “describes the process of creating networks of connections among actors at multicontinental distances, mediated through a variety of flows including people, information, and ideas, capital and goods”.==== Of equal importance, of course, is the so-called “social globalization”, which refers to the spread of ideas, information, culture and people from different countries, and “political globalization”, which captures the foreign government influence on domestic government and participation of the country in international agreements, organizations and missions (Dreher, 2006a). In the present study, we examine the impact of all components of globalization, using the overall KOF index of globalization, which combines a wide set of indices for economic, social and political globalization, on parties’ ideological position.==== To our knowledge, this is the first paper that undertakes this task.====The present paper is related to several studies that examine the effect of economic globalization on party positions (Ezrow and Hellwig, 2014; Ward et al., 2015; Sen and Barry, 2018). However, it is different in several dimensions. Firstly, in contrast to these studies, our focus is on every dimension of globalization, as it reflects not only the integration of the economy but also the integration of population, culture, ideas, and politics. Secondly, we examine the influence of globalization on the overall ideological position of parties and not only on their economic positions. Even though economic issues are important when shaping the electoral platforms, most of the times additional social issues enter in the pre-electoral political debate and shape the final electoral outcomes. For that reason, we consider the position of parties in many dimensions and not only their economic platforms (as, for example, in Sen and Barry, 2018). Furthermore, our analysis, in contrast to the existing literature, allows us to determine which parties change their position and converge, by flexibly accounting for different left- and right-wing parties’ behavior.====Even though globalization can have a direct effect on policy positions, it can also have an indirect effect by creating common ideological trends among parties in different countries (Kayser, 2009). As a corollary, we expect parties to be influenced by ideologically similar parties in other countries. Recent studies, in the so-called policy diffusion literature, have provided strong evidence that parties are responsive to changes in the policy positions of foreign parties (Böhmelt et al., 2016; Ezrow et al., 2017) and other studies have shown that parties respond to domestic rival parties of the same party family (Adams and Somer-Topcu, 2009; Williams, 2015). Our analysis seeks to complement these studies by evaluating whether parties respond to policy positions of foreign parties of the same ideological bloc.====The empirical analysis relies on a panel dataset of 36 political parties in 18 Western European countries, over the 1970–2015 period.==== Our model specification considers a range of unobservable characteristics by using party-level fixed effects to account for different constitutional and historical characteristics that led to the creation of each party. Moreover, we add a set of control variables related to economic, demographic and political factors that may influence party position.====To explain the relationship between party's ideological position and globalization we use as dependent variable a multidimensional left-right index of party ideological position, taken from the Manifesto Project database. As a proxy of globalization, we use the overall KOF Globalization Index (Dreher, 2006a; revised in Gygli et al., 2019) but we also examine the robustness of our results by using the separate sub-indices of KOF for economic, social and political globalization.====The main findings can be summarized as follows: globalization creates a convergence of party positions, with right-wing parties moving leftward. This effect exists if we examine the overall index, but also the economic and social globalization sub-indices respectively. This is consistent with the idea that globalization makes the positions of left-wing parties more attractive to voters (Walter, 2010), either because globalization increases the income volatility (e.g. Rodrik, 1998) or because it makes voters more susceptible to foreign cultures and ideas.==== Compared to previous studies (e.g. Dorussen and Nanou, 2013; Ward et al., 2015; Sen and Barry, 2018), which have found evidence of party positions convergence in the face of higher economic integration, our study has as an additional advantage the ability to identify the direction of this convergence, namely to the left. We also complement this literature by showing that party positions convergence is not driven only by globalization that reflects the economic integration but also by the integration of population, culture, ideas, and politics.====Finally, we obtain evidence of foreign party position influence. Specifically, we find a negative relationship between domestic parties and foreign parties of the same family, suggesting that parties move towards the opposite direction of the position of foreign similar parties. We regard this relationship as a strategic response of parties, which move towards the opposite direction as a way to capture more votes and not to move away from the domestic political centre.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Parties submit their strategy in each, their beliefs about their opponent's choices, and are also asked whether they prefer one procedure over the other. The procedures – a yes-no game, an ultimatum game, and a dictator game – are designed such that by all existing economic preference models, whether distributive or procedural, parties should be indifferent between them. In particular, the procedures should yield the same outcomes, the same expected outcomes and carry the same information on parties' intentions. At the same time, the procedures differ in the way they distribute decision and information rights across players, and also in their complexity and efficiency. Experimentally, parties do indeed still reveal preferences over the procedures at hand. To explore why this happens, we elicit individuals' simplicity and efficiency ratings of the procedures, and also the degree by which individuals invoke the equality of basic rights and liberties in their moral judgement – an ethical criterion not yet captured by any preference model. The preferences we find link to this data. We explore formalizations for such preferences.","In some areas of life, procedures may be vitally important when they do not have even a stochastic influence on outcomes. In an election, for instance, great care is taken to grant each individual an equal opportunity to vote, to make the voting simple, and to elect a candidate in a transparent way. Yet, one may plainly refuse to acknowledge a candidate's victory, if it is learned that the election violated some of the criteria mentioned before. Notably, such a concern may be independent of any potential outcome.====This paper studies procedural properties which do not refer to the outcomes of a procedure at all: process fairness which requires that the rules of the game do not privilege any party in terms of available information or decision rights.==== Individuals may disapprove of such privileges even if these do not assist the privileged party in the pursuit of her material ends. To test the idea, we conduct an experiment in which subjects choose between two pie-splitting procedures which all social preference models predict to induce the same material and social payoffs. In one treatment, subjects choose between a binary offer ultimatum game, and a binary offer yes-no game, in another treatment, subjects choose between a binary offer ultimatum game, and a binary offer dictator game. In all procedures, there are two efficient ways to share a pie of 6 Euros, that is, there are two proposals. The party who picks the proposal always earns weakly less than her opponent (one proposal splits the pie equally and is fair, the other proposal favors the opponent and is generous). The opponent can express her consent or dissent differently in each procedure. In the dictator game, consent does not influence the outcome. In the yes-no game, consent implements the proposal without knowing which proposal was made; dissent implies zero payoff for both parties. In the ultimatum game, consent implements the proposal knowing which proposal was made; dissent implies again zero payoff for both parties. Subjects first make decisions in all player roles; they choose a proposal and choose to consent or dissent. Afterwards, they choose which procedure they would implement for their actual role. We also ask subjects for their beliefs in each procedure to verify empirically that subjects always choose the same action, and always believe their opponent to choose the same action for sure such that they expect identical distributions of outcomes in all procedures. Even when subjects’ actual actions and beliefs therefore imply that they should be indifferent, they are still willing to pay for having the allocation determined by one procedure rather than the other. Most often, subjects prefer either a yes-no or a dictator game to a fair coin flip between either of these games, and the ultimatum game. This is our first main finding.====We also study the rationale behind ==== and find that they are ethically motivated. Relying upon Jean Piaget's (1948) and Lawrence Kohlberg's (1969, 1984) work, we elicit in a non-incentivized standardized moral judgement test (Georg Lind 1978, 2000, 2008) how an individual arrives at the conclusion that some portrayed action is either right or wrong. More specifically, we elicit by which degree individuals refer to expectations about punishment or reward, social norms, others' expectations or intentions to judge whether a course of action is right or wrong. This way, we quantify individuals' preferences over the set of ethical criteria around which economics has built preference models to date. Kohlberg's field work lists yet two other ethical criteria whose consequences have not yet been modelled in economics: the ideal that each member of society enjoy the same rights – justified either in terms of the social contract, e.g. (Rawls, 1971; Binmore, 1994), or by the existence of some inalienable human right. The more likely subjects invoke these two last ethical criteria in their moral judgement, the more likely they prefer the yes-no game (which distributes decision rights equally) or the ultimatum game (which proceeds transparently, granting both parties perfect information about the history of the game when they take action) over a fair coin flip between both procedures. This is our second main finding. The second result supports the conclusion that the procedural choices we observe do not reflect mistakes in decision making, or outcome-related differences between the procedures which we cannot measure.==== The fact that we observe procedural choices which have a systematic motivation, suggests a new type of procedural preference which has not been formalized in economics as of yet. We call these preferences ==== since they are not defined in terms of procedural outcomes.====Since Thibaut and Walker's (1975) seminal contribution, an impressive body of research in psychology and – more recently, also in economics – has studied the topic of procedural fairness. From a conceptual point of view, procedural justice is best understood if contrasted with ====. While distributive justice (Adams, 1965) is concerned with unjust allocations and human reactions to these, ==== explores the fairness of the principles and measures taken to reach such allocations and how individuals react to the application of these principles.====Procedural justice is a necessary building block for economic prosperity and a stable society. A third party resolving a property rights dispute, for instance, needs legitimacy for its authority. This legitimacy springs ultimately from a shared perception between the dispute parties and outsiders about the fairness of the procedures employed (Lind, 2001; Tyler, 2004). Perceived procedural justice also promotes compliance by the dispute parties to the verdicts of the authority (Lind, 2001). Since the seminal work of Thibaut and Walker (1975), research in psychology (Lind, 2001; Tyler, 2004) and experimental and behavioural economics (Falk et al., 2003; Bolton et al., 2005; Brandts et al., 2006) have come to establish, and to support these views.====Psychological and economic research into procedural justice employ different methods to strive for overlapping but different goals. Both disciplines have sought to disentangle process fairness from distributive fairness. Cropanzano and Ambrose (2001, pp. 125) state that in psychology, distributive justice is operationalized as “individuals' reactions to economic or quasi-economic allocations”, and procedural justice as “individuals’ reactions to the allocation of socioemotional benefits”.====Economists resort to game theoretic models to clarify the difference between distributive (outcome-related) and procedural fairness. So far, the overarching principle in the procedural fairness literature has been to compare the outcomes of a procedure to the outcomes other procedures would have generated. When the fairness value of an outcome depends on counterfactual paths of the process (or the game), then the process itself matters, not only the outcome. By exploiting this principle, a first strand of research studies whether and how individuals discriminate between fair and unfair explicit randomizations over outcomes (Karni and Safra, 2002; Bolton et al., 2005; Karni et al., 2008; Trautmann, 2009; Krawczyk, 2011; Krawczyk and LeLec, 2010; Kircher et al., 2009).==== The classical dilemma here is how to divide an indivisible object in a fair manner. The procedural fairness literature formulates and shows that people prefer fair coin flips over lotteries which grant parties unequal chances of winning. While these preferences are clearly not only about outcomes but also about the process, changes in the chances of winning also imply changes in expected payoffs. Thus, in comparing two procedures, the preference compares the payoff distributions which both procedures generate, after all. A second strand of research explores how kind (economically generous) an individual deems an opponent's choice of a specific process==== compared to what she believes would have happened had the opponent chosen a different process (Rabin, 1993; Blount, 1995; Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger, 2004; Falk and Fischbacher, 2006; Brandts et al., 2006; Sebald, 2010).==== Aldashev et al. (2010) show that psychological game theory in general can be interpreted from this perspective, although it is not customary to do so. Since kindness is measured in economic terms, also the preferences in this second strand of literature assess distributions of outcomes when judging the fairness of two procedures. Both strands have made important contributions to understanding differences in individual reactions to procedures and to advancing the optimal design of institutions and organizations. Yet, from a bird's-eye perspective and independent of their interpretation, it is evident that in both strands, individuals evaluate the fairness of a given process by their subjective expectations of the social and economic benefits which alternative processes would have generated. Therefore, both strands of research ultimately refer to the distribution of outcomes and thus stress that the rules of the game matter ==== they impact the distribution of outcomes. Similar connections between distributional and process fairness have also been admitted in psychology. Two leading figures in the field – Cropanzano and Ambrose – summarize the decades of psychological research into procedural and organizational justice (2001, pp. 119–120) concluding that:====Already the early literature on democracy and its federal organization points out that procedures which grant all parties equal decision rights and equal information can become undesirably complex and hard to handle (de Tocqueville, 1868, p. 276). Hence, the decision maker may need to trade off potentially conflicting properties when choosing between alternative procedures. To illustrate such trade-offs, take the following example. Individuals may prefer to grant all agents an option to (dis)agree on some proposal rather than denying one or several agents their say. Individuals may also prefer that all agents are properly informed about the proposal before they opt to agree or to disagree.==== Incorporating these aspects into a procedure will increase agents' freedom of choice and their information rights. At the same time, the potential number of instances where an agreement cannot be found increases – as does the need for their expedient regulation. In the real world, choices of institutions tend to involve such trade-offs. Therefore, we let subjects decide between alternative procedures which are predicted to induce identical expectations and outcomes. Subjects may choose to increase the responder's freedom of choice by opting for an ultimatum rather than a yes-no game but not without foregoing the simpler (the yes-no game), or the more efficient procedure (the dictator game). To flesh out these trade-offs, decision rights (freedom of choice), information rights, procedural simplicity, and efficiency must be formally discussed and hence, measured. We explore such measures without referring to outcomes in any way, while a myriad of these measures may exist. Guided by this formal discussion, we elicit additional data on subjects' motives and show that responder choices of the yes-no and choices of the dictator game in general link to subjects' simplicity rankings and efficiency perceptions of both procedures.====Purely procedural preferences are economically and politically relevant. Survey studies suggest that fair procedures catalyze the smooth functioning of organizations and institutions. The more an institution or an organization is deemed to employ fair procedures, the higher are organizational engagement, performance, and cooperation (Tyler, 2000; Sondak and Tyler, 2007; De Cremer et al., 2005). Frey and Stutzer (2005) find that inhabitants of Swiss Cantons with greater democratic participatory rights are more satisfied with their lives. Thereby, life satisfaction does not only increase because participation is seen to improve the outcomes of political decision making – self-reported life satisfaction also increases in the right of proper participation itself. These surveys suggest that better insight into procedural fairness might also benefit institutional design. Economists have indeed called for more economic and behavioural research into the relatively new field of procedural fairness (Rabin 1993, 2002; Konow, 2003; Engelmann and Strobel, 2004). Even experimental economics which has long taken intrinsic fairness concerns seriously, has only recently turned to analyze the effects of procedural aspects. To date, however, experiments on procedural preferences invariably compare procedures which induce outcome distributions with different statistical moment(s) – the preferences studied can thus be about those differences. Exceptions are Fehr et al. (2013) or Bartling et al. (2014) who show in studies on control rights and delegation that principals have intrinsic value for maintaining the power to decide and control and that reducing control or delegating decision rights to an agent has a positive welfare effect beyond what reciprocation can explain (Charness et al., 2012). We, instead, report evidence for ==== concerns about the ==== of rights across players, and a concern for procedural efficiency – parties remove their veto if they expect that it cannot change payoffs and if they can still voice their opinion without veto.====The following section describes the two-player pie-division procedures we use. Section 3 verifies that all relevant existing preference models and theories predict procedurally invariant outcomes within each pair of procedures – in, but also out of equilibrium. Section 4 explores formalizations of ==== ====. Section 5 introduces our experimental design and the psychological test used to describe individuals’ moral judgement. Section 6 presents our main results, Section 7 cross-checks some aspects of cleanliness of our design.

Many real-world situations are eligible for an analysis using tools from that theory, such as elections, choosing from job candidates, making investment decisions, searching the internet, and so on. Since the beginning of modern social choice theory in the 1950s, the focus of traditional social choice theory has mainly been put on theoretical aspects. Normative approaches, as in impossibility theorems (see, e.g., Arrow (1963), Sen (1979) or Gibbard (1973) and Satterthwaite (1975)), the study of theoretical properties of voting rules (see, e.g., Brams and Fishburn (2002), Laruelle and Valenciano (2011), Yilmaz (1999), and Nehring et al. (2016)), the analysis of paradoxical situations (see, e.g., Brams et al. (1998), Nurmi (1999), Nurmi and Meskanen (2000), Saari (2000a,b) and Gehrlein (2006)), and comparisons of outcomes, i.e., either winners or whole rankings, of different social choice rules (see, e.g., Saari (1994), Ratliff (2001) or Klamler (2005)) have been some of the main topics discussed in the literature. This led to an overwhelming number of negative results, which rather was in contrast to the experience coming from actual elections and decision processes.====First doubts about the real-word consequences of Arrow's General Impossibility Theorem came from Tullock (1967). In particular he provided various arguments against the occurrence of voting cycles in parliamentary decisions. This, essentially, led to the question “Why so much stability?” posed by Tullock (1981). In the latter work, Tullock extended the critique to situations in which logrolling is possible and offered various explanations for the apparent stability of voting outcomes. Until Stratmann (1996), however, it was rather unclear how to empirically determine whether stability will actually occur or not. Whereas those early approaches were primarily focusing on sequential majority decisions between pairs of alternatives, in the early 2000s first attempts started to analyze the consequences of those theoretical results for the practical use of social choice rules based on more elaborated empirical data such as rankings. In particular, Regenwetter et al. (2006) opened the new research-field of behavioral social choice, where, essentially, data from actual elections were tested against the negative predictions stemming from the theoretical literature.====The starting focus was again put on the famous Condorcet paradox, i.e., the existence of majority cycles in preference profiles. As shown by Regenwetter et al. (2006), in most of the elections for which preference data is available, the Condorcet paradox almost never occurs although theoretical results predict otherwise (Gehrlein (2006)). Later papers, e.g., by Regenwetter and Tsetlin (2004), Regenwetter et al. (2007) or Popov et al. (2014), looked at the actual consensus among social choice rules in real-world elections indicating a surprising overlap of outcomes among classical social choice rules such as Plurality Rule, Plurality Runoff or the Borda Rule.==== This is in contrast to the theoretical investigations of differences among social choice rules in the sense that for various preference profiles winners and losers of social choice rules could drastically contradict each other (Saari (2000a,b)).====Although certain steps forward have been made in the behavioral approach to social choice theory, a massive expansion of that literature has been prevented by the unavailability of real-world election data. The collection of such data with sufficiently rich preference information, i.e., complete rankings and cardinal evaluations, is both difficult and costly. Some exceptions can be found in the papers by Baujard et al. (2014), Roescu (2014), Alòs-Ferrer and Granì (2012) and Darmann et al. (2017) who provide interesting insights into the performance of selected social choice rules for various real-world elections. Some of these papers have expanded their attention to evaluative voting (also know as utilitarian voting, grade voting or range voting), where, on a pre-defined numerical scale, each voter freely assigns points to the candidates. The candidates are finally evaluated by the sum of the points received, making the candidate with the highest sum the winner of the election. Evaluative voting is frequently applied in practice. On the one hand, it is used in multi-criteria decision making, such as in sports, when some average score determines a ranking over teams or single athletes. On the other hand, it is applied in political processes, making use of one of its key features such as expressing intensities in preferences (see Baujard et al. (2014) and Baujard et al. (2018) for more details). Examples can be observed in Latvia where voters can choose between the options of crossing out, leaving unchanged, or adding a “plus” to candidates of their chosen party list (Laslier et al. (2015)), or in Luxembourg and Germany in the form of cumulative voting, where voters can assign more than one point to the same candidate (Baujard et al. (2018)). However, and perhaps surprisingly, only recently has it received more attention as a particular voting rule in the literature, both theoretically (Hillinger (2005); Núñez and Laslier (2014); Gaertner and Xu (2012)) and empirically (Baujard et al. (2014); Roescu (2014); Baujard et al. (2018)).====To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide an empirical comparison of classical voting rules and evaluative voting using statistical confidence levels. In particular, complementary to the above-mentioned papers by Baujard et al. (2014), Roescu (2014), Alòs-Ferrer and Granì (2012) and Darmann et al. (2017), we rely on an approach used, e.g., by Regenwetter et al. (2007), namely the generation of statistical confidence levels through a nonparametric bootstrap (see Efron and Tibshirani (1993)). The underlying idea is to investigate certain outcomes in case there are small changes in the ballot frequencies. Hence, based on our survey data, numerous fictitious ballots are created which are analyzed with respect to various different voting rules. Regenwetter et al. (2007) and Popov et al. (2014) applied bootstrap methods essentially to a dataset from the American Psychological Association (APA) presidential elections and focused on issues like the comparison of voting outcomes under different voting rules and majority cycles. In this paper their analysis is extended to a different set of data – collected in an online-survey in connection with the 2015 parliament elections in the Austrian federal state of Styria – with a larger set of voting rules including the recently more noticed method of evaluative voting.====In this respect, the presented empirical results show that certain paradoxical situations from the theoretical literature do hardly occur in real-world data. More precisely, it turns out that a large agreement in the outcomes of the voting rules can be found even for those rules using richer preference information (such as evaluative voting), and majority cycles are virtually inexistent. This confirms the early stability observations by Tullock (1981) and extends and supports the findings from the behavioral social choice literature.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the set of voting rules used in the paper. Section 3 provides a detailed theoretical example leading to a plethora of surprising and paradoxical results. This is followed, in Section 4, by an overview over the experimental design of the online-survey and the used method.

The results for ==== measures of globalization are mixed.,"There is a large literature studying the consequences of globalization for the welfare state. In an influential work, Rodrik (1997) highlights how increased capital mobility threatens the implicit contract between the government and the working class whereby the former offers social insurance in exchange for greater globalization. Schulze and Ursprung (1999) provide a comprehensive survey of the early literature. They argue that the globalization debate with respect to fiscal policy can be reduced to two effects —an efficiency effect and a compensation effect. The efficiency effect refers to the fact that increased mobility of goods and factors of production will induce countries to lower taxes thereby lowering their ability to provide public goods. The compensation effect refers to the fact globalization may increase demand for social insurance programs by increasing inequality as well as volatility.==== This paper provides a theoretical model to formalize these offsetting effects in a unified framework and empirically studies the relationship between globalization and taxation.====In the theoretical model, labor income is distributed equally but capital income is distributed unequally. The median voter decides on the level of redistributive taxation. Labor supply is endogenous, and therefore, taxation distorts labor supply which acts as a check on the extent of redistribution. With capital mobility, the possibility of capital flight (or reduced capital inflows) acts as a further check on taxation. While the tax competition literature assumes perfect capital mobility so that the post-tax returns to capital are equalized across countries, a key feature of our model is imperfect mobility of capital which allows us to do comparative statics with respect to the degree of capital mobility. In the absence of capital mobility, the impact of trade liberalization depends on whether the country is capital abundant or labor abundant. In a capital abundant country, trade liberalization increases the reward of capital and reduces the reward of labor thereby increasing inequality. Consequently, the level of redistributive taxation preferred by the median voter increases. The opposite happens in a labor abundant country. Things change with capital mobility. Given our assumption of source based taxation of returns to capital, in a capital exporting country increased capital mobility makes redistributive taxation more costly because it increases capital flight. In a capital importing country, taxation of capital reduces capital inflows, which reduces the tax base. Both these effects tend to reduce taxation.====While the literature generally talks about the compensation and efficiency effects informally, our theoretical model formalizes these effects.==== More importantly, our model shows that different facets of globalization may have different implications for taxation. In particular, it suggests that trade liberalization and capital market openness could have different effects on taxation depending on a country's comparative advantage and whether the country experiences inflows or outflows of capital. Also, the median voter model that we use highlights the role of inequality in determining the impact of globalization on taxation.====Empirically, we study the relationship between globalization and taxation using a large cross-country panel data set. Unlike previous studies on globalization and taxation which have focused mainly on the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, our data set includes 155 countries, including many developing countries which have undertaken capital account liberalization in the last couple of decades. Our data on taxation comes from the Economic Freedom Dataset of the Fraser Institute (see Gwartney et al. (2017)) which provides taxation data on a large number of countries from 1970 onwards. Since this data is available at 5-year intervals till year 2000, we create a panel at 5-year frequency, starting in 1975 and ending in 2015. We use 7 different measures of globalization which include both ==== and ==== measures of trade liberalization as well as capital account liberalization.====Among the key results, we find some support for our theoretical prediction that trade liberalization increases taxation in capital abundant countries and reduces it in labor abundant countries. The results with the most commonly used ==== measure of trade liberalization, nominal trade-GDP ratio, are not significant, however, using real openness as a ==== measure of trade liberalization, which corrects for the lower price of non-tradables in developing countries as suggested by Alcalá and Ciccone (2004), yields significant results. Restricting the estimation to the pre-financial crisis years– excluding years 2010 and 2015 from the panel– we find the results to be significant for 3 out of 4 measures of trade liberalization. Most notably, the KOF index of ==== trade liberalization becomes strongly significant now.==== The results using measures of capital account liberalization are significant for the whole period as well as the sub-sample excluding the post-financial crisis years. Testing if the impact of globalization on taxation depends on inequality, we do not find significant results. Finally, if the impact of capital market liberalization differs across capital importing and capital exporting countries. We find that our ==== measures of capital account liberalization are negatively and significantly related with taxation in both capital importing and capital exporting countries. There is some evidence that the tax reducing effect of capital account liberalization is stronger in capital importing countries than capital exporting countries.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we provide a brief summary of the related literature. Section 3 provides the theoretical model and section 4 provides empirical results.

To date, the literature has identified a wide range of potential impacts of fiscal decentralization on a country, including economic growth, regional disparity, macroeconomic stability, corruption, and government size (see Martinez-Vazquez et al., 2017 for a survey). Among them, one of the most relevant and discussed consequences is the impact of fiscal decentralization on government size, for which limited consensus has been reached, both theoretically and empirically (Golem, 2010).====This paper re-examines empirically the effect of fiscal decentralization on government size by considering the role of a country's political regime (proxied by democracy). We contribute to the literature by offering a novel explanation on the mixed results regarding the relationship between fiscal decentralization and government size in the literature. Theoretically, fiscal decentralization, as explained in the subsequent section, has important implications on government size, although competing explanations exist. Specifically, by assuming the government as a benevolent agent that serves the needs of its constituents, the “first-generation” of fiscal federalism argues that, in the presence of heterogeneous preferences and needs across different jurisdictions, fiscal decentralization may increase efficiency and quality of government services because it allows for a closer match between the preferences of residents and the packages of public goods and services provided by local governments (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1972; Weingast, 2009). Therefore, greater decentralization can be considered to enhance local accountability and residents' trust in government, which motivates them to demand more public goods and services, hence leading to a greater government size (Golem, 2010). By assuming the government as a monolithic Leviathan with selfish public officials to maximize revenues, the “second-generation” of fiscal federalism argues that, for attracting mobile tax bases, tax competition among governments under the decentralized system destroys the Leviathan's monopoly on taxation and brings government spending closer to the preferences of residents. This potentially leads to less bureaucratic waste of resources and a smaller size for government spending (Weingast, 2009; Golem, 2010).====Therefore, these different predictions for the relationship between fiscal decentralization and government size are based, at least partially, on the particular political regimes that give rise to different government types. We argue that, compared to non-democratic regimes, democratic regimes are more likely to support a benevolent government, meaning fiscal decentralization in democratic countries is more likely to improve local accountability, resulting in a relatively larger government size. We test this hypothesis using a panel dataset of 76 developed and developing countries for the period 1972–2013. We find strong evidence that (1) overall, fiscal decentralization is negatively associated with government size, supporting decentralization as a device to promote local competition thus restricting government size increases, and (2) fiscal decentralization in countries with a higher level of democracy tends to have a smaller negative impact on government size than countries with lower democracy levels. We thus contribute to the literature by providing an explanation that integrates the apparently conflicting views on the relationship between fiscal decentralization and government size. These results are robust across alternative measures of key variables and alternative specifications, subsamples, data frames, and estimation approaches.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and discusses the potential role of democracy in the nexus between fiscal decentralization and government size. Section 3 proposes the empirical methodology and discusses the data. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Section 5 provides additional robustness checks.

This paper identifies regional ,"Populist parties in many European countries, such as UKIP in the UK, FN in France, PVV in the Netherlands or AfD in Germany have made electoral breakthroughs. Such parties espouse a nationalistic agenda and oppose globalization. This populism is often manifested as Euroscepticism, with populist parties and their supporters seeing the EU as an institutional symbol of globalization. These eurosceptic ideologies can be harmful as support for the EU is key for its legitimacy and effectiveness (Hobolt and de Vries, 2016), which in turn fosters political stability and economic prosperity (Schmidt, 2013). It is therefore important to better understand determinants of support for the EU. In the public debate, rising unemployment and the lack of economic perspectives are among the most frequently mentioned reasons for the success of these views.==== Even the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has emphasized the importance of policies which aim at mitigating economic inequality and job insecurity in the EU to prevent the rise of populism.====I contribute to this debate by showing that regional labor market conditions affect support for the EU. I document that regions experiencing negative employment changes tend to vote for more eurosceptic parties in European Parliament elections and also show a higher attitudinal euroscepticism. Support for the EU and euroscepticism are defined as two sides of the same coin encompassing attitudes toward the European Union as a regime and its principles. I focus my analysis on attitudinal euroscepticism because it is more comparable across countries (as opposed to political parties) and captures the distinct nature of anti-EU attitudes, which is not the case with political parties that campaign on several platforms. In order to quantify attitudinal euroscepticism I analyze Eurobarometer survey data and combine them with regional employment data. The Eurobarometer questions ask about the respondents' image of the EU, the respondents' assessment of the benefits from the EU and the respondents' evaluation of their country's EU membership.====There are huge differences in these attitudes across regions but it is difficult to distinguish economic factors from other factors such as culture, regional institutions or local politics, which are correlated with both labor market conditions and attitudes. I therefore apply panel fixed effect estimation methods, which exploit variation within regions over time, thereby conditioning on region-specific and time-specific unobserved heterogeneity. I also include lagged dependent variables in order to account for feedback effects from past attitudes on employment. Finally, I control for a number of factors that may be correlated with labor market conditions and support for the EU such as national institutions, education, demography and migration.====Regional employment changes may nevertheless be still endogenous to attitudes due to third factors that are neither region-specific nor time-constant and are not captured by the control variables. To account for that I construct a Bartik-style shift-share instrument (Bartik, 1991) that predicts regional employment changes on the basis of Europe-wide sectoral employment growth and regional industrial specialization.==== This instrument provides plausibly exogenous variation in regional employment and allows me to identify a causal effect.====In all specifications I find significantly positive effects of employment changes on support for the EU. These effects are driven by variation in negative employment changes rather than positive ones. In an attempt to identify a potential mechanism, I further analyze interaction effects with education, occupation and migration. The theoretical literature has suggested that nationalist ideology appeals in particular to ‘modernization losers’ (Golder, 2016; Garry and Tilley, 2009), who are expected to react more to negative changes than positive ones. Hence, those who are threatened to lose most from further European integration, such as unskilled people in regions with a lot of low-skilled EU migration, are most likely to be eurosceptic. Consistent with this, I find that both unemployed and low-skilled workers react particularly strongly to employment changes. Moreover, the triple interaction between employment changes, an unskilled worker dummy and EU migration is statistically significant. This finding indicates that the unskilled are particularly sensitive to employment changes in regions with high shares of EU migration. Labour market prospects of these groups are similarly threatened by both globalization (i.e. migration and trade) and skill-biased technological change. The findings of this paper suggest that EU migration reinforces the effect of an increase in unemployment on euroscepticism for the low-skilled. Employment changes induced by skill-biased technological change may nevertheless also play a role in explaining populism in general and euroscepticism in particular.====This paper contributes to the literature on several dimensions. First, I exploit variation across 260 European regions over a long time horizon (1996–2014) and am therefore able to control for region and time specific factors that may cause bias. Second, I analyze three different attitudinal dimensions of euroscepticism, which account for its ‘multifaceted nature’ (Boomgaarden et al., 2011). Other studies have often only focused on one aspect, for example trust in institutions. Moreover, I present results for voting behavior in European Parliament elections using administrative voting data rather than self-reported ones as in other studies (Guiso et al., 2017; Hernández and Kriesi, 2016). Third, I construct a Bartik-style instrument for European regions, which arguably extracts the exogenous component in employment changes. This instrument has not been used to study euroscepticism before. Fourth, I investigate potential mechanisms such as occupation and education as well as their interaction with regional EU migration.====There is a large literature emphasizing the link between economic insecurity and anti-globalization sentiment (see Anderson (2007) for an overview). A recent strand of literature examines effects of globalization, most notably trade shocks on political polarization and extreme voting. Autor et al. (2016) find that US districts exposed to high import competition tend to remove moderate representatives from office. They conclude that “employment consequences of trade [are] acutely recognizable and therefore politically actionable” (p.45). Similarly, Che et al. (2016) show that US counties exposed to import competition from China experience increases in turnout and are more likely to be represented by a Democrat. Colantone and Stanig (2018) examine the effects of import competition on western Europe and also find that import shocks lead to an increase in support for nationalist parties and a general shift to the right in the electorate. Dippel et al. (2015) present causal evidence for the effect of trade integration on extreme right voting for Germany. All of these studies apply an instrumental variable strategy exploiting variation in import penetration from China depending on the local industry structure, which is advanced in Autor et al. (2013). Guiso et al. (2017), Algan et al. (2017) and Dustmann et al. (2017) provide evidence that economic factors are important determinants of support for right-wing populist parties in Europe.====Right-wing voting is often associated with nationalist ideologies. Therefore another strand of literature focuses on the effects of economic conditions on attitudes measured in surveys. Hobolt and de Vries (2016) provide an extensive overview over the literature about origins of public support for European integration and its consequences. Roth et al. (2013), Frieden (2016), Dustmann et al. (2017) and Algan et al. (2017) document a decline in trust in European and national institutions as a consequence of the financial crisis. Roth et al. (2013) show that the economic crisis of 2008–2012 had a particularly pronounced negative effect on trust in the European Commission and European Parliament in the four periphery countries (Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland). Dustmann et al. (2017) and Algan et al. (2017) confirm that the economic crisis reduced trust in national and European institutions and was associated with the rise of anti-establishment parties. In terms of labor market conditions Dustmann et al. (2017) find for the EU15 that the unemployment rate has a negative-albeit not significant-effect on support for European integration and a negatively significant effect on trust in the European Parliament and on the vote share of pro-EU parties. Algan et al. (2017) present evidence that underpins these results. Increases in unemployment are associated with voting for non-mainstream parties and a decline in trust in national and European institutions.====I complement the studies by Algan et al. (2017) and Dustmann et al. (2017) in three important ways. Firstly, I analyze the effect of labor market conditions on euroscepticism specifically rather than on trust in general. Algan et al. (2017) and Dustmann et al. (2017) focus on trust in European and national institutions as well as interpersonal trust as most important attitudinal outcome variables. Focusing on attitudes toward the EU allows me to disentangle the effect on mistrust in institutions in general from euroscepticism, which is clearly aimed at the EU as an institution symbolizing globalization. I am therefore able to examine globalization, in particular EU migration, as a potential mechanism. Algan et al. (2017) and Dustmann et al. (2017) do not analyze channels. Secondly, I use a range of empirical methods to substantiate my findings. While Dustmann et al. (2017) rely on panel fixed effects methods with only a limited set of control variables, Algan et al. (2017) additionally use the share of pre-crisis construction as instrument for employment changes during the economic crisis. The Bartik-style instrument applied in this paper however goes beyond their instrument as it uses both variation across sectors and over time rather than only variation across regions. Finally, my analysis is based on a considerably larger sample. Both Dustmann et al. (2017) and Algan et al. (2017) use ESS data from 7 survey waves between 2002 and 2014 for 132 and 186 regions respectively. I use Eurobarometer data between 1996 and 2014 (38 waves) for 265 regions. This allows me to abstract from crisis driven changes in employment, which is the focus in Algan et al. (2017) and Dustmann et al. (2017).====All these studies focus on trust in institutions as main attitudinal outcomes. There are a few studies which analyze the effect of economic conditions on attitudinal euroscepticism.==== Both Serricchio et al. (2013) and Gomez (2015) establish a link between the financial crisis and euroscepticism measured with the Eurobarometer membership question. While Gomez (2015) finds a strong effect of economic variables such as GDP growth, unemployment rate and interest rates on support for the EU in the context of the financial crisis, Serricchio et al. (2013) conclude that economic indicators have very limited power in explaining euroscepticism. They instead attribute the effect of the financial crisis to national identity and political institutions. Both approaches however have analytical shortcomings. Their time frame is rather short (2007–2011 in Gomez (2015) and only 2007 and 2010 in Serricchio et al. (2013)) and the unit of analysis is the country-level. Lubbers and Scheepers (2010) examine the evolution of euroscepticism for the pre-crisis period (1994–2004) and find that changes in economic growth, inflation and unemployment are hardly related to euroscepticism. Their analysis is also conducted on a country level. A regional-level analysis over a long time span examining the effect of labor market conditions on different aspects of ‘attitudinal euroscepticism’ is still missing from the literature.====The paper is structured as follows: I first describe the political attitude, voting, and regional employment data (Section 2). I then discuss both the fixed effect and the instrumental variable estimation strategies (Section 3). The main analysis is conducted in Section 4 measuring euroscepticism with survey data. I present results from the panel analysis including effect heterogeneity and also from instrumental variable estimations. Finally, I present results about the relationship between labor market conditions and voting behavior in European Parliament elections in Section 5.",Employment shocks and anti-EU sentiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018301460,5 April 2019,2019,Research Article,259.0

This, as a function of the electorate's ","Elections have policy consequences that depend not only on the identity of the winning party but also on the popular support shown by the election results. The notion of mandate, which refers to the power granted by a constituency to act on its behalf, is usually employed to explain how a large vote share helps the elected representatives to implement firmly the proposed policies (Conley, 2001; Fowler and Smirnov 2007).====Accordingly, a few papers have recently modeled elections assuming that candidates and voters care about the margin of victory, as a measure of the electoral mandate (Castanheira, 2003; Faravelli et al., 2015; McMurray, 2017). However, when participation is voluntary, there is a second element that contributes to shaping the mandate and provides information about the electorate's approval for the competing candidates: the turnout rate. Indeed, in line with a view of elections as a mechanism for the generation of popular support for the government and its policies (Ginsberg and Weissberg, 1978), scholars have often referred to the legitimizing function of electoral participation (Nadeau and Blais, 1993). In light of this argument, the purpose of this paper is to study electoral participation in a unified framework, in which the government's mandate is affected both by the margin of victory and by the turnout rate, as two complementary indicators of popular support.====The relative importance of these two sources of mandate reasonably depends on the characteristics of the political regime in which the elections take place. As an extreme case, elections held in authoritarian regimes are generally considered a tool in the hands of the regime to foster its legitimacy via the popular participation. In such a context, the political science literature agrees that turnout is indeed a major dimension of political competition (Gonzalez-Ocantos et al., 2015). As a consequence, a typical form of protest by the opposition parties in non-democratic regimes is to call for an election boycott, with the aim of delegitimizing the outcome of a process that is deemed unfair (Buttorff and Dion, 2017).====In established democracies, instead, the legitimacy effect given by a high turnout rate is arguably smaller and the extent to which it interacts with the institutional environment in determining parties' political strength has lacked a precise empirical investigation. The results of the 2017 UK general election, for example, have been unanimously interpreted in terms of a reduced mandate for May's future government, as a consequence of the decreased number of seats obtained by the conservative party. This interpretation prevailed despite a historically high turnout rate, which resulted in an increased popular vote - and even vote share - in favor of the conservative party relatively to the previous general election.====However, even in contexts in which parties' power is mostly determined by the electoral and institutional rules, voters might still partially perceive their act of voting as a way to give legitimacy or to show consent to the future government (Miles, 2015), and thus decide their participation accordingly. Moreover, a concern for the legitimacy of representative democracy is becoming increasingly salient in western countries, given a steady pattern of declining turnout rates, which could also raise parties' efforts to ensure a high participation when they aim to form a legitimate government after the election.====This paper postulates that voters and parties care about the electoral mandate emerging from the election results and presents a theoretical model that relates different patterns of electoral participation to the extent to which the turnout rate contributes to the mandate. The model follows the group-voting literature in studying electoral participation as the outcome of a competition between voters' groups (Morton, 1987, 1991; Shachar and Nalebuff, 1999; Coate and Conlin, 2004). As such, it features two groups, namely a majority and a minority, which compete in an election and trade off the electoral benefit of participation with the cost of mobilizing the members to vote. Both groups care not only about who wins but also about a measure of “legitimate mandate” assigned to the government formed by the winning group, as a convex combination between the total turnout rate and the margin of victory.====Concerning preferences, the model assumes that both groups would like to enjoy a large legitimate mandate if they form the government, but would prefer a small legitimate mandate for an opposing government. This assumption generates a specific trade-off faced by the eventual losing group: a higher participation by its members, on the one hand, reduces the margin of victory of the winning group, but, on the other hand, increases the total turnout rate; the total effect on the government's legitimate mandate is thus ambiguous. In equilibrium, both groups decide their turnout rates optimally with respect to this trade-off, taking into account the relative importance of the two components of the mandate and the mobilization cost.====The equilibrium - which exists under some conditions and is unique - features the majority group winning the election and thus forming the government. As such, the group facing the previous trade-off is (always) the minority. This follows from an assumption of no uncertainty, which makes the majority group always able and willing to ensure its victory. Importantly, this assumption also implies that local deviations in the participation decisions do not affect the groups' probability of winning but only the strength of the mandate enjoyed by the majority government.====Unable to win with positive probability, the minority solves its trade-off in favor of a complete withdrawal from voting, when the relative importance of the turnout for the government's mandate is high enough. Such behavior is consistent with the previous observation of frequent election boycotts in authoritarian regimes, as an opposition strategy to prevent leaders from claiming their legitimacy out of the popular participation.====For mid-range values of the parameters, the equilibrium is interior, with both groups participating at a rate between 0 and 1. Its comparative statics analysis reveals several insights. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is to highlight a non-trivial relationship between turnout and mandate in equilibrium: in a large region of the parameter space, a second fundamental trade-off arises between the two variables, which move in opposite directions following variations in the relative weights of the mandate's components. For example, if the turnout becomes relatively more important than the margin of victory, the total turnout itself decreases but the government's mandate increases.====The mechanism at play is a shift in the relative participation of the two groups, which favors the majority and thus generates a bandwagon effect. As a consequence, the margin of victory increases to the point that it offsets the effect of a lower turnout and yields a positive net effect on the government's mandate. Hence, the supposed positive relationship between turnout and mandate can be overturned in equilibrium, given that both variables are determined endogenously. In this model, a more salient warning of the undermining effect of low turnout on the government's legitimacy produces stronger mandates, coming from higher margins of victory.====A conflicting relationship between turnout and mandate is a general property of the model, which holds not only when the equilibrium is interior but across the whole parameter space: in particular, the highest degree of legitimate mandate is attained for a set of parameters' values for which the majority participates at a full rate, while the minority turns out only partially.====The key determinant of the bandwagon effect is the assumption of turnout contributing to the mandate, which interacts with the different attitudes towards the mandate between the winning and losing group. This assumption crucially alters the relative participation rates of the groups. Indeed, when the mandate is mainly given by the margin of victory, the minority participates at a higher rate than the majority, offsetting the size disadvantage in line with an underdog effect often predicted by the theoretical literature on costly voting (Levine and Palfrey, 2007; Herrera et al., 2016). If turnout matters as well, however, the relative participation of the majority increases, reducing the underdog effect until it shifts to a bandwagon effect, when the weight of the turnout is big enough. Bandwagon voting has been observed empirically and experimentally by the previous literature (e.g. Klor and Winter, 2007; Morton et al., 2015); this paper identifies a new theoretical mechanism for this effect in the lower participation, driven by legitimacy concerns, of those citizens who do not support the likely government-forming party.====The aforementioned property of the total turnout decreasing when it matters relatively more for the government's mandate might be surprising. When a majority of the electorate prefers a large mandate and this is determined to a large extent by the turnout rate, one could expect participation to rise. Instead, an increase in the weight of turnout reduces participation in both groups (though disproportionately for the minority). The intuition for this result comes from the majority perceiving the participation rates of the competing groups as strategic complements: as such, when the minority lowers its turnout in order to minimize the mandate, the majority also participates less to save on mobilization costs.====In western democracies, a steady decline in turnout is sometimes attributed to a large process of dealignement or alienation. The previous result points out that if voting or mobilizing voters is costly, the total turnout can theoretically decrease mainly due to a complementarity effect: even when only a (small) minority abstains with a delegitimizing intention, the majority may follow the same trend despite a favorable attitude towards the government's mandate.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the related literature. Section 3 presents the model and discusses the existence and properties of the equilibrium. Section 4 focuses on the comparative statics analysis of the key variables in the model.

While anecdotal evidence suggests that the IMF has been playing a vital role for CBI, the underlying mechanisms of this influence are not well understood. We argue that the IMF has ulterior motives when pressing countries for increased CBI. First, IMF loans are primarily transferred to local monetary authorities. Thus, enhancing CBI aims to insulate central banks from political interference to shield loan disbursements from government abuse. Second, several loan ==== clauses imply a substantial transfer of political leverage over economic policy making to monetary authorities. As a result, the IMF through pushing for CBI seeks to establish a politically insulated veto player to promote its economic policy reform agenda. We argue that the IMF achieves these aims through targeted lending conditions. We hypothesize that the inclusion of these loan conditions leads to greater CBI. To test our hypothesis, we use a recently available dataset on IMF programs that includes detailed information on CBI reforms and IMF ==== for up to 124 countries between 1980 and 2012. Our findings indicate that targeted loan conditionality plays a critical role in promoting CBI. These results are robust towards varying modeling assumptions and withstand a battery of robustness checks.","It is well established that central bank independence (CBI) produces all sorts of benign outcomes. CBI is associated with lower inflation, better sovereign credit ratings, enhanced capital inflows, and to a certain degree greater financial stability that ultimately translates into more stable economic output growth (e.g., Bodea and Hicks, 2015). Although most research relies on the implicit assumption that CBI is exogenously given, a lively debate remains around the question why some governments delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank whereas others remain reluctant to do so.====Existing research emphasizes the role of an entire battery of domestic and external economic, political, and social factors that lead to CBI (e.g., de Haan et al., 2018). In this literature, a particularly important role has been assigned to the IMF (Polillo and Guillén, 2005; Eichengreen and Dincer, 2011; Romelli, 2014). At the same time, few attempts have been made to isolate the mechanisms linking IMF conditionality to CBI. For example, Eichengreen and Dincer (2011), Romelli (2014), and Bodea and Hicks (2015) find that IMF program participation is positively associated with CBI, but do neither assess the type of central bank reform nor the type of IMF loan condition that would explain this positive association. In fact, the role of IMF loan conditionality in the context of CBI remains largely a ‘black box.’ In this article, we are trying to unpack critical mechanisms within this black box. Instead of replicating the results of prior research, our aim is to provide a coherent theoretical framework to explain (a) why the IMF cares about CBI and (b) why governments often follow suit with comprehensive monetary policy reform.====Historically, the IMF has pushed several countries towards implementing central bank reform when providing emergency loans. In particular, the Fund has often explicitly spelled out prohibitions of monetary financing and required governments to implement reforms in the conduct of monetary policy when formulating loan conditions (Polillo and Guillén, 2005; Johnson, 2016; Bossu et al., 2017). For example, during the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s, IMF conditionality played a critical role in pushing governments to loosen their grip on monetary authorities (Cargill, 2001; Polillo and Guillén, 2005; Corsetti et al., 2006). Furthermore, the IMF has been an active advocate for CBI and even threatens to withdraw from loan commitments to block governments’ attempts of undermining CBI (e.g., Johnson, 2016). For example, in 2011, the IMF threatened the Hungarian government to withdraw from its Stand-by Loan Agreement if policymakers were enacting and implementing new central bank legislation aimed at removing CBI (Bodea and Hicks, 2018).====From the IMF's perspective, CBI conditionality is not necessarily an ideological instrument. In fact, there are several practical/pragmatic reasons why the IMF attaches CBI conditions to its loans. First, CBI is a strong signaling device for investors concerning the soundness of future macroeconomic policies (Maxfield, 1997; Polillo and Guillén, 2005; Bodea and Hicks, 2018). Thus, requiring governments to enhance CBI, the IMF envisions to boost confidence among international investors to relief pressure from a country's balance of payments. Second, the IMF's due diligence protocol – before disbursing loans – foresees a thorough investigation into the operational and legal proceedings of monetary authorities to safeguard these funds (IMF, 2015). Through enhancing CBI, the IMF aims to insulate central banks from political interference, which is essential to minimize the risks of government abuse of disbursed funds. Third, loan conditionality clauses leading to a higher level of CBI imply a substantial transfer of political leverage over economic policy making to monetary authorities (e.g., Bodea and Higashijima, 2017). As a result, the IMF through pushing for CBI seeks to establish a politically insulated veto player within the borrowing country to constrain excess credit creation and promote its economic policy reform agenda (Nelson, 2017).====From a government's perspective, CBI implies substantial economic and political benefits, which come at the expense of losing direct control over a powerful tool to disburse cheap credit and to stimulate the economy. In particular, painful interest rate adjustments, a cutting-off of special funding windows, and the elimination of credit subsidy schemes for key political constituents make it often hard for an incumbent to craft a critical majority for CBI and to credibly commit to monetary reform (e.g., Aklin and Kern, 2019). Thus, governments often neither have incentives to give up control over this economic policy ‘basooka’ nor sufficient political capital to implement deep seated monetary reform (Bernhard, 1998; Cargill, 2001; de Haan et al., 2018). In these situations, the IMF entering the domestic policy scene has the potential to swing the domestic balance towards CBI. Especially, when domestic veto players cannot agree on or simply block monetary reforms, CBI loan conditionality can provide governments with an external policy anchor (Eichengreen and Woods, 2016). Besides tipping the domestic political balance, IMF involvement sends a positive signal to international investors about the viability of CBI and thus enhances the credibility of monetary reform (Beazer and Woo, 2016). As many emerging market and developing economies simply lack qualified personnel, the basic financial infrastructure (e.g., functioning money markets), and do not have the institutional and technical prerequisites to successfully implement CBI, the IMF can bridge these gaps through providing targeted technical assistance (Johnson, 2016). Taken together, we hypothesize that CBI conditionality is conducive for monetary reform and leads to greater CBI. We expect this effect to be most pronounced in emerging market economies that heavily rely on international capital inflows.====To test our main hypothesis, we use a recently available dataset on IMF conditionality (Kentikelenis et al., 2016) from which we code CBI conditions for up to 124 countries between 1980 and 2012. Utilizing these data allows us to draw on detailed information about explicit IMF-mandated policy conditions aimed at enhancing CBI. Our quantitative findings indicate that targeted loan conditionality plays a critical role in promoting CBI. On average, IMF programs with CBI conditionality increase the CBI index (ranging from 0 to 100) by up to 2.7 index points (one-eighth of its standard deviation), compared to IMF programs without CBI conditionality. These results are robust towards varying modeling assumptions and withstand a battery of robustness checks. Given recent debates on the viability of CBI, our findings have important policy implications concerning the role of the IMF in promoting and shielding central bank autonomy.====We contribute to several lines of the literature. First, we complement a fast-growing political economy literature on the dynamic evolution of central bank autonomy and its underlying determinants (Bodea and Hicks, 2015; Ainsley, 2017; de Haan et al., 2018). In particular, we are trying to address the role of the IMF in promoting CBI. Although several authors refer to the prominent role of the IMF in the context of CBI (Polillo and Guillén, 2005; Eichengreen and Dincer, 2011; Romelli, 2014), few attempts have been made to isolate the mechanisms linking IMF conditionality to CBI. In comparison to this earlier work, our approach offers a more fine-grained view on IMF involvement in central bank reform. While previous research long noted the desirability of gaining “====” (Polillo and Guillén, 2005, 1775), such data have become available only recently (Kentikelenis et al., 2016).====Second, we aim to complement a comparably large political economy literature on IMF loan conditionality (Copelovitch, 2010; Breen, 2013; Dreher et al., 2015). In this context, our contribution is most related to research that focuses on structural reform conditions and their effectiveness (Beazer and Woo, 2016; Nelson, 2017). In particular, we aim to exploit the heterogeneity afforded by our dataset to analyze the IMF's role in domestic monetary institution building. In this respect, using this newly available dataset on IMF loan agreements allows us to overcome a significant short-coming in prior research.====Finally, our contribution has important policy implications. As Beazer and Woo (2016) point out, it is often unclear “====” Our work shows that the IMF's CBI loan conditionality faces less political obstacles, which makes it more appealing to domestic policymakers and thus a highly potent policy instrument. Given that central banks around the globe are subject to rising political pressure (Binder, 2018), we believe that the IMF's role as guardian of politically independent monetary policy-making will increase significantly in the future.",IMF conditionality and central bank independence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018304890,14 March 2019,2019,Research Article,261.0

Using exogenous variation arising at population cutoffs determining council sizes in Finnish municipal elections, we show that larger council size increases both pivotal probabilities and turnout. These effects are statistically significant, fairly large and robust. Finally, we use a novel ==== design to show that the jumps in the pivotal probabilities are the likely candidate for explaining the increase in turnout, rather than the other observed simultaneous jumps at the council size cutoffs. Moreover, our results indicate that turnout responds only to within-party pivotal probabilities, perhaps because they are more salient to the voters than the between-party ones.","The expected instrumental benefits of voting are often thought to be close to zero, because the probability that a vote has an effect on the election outcome is typically close to zero (e.g. Grofman, 1993 and Blais, 2000). Moreover, the act of voting incurs non-negligible costs such as the opportunity cost of time. Therefore, if voters are rational in the sense that they only vote when the benefits of voting exceed the costs, the turnout rates should be very low in most elections, and particularly so in large elections.==== Yet, we observe relatively high turnout rates across countries and various elections, and it is not clear that turnout responds to the closeness of elections (e.g., Grofman, 1993). This voting paradox (Downs, 1957) has long puzzled social scientists and continues to do so.====Various explanations for the paradox have been offered both within and outside the rational voting paradigm. A simple way to explain the empirical patterns of high turnout is to introduce an additional utility component by assuming that voters derive utility from the act of voting itself. This expressive component may include elements such as social identity, civic duty or social pressure (e.g., Schuessler, 2000; Wiese and Jong-A-Pin, 2017). Indeed, there is convincing empirical evidence that such expressive motives matter (e.g., Gerber et al. 2008; Funk, 2010).====The purpose of our study is to analyze whether the instrumental components of the rational voting model also matter for the decision to vote or abstain. Empirical analysis of the relationship between turnout and how close the elections are is complicated due to standard endogeneity issues. In particular, reverse causality is an inherent issue in such studies, because pivotal probability, ====, the probability that one vote chances the election outcome, depends on turnout. Moreover, numerous unobservable candidate, voter and constituency characteristics may influence both turnout and how close the election is. Furthermore, it is not always easy to measure the pivotal probabilities, especially in proportional representation (PR) elections. In this paper, we make some progress in addressing both the issues of measurement and causal inference, although we cannot claim to be conclusive.====To overcome these challenges for causal inference, we utilize a natural experiment to analyze if turnout increases when the probability of one vote making a difference increases exogenously. In our quasi-experiment, we utilize population discontinuities in Finnish local government elections to construct a regression discontinuity design (RDD). In Finland, municipal council size is an increasing step function of population. Essentially, we compare otherwise similar municipalities with different council sizes. The discontinuities are sizeable. Crossing a population threshold increases council size by 20–30 percent, depending on the threshold. This design allows us to evaluate causal effects of council size on various political outcomes - a first step in our attempt to evaluate rational voting.====In an open-list PR system, pivotal events are relatively common. They can occur both between parties, i.e., situations where one abstaining voter could change the allocation of seats between parties by voting, and within parties, i.e., situations where one voter could change which of the party's candidates gets the last seat of the party. In this setting, an increase in the amount of seats leads to an increase in the probability of a vote being pivotal. The effect arises most importantly simply from the elections allocating the last seats with a smaller amount of votes and thus smaller margins both between and within parties. According to our bootstrap election simulations, crossing the threshold where council size increases, increases the probability of pivotal occurrence between parties for the average party on average by about 18% (from 1.7 times out of a hundred to 2.0) and the probability of pivotal occurrence for the last seat within parties for the average candidate increases on average by about 17% (from 2.4 times out of a hundred to 2.8).====In the absence of precise manipulation of the municipal population, the treatment of increasing the council size is almost as good as random near the population thresholds. Therefore, this setup provides a valid causal test for the effect of council size on turnout. We find that turnout is higher just above the council size thresholds than just below. This result is fairly robust to extensive validity and robustness checks.====The main caveat of our natural experiment design in making conclusions about rational voting from the council size effect is that pivotal probabilities are not the only things that change at the thresholds. On the contrary, the relationship between turnout and district magnitude can arise from many sources. From the voter perspective, council size affects also proportionality and hence potentially political efficacy, because voters may perceive that less votes are wasted (see e.g. Eggers, 2015; Gallego et al. 2012; Karp and Banducci, 2008). Also parties may respond to changes in political competition (i.e. closeness of elections in a more general sense that just one vote making a difference) and hence induce elite mobilization (Powell, 1986; , Cox, 1999b; Cox et al. 2016), which may be reflected in campaigning and candidate placement. We also observe that the number of candidates and some of their characteristics change at the discontinuities.==== Besides a further impact of more candidates on the pivotal probability (vote distribution may be flatter), this may also influence turnout due to some expressive components.==== Since RDD identifies only the joint effect of all the events that take place at each threshold, we cannot be sure whether the voters react to the pivotal probabilities or to e.g. the number of candidates. Fortunately, we are able to analyze this question of causal channel in detail using a novel procedure.====Our test of rational voting involves three steps. First, we document the overall effect of council size on turnout. Second, we simulate the pivotal probabilities for each municipality-party both within and between parties. There are many attempts in the literature that test for rational voting by correlating some measures of expected closeness of elections to turnout (see e.g. Geys, 2006 for a survey). One fundamental issue with such studies is that the real pivotal probability is highly nonlinear in relation to typical closeness measures such as margin of victory and the relationship is context dependent, e.g. 1% vote share victory margin may be either very far or very near to one vote being decisive (Cox, 1988). Moreover, closeness realizes after the elections, and thus, is affected by turnout (Cox, 1988; Matsusaka and Palda, 1993). We address these measurement and timing issues by bootstrapping pivotal occurrences.====Finally, we use our measure of expected pivotal probability simultaneously with the other endogenous variables in an instrumental variables regression (IV), where the different thresholds are the instruments. We find that the number or quality of candidates has consistently no significant effect on turnout, but that the pivotal probability has a positive and significant effect. Moreover, we find that turnout responds only to the more salient within-party pivotality but not at all to the - harder to calculate - between-party pivotality. These results also largely rule out proportionality and elite mobilization as explaining the turnout response, because they are mainly between-party concerns and also relate to political competition in general rather than to the influence of a single voter. Nonetheless, we also subject our measures of pivotality, general closeness of elections and proportionality to a horse race and find that only pivotality affects turnout.====This approach of using multiple thresholds to uncover and quantify the causal channel at work at the thresholds in RDD is an applied methodological contribution. Previous approaches to disentangle multiple treatments from each other in RDD with multiple thresholds have included focusing only on such ‘clean’ thresholds which affect only one of the treatments (see e.g. Ferraz and Finan, 2009) or using variation in treatment timing by combining RDD with a difference-in-differences analysis (so called difference-in-discontinuity approach as first coined by Grembi et al. 2016).==== We provide a new alternative that requires, first, in the case of, for example, two simultaneous treatments A and B, there to be some threshold(s) where treatment A has a large intensity (but treatment B only small) and some other threshold(s) were treatment B has a large intensity (but treatment A only small), and second, that there are at least as many thresholds as endogenous variables (simultaneous treatments). Therefore, we contribute to the emerging methodological literature on the analysis of multiple cutoffs RDD (Eggers et al. 2018; Cattaneo et al. 2016). However, as usual in attempting to uncover causal mechanisms (see, e.g., Imai et al. 2011), our approach requires some strong assumptions that we discuss later, but the key issue is that, when it comes to this analysis, we are back to observationally world. This implies that despite the fairly clear patterns in the data in favor of rational voting, this evidence should be taken merely as suggestive.",Are voters rational?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018303860,7 March 2019,2019,Research Article,262.0

Then, motivated by these observations, it presents a theoretical framework that highlights the scope for welfare-improving policy interventions in education, immigration policy and ethnic autonomy; surveys empirical evidence on such policies; and suggests directions for further research.","Recent decades have seen a dramatic rise in the scale and intensity of interaction between population groups divided along racial, ethnic and religious divides. In some countries, culturally polarized, native ethnic groups sharing a common political entity compete over political hegemony and economic resources. In other countries, cultural conflict breaks out when waves of immigrants, legal and illegal, arrive in growing numbers, disturbing a domestic equilibrium that may have been precarious to begin with. This has led to the emergence of a growing body of research by economists on these phenomena, much of it informed by the earlier work of sociologists and political scientists. It focuses on the interplay between cultural interactions and economic development: the influence of cultural interactions on the level and growth of economic well-being; and the impact of economic conditions on cultural interaction. Understanding how these reciprocal effects play out is directly relevant for forming policies on such central issues as the autonomy of ethnic groups, government efforts to promote cultural assimilation, immigration policy, and the cultural content of public education.====In this paper we first briefly survey empirical evidence on these interactions, distinguishing between two principal scenarios: one, of ethnic, cultural or religious tension between indigenous population groups sharing a single political entity; and another in which cultural interaction is the result of large waves of foreign immigration.==== We then present a theoretical framework, in section 3, which highlights the different types of externalities that arise from this interaction between economic development and cultural divisions, and indicates scope for welfare-enhancing policy interventions as well as the potential scope for political integration or segregation.

Since 2014 the Italian law allows mayors in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants to re-run for a third term, whereas mayors in cities with a number of residents above the cut-off still face a two-term limit. The introduction of the reform permits us to implement a difference-in-discontinuities design exploiting the before/after with the discontinuous policy change. We find that voters negatively react to the introduction of the reform: electoral participation decreases by about 5 percentage points in municipalities eligible to the treatment compared to municipalities in the control group. This negative effect is essentially driven by a decrease in the political competition. We also find that relaxing term limits does not improve the quality of politicians running for election.","Term limits, consisting in legal restrictions on the number of terms an officeholder can serve in a given elected office, are nowadays applied in several countries and for different offices. Nonetheless, pros and cons of term limits are still a matter of debate, also because legislative changes are often at the core of many political campaigns. For instance, Donald Trump made term limits for Congress an integral part of his campaign.====Opponents typically focus on both the incentive and selection effects coming from eliminating the re-election perspective for incumbent candidates. Indeed, according to the electoral incentives theory, term limits negatively affect politicians' accountability: term-limited politicians, being unable to benefit from good reputation, will have no incentives to take costly choices on behalf of voters and to make efforts in their activity. Moreover, politicians who know that their time in office is limited will face less pressure in developing expertise on specific issues. An additional cost related to the use of term limit is that it restrains voters' ability to select competent incumbents (Fearon, 1999; Alt et al., 2011). On the opposite side, supporters of term limits suggest beneficial effects, as they might reduce corruption. In fact, the common thread with most politicians, who have become more corrupt, seems to be the length of time they have served, and the absence (or relaxation) of term limits can contribute to this phenomenon as it prolongs the time a politician can be influenced by the power of the office s∖he holds (see for instance, Gamboa-Cavazos et al., 2007; Campante et al., 2009; Coviello and Gagliarducci, 2017).====By altering both the behavior and the characteristics of politicians, term limits are expected to produce a substantial impact on politics, governance and institutional dynamics. Further changes might derive from the relationship between term limits and turnout. From a theoretical side, term limits might increase or decrease turnout depending on whether they decrease or increase institutional quality and trust in government. For instance, term limits might negatively affect turnout since, on the one hand, they force out experienced incumbents from the electoral competition, and on the other hand, they might discourage new high quality entrants to run for election, through the reduction of the benefits coming from political careers. Conversely, by increasing the number of open-seat races, term limits increase competition (Nalder, 2007), and might attract citizens to the polls either by increasing the probability of each voter to influence the electoral outcome or by increasing campaign expenditures. Then, in order to figure out which of these effects is empirically relevant, it is particularly important to understand how voters respond to term limits.====The aim of this paper is to provide such empirical evidence by using data on Italian local elections and exploiting an exogenous institutional change introduced by a law (Law April 2014 no.56) allowing mayors to re-run for a third term in municipalities with a population size lower than 3,000 inhabitants. Before the reform, all municipalities were subject to a term limit of two consecutive mandates. The change introduced by this law enables us to use a difference-in discontinuities design by combining the before/after with the discontinuous policy variation, and to identify the impact of relaxing term limits both on turnout and institutional quality.====We contribute to the existing literature in different ways. First, the literature investigating the effect of term limits on electoral participation is scant, especially for European countries. To the best of our knowledge there are only a few papers stressing this kind of relationship, highlighting mixed results. Hajnal and Lewis (2003), using data obtained through a mail questionnaire proposed to city clerks in California find no effect of term limits on voter turnout. Nalder (2007), also using California data, considers state legislative races from 1976 to 2004 and finds that term limits decrease voter turnout. Instead, Veiga and Veiga (2018), analyzing data at the local level in Portugal and using a difference-in-differences approach, highlight a positive effect of term limit on electoral participation.====These mixed results might be due to the fact that in some of the contexts considered in these works, term limits were not exogenously imposed, leading to a reverse causality issue. Similarly to Veiga and Veiga (2018), we exploit a national reform that has affected all Italian municipalities with less than 3,000 inhabitants. Thanks to the richness of our data set, that also provides information on a number of candidates' characteristics, we are able to further contribute to this literature by investigating whether term limit extensions lead to an increase in the institutional quality, allowing high quality representatives to remain in office. At this aim, we investigate whether in response to a term limit extension high quality incumbents tend to re-run for election. As term limit extensions also increase the returns deriving from political career we also investigate the effects produced on the quality of new entrants.====Our results at the local level in Italy are in line with those found for Portugal and show that extending the mayoral term limit decreases voter turnout by about 5 percentage points. The channel through which the implementation of the policy negatively affects voters' behavior is a reduction in the political competition (larger electoral margin) characterizing those electoral races in which the exiting mayor, who has already served for two consecutive mandates, is allowed to re-run for the third time. We show that term limit extension has no effect on institutional quality, as all candidates' observable characteristics remain substantially unchanged.====These results hold true when we choose different optimal bandwidths. Moreover, we do not find any statistically significant effect when we focus on fake population thresholds and on fake years. These checks reassure us that the effects found are causal and not driven by chance. We also show that the estimated impact is not due to the increase in the number of councilors within the municipal apparatus. In fact, the law we exploit in our identification strategy has also led to a change in council size and one might be concerned that the effect driven by the mayoral term limit extension is confounded by the increase in the number of councilors. In order to take into account this potential issue, as a robustness check we directly test the effect of council size on electoral participation, by focusing on specific years where the only policy that changes in proximity of 3,000 cut-off is the number of councilors, and finding no significant effects.====Our paper also contributes to the huge literature investigating the determinants of electoral participation. As voting is costly (acquisition of information, cost of displacement, etc.), while for each single elector the probability of affecting the electoral outcome is close to zero (Downs, 1957), understanding why people decide to vote is a challenging question. In order to give an explanation of the so-called “paradox of voting”, describing the fact that in spite of the theoretical prediction of a very low turnout many people go to the polls (Fiorina, 1976), the literature has focused on characteristics of voters and candidates, and on different institutional features such as electoral systems, voting mechanisms and electoral closeness.==== In this regard we find effects that are consistent with previous literature, showing for instance a positive correlation between education and turnout and a lower turnout in municipalities with older people.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the Italian institutional setting, whereas in Section 3 we illustrate our data set, the methodology used and some validity tests on the diff-in-discontinuities design. In Section 4 we discuss our main empirical results. Section 5 investigates the impact of relaxing term limits on institutional quality.

While there has been some theoretical work, to the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first experimental study of the tug-of-war. The results show notable deviations of behavior from theory derived under standard assumptions. In the first battle of the tug-of-war, subjects often bid less, while in the follow-up battles, they bid more than predicted. Also, contrary to the prediction, bids tend to increase in the duration of the tug-of-war. Finally, extending the margin necessary to win the tug-of-war causes a greater reduction in bidding than either a decrease in the prize or greater impatience despite all three having the same predicted effect. These findings have implications both for theorists and practitioners.","The term “tug-of-war” derives from a rope pulling contest in which two contestants (or groups) pull a rope in different directions until one of the contestants pulls the other across a middle ground. But more generally, tug-of-war describes a contest consisting of a series of battles, where a battle victory of one contestant moves the game closer to the winner's preferred terminal state, and where one contestant wins the war if the difference in the number of battle victories exceeds some threshold (Konrad and Kovenock, 2005; Agastya and McAfee, 2006). As a modeling device, the tug-of-war has a large number of applications like R&D races in economics (Harris and Vickers, 1987) and the interaction of viruses and cells in biology (Zhou et al., 2004). In political science, the back and forth between the legislature and the president (Whitford, 2005) and the status of Jerusalem (Organski and Lust-Okar, 1997) have been described as tug-of-wars as has the tradeoff between efficient production and improving customer satisfaction with early delivery in operations management (Schutten et al., 1996).====Harris and Vickers (1987) were the first to formally examine the tug-of-war game.==== They analyzed an R&D race as a tug-of-war in which two players engage in a series of multiple battles and the winner of each battle is determined probabilistically. The assumptions of their model, prevented Harris and Vickers from completely solving the model, and instead they were only able to obtain qualitative predictions. More recently, Konrad and Kovenock (2005) have explicitly solved the tug-of-war game and provided conditions for a unique equilibrium. They showed that the contest effort crucially depends on the number of needed victories, the value of the prize, and the discount rate. In a related paper, Agastya and McAfee (2006) also derive equilibrium conditions for an alternative formulation of the tug-of-war game.====Despite an established theoretical literature, no effort has been devoted to empirically investigate individual behavior in the tug-of-war and compare such behavior with theoretical predictions. This is understandable, because it is not trivial to measure individual effort with naturally-occurring data, as the researcher can only observe the performance of contestants, which is a function of effort, ability and luck (see the discussion in Ericsson and Charness, 1994). In addition to measurement error, self-selection and endogeneity are unavoidable in dynamic settings (see the discussion in Kimbrough et al., 2018). Given the difficulties of testing the tug-of-war with naturally-occurring data, we chose to conduct a controlled laboratory experiment, which allows us to examine behavior in the tug-of-war without confounding effects and endogeneity issues.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining the tug-of-war experimentally (see Dechenaux et al., 2015 for a review of the experimental contest literature). Our experiment examines the theoretical predictions of Konrad and Kovenock (2005), using a three-by-one between-subjects design. In the ==== treatment, the value of the prize ====, is lower than in the other treatments. The ==== treatment involves more possible states ==== and thus a greater necessary margin for victory, than the other two treatments. The ==== treatment, reduces the discount rate ==== as compared to the other treatments. We follow the standard procedure for inducing a discount rate by making continuation to the next round probabilistic (see Dal Bo, 2005; Duffy, 2008). The key aspect of the design is that for all three treatments ==== is fixed, which makes all three treatments theoretically equivalent. The prediction is that contestants should exert costly efforts (bids) in the first battle (round) using a mixed strategy as in the standard all-pay auction. In the follow-up rounds, when the state is not ====/2, there should be no bidding. Moreover, bidding should not depend on the number of times a particular state has been reached. Finally, the aggregate behavior in each treatment should be the same as long as ==== is fixed.====We find notable deviations of behavior from theoretical predictions. First, we find that in the first round of the tug-of-war, bids are not drawn from the uniform distribution and there is significant underbidding. Second, we find that the bids are systematically greater than the predicted value of zero in the follow-up rounds. Third, contrary to the theoretical prediction, conditional on the state bids tend to increase in the duration of the tug-of-war. Finally, we find that bidding behavior is generally similar in the ==== and ==== treatments, but bidding is significantly lower in the ==== treatment, suggesting that extending the necessary margin of victory for the tug-of-war discourages subjects more from bidding initially than does lowering the prize or increased discounting. These findings have implications both for theorists and practitioners, which we discuss in the concluding section of our paper.",The tug-of-war in the laboratory,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017302859,1 March 2019,2019,Research Article,265.0

While the probability of a successful secession is increasing in heterogeneity, it is increasing in interregional income ","Nation boundaries have been in movement for a long time. The Center for International Development and Conflict Management (CIDCM) identifies the occurrence of 148 self-determination movements in 78 countries between the 1950s and 2005 (Marshall and Gurr, 2005), while Sambanis et al. (2018) identify 464 groups that have made separatist claims in 120 countries over the period 1945–2012. In Europe, Scotland held a binding referendum in December 2014, while Catalonia unilaterally declared independence in October 2017. Secessionist movements are currently present both in the developed and developing world, and at the supranational level, as the recent ==== vote testifies.====Even when they do not lead to violent conflict, separatist tensions involve a waste of resources for both the group seeking separation and the one seeking to preserve the union. They generate lobbying expenditures on both sides, and tend to monopolize the public debate and divert public resources.==== In this context, decentralization is often cited as a way of accommodating regional demands for more autonomy in heterogeneous countries.==== As decentralization allows regional governments to implement policies that are closer to local preferences, it potentially constitutes an alternative to costly and sometimes violent secession attempts. Yet, decentralization does better in curbing secessionism in some countries (such as Switzerland, or to a lesser extent Canada) than in others (such as Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia or Indonesia) (Lake and Rothchild, 2005). In their study on decentralization and country stability, Bird et al. (2010) report 34 countries “at risk”, that is, where there is arguably a secessionist (or at least autonomist) movement. Focusing on the cases of Spain, Belgium, UK and Canada, the authors do not provide any clear answer to the question as to whether decentralization works to preserve national unity.====The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we analyze the workings of wasteful secessionist conflict in the presence of income disparities and cultural heterogeneity between two regions. Second, we analyze under what conditions partial decentralization of both public expenditures and revenues can serve as a secessionist conflict-mitigating strategy. We do so in four steps.====In the first step, we set up a simple political economy model of border formation in the spirit of Alesina and Spolaore (1997), in which the inhabitants of two regions choose where to locate a public good, while suffering disutility from the distance to the latter. Under unification, besides this heterogeneity cost, there is a diversity cost resulting from a homogeneity bias (Desmet et al., 2011). Indeed, as argued by Alesina et al. (2005), even though preferences might be similar across groups, individuals may still prefer to interact with members of their own group. Finally, there is a rich and a poor region, so that there are implicit interregional transfers taking place under unification through the proportional financing of the public good. This setup allows us to capture the standard trade-off between heterogeneity and economies of scale: by seceding, a region eliminates the heterogeneity and diversity costs, while losing the benefits from economies of scale in the provision of the public good. Higher income inequality between regions increases the size of the implicit transfers under unification, making it more likely that the rich region wants to secede from the union, while the poor region wishes to preserve it. Therefore, we are able to capture the interactions between efficiency (heterogeneity versus economies of scales) and distributional (interregional transfers) effects in shaping the regional incentives for secession.====The second step of the analysis concentrates on the case of a disagreement between the two regions, namely the rich region seeking secession and the poor one seeking unification, and introduces a technology that allows the regions to exert costly effort in order to force their preferred border configuration. We show that the key element determining the intensity of conflict and the resulting outcome is the relative stakes in the conflict.====The region devoting more resources to the conflict is the one whose stakes are the largest, which depends on whether unification or secession is the socially efficient outcome, i.e., on whether economies of scale outweigh aggregate heterogeneity and diversity costs. Given that the poor region prefers unification, and as the difference in total welfare between the two border configurations is equal to the difference between the regional stakes, it follows that the poor region has bigger stakes than the rich region whenever the union is efficient. Conversely, if the union is inefficient, it is the rich region that has the biggest stakes in the conflict. As a consequence, a secession is more likely in an inefficient union than in an efficient one.====An increase in heterogeneity and diversity costs, by making the union relatively less attractive, reduces the stakes of the poor region while increasing those of the rich region. Thus, if the union is efficient to start with, such an increase also contributes to make the conflict stakes more symmetric, while doing the opposite in an inefficient union. In contrast, higher inequality always brings about more symmetry in the stakes, since it makes the conflict essentially a distributional one over interregional transfers (i.e., the stakes of both regions increase). In turn, as more symmetry in the stakes means that competition is stronger, it follows that the conflict is more intense, while its outcome is more uncertain. Interestingly, this means that a rise in inequality, while always fuelling conflict intensity, yields a higher probability of secession if and only if the union is efficient. By the same reasoning, higher heterogeneity and diversity costs fuel conflict intensity if and only if the union is efficient, while always increasing the likelihood of a successful secession.====In the third step of the analysis, we study whether such wasteful secessionist conflict can be avoided by partial decentralization. That is, we ask whether there exists an intermediate arrangement between unification and secession under which both regions are better off than under conflict. As partial decentralization applies to public expenditures and revenues, it has efficiency and distributional effects. On the one hand, decentralization brings the government “closer to the people”, while on the other, some benefits from economies of scale are lost. Furthermore, fiscal autonomy, by decreasing the size of the implicit interregional transfers, ==== impoverishes the poor region, while making the rich region richer. Finally, decentralization reduces the cost of diversity.====If the cost of diversity decreases proportionally with decentralization, there always exists a range of decentralization levels such that both regions prefer decentralization to conflict. We show that this range widens as conflict intensity increases, while the actual level of decentralization that is implemented under the threat of conflict is closely linked to the underlying probability of secession would a conflict occur. Intuitively, the more intense the conflict, the more resources are wasted, hence the greater the range of decentralization levels compatible with peace. Further, the larger the probability of a successful secession, the more concessions must be made to the separatists in order to avoid the conflict, so that the level of decentralization should increase. Therefore, while the range of decentralization levels compatible with peace always increases with inequality, it increases with heterogeneity and diversity costs if and only if the union is efficient. Furthermore, the level of partial decentralization that is implemented to prevent conflict always increases with heterogeneity and diversity costs, while it increases with inequality if and only if the union is efficient.====Finally, we show that if the cost of diversity decreases less than proportionally with decentralization, the range of decentralization levels compatible with peace might be empty. Put otherwise, if decentralization is ineffective at reducing between-group antipathy --- which is likely to be the case if there is a high level of resentment between such groups --- it cannot prevent conflict. This is consistent with the findings of Siroky and Cuffe (2015), who argue that resentment and grievances fostered by lost autonomy increases the likelihood of separatism and weakens the viability of conciliatory political strategies. Likewise, Cederman et al. (2015) argue that the effectiveness of governments’ concessions to ethnic groups shall depend on whether the relationship has so far been peaceful or not.====In the fourth and final step of the analysis, we analyze whether partial decentralization is self-enforcing. It turns out that whether full unification is still an available option once a decentralization agreement has been reached is key to answer this question. If it is, it follows directly that peace is self-enforcing, as the underlying conflict stakes are unaltered by decentralization. In other words, the possibility of losing previously acquired autonomy (i.e., reversible decentralization) shall appease further autonomy demands from separatist groups. To the contrary, we show that peace is not self-enforcing whenever decentralization is not a reversible process, as the rich region always has an incentive to trigger conflict in order to force secession after decentralization has been implemented. In turn, as it correctly foresees the latter, the poor region opposes the implementation of any decentralization to start with. Yet, even though decentralization eventually leads to secession, it still constitutes a way to maintain peace, while postponing full secession to some distant future. Belgium provides an example of such a process, where after several rounds of decentralization, the central government arguably has been emptied of most of its functions (Van Den Abbeele, 2016). Yet, the Flemish separatist mobilization has always been peaceful, and Belgium is often cited as a successful example of federalism.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 describes the basic setup and analyzes the costs and benefits of secession in the poor and the rich region. In Section 4, we describe the conflict technology and solve for the equilibrium of the conflict game. Section 5 introduces the possibility of using partial decentralization as a way to prevent conflict, and analyzes the feasibility of such a peaceful compromise. In Section 6, we analyze the issue of self-enforceability of the peaceful (i.e., decentralized) solution. Section 7 concludes.

Variance of achievement reaches its peak when average bonus pay is 14.06==== and then it starts falling. Also, mean achievement always falls as average bonus pay rises.","All over the world, bonus pay for teachers based on performance is a common policy. According to OECD (2014), 21 out of 35 OECD countries relied on teacher bonus pay policy during 2011–2012 academic year. Being a member of OECD, the interest for this policy have grown in the U.S. after the ==== report published in 1983 which clearly recommended teacher bonus pay to reform the public K-12 education. This recommendation is implemented recently through the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) for which the U.S. government spent 14.5 billion dollars (0.09==== of GDP) in 2012. Moreover, between 2006 and 2016, U.S. spent around 2.5 billion dollars under the Teacher Incentive Fund. Furthermore, according to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data, between 24.5==== and 54.9==== of school districts administered bonus pay policy during 2011–2012.==== Motivated by these, this paper tries to understand quantitatively the effect of bonus pay policy on student achievement distribution for the U.S. case. Because of the decentralized education finance system in the U.S., we find that bonus pay policy may lead to higher household and teacher sorting among districts which may then cause the variance of achievement (or inequality of opportunity) to rise and the mean achievement to fall.====In the U.S., financing of education is highly decentralized. This financing scheme causes both households and teachers to sort across school districts.==== Indeed, according to Census (2000) data, between school district household income variation accounted for 12.3==== of the national income variation. Regarding teacher sorting, Lankford et al. (2002) found that 65==== of the total variation in teacher quality is due to the teacher quality variation between regions and districts.==== Household and teacher sorting causes the richer school districts to spend more on public education. Data supports this prediction since the correlation between median income and per-pupil public expenditure across school districts is 0.27 in 2000.==== Moreover, according to Orlando Sentinel (April 15, 2016) and USA Today (December 14, 2016), wealthier school districts reward their teachers more than poorer school districts in both Indiana and Florida.====Under the light of the above evidence, once teacher bonus pay policy is introduced, richer districts are expected to reward their teachers disproportionately more than poorer districts. Depending on the size of the bonus gap among districts, the sorting of both households and teachers among districts is expected to change. If both household and teacher sorting rises, then we expect the variance of achievement to rise as well. In fact, for the recently observed level of average bonus pay (6.59==== of the average teacher base salary in 2011–2012 academic year), our model implies that household and teacher sorting rises by 8.21==== and 0.19==== respectively and the variance of achievement rises by 2.46==== compared to the no bonus pay case. Moreover, the mean achievement falls by 1.79====.====More formally, our model economy consists of two school districts (poor and rich), a continuum of heterogeneous households with measure one and a continuum of heterogeneous teachers with measure one. Each household consists of one parent and one child, and households are differentiated by exogenously specified income. Teachers are heterogeneous with respect to exogenously set quality. School districts differ by endogenously determined income tax rate, public spending per pupil and student achievement. Households have access to private consumption lotteries which are supplied by perfectly competitive, risk neutral firms. Each lottery consists of the probability of losing and winning, and associated prizes for each case. If the household loses the lottery, her prize is negative and she goes to the poor district. On the other hand, if the household wins the lottery, she gets a positive prize and resides in the rich district. A household's district-specific utility depends on the consumption and the achievement of her child in that district. Each household maximizes her expected utility defined over districts by choosing the optimal lottery and consumption. The probabilities embedded in the optimal lottery then determine the residential allocation of households across districts. Teacher efficiency wage per unit of quality is determined by the economy-wide demand and supply of teacher quality. Economy-wide supply of teacher quality is perfectly inelastic whereas demand is as usual. Given the wage, the demand by each district determines the assignment of teachers into the districts. A teacher's utility rises with the consumption and the mean achievement of her students and falls with the cost of effort. Optimal effort of a teacher is determined by maximizing the utility function. Each household pays some fraction of her income in the form of tax. The tax rate in each district is determined via majority voting. Households are myopic voters and they take into consideration the effect of their vote only on the public spending per pupil at the time of voting. An exogenous share of income tax revenue finances teacher wages and the remaining part finances non-teacher related education spending in each district. The achievement level in a district depends on teacher effort and non-teacher related spending per pupil.====Our model is consistent with the observed patterns of household and teacher sorting across school districts. As mentioned above, between district income variation accounted for 12.3==== of the overall income variation in the U.S. in 2000. Equivalently, within district income variation explains the remaining 87.7==== of the overall income variation. This implies considerable amount of income mixing within school districts. Further evidence of income mixing is provided in Table 1. In the table, we group districts based on mean income. Poor districts are defined as having mean income smaller than the U.S. mean income (====57, 135). On the other hand, rich districts are defined as having mean income greater than the U.S. mean income. Out of all households living in the poor districts, we observe that 75.35==== have incomes below the U.S. mean income and the remaining 24.65==== have incomes above the U.S. mean income. Similarly, out of all households living in the rich districts, 52.92==== have incomes below the U.S. mean income and the remaining 47.08==== have incomes above the U.S. mean income. In our model, we obtain income mixing by relying on private consumption lotteries. A household with a particular income, ex-ante agrees on a state-contingent contract by choosing a lottery.==== The contract specifies the probabilities and prizes for each state (i.e., district). Since there is a continuum of households, the law of large numbers applies and the probabilities at the household level convert into masses at the aggregate level. For instance, if a household with income, say ====50, 000, chooses a lottery that assigns one-half probability for each district, then at the aggregate level, half of the households with income ====50, 000 reside in the poor district and the other half reside in the rich district. This way, same income households appear in both districts which implies income mixing.====Moreover, as mentioned above, Lankford et al. (2002), Clotfelter et al. (2011) and Kalogrides et al. (2012) found significant evidence of teacher sorting across districts. In our model, teachers are perfectly sorted across districts consistently with empirical evidence and the local demands for teacher quality determine the teacher quality cutoff.====We calibrate the parameters of our theoretical model by matching certain targets from the 2000 U.S. data. We also test our model against those statistics which are not targeted at the calibration stage. In a computational experiment, we then introduce bonus pay on top of teacher base salary. The bonus pay for a teacher increases with the mean achievement of her students. The size of the bonus pay per unit of mean achievement is exogenously set and it differs across districts. Different bonus sizes across districts imply a particular economy-wide average bonus pay measured as a percentage of average teacher base salary. For the 2011–2012 observed level of average bonus pay in the U.S. (6.59====), we find that the variance of achievement rises by 2.46==== and the mean achievement falls by 1.79====.====The rise in the variance of achievement is consistent with the findings of Macartney et al. (2015) which empirically investigates the teacher incentive design for the North Carolina public schools.==== Similar to our paper, several other studies such as Glazerman et al. (2009), Springer et al. (2010), and Fryer (2013) also found a negative effect of teacher bonus pay on the mean achievement. However, the evidence is mixed and a recent study by Chiang et al. (2017) found a slightly positive effect of teacher bonus pay on the mean achievement. More specifically, Chiang et al. (2017) analyzes the impact of Teacher Incentive Fund grants by randomly assigning 131 schools in 10 districts into control and treatment groups. In the treatment group, the average bonus pay is around 4====–5==== of average teacher salary and bonus pay rises with teacher's performance. After observing 131 schools from 2011 to 2015, Chiang et al. (2017) found between 1 percentile and 2 percentile points increase in the mean achievement. For a similar bonus pay, we find a 1.79==== decline in the mean achievement as noted above. Moreover, Chiang et al. (2017) found that teacher bonus pay causes a fall in the mean math and reading achievements for 5 and 3 districts respectively. In our paper, mean achievement declines in all districts. There may be several reasons for these opposite findings between our paper and Chiang et al. (2017). One possible reason is that, in the data used by Chiang et al. (2017), only 37==== of students stayed in their schools within four year period implying significant student attrition. This is not the case in our paper. The slight increase in the mean achievement may be due to the possibility that the students that enter the sample may be high ability and students who left the sample may be low ability. One other possible reason is that, in our model, we have only two public schools whereas Chiang et al. (2017) analyzes 131 public schools. Our results may be biased because of this limitation.====Different from previous empirical studies, we provide an explanation for the behavior of the variance of achievement and the mean achievement. Our explanation is based on the sorting of households and teachers across districts. More specifically, we find that when both household and teacher sorting rises, the variance of achievement also rises reaching its peak at an average bonus pay of 14.06====. After 14.06====, although household sorting rises, teacher sorting starts falling. Higher household sorting pulls the variance up and lower teacher sorting pulls the variance down. The latter offsets the former and the variance of achievement starts falling after 14.06====.====Mean achievement always falls as the average bonus pay rises. To understand this, we analyze the behavior of the economy-wide non-teacher related spending per pupil and the mean teacher effort which are the determinants of the mean achievement. As average bonus pay increases, the economy-wide non-teacher related spending per pupil also increases which then pulls the mean achievement up. At the same, economy-wide mean teacher effort falls with the average bonus pay which pulls the mean achievement down. Quantitatively, the latter effect offsets the former and the mean achievement falls.====To the best of our knowledge, this study seems to be the first to analyze bonus pay policy using an equilibrium political economy model of education. Education finance in a decentralized economy is analyzed by Westhoff (1977), Epple et al. (1984), Fernandez and Rogerson (1996), Epple and Platt (1998), Epple and Sieg (1999), Nechyba (1999), Bearse et al. (2001), Ferreyra (2007) and Hanushek and Yilmaz (2007).==== Different from these papers, we model the sorting of both households and teachers across districts in a decentralized education finance system and we incorporate the incentives faced by teachers in producing achievement. Moreover, another difference from the aforementioned papers is that income mixing is obtained via private consumption lotteries. Households are willing to play lotteries in our model because of the indivisibility inherent in location choice. Previous papers such as Epple and Platt (1998) and Epple and Sieg (1999) relied on household preference heterogeneity for housing or public good to obtain income mixing whereas Nechyba (1999) relied on housing stock heterogeneity across districts.====Another strand of literature following Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991), emphasize that teachers, faced with a bonus pay scheme, can take hidden actions such as “teaching to the test” to boost both the performance of their students and their bonus payment. To solve this problem, Barlevy and Neal (2012) proposed to pay bonuses based on the comparison of after-school achievement of students who were initially at the same before-school achievement percentile. This paper ignores such incentive problems and tries to understand the effect of bonus pay policy in the best case scenario. As mentioned above, even in this case, we find that bonus pay may increase the variance of achievement and decrease the mean achievement.====Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the model. Section 3 defines the equilibrium of our model and Section 4 characterizes its theoretical properties. We calibrate the parameters of the model in Section 5 by matching certain statistics from the 2000 U.S. data. Section 6 analyzes the effects of the bonus pay policy through computational experiments.

In India, public disclosure of the large share of politicians currently facing criminal charges has sparked a heated public debate and emerging literature assessing the causes and effects. We develop two hypotheses based on our theoretical considerations. Based on the coding of published affidavits and a comprehensive set of three proxies to measure effort in the 14th Lok Sabha over the 2004–2009 legislative period, we put these hypotheses to an empirical test. Members of the parliament (MPs) facing criminal accusations exhibit on average about 5% lower attendance rates and lower utilization rates in a local area development fund, but only insignificantly lower parliamentary activity. In line with our hypotheses, these differences decline in the development level of the constituency - a proxy for higher rent-seeking possibilities and monitoring intensity. We argue and demonstrate why these negative relations should constitute an upper bound estimate of the causal effect, and show that even under conservative assumptions the effect is unlikely to be caused by unaccounted selection-bias.","Many democracies, particularly in developing countries, face problems with regard to the personal background of some politicians. The world's largest democracy, India, is only one example. In 2014, a year where we possess reliable data, roughly 34% of the recently elected members of the lower house of the Indian parliament faced pending criminal charges.==== A significant share of the Members of Parliament (MPs) are accused of serious criminal acts ranging from rape to murder.==== The Indian and international media have reported on this issue, and it is widely believed that it poses a threat to the Indian democracy in general and the constituencies represented by those individuals specifically. While these problems supposedly exist in a wide range of countries worldwide, the unavailability of data has impeded analysis of their consequences. We outline why India is a unique case that allows us to assess the economic and developmental consequences of parliamentarians with pending criminal charges holding public office.====While there is some anecdotal evidence that electoral constituencies represented by MPs with pending serious criminal charges remain underdeveloped and such members tend to underperform in terms of their effort in parliament, systematic empirical evidence remains scant. Can criminal charges explain the variations in parliamentarians' performance in parliament and the development of their electoral constituencies: The existing theoretical literature models the effect of electoral accountability on economic policy choices (Besley and Case, 1995; Dutta and Gupta, 2014), of compensation on policy outcomes (Besley, 2004), and of outside income opportunities on self-selection and behavior (Gagliarducci et al., 2011).====Political competition could mitigate the effect of a candidate with a criminal background if political parties can make credible commitments to the voters and are thereby able/likely to discipline their party members (e.g., Besley and Coate, 1997). In the Indian context, however, Keefer and Khemani (2004) argue that the biggest obstacle for development is that promises made by the political parties lack credibility. Under such circumstances, elections only serve the purpose of removing the incumbent in the constituency from power (or keeping the incumbent in power). This paper ties in with the emerging literature on electoral competition in the context of India (e.g., Keefer and Khemani, 2009). For instance, Aidt et al. (2011) investigate why parties field criminal candidates, and Dutta and Gupta (2014) analyze competition between candidates that include criminals.====In order to empirically test our hypotheses, we use details about the criminal records of the candidates available due to a 2003 Indian Supreme Court judgment that made it mandatory for every candidate contesting state and national elections to provide sworn affidavits detailing their background. These include details not only about their personal, educational, and financial particulars, but also detailed information on any criminal charges they had faced, the status of their criminal cases and any pending charges against them.====We use criminal charges as a signal of whether a MP is a criminal type, and refer to those with pending charges as “criminal MPs” in the rest of the paper. To alleviate potential bias in our estimates caused by measurement errors due to individual false charges, we run all regressions both with a binary variable ====, coded one for those with a least one charge, and ====, which takes the value one only for those with more than one charge. We study the 14th Lok Sabha (2004–2009) instead of the 15th (2009–2014), or a combination of both, because electoral boundaries of constituencies changed between elections, making it impossible to match constituencies. Using the 14th Lok Sabha allows us to control for confounding factors such as past electoral performance or party strongholds which are crucial in determining MP effort.====We want to assess whether elected candidates with criminal records differ from their colleagues with regard to effort. Various measures have been used in the literature to gauge MP effort. Instead of picking just one factor, which might not capture differences between MPs comprehensively, we use three measures, each capturing a different facet of MP behavior. First, we use attendance rates (or absenteeism respectively) as, for example, in Besley and Larcinese (2011); Gagliarducci et al. (2010, 2011) and Mocan and Altindag (2013). Second, we make use of MPs' effort in parliament by considering information on the number of questions they asked and their participation in debates (cf. Mocan and Altindag, 2013; Arnold et al., 2014). While both of these measures capture effort, one might question their relevance for the electorate. On the other hand, we doubt to some degree that economic outcomes like consumption or economic activity at an aggregate level can be directly linked to MP activity, which makes it more problematic to draw a causal link to MP effort.====Thus, we draw on Keefer and Khemani (2009) and use the cumulative utilization rate of the MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). The fund is intended for the development of electoral constituencies and offers several advantages in making the effort that MPs undertake on behalf of their constituencies observable. Advantages are, for example, that the amounts available are identical across constituencies, implementation of projects requires substantial effort on behalf of the MP, projects are clearly identifiable with the MP's name, and that the considerable media coverage makes it likely that voters learn about the effort. Attracting public spending for one's electorate is a widespread phenomenon, that is also relevant in more developed political systems (Gehring and Schneider, 2018). More details are outlined below.====Our paper is most closely linked to two other papers that are also evaluating the impact of Criminal actors in Indian politics. Chemin (2012) suggests electing criminal MPs results in very large declines of up to 19% in consumption of the most vulnerable parts of society. The surprisingly large estimates might be driven by two potential problems with the regression discontinuity design. First, the study needs to rely on relatively few observations and a rather large bandwidth in the 178 constituencies in which a criminal faced a non-criminal candidate in 2004. Second, it matches political constituencies to administrative districts, but both overlap in non-trivial ways. Prakash et al. (2014) use data at the state assembly level over the 2004–2008 period and various development proxies based on nighttime light as their outcome. They also use a regression discontinuity design and find very large effects: declines in luminosity of around 22 percentage points. Our study is complementary to these existing studies, as it examines measures more closely linked to the MP and estimates the average treatment effect instead of the local average treatment effect measured in the RD designs.====The observation level in our study is the 543 constituencies, which each elect one MP in a first-past-the-post-system. We find that across specifications, ==== is related to around 5% higher absenteeism rates. Parliamentary activity, on the other hand, does not differ significantly between criminal and non-criminal MPs in our baseline specification. In line with our hypotheses, criminal MPs show both significantly lower attendance rates and less parliamentary activity in constituencies that are economically underdeveloped. The reason for the latter could lie in better monitoring of politicians' behavior in the more developed constituencies and/or the greater attractiveness of these constituencies for criminals in terms of rent-extraction possibilities. The coefficients become more negative when we use our ==== indicator instead. MPLADS fund utilization is lower for criminal MPs in general, but only significant for ====.====The most difficult challenge for identification is that MPs are obviously not randomly assigned to constituencies. Omitted variable bias arises if expected effort generally differs in those constituencies that have voted for a criminal MP based on unobserved factors we cannot fully control for. The direction of the bias is not ex ante trivial. It would be negative, if, for example, less developed electorates are more likely to elect a criminal and it would be harder to recommend an MPLADS project in such a constituency. A positive bias would occur, if less developed constituencies were more likely to elect a criminal and exhibit higher MPLADS utilization rates because it is easier to identify necessary projects. Given the common a priori assumption of a negative relationship between Criminal and effort, we are less concerned about a potential upward bias, because our estimated negative coefficient would then be an upper bound of the true effect.====As part of our strategy to identify the causal effect of having a criminal background on the outcome variables, we control for observable pre-determined constituency-specific and MP-specific factors. Second, fixed effects for major states ensure that the results are not driven by factors specific to certain Indian regions such as, for example, economic underdevelopment. Fixed effects for major parties make sure that the coefficients are not driven by unobserved factors specific to a party or related to being part of the government or opposition. Third, we show that the control and treatment groups are strongly balanced, and that our results remain unchanged when using alternative matching estimators. Overall, we argue and provide evidence that selection effects are more likely to shift our coefficients towards zero.====As our approach cannot explicitly exploit exogenous variation, we accept that omitted variable bias remains a concern. Still, it seems a relatively mild concern regarding the direction of causality. We use selection-on-observables to show why the negative coefficient of ==== on MPLADS utilization rates is more likely an upper bound estimate of the negative effect. With the methods developed in Altonji et al. (2005) and Oster (2017), we then demonstrate that on average selection bias (on unobserved factors) would have to be between two and sixteen times greater than selection on observed factors to fully explain the negative relationship between Criminal and attendance rates or MPLADS utilization. If the reader accepts this logic and the notion that the observable controls give an idea about the direction of the biasing effect of unobservables, then we provide robust evidence that, on average, criminal MPs indeed behave in a way that is detrimental to their constituency.====The paper is structured as follows: the next section summarizes the relevant literature. Subsequently, we describe our theoretical framework about the impact of a criminal background on political effort depending on the development of the electoral constituency. Section 4 describes our data, methods and estimation strategy.

We analyze this episode in several dimensions: (i) we provide an event-study analysis, covering key variables from national central banks' balance sheets, (ii) we rationalize the empirical patterns in a formal discussion of the constraints in a monetary union and (iii) we analyze different indicators of redenomination risk in the euro area. Finally, we argue that the euro area entails an inherent policy trilemma that makes it prone to speculative attacks.","In small open economies with fixed exchange rates, the central bank often faces the challenge that it cannot accommodate capital flight with a monetary expansion, while at the same time keeping the exchange rate fixed. At some point countries run out of reserves and a speculative attack breaks the monetary arrangements apart.====During the euro crisis, the ECB has faced a similar policy trilemma: In the winter 2011/12, internal capital flight reached its peak when national central banks (NCBs) implemented the ECB's full allotment policy and provided one trillion euros of refinancing credit to banks.==== At the same time, the ECB started to pursue an exit strategy from unconventional policies, by raising interest rates and collateral standards. These parallel developments generated severe market tensions and rising break-up expectations. In early December 2011, when banks started using the swap line and borrowed from the ECB in US Dollars,==== a major policy reversal took place. The ECB announced the “Big Bazooka”, in the form of two tranches of 3-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). In the summer of 2012, the whatever-it-takes statement implied that for the foreseeable future liquidity support would be unlimited. Interestingly, Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, interprets the ECB's actions during this period as a “====.”====In this paper, we interpret the events of 2011/12 in the context of the speculative attack literature. What are the constraints for NCBs when providing refinancing credit to banks? What has been the trigger event that caused speculative capital flows? And what role do political economy considerations play?====To address these questions, we analyze the institutional characteristics of the euro area with a particular focus on the NCB's balance sheets and the TARGET2 clearing system. We show theoretically that the common central bank of a currency union cannot simultaneously control the aggregate monetary base and delegate the implementation of a full-allotment policy to NCBs.==== Also, while de jure unlimited, there is a de-facto limit of the TARGET2 imbalances, as claims and liabilities cannot become larger than the monetary base. At the time of a speculative attack, the ECB is forced to abandon one of the following incompatible objectives: (i) the full-allotment policy, (ii) its monetary target or (iii) the single currency. This result is reminiscent of the well-known ====. In contrast to the literature, however, we focus on policy options within a single currency area, not on individual countries. Financial market participants anticipating this predicament will attack the currency union when the ability to accommodate internal capital flight – given a particular monetary target – reaches a critically low level.====The empirical analysis in this paper consists of two parts. First, we highlight key indicators from central bank balance sheets in an event-study analysis, centered around the ECB's monetary expansion on December 8, 2011. In particular, we document the patterns of refinancing credit, deposits, reserves, swap lines and TARGET2 balances. We derive a set of stylized facts by comparing a group of crisis countries – Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS) – with a set of countries that have been the recipients of capital flight – Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg (DNFL).====Secondly, we empirically analyze the redenomination risk in the euro area and illustrate that it reached a peak-value when the trilemma became binding for the first time in December 2011. This finding is based on different indexes of break-up risk, such as the redenomination-risk component in bond yields, Google searches for Euro break-up and the implied break-up probability from a betting platform. In a principle components analysis, we combine all three indicators to visualize their common pattern.====Finally, based on theory and the empirical analysis, we argue that the ECB's exit strategy in the summer of 2011 can be interpreted as a trigger event for speculative capital flows and the increase in redenomination risk. It added a third policy objective to the earlier decision on full allotment and the overall objective of keeping the single currency intact. The monetary expansion in December 2011 postponed the break-up scenario and the promise of unlimited liquidity ultimately forestalled the dynamics.====From a political economy perspective, we point out that the letter from Bundesbank President Weidmann to the ECB, requesting a collateralization of TARGET2 claims, may have further fueled capital flight. It has played a similar role as the well-known “Emminger Letter” before the break-up of the ERM. We discuss the link of our paper to the political economy literature on the trilemma, which analyses how central banks position themselves in the decision-triangle, and how this decision is influenced by ideology and voting pressure.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the behavior of key balance sheet variables around December 2011. Section 3 derives the European version of the trilemma and highlights similarities and differences to standard first-generation speculative attack models.

Nevertheless, it has not been established whether a market solution via private financing, rather than public financing, curb aggregate healthcare expenditures. To our knowledge, this paper is the first that quantifies the impact of reforms that significantly increases (decreases) the private (public) share of healthcare financing on total healthcare expenditures relative to income in 20 ==== countries. Our reform measure is based on structural break testing of the private share of total expenditures, and verification using evidence of policy reforms. To quantify the effect of these reforms we apply ==== and Inverse Probability Weighted ====. Over a 5-year evaluation period the reforms lead to an accumulated cost saving 0.45 percentage points of GDP. The yearly effects of the reforms are largest in the first years in the post-reform period and decreases in size as a function of time since the reform. Our findings suggest that the investigated healthcare reforms have a relatively short-lived effect on aggregate health spending relative to GDP. The findings are robust to various sensitivity tests.","For decades most developed economies have experienced a rapid increase in total Health Care Expenditures (HCE) relative to income. At the same time, the private share of HCE decreased (Fan and Savedoff, 2014, Fig. 1). In light of this ‘Health Financing Transition’ academics and policy-makers worried that the healthcare systems would become unsustainable (OECD, 1987; Oxley and MacFarlan, 1995; Chernichovsky, 1995). In an attempt to increase efficiency and curb public expenditures, countries introduced healthcare reforms. Till date, it has not been established quantitatively in a multi-country sample of comparable reforms whether significant policy reforms that shift healthcare financing from public to private entities curbs total healthcare expenditures relative to GDP. We aim to fill this gap in the literature, by quantitatively analysing the effect of Health Care Financing (HCF) reforms==== on total costs relative to GDP in developed economies in the short to medium run.====To detect significant policy induced reforms we employ a methodology designed to identify structural reforms (Wiese, 2014). First, structural break tests are applied to the private share of HCE to identify ‘potential reforms’. Secondly, to qualify as a HCF reform the potential reform must be corroborated by evidence of an actual policy change. This ensures that the 23 analysed reforms are policy induced and makes a statistically significant positive (negative) impact on the privately (publicly) financed share of HCE. That way, we avoid including reforms in our sample that did not fundamentally alter the institutional setup of the health care financing system.====We estimate the effect of the reforms shown in Fig. 1 on the change in total HCE as % of GDP in the following 5-years. Following a reform we observe a stagnating or a decreasing development of total HCE relative to income in the medium run for several countries, for example in France and Spain. It is very likely that the countries that undergo HCF reforms are the ones where there is a potential for cost savings. This implies selection into treatment, which will bias any standard OLS estimate of the effect of reforms on total HCE. Ideally we would like to know what would have happened to total HCE in the absence of a reform. As can be seen in Fig. 1 we have multiple observations in the sample of countries where no reform took place. Therefore, both Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) regression analysis are applied. This allows identification of appropriate reform counterfactuals mitigating potential selection bias. The estimated effect of the reforms is of the magnitude 0.45 percentage points of GDP saved over the five following years. Additionally we show that the estimated cost savings in the post-reform period are large in the first year(s) and almost continually decreasing over time, approaching a zero-effect in the 5th year. We wish to bring to the reader's attention that the analysed reforms may have adverse effects on total expenditures in the longer run and that the analysed reform may result in a net increase in total HCE in the longer run.====Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 discusses the identification of HCF reforms and gives a brief characteristic of the reforms. Section 4 presents the estimation approach along with the data.

We explore the effects of a change in ====, introduced a year before the gubernatorial elections in Peru on the number of parties that participated in these elections. We also investigate how the legislative change affected the political experience of the candidates. Given that the legislative change did not apply to elections for provincial mayors, we use those elections as a control group, in a difference-in-differences design. Our estimates show the number of parties registered increased by a margin of around 2.2 after the legislative change. The change also increased the candidates' years of accumulated political experience, particularly in the subsequent gubernatorial elections.","Electoral systems are the body of rules governing democratic elections. Two of the most common systems in elections for a single seat, are simple majority, where the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected, and runoff voting or ballotage, where there is a second round of voting if the candidate with the highest number of votes does not surpass a predefined threshold (usually, 50% of valid votes).====In this paper we explore the effect of these rules on electoral competition. Electoral rules could affect competition through their influence on voting strategies and subsequent outcomes, as Duverger (1959) suggested.====Moreover, Persson and Tabellini (2006) propose that systems create incentives for parties and individual politicians participating in the political competition with, ultimately, consequences on economic policy outcomes. They focus on the trade-off between accountability (how voting can be used to punish or reward specific actions taken by elected officers) and representation (how wide the platforms are on which parties run). If an electoral system tends towards the concentration of the vote on few parties, these parties could be less accountable to any specific group of voters, but would be more representative of the mass of the population.====Therefore, it is important to study how electoral systems affect electoral outcomes and party participation in elections. Given that electoral systems do not change frequently, these issues have not been thoroughly studied. We do so using a law change in Peru that required a runoff between the top two candidates for regional governor if neither surpassed 30% of the valid votes in the first round. This change of electoral rules did not apply to provincial mayors, a comparable executive office that is chosen at the same time. Using these elections as counterfactual, we estimate the effect of this new system on the number of parties competing in the gubernatorial election, the concentration of voting shares, and the political experience of the candidates chosen by the parties to stand in the election.====Our results suggest an increase of around 2.2 additional candidates as a consequence of the change towards a runoff election. This effect is robust to the inclusion of several control variables, including year and regional fixed effects, demographic information and windfall transfers. We do not find an effect on vote distribution, but candidates' experiences increased after the rule change, particularly so in 2014.====The paper proceeds as follows.

The theoretical transmission channels are numerous, including rent-seeking, Dutch disease, and corruption (see section 2 for a detailed review of the literature). A clear majority of empirical studies concentrates on country-level data that are widely available for countries at different levels of economic development. However, country-level averages ignore the spatial distributions of resources within countries, which can be very important for several transmission channels.====We study the effects of spatially unequal resource distribution on ethnic income inequality and civil war. Consequently, our paper relates to three broad strands of the literature. First, this paper enlarges the perspective of the resource curse on spatial and geography-driven causes of income inequality within countries. Recent studies only state that resources raise personal income inequality in ethnically divided countries but reduce inequality in homogeneous societies (Fum and Hodler, 2010). We therefore provide new insights into exogenous roots of horizontal inequalities within countries. Second, this paper contributes to the literature on the causes of civil war. Most studies focus on the economic and institutional roots of civil war. Few of them include exogenous geographical data, which is said to favour insurgency (see Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Morelli and Rohner, 2015). Finally, we study the effect of ethnic relations on executive power and the role of institutional quality in the resource-income inequality nexus and in the resource-conflict nexus. Thus, we also contribute to the regional favouritism and institutional quality literature (see Mehlum et al., 2006a; Hodler and Raschky, 2014; De Luca et al., 2018).====Our study is motivated by a theoretical model that extends Hodler (2006) to the case of unequal resource distributions across groups. We hypothesise that (1) intergroup income inequality grows as resource inequality rises. Considering conflicts due to intense rent-seeking and inequality, we claim that (2) a heterogeneous resource distribution increases the probability of the onset of civil war. Against the background of our symmetry assumptions in the model, we also argue that the existence of a dominant ethnic group or weak national institutions can affect the outcomes.====In the empirical part of our study, we exploit night-time light data for mining areas and ethnic homelands to test our main hypotheses. Ethnic homelands are defined as in the Geo-Referencing of Ethnic Groups (GREG) dataset, which is derived from the Soviet Atlas Narodov Mira (Weidmann et al., 2010). Following Alesina et al. (2016), we use the light intensity within ethnic homelands to proxy for ethnic income and inequality. Concerning local resource-based income, we concentrate on the geo-locations of active mines, which are reported by the National Minerals Information Center of the U.S. Geological Survey. We draw circles with a 10-km radius around the exact locations of more than 6000 mines and mining facilities all over the world,==== and we calculate the levels and changes of night-time light in these areas. Our approach is based on the assumption that an increase in mining intensity causes an increase in light emissions on the earth's surface due to local lighting and transport systems, industrial facilities, agglomeration of miners and increasing local income levels. To test our approach, we consider two cases in detail: Mt. Whaleback, an iron ore mine in Western Australia, and El Teniente, a copper mine in Chile. Both examples show that mine lights are closely related to both input and output measures of resource extraction, regardless of whether the mine has an open pit or an underground pit. Moreover, we show that changes in mine-lights calculated at the country level are highly correlated with reported information on mineral resource rents drawn from the World Development Indicators. Therefore, our approach appears suitable for measuring the economic effects caused by different levels of resource extraction intensity and resource-based income at the local level.====Consistent with our theory, we find that resource inequality is a crucial determinant of ethnic income inequality and conflicts. In particular, we show that increased mine-lights are associated with rising income for the specific ethnic group surrounding the mining area. Neighbouring ethnicities do not gain from resource exploitation behind ethnic borders. However, this result is partly offset if a politically dominant ethnic group exists. Groups that hold monopoly power or dominant power also benefit from resources that are located in other ethnic homelands. Next, we calculate an inequality index at the country level (====), which measures the concentration of mine light across ethnicities. Panel fixed effects regressions show that an unequal resource distribution increases ethnic income inequality and the risk of internal conflicts. In order to study a possible transmission channel, we condition the relationship on the quality of national institutions. We find that weak institutions amplify the negative effect of an unequal resource distribution on civil conflicts, whereas high institutional quality can offset the curse, at least partly. Therefore, natural resources are a blessing for regions, but they can be a curse for nations.====Let us briefly illustrate our findings in the cases of Nigeria and Gabon. These countries have almost the same degree of ethnic fractionalisation. However, according to our Gini index of resource inequality, Nigeria has very high resource concentration across ethnicities of approximately 0.88, whereas Gabon's mine-light inequality is significantly lower, with an index of 0.62. Inequality in resource distribution causes comparatively high ethnic income inequality in Nigeria, whose Gini index is 0.71 compared with 0.41 in Gabon. In addition, Nigeria suffered from at least three armed conflicts during our 2000–2012 observation period. In contrast, there has not been a single conflict in Gabon over the entire period. Considering the full sample, we find that a 0.1 increase in the resource inequality Gini is associated with a 0.035 higher income Gini and increases the risk of the onset of civil war in a certain year by approximately 0.7%. This finding is of high relevance because the size of the effect is close to similar effects of ethnic polarisation and ethnic fractionalisation (e.g, Fearon and Laitin, 2003; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, 2005). This result implies that geography – via the spatial distribution of resources – is aexogenous root of conflicts. Moreover, resource-induced civil conflict might also infect neighbouring countries (Murdoch and Sandler, 2002, 2004); therefore, resource inequality across ethnicities can contribute to explaining regional underdevelopment, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, by considering the intra-national spatial distribution of natural resources, we are confident that our study provides new insights into the economics of the resource curse.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related literature. Section 3 provides a theoretical model based on Hodler (2006), which we extend to the case of unequal resource distribution. Section 4 introduces the data that are used to test our main hypotheses. Section 5 concludes.","The geography of natural resources, ethnic inequality and civil conflicts",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018300399,10 February 2019,2019,Research Article,272.0
Bertola Giuseppe,"Università di Torino, CEPR, CESifo, Italy","Received 23 May 2018, Revised 14 December 2018, Accepted 15 January 2019, Available online 8 February 2019, Version of Record 29 August 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.01.004,Cited by (1),"This paper's model lets an international wedge continuously index a country's capital market integration with the rest of the world, and studies politico-economic determination of a domestic labor wedge that corrects market imperfections and/or redistributes welfare across differently wealthy voters. International integration influences the equilibrium policy, at given country-specific political and structural features, through the strength of factor price effects and through ownership of domestic and foreign capital by the country's citizens. If policy reduces market employment, then it unambiguously does so more strongly when a capital-poor country integrates more tightly with the rest of the world.","This paper characterizes politico-economic determination of policies that redistribute welfare across owners of production factors within and across a country's borders. Because international integration elicits more elastic market responses to uncoordinated policy-makers’ actions, standard race-to-the-bottom intuition suggests that it should trigger deregulation of national policies. Beggar-thy-neighbor motives to distort international factor prices are also relevant, however: race-to-the-bottom pressures can be more than offset by the policy's terms-of-trade implications if the country owns a sufficiently large portion of the integrated economy's immobile factor, and a large capital-poor country's representative agent might upon moving from autarky to full integration increase source-basis capital income tax rates (DePeter and Myers, 1994).====The paper's formal model studies these general issues with a specific focus on labor policy implications of capital market integration, motivated by the labor market evidence generated by Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe. Many models would predict that integration results in wage restraint, but this was not generally observed in EMU (Mikosch and Sturm, 2012), where there is only weak and uneven evidence of race-to-the-bottom effects (Bertola, 2016; 2017a).====The technical derivations extend those of Bertola (2016) and its references in two directions: country-specific policies may respond to domestic market inefficiencies as well as to redistributive motives, and proportional capital mobility costs make it possible to study the implications of gradual international integration. These features, and the results, are novel in an international policy competition literature that has focused mostly on policy choices by country-specific representative agents==== and almost exclusively on the comparisons of autarky and full integration extremes.==== Because the model's country is not infinitesimally small, its policy can influence equilibrium factor prices: how it does so in politico-economic equilibrium depends on ==== market imperfections and on the distributional motives of country-specific decisive individuals, and on the tightness on market integration. Intuitively, capital-poor decisive agents are inclined to reduce employment because this changes factor prices in their favor. Their ability and inclination to so depend on capital mobility's implications not only for the elasticity of labor demand, but also for foreign ownership of domestic capital stocks: foreigners are politically irrelevant in determining national policy, which more aggressively shifts income from capital to labor when more capital is foreign-owned. The latter effect may or may not overturn race-to-the-bottom predictions in comparisons of autarky with full integration, as in previous work. The present model's less extreme and arguably more realistic smooth variation of international integration has an implication that overturns race-to-the-bottom intuition for a case of practical interest: policy must more strongly reduce employment when a capital-importing country becomes more tightly integrated with the rest of the world.====Section 2 sets up a static economy where flexibly supplied labor is employed with complementary capital: Subsection 2.1 models capital market equilibrium when cross-border flows reduce capital productivity as in Samuelson's (1954) “iceberg” transport cost specification for trade in goods, used also by Martin and Rey (2000) to analyze the financial implications of international capital mobility; Subsection 2.2 characterizes the welfare implications for differently wealthy individuals of a wedge between labor's productivity and utility margins that represents market imperfections and policies, treated as exogenous in macroeconomics (Shimer, 2009) and endogenously determined in models that rule out compensatory lump-sum transfers and let distortions redistribute welfare across heterogeneous agents (Meltzer and Richards, 1981). Section 3 studies the interaction of politico-economic equilibrium policies and international integration. Subsection 3.1 characterizes policy in autarky, where it depends on ==== imperfections and on whether politically decisive agents are capital-poor within the country. Subsection 3.2 studies how the equilibrium depends on capital market integration. As both employment levels and capital flows vary continuously and endogenously with market integration, formal derivations are somewhat intricate, but deliver clear substantive results. If policy reduces employment below ==== in a capital-poor country, it unambiguously does so more strongly when integration becomes tighter. Market integration is likely to (but need not) imply race-to-the-bottom deregulation only if capital flows out of the country. Subsection 3.3 studies technical issues arising in the transition from autarky to non-zero capital flows and Subsection 3.4 discusses the results' relationship to those of models that, comparing only the limit cases of autarky and full integration, tend to overemphasize race-to-the-bottom deregulation implications. Section 4 concludes outlining briefly how the model and possible extensions may help interpret real-life interactions between national policy and international integration.","Wedges: Distribution, distortions, and market integration",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626801830226X,8 February 2019,2019,Research Article,273.0

Although novel, the methodology builds upon basic statistical structures, largely modern ==== type models, and it is carried out in open-source software. The methodology is motivated by the specific challenges of forecasting elections with the participation of new political parties, which is becoming increasingly common in the post-2008 European panorama. Our methodology is also particularly useful for the allocation of parliamentary seats, since the vast majority of available opinion polls predict at national level whereas seats are allocated at local level. We illustrate the advantages of our approach relative to recent competing approaches using the 2015 Spanish Congressional Election. In general, the predictions of our model outperform the alternative specifications, including hybrid models that combine fundamental and polls models. Our forecasts are, in relative terms, particularly accurate in predicting the seats obtained by each political party.","Forecasting in social sciences is a challenging endeavour. Probably one of the most challenging exercises in this respect is the forecasting of election results. Most of the literature on election forecasting, including its methodological underpinning, has focused on two-party political systems, a “winner-take-all” system for the Electoral College and democracies with a long history of past elections. Conversely, in this paper we develop a methodology most appropriate for elections with little historical data for some competing parties, including the case of parties entering the electoral competition for the first time. Seats are allocated under a D'Hondt system. The vast majority of available opinion polls predict at national level whereas the seats are allocated at local level.====The scientific approach to electoral forecasting relies mostly on four alternative methodologies: the statistical modelling approach based on fundamentals; the use of polls, either voting intention surveys or party sympathy surveys; the use of political prediction markets based on bets for the candidates; and a combination of other methods, sometimes referred to as hybrid models.==== The statistical modelling approach, also referred to as structural approach, consists of predicting election results from historical and socioeconomic data. An example is the simple “bread and peace” model of Hibbs (2008).==== In stable political systems it is known that national election votes are highly predictable from fundamentals==== while polls are highly variable but contain useful information, especially close to the election day. The aggregation of polls and the use of betting markets are further classical approaches to electoral forecasting. Recently there has been increasing interest in hybrid models which combine the outcomes of several methods. The most popular hybrid approach is the synthesis of a fundamental model and polls, e.g. Lewis-Beck (2005). Graefe (2015) averages the results of pollsters, prediction markets, experts (journalists and scholars) and quantitative models to produce a combined forecast for the 2013 German election.==== Lewis-Beck and Dassonneville (2016) and Lewis-Beck et al. (2016) present the canonical structure of this type of model. In this case the fundamental model is a regression on GDP and government popularity. This model is then synthesised with the median of polls, using a second regression, in order to predict the national level result.====Our methodology is also hybrid but it is tailored to situations where there is little historical data to apply existing hybrid methods. Moreover, elections are determined by seats won at local level, hence the national average is not that predictive of the party's representation in the parliament. A further reality particularly relevant to the European electoral landscape is that there is limited or no polling at local level. To put things in perspective, after the beginning of the financial crisis many new parties were created in European countries to capitalise on the discontent of voters with the policy reaction to the economic crisis. Dennison and Pardijs (2016) identify 45 “insurgent” parties in Europe, many of them just a few years old, that occupy the entire political spectrum, including the extremes. Insurgent parties held 1329 seats in 27 EU countries in 2016, which correspond to 18.3% of the total seats of their parliaments. The political landscape in Spain is complicated by the existence of numerous political parties with non-trivial representation in certain parts of the country (the so-called nationalist parties, e.g. in Catalonia or the Basque country), the fact that only a handful of elections have taken place since the restoration of democracy in the country in 1977 after decades of dictatorship, and that electoral polling is not as extensive as in older democracies (e.g. the USA or the UK). Moreover, as in most countries, polling is rarely available at higher spatial resolutions than national. However, by far the biggest challenge in the 2015 elections is that two new political parties ended up taking more than 30% of the parliamentary seats even though they had no political representation in the previous parliament. Accordingly, the Spanish case is a good example of the challenges of forecasting electoral outcomes with new parties' competition.====Our approach is to learn the national average for each party primarily from published polls and use a fundamental model to learn how this national average propagates down to local level. In order to compensate for the lack of historical data for some competing parties, we use a fundamental model of voting intention ==== on “deep” micro-data obtained in the form of pre-electoral surveys. In Spain, these are carried out by the government-sponsored research center CIS and allow us to estimate the relationship between geographical or demographic characteristics and voters’ choice. The downside of these data sets is that the sample size in some provinces is very low and that the sample might not be representative. We address these issues through post-stratification==== based on census data. This model is synthesised with a polls model, which computes weighted averages of published polls but, at the same time, corrects for potential sources of bias. These include house effects, the varying quality of polling methodologies, as well as time-trending that takes place as the election times approaches. Due to the lack of historical data the synthesis is not done by regression, but rather through a Bayesian evidence synthesis approach.====It is easiest to understand what that approach amounts to in the following way: the fundamental model produces simulations of local results for each party; these are transformed to local seats using D'Hondt method; the local results are aggregated at national level for each simulation; each of these simulations then receives a weight which corresponds to how close the implied national average is to the prediction of the polls model; then each implied national seat allocation is given the corresponding weight and weighted averages are computed to form predictions. We set up the fundamental model parameters so that the implied predictive distribution for the national average is fairly flat relative to that obtained from the polling model, hence the fundamental model is useful for learning how the national result propagates down to local level and for capturing correlations at that level.====Our approach has close links with recent work in election forecasting. Both the fundamental and the polling model are multilevel regression models. Park et al. (2004) use a multilevel regression model and post-stratification to obtain state level estimates from national polls.==== Lock and Gelman (2010) use a Bayesian model to obtain a combination of polls with forecasts from fundamentals. They merge a prior distribution, obtained from previous election results, with polls to generate a posterior distribution over the result in each state relative to the national popular vote.==== The objective of this procedure is not to produce a forecast for the national vote but to develop a methodology that separates the national vote from states’ relative positions. This can be very valuable for individual state forecasts.====The article is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the challenge of forecasting electoral results in the presence of emerging parties and the political developments leading to the Congressional Elections of 2015. The choice of this example does not compromise the general applicability of our methodology: one of the challenges in forecasting electoral results is related to the fact that the allocation of seats may be very different from the proportion of votes at national level. Section 3 describes our methodology, starting with the fundamental model. It also describes the polls model and the synthesis of the two models. Section 4 applies the methodology proposed in Section 3 to the Spanish Congressional Election of 2015. Section 5 contains an evaluation of the forecasting accuracy of our model compared with some alternative models recently proposed.

People care about these two features and they tend to be connected. I consider a contest in which the quantity and quality of output are rewarded. The output in the quality contest plays a dual role. It counts in the quality contest but it is also converted into quantity-equivalent output to obtain ==== remain unchanged.,"A contest is a game in which players compete over a prize or set of prizes by making irreversible outlays or expenditures. The seminal works by Tullock (1980) and Lazear and Rosen (1981) have resulted in a vibrant literature on contests (see, for example, Konrad, 2009; Vojnovic, 2016).====In this paper, I want to study an unexplored contest, what one may refer to as quantity-cum-quality contests. Let me give some examples. Leaders of a country may be ranked by their major or most enduring policies (quality of work) and also by their entire set of policies (quantity of work). In contests for professional recognition or prizes in academia, a scholar's success depends on the quantity (number) of publications and quality of publications (i.e., citations, rank or impact factor of journals, etc). In some universities, internal competitions over research chairs, course reductions, promotion, etc that are evaluated by committees of administrators and members, drawn from different fields, may focus more on quantity of publications than on quality of publications. In contrast, external academic awards, recognition, and reputation within a scholar's field tends to be evaluated by people within his/her field and is more likely to be influenced by the quality of publications. Sports teams are ranked by the quantity (number of competitions won) and also by the quality of competitions won. In European soccer, teams are ranked by the number of domestic league cups won and the number of European club championships won with the UEFA Champions league cup being the most prestigious. In the Olympics, countries and athletes are ranked by the number of gold medals (quality) won and the total number (quantity) of medals (i.e., gold, silver, bronze) won. In fact, whether total medals or only gold medals should be used is a subject of debate.==== And a gold medal in the 100 m race for men -- which comes with the accolade of “the world's fastest man” -- may have more weight than a gold medal in an 800 m race or triple jump.==== A world or Olympic record will carry even more weight. A musician's or novelist's work is judged by the number of albums or books written and also by the number of hits or bestsellers produced. Departments in a university may be ranked by quality of students (e.g., graduate student placements) and quantity of students (enrollment numbers). In film and television, actors may be ranked by the number of ==== (i.e., the Oscars) won and also by the total number of awards won.==== Some of these rankings need not be formal rankings because there is certainly an informal contest for recognition that human beings, as social beings, care about.====These contests would be trivial if the quantity contest and quality contest were separate. But they are not. By a quantity-cum-quality contest, I mean a contest with the following features: (i) There is a prize for quantity of output and a prize for quality of output, (ii) in the quantity contest, the quality of output is converted into quantity-equivalent output to obtain ==== quantity of output, but not vice-versa, and (iii) the unit cost of effort in the quality contest is higher than the unit cost of effort in quantity contest. I note that the rent-givers or contest-designers of quantity contests need not be the same as the rent-givers or contest-designers of quality contests. I return to this point in section 2.1.====In the preceding paragraph, it is the feature in (ii) that makes the quantity and quantity contests interlinked. Otherwise, they will be two separate contests. The feature in (ii) is captured in cases where publication in a prestigious journals is considered to be equivalent to, for example, two or more publications in a less prestigious journal. An Olympic gold medal may be equivalent to three bronze medals.====It is important to note that while output in the quality contest can be translated into equivalent units of output in the quantity contest, output in the quantity contest ==== be translated into quality-equivalent output. For example, five or ten books, none of which made it to a best-seller list, may not be equivalent to one book that made it to a best-seller list. At the 2017 meetings of the American Economic Association, Nobel laureates Robert Akerlof and James Heckman bemoaned the overemphasis on publishing in the top five journals,==== a phenomenon that the Roberto Serrano of Brown University has humorously dubbed ====. According to Serrano (2018), “Top5itis is a disease that currently affects the economics discipline. It refers to the obsession of the profession of academic economists with the so-called “top5 journals.” Heckman and Moktan (2018) refer to this obsession as the “tyranny of the top five”. Whether this obsession is detrimental to the Economics profession is not my focus. My point is that ==== may explain why many economists will not consider multiple publications in lower-tier journals to be equivalent to one publication in the so-called top-5 journals. In film and television, multiple ==== awards may not be seen as equivalent to an ==== (i.e., the Oscars).====It is obvious that in a quantity-cum-quality contest, the players have the opportunity to invest in two dimensions: quality and quantity. There are contests with multiple dimensions of efforts. An example is a contest with sabotage where the players can invest in both productive effort and destructive effort. These contests have been studied in Konrad (2000), Chen (2003), Kräkel (2007), Amegashie and Runkel (2007), and Amegashie (2012). There are also multiple dimensions of efforts in contests in which the players can engage in production and appropriation (theft) or in the defense of their properties (e.g., Hirshleifer, 1995; Skapedas and Syropoulous, 1997). Finally, Epstein and Hefeker (2003), Rai and Sarin (2009) and Arbatskaya and Mialon (2010, 2012) have studied contests with multiple dimensions of efforts, none of which is necessarily destructive (sabotage). Contests in which the prize is awarded by a committee and so the players direct their efforts toward multiple committee members also fall in this class of contests (see, for example, Amegashie, 2002; Congleton, 1984).====There is also a literature on selection or entry of participants into contests that is related to the present paper. In Lazear and Rosen (1981), Amegashie and Wu (2004), Azmat and Moller (2009, 2016), Edwin Leuven et al. (2011), Konrad and Kovenock (2012), Damiano et al. (2012), and Morgan et al. (2017), contestants can choose from a set of contests to participate in. However, unlike the contest in the present paper, the participants can only compete in one contest. A participant in this paper can compete in two contests.====Iluz and Sela (2018) study a model of two contests and two prizes. Effort in the first contest counts as effort in the second contest. While there are some similarities between this paper and Iluz and Sela (2018), some important differences remain. In their paper, efforts in the two contests take place sequentially while they take place simultaneously in this paper. They assume that effort in the first contest counts as one-for-one effort in the second contest. This is equivalent to ==== in my model, where ==== is the rate of transformation from effort in the quality contest to equivalent units in the quantity contest. In my model, I focus on ==== and look at the different effects of ==== on total efforts in the quality and quantity contests including the incentive effects of treating quality and quantity of output as the same. I also study an extension in which ==== is a random variable. They have two players while this paper has ==== players. Finally, I also consider budget constraints, incomplete information, and discuss different applications.====What I refer to as quantity contest may be referred to as a low-cost or low-quality contest and what I refer to as quality contest may be referred to as a high-cost or high-quality contest. But because output in the quality contest can be converted into quantity-equivalent output and added to output primarily intended for the quantity contest, I prefer to use quantity contest and quality contest. Serena (2017) has a paper titled “quality contests”. It is a model with only one contest. Naturally, his definition of quality contest is different from the definition in this paper. By “quality contest”, he means a contest in which the objective is the maximization of the expected effort of the winner.====The paper is organized as follows: the next section presents a model of a quantity-cum-quality contest with complete information and a single prize in each contest. It derives some results and discusses them. Section 2 considers some extensions: budget constraints and incomplete information.

We use a political economy model in which agents have the possibility to hide part of their earnings in order to avoid taxation and, where the public system is more efficient in providing annuitized pension benefits than the private sector. We show that in the absence of evasion costs, agents are indifferent to the tax rate level as they can always perfectly adapt compliance so as to face their preferred effective tax rate. There is unanimity in favour of the maximum tax rate and, the public pension system is found to be partially contributive in order to increase tax compliance and thus the resources collected. This, in turn, enables higher redistribution toward the worst-off agents. When evasion costs are introduced, perfect substitutability between compliance and taxation breaks down. At the majority-voting equilibrium, individuals at the bottom of the income distribution who are in favour of more redistribution, and those at the top who want to transfer more resources to the old age, form a coalition against middle-income agents, in favour of high tax rates. In addition to the previous ==== argument, the optimal level of the Bismarkian pillar is now chosen so as to account for political support.","Tax evasion is endemic in many countries, in particular in developing countries, which do not collect even half of what they should if taxpayers complied with the written letter of the law (Moore and Mascagni, 2014). For instance, according to the OECD, in sub-Saharan Africa, tax revenues correspond to less than a fifth of GDP and, at the same time, the cost of collection varies from 1==== to 4==== of that revenue.==== Many developing countries still face tax shares of GDP below 15====, which corresponds to the threshold level that would be reasonable for ensuring government functioning.==== In these countries, enforcement mechanisms are weak, tax-collecting authorities are held in low esteem, and courts may not enforce the law. In recent years, domestic revenue mobilization in developing countries has gained increasing prominence in the policy debate. This is due to several factors, including the potential benefits of taxation for state building, long-term independence from foreign assistance and the continuing acute financial needs of developing countries.====Plenty of specific solutions to how boosting compliance have been offered in the literature and public authorities have tried many more. Some of them consist in increasing and in focusing on better enforcement, in improving the collection and management of information, in reducing the costs of complying with the law, and in providing incentives for those who comply.==== The solution we explore in this paper consists in establishing a close link between the amount of taxes paid and the payments obtained in return. After all, if that link were perfect, there would be no problem of compliance and the tax would play the same role as any market price. Yet, in many countries, this link is often not perfect as the government is expected to provide public goods and redistribute income. This is the avenue of research this paper pursues.====The objective of our paper is therefore to focus on payroll taxation and to study how a government who wishes to redistribute resources inside the economy should design the pension system when it faces contribution evasion and political restrictions on the tax rate. Here, individuals receive public pension benefits which depend (imperfectly) on their earlier tax payments. These benefits are essential to the individuals' welfare but have imperfect substitutes in the private sector. For instance, even in developed economies, the private annuity market is thin and faces important loading costs. It is therefore in the agents' own interest to contribute to the public pension system.====We assume a two-period model in which individuals work in the first period and retire in the second one. In the first period, they choose how much income to report to fiscal authorities and pay taxes based on this reported amount. This, in turn, finances the public pension system. In the first part of the model, we assume that evading income is done at no cost so that there is a priori no reason not to do so if the government imperfectly observes income or lacks coercive measures to make individuals report it truthfully. Individuals further allocate disposable income between current consumption and private saving. The second period is uncertain as we assume that survival is random. If they survive, individuals use their private saving and the pension benefit for consumption. As in Casamatta et al. (2000a, b), the pension benefit depends on two components. The first component is proportional to ==== labor income; the factor of proportionality is called the Bismarkian factor. The second one, the Beveridgian part, is common to all individuals and depends on average tax collection. This component allows for intra-generational redistribution. We also assume that there is a probability that the government defaults and is not able to pay the pensions for which agents previously contributed. If so, contributions are lost and disappear from the economy. The tax rate is decided by majority-voting while the Bismarkian factor is set at the constitutional level, behind the veil of ignorance, and prior to any votmajority-voting equilibriume on the tax rate. Following Rawls and its ==== (1971), the social welfare criterion consists then in giving priority to the worst-off agent. In the last part of the paper, we extend our model to allow for the existence of (moral or psychological) costs of compliance and show how our results are modified.====Before going further, let us explain our choice of the political structure. First, one could have assumed that the Bismarkian factor, like the tax rate, is chosen by majority-voting. As it becomes clear later with the model, if the median voter has a low income and receives only the flat pension benefit, this does not change our results. One could also argue that the redistributivity of the pension system is a characteristic which results from countries specific traditions and culture regarding the role of public institutions. For this reason, it seems rather difficult to overturn it in the short run, contrary to the contribution rate which is more subject to fluctuations across time and to political cycles.==== Second, one could have chosen a different social objective such as for instance, the Utilitarian one. We derive only the Rawlsian solution which is a special case of the Utilitarian one where the individual with minimum income is given priority. In this special case, the redistributive motive is maximum and our results are “biased” toward the highest level of redistribution, which may discourage compliance the most, at least for richer individuals.====We obtain the following results. A necessary condition for agents to report some income is that the marginal return from public pensions is greater than that of the private annuity market. Even though the no-evasion-cost assumption “biases” our results toward minimum participation to the fiscal system, we find that agents comply with the tax system at a rate which is increasing in their income. Interestingly, choosing how much income to report or choosing the tax rate level are perfectly equivalent decisions: if the tax rate increases, agents perfectly adapt their compliance rate so as to pay the exact same amount of taxes. Hence, at the majority-voting equilibrium, there is unanimity in favour of the maximum tax rate. The reasons are twofold. First, because of perfect substitutability between taxation and compliance, the flat (Beveridgian) part of the pension benefit is increasing in the tax rate so that every agent wants the maximum of that benefit. Second, agents with high income prefer to use the more efficient pension system (rather than the private annuity market) to transfer resources to the old age. At the last constitutional stage, the level of redistribution is chosen so as to maximise the utility of the poorest agent and the Bismarkian factor is optimally set at a level that is higher than the marginal return from savings. The reason for a contributive pension system is therefore directly related to a tax base increase argument: a pension system with a contributory part makes the agents willing to report more income. This, in turn, increases the resources available for redistribution (through the flat pension benefit) and, as such it ensures the highest possible level of utility to the worst-off individual.====With a moral cost of evasion, our main results are preserved. Yet, the presence of an evasion cost breaks down perfect substitutability between the tax rate and the compliance rate so that the agent's preferred tax rate now depends on his income. Agents at the bottom of the income distribution, may partially comply with the tax system but are in favour of a positive tax rate which is decreasing in income. For them, the main reason for a pension system is to benefit from intra-generational redistribution. To the opposite, agents with higher income, who already fully comply, want a positive tax rate so as to transfer more resources to the second period. Their preferred tax rate is now increasing in income. Consequently, we obtain an ends-against-the-middle voting equilibrium, where poor agents form a coalition with high-income agents against middle-income agents, for implementing high tax rates. Finally, at the constitutional stage, the Bismarkian factor is likely to remain high. First, increasing the degree of contributiveness leads individuals to comply more, which in turn increases the tax base and income redistribution. Second, as in Casamatta et al. (2000a), a tighter link between contributions and pension benefits may increase the political support for the pension system.====All in all, independently of whether evasion entails individual costs, giving the possibility to individuals to participate in a contributory pension system increases compliance and the overall welfare of the society. This may even be more relevant in developing countries where the financial sector is usually under-developed (for instance, annuity markets are absents and loading costs are high) and, the provision of pensions by the public may be more efficient.====Our paper can be related to at least two strands of the literature. First, there is a well-known theoretical literature on tax evasion and on how tax compliance varies with income, risk aversion, fiscal instruments, enforcement parameters and social norms (see Allingham and Sandmo, 1972; Yitzhaki, 1974; Cowell and Gordon, 1988; Gordon, 1989; Myles and Naylor, 1996). Also, related to our paper, Baumann et al. (2009) studies contribution evasion in unemployment insurance programs, in an Allingham and Sandmo (1972) framework.==== These papers assume a probability of auditing and a penalty rate in case of detection and, sometimes a cost of non-compliance. To the contrary, we assume away auditing but model instead a moral cost of under-reporting as in Gordon (1989) as well as uncertainty in the provision of the pension benefits. Such a modelling is relevant in particular for countries where tax enforcement mechanisms are weak and the political risk is high.====Second, our paper can be related to the political economy literature on tax evasion. For instance, Borck (2004, 2009) study political economy models in which agents can evade income.==== Appart from the questions raised (how stricter enforcement policies may actually increase tax evasion, or how redistribution is impacted by evasion), these papers differ from ours in several other respects. First, agents are risk neutral so that they either avoid all income or none of it. This seems rather restrictive as in general, evasion is not an “all or nothing decision”. Second, it assumes that agents get a uniform transfer from their contributions while we model a contribution-related pension system. Third, the only motive for taxation is redistribution and there is no consumption smoothing motive as in our model. Traxler (2012) also looks at the efficiency effect of tax avoidance when the tax rate is chosen by a majority of taxpayers. The main finding is that the traditional inefficiency carried by majority voting decreases with the extent of tax avoidance. Alm et al. (1999) also briefly discuss a political economy model with risk-neutral agents where the presence of a social norm influences agents' tax compliance and thus, their voting behaviour over an increase in the tax rate, in the fine and in the probability of detection. This model is different from ours at least in three dimensions: agents either fully comply or not at all, they receive a lump sum benefit and, individuals' heterogeneity arises from differences in the psychological loss from not complying. Finally, Kopczuk (2001) studies an optimal income taxation scheme when agents have different tax avoidance behaviour, either because of different preferences for avoidance or because of different avoidance cost functions. This is different from our paper because first, it is normative and second, in our model agents differ in income only. In addition, none of these models consider the possibility of government default as we do. To our knowledge, our paper is one of the few political economy papers which studies the interaction between tax compliance and the existence of a pension system and, how the latter helps reducing inefficiencies related to income under-reporting, even when evasion can be done at no cost.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the model. Section 3 presents individuals' decisions in terms of compliance and private savings for given levels of the policy instruments. In Section 4, we derive individuals' preferred tax rate and the majority-voting equilibrium. In Section 5, we find the constitutional level of the Bismarkian factor. Section 6 extends our model to allow for compliance costs.

Does international travel promote institutional change in a traveler's home country? This paper uses panel data from 149 countries to test the hypothesis of institutional change stemming from international travel. We generally find that foreign travel does not affect political institutions. In one sub-sample, we find limited evidence that international travel can be a determinant of institutional quality in the home country depending upon whether the home country is an autocracy or democracy.","People travel outside their national borders for a variety of reasons including vacation, business, academic, religious work, performing athletic or artistic work, and medical treatment. These travelers are exposed to foreign influences, foreign ideas, and foreign institutions; does this exposure help them improve institutions in their home countries? In order to explore the statistical relationship between institutions and temporary cross-border travel, this study follows previous research and features an institutional quality index as a dependent variable.==== We use the well-known Polity IV index as a primary dependent variable.====Our baseline specification follows Spilimbergo (2009), who finds that foreign-educated students foster democracy in their home countries, and include three main explanatory variables in the model: international travel as a share of the population, average institutions in host countries, and an interaction term between the two. The average institutions in host countries variable captures the idea that travelers experience different types of institutions in different countries, and hence bring back different institutional knowledge from abroad. For example, an international traveler experiences different types of institutions in Saudi Arabia than in the U.S. The interaction term shows whether the marginal effect of international travel depends on the institutional quality in the host countries.====Our results further expand on the insights of Spilimbergo (2009), who only focused on the role of foreign education in home country institutions. While foreign education is comparable to foreign travel, it is also distinct in meaningful ways. These distinctions point in opposite directions, indicating that the role of foreign travel on home country institutions may be an empirical issue. Thus, it can be argued that foreign travel may be more or less important than foreign education.====The first argument in favor of foreign travel is that most people travel to other countries for non-academic reasons. We might, therefore, expect that non-academic international travelers might have a more significant effect on their home country institutions given that they comprise a larger share of the home country population. Second, the majority of international students belong to the elite of their country (Spilimbergo, 2009); they may be more interested in the status quo in their home countries due to the political and economic rents that the elite accrue from the status quo (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000). Ordinary citizens might have more to gain from improving political institutions; so they are more likely to foster reforms that they observed traveling abroad.====One reason foreign travel might be less critical than foreign education is that students spend most of their time on campus in an academic environment, and are likely to encounter situations where the divergence between political institutions in their host and the home country becomes apparent. Higher education is transformative in a way that foreign travel is not. Ordinary citizens, however, travel to other countries for personal and business reasons and are thus less likely to have more direct interaction or discussion regarding host country political institutions. A second and perhaps most important reason why international travel might not lead to a substantial institutional change is the element of time. The dataset on international tertiary level students contains students who cross national borders to study outside their country of citizenship for more than a year. Most of the international travel is for much shorter periods. Our international travel dataset contains data for international travelers who stayed in another country for less than a year, with many visits being for very short periods of time. These short visits may not expose travelers to the true nature of political institutions in the host country.====International travel is likely to be endogenous in the model. Countries with a higher institutional quality may show a higher travel intensity due to reasons unrelated to institutions. To deal with this endogeneity, we employ several instrumental variables for international travel. Our first and preferred instrumental variable is constructed by estimating a bilateral travel gravity equation that contains bilateral geographic factors. We chose instrumental variables based on the likelihood of a direct effect of these geographic factors on institutional quality.==== Our second instrumental variable set contains data on natural disasters. Natural disasters in the host country are exogenous and hurt travel towards that host country. The estimated values of the bilateral travel equation are then summed up to calculate aggregate predicted travel values and used as instrumental variables for international travel. In using a bilateral travel equation as an instrumental variable for the international flows of people, we are following the work of Andersen and Dalgaard (2011) based on Alcalá and Ciccone (2004).====We use an unbalanced panel of 149 countries and data for the years 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 to estimate the relationship between institutions and international travel. To preview our results, our dynamic panel estimates in the OLS, IV, and system GMM settings show that institutions are persistent over time. Concerning the hypothesis that international travel flows are a determinant of institutional quality in the country of origin, we find very little evidence that international travel leads to an improvement in home country political institutions. Moreover, we find no evidence for any effect of international travel on home country political institutions in OLS, GMM, and IV settings using natural disasters as an instrumental variable.====The only evidence we do find is in our IV estimation that uses bilateral geographic factors as instrumental variables in the first stage. In those specifications, we find limited evidence that international travel has different marginal effects on home country institutions depending upon the level of institutional quality in the home country and the average institutions in the host countries. We find that for autocracies, travel has a positive marginal effect as long as the countries being visited have weak institutions. When citizens of an autocracy visit countries with high-quality political institutions, the marginal effect on home political institutions is adverse.====To the extent that our instrumental variable strategy, in this case, is plausible, our intuition behind this result is that travel to other low institutional quality countries tends to lead to incremental reforms that lead to improving political institutions but do not threaten those in power. When citizens of autocracies visit countries with high levels of institutional quality, their experiences can lead to a desire for significant reforms in political institutions that are viewed as a threat to the current status quo. In these cases, travel can lead to a crackdown on civil and political liberties that lowers institutional quality.====For democracies, we find the opposite effect. The marginal effect of citizen travel for democracies is negative for most of the range of institutional quality in host countries. Only when citizens of a democracy visit the most democratic countries on average does the marginal effect become positive. Our intuition for this result is that when citizens from democracies travel to countries with weak political institutions, they tend to visit the most developed and tourism-oriented portions of the country. In these settings, the average traveler receives a distorted view of the importance of political institutions. A visitor to Dubai would experience an extraordinarily prosperous and modern city. To most tourists from mature democracies, their experience would not tell them much about the political institutions of the United Arab Emirates except that democratic institutions were not necessary to achieve this level of affluence. To the extent that citizen commitments to democracy are pragmatic rather than ideological, travel to autocracies and anocracies can change citizen views about the appropriate form and bounds of government.====Our paper adds to the literature on the effects of international flows of people on home country institutions. Earlier research primarily focuses on the impact of emigration on development and democracy in the country of origin. Spilimbergo (2009) is an exception as he analyzes the effects of foreign-educated individuals on the level of democracy in the home country. However, Spilimbergo (2009) focuses on a specific group of cross-border travelers, tertiary level international students. Here we look at ==== international travelers who stayed in another country for less than a year. In addition to the literature on student flows, our paper relates to two other important topics in the institutional literature. First, our paper relates to the literature exploring the relationship between migration and home country institutions. Second, our work relates to an empirical literature on the determinants of political and economic institutions (Boockmann and Dreher, 2003; De Haan and Sturm, 2003; Kalyvitis and Vlachaki, 2012; Rode and Gwartney, 2012; Dutta et al., 2013; Bjørnskov and Kurrild-Klitgaard, 2014; Young and Sheehan, 2014; Leibrecht and Pitlik, 2015; Askarov and Doucouliagos, 2015).",International flows of people and institutional change,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017302148,4 January 2019,2019,Research Article,277.0

The empirical results show robust evidence that perceived inequality, not actual inequality, is significantly associated with redistributive preferences, while preferences for redistribution do not translate into any type of redistribution.","Is Robin Hood, a heroic outlaw who robs from the rich to give to the poor, reappearing in modern democracies? If so, does his band exert more power in a more unequal society? Put differently, does a government, portrayed as the popular folk figure above, play an active role in redistributing economic resources to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor? Are redistributive efforts increasing as the gap is widening? In recent decades, these questions have been at the heart of the politics of inequality and redistribution, but there have been no clear-cut answers to them so far. Many political economists have tried to solve the puzzle of redistribution under the assumption that actual reality straightforwardly translates into its perception and then interacts with other structural factors, following a materialist approach. However, well-known facts in psychology have recently secured attention in the study of inequality: First, there is a mismatch between actual reality and its perception; second, the perceptual world rather than the real world dictates people's attitudes or behaviours. These evident facts have long been ignored in exploring the dynamics of inequality and redistribution.====This article revisits the classical redistribution theory and provides empirical evidence that does not support the standard theory. The long-standing redistribution hypothesis,==== derived from the Meltzer and Richard (1981) model, assumes a close association between actual economic inequality and redistribution. This theory presupposes that increasing market inequality leads to more demand for redistribution, thereby resulting in more redistribution; however, the posited mechanism that support for redistribution links inequality to redistribution has not been fully clarified or explored in previous studies. To test this redistribution theory, many studies have simply examined the effect of market inequality on redistribution without taking the mechanism into account. By contrast, this paper investigates the role of redistributive preferences in connecting inequality and redistribution. Besides, research in the field of inequality has produced substantial evidence that perceived inequality is clearly distinguishable from actual inequality and that the former, rather than the latter, plays a decisive role in shaping attitudes towards redistribution.====The primary research question of this paper is whether or not the standard model of redistribution is supported when redistributive preferences are considered as an intervening factor between actual or perceived inequality and redistribution at the country level. To answer this question, one of the critical things is to develop a more valid and reliable measure of perceived inequality than previous ones, which is comparable to actual inequality in a country. Thus, for this inquiry, the perceived Gini, short for the Gini coefficient based on the distribution of perceived social position, was constructed. The results of a country-level analysis show that, first, perceived inequality rather than actual inequality significantly affects redistributive preferences; second, the impact of redistributive preferences on redistribution is negligible. Accordingly, provided that public support for redistribution is considered as a linking mechanism between inequality and redistribution, it can be argued that the traditional redistribution theory should be completely reconsidered.====In the remainder of this paper, the classical redistribution hypothesis is redefined with the explicit role of redistributive preferences, and the importance of perceived inequality is discussed in relation to preferences for redistribution in more detail. The alternative redistribution hypotheses incorporating perceived inequality and redistributive preferences are then developed. The limitations of existing measures of perceived inequality are also discussed, and the perceived Gini is presented. The findings of the empirical analyses, using an instrumental variables approach, are provided, and then remaining issues are discussed.",Revisiting the redistribution hypothesis with perceived inequality and redistributive preferences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017305773,3 January 2019,2019,Research Article,278.0

These short-term political preferences are likely to be influenced by external factors, such as media reporting. Moreover, as the majority of the voter receive their information on political parties and politicians through the media, we expect a strong impact of media reporting on the decision-making process and thereby on voting intentions of individuals. If media would provide comprehensive and unbiased information about political parties and politicians, this would be rather unproblematic. Media would play their role as information channel in democracies and voter would decide on the basis of this information.

As media coverage may not only affect the political preferences of voters, but also be generally affected by the current political mood among the electorate, it is likely that our regressions suffer from endogeneity. On the one hand, the political preferences of media consumers could affect the coverage of the specific media outlets they consume. For instance, this would hold if a media outlet reacts to the moods of their recipients. In this case, the analysis is likely to suffer from endogeneity in terms of reverse causality. On the other hand, in the case that the media react to general political sentiments, this would result in endogeneity in terms of an omitted variable bias.

At the same time, the quality of elections has deteriorated over time: while the share of elections reported to be illicitly influenced was around 15% of around 180 national level elections during the period 1980–1990, it increased to almost 40% of around 480 elections in the period 2001–2010.====In this paper we investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the effects of electoral fraud on voter turnout. Our objective is twofold. First, high turnout rate is often quoted as an indirect indicator of properly organized and conducted elections. We thus provide first evidence on whether a lower participation rate is effectively associated with a higher degree of fraudulent intervention in the elections. Second, our experimental design enables us to test whether the behavioural reaction to an electoral procedure that is considered unfair also affects voter participation. Citizens may shy away from voting when the election is characterized by a fraudulent mechanism or, alternatively, they may be rather more likely to mobilize and go to the polls in order to counteract it.====Evidence of electoral fraud has been provided worldwide, both in developed and in developing countries. Weak electoral identity-checking schemes were responsible for at least 42 convictions for electoral fraud in the UK in the period 2000–2007 (Wilks-Heeg, 2008) and for promoting electoral fraud in Japanese municipal elections, as shown by the natural experiment by Fukumoto and Horiuchi (2011). News reports, highlighting the risk of voter fraud in several EU countries,==== have become a fairly routine part of electoral campaigns. Douglas (2013) examines the multiplicity of election contest provisions and the procedural mechanism used to manage them in US states: the notorious hanging chads in 2000 in Florida is an example of the US not being immune to (potential) electoral malpractices. While in developing countries electoral fraud is usually more evident and takes a wider variety of forms, from vote buying to intimidation and explicit violence, in the post-Soviet area the most common electoral malpractices are multiple voting and ballot stuffing, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (Bader, 2012).====In order to theoretically investigate the effects of fraud on voter turnout, we modify the conventional binary election model with costly voting to allow for fraud, where illicit intervention is promoted by only one out of two parties. Assuming that the implementation of fraud is costly (hence limited) we show that, in equilibrium, fraud might increase the turnout rate. In particular, a low level of fraud exerted in favour of the competitor with the ex-ante less support should increase turnout in both groups, whereas a higher fraudulent intervention should suppress voting motives and decrease the turnout rates to a level lower than in equilibrium without fraud.====We test our predictions in a laboratory experiment, where we compare voting behaviour in a baseline condition with respect to a situation where, respectively, a low and a high level of fraud is introduced in the elections. The baseline condition is designed in a way that allows direct comparisons with the paper by Levine and Palfrey (2007). In their laboratory experiment, they test for the effect of changing the (relative and absolute) size of the electorate of two competing groups of supporters on voter turnout: while a more numerous electorate lowers turnout rate, having closer elections increases it. Finally, they show that voters supporting the less popular alternative have higher turnout rates. We thus provide an additional validity test for their results. However, in order to analyse the effect of fraud on voting behaviour, we also introduce fraud in the elections. We investigate voters' reaction to an unfair electoral process in a framework involving a decreasing (increasing) quality of elections, where voters experience an electoral system which progressively evolves from a situation of electoral integrity (fraud) to electoral fraud (integrity).====We first investigate how individuals react to uneven ex-ante conditions when choosing between two featureless options standing for voting and abstention. In the ==== treatment, the wording in the instructions is designed to induce a neutral environment; there is no mention of voting, electoral fraud or voting costs. More specifically, in the experiment, electoral fraud is introduced by adding a number of “fake” votes in favour of the minority group.====We then examine the importance of social and psychological factors in affecting voting behaviour.==== In the Framing treatment the only modification is made with respect to the terminology used in the instructions: we explicitly refer to elections and we render the unfairness of the uneven condition more salient, by explicitly referring to “vote rigging”.====The experiment provides a number of noteworthy results. First, the comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions reveals over-voting (analogous results were obtained by Levine and Palfrey (2007)). Second, as expected, limited fraudulent intervention increases the turnout and this result is observed both in the Neutral and Framing treatment. Third, extensive fraud has a significant negative impact on turnout rates, as suggested by the theoretical model, merely in the Neutral treatment, but still turnout is higher than when electoral integrity is fully assured. Fourth, in the Framing treatment, the majority group, against which the fraud is undertaken, responds with significantly higher participation in the extensive ballot box stuffing case. However this evidence is not always confirmed when limiting the analysis to a setting characterized by a decreasing, rather than an increasing, quality of electoral integrity. This suggests that the timing of (extensive) electoral fraud might play a role in affecting voters' behaviour. The observed differences between the Framing and Neutral treatments suggest that voting behaviour cannot be solely explained by the (in)ability of agents to correctly infer their expected pay-offs when deciding to vote or to abstain. In this paper we provide evidence of behavioural aspects that cannot be disregarded when considering voting in a fraudulent environment.",Electoral fraud and voter turnout: An experimental study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018301496,18 December 2018,2018,Research Article,280.0

Yet economists have been relatively slow, amongst social scientists, to engage this growing area. Even so, a number of economists have made significant contributions to the study of well-being and happiness especially regarding the role of institutions in generating happiness (Bjørnskov et al., 2010; Frey and Stutzer, 2000a, 2002; Helliwell, 2003; Inglehart et al., 2008; Jackson, 2017 Veenhoven, 2000). A recent issue of the European Journal of Political Economy, dedicated to the legacy of Douglas North, was devoted to the topic of institutions and well-being (Bennet et al., 2016). The economics literature (Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2005; Frey and Stutzer, 2000b, 2010; Gabe and Silva, 2011; Wassmer et al., 2009) has also joined the political science (Alvarez-Diaz et al., 2010; Pierce et al., 2016; Radcliff, 2001) and psychology (Bixter, 2015; Napier and Jost, 2008; Schlenker et al., 2012) literature in contributing to an understanding of the role of politics in happiness. This paper empirically examines the effect of party politics, partisanship, and extreme ideology on reported happiness.====This paper deepens our understanding of the role of politics in creating happiness with a focus on the role of party politics and ideology. Using US data from the General Social Survey (GSS) from 1972 to 2010, this study is able to distinguish the effect on happiness of party and ideology at national and state levels. This paper makes an improvement to the contribution of Gabe and Silva (2011) by incorporating necessary geographic information into the empirical specification. Interestingly, with the same data and better geographic controls, the conclusions of Gabe and Silva (2011) were found to be incorrect. Results show that the congruence between the political party of an individual and the political affiliations of those holding political office at the state level have little impact on reported happiness. Conversely, political congruence at the national level, and most pronounced at the presidential level, has a big impact on reported happiness. In particular, having a president of the same party as an individual results in greater reported happiness. However, it is revealed that this experience is different for republicans and democrats. For republicans the effect of a republican president is positive but for democrats the effect of having a democratic president is negative. This paper is the first to compare the effect of party congruence at different tiers of US government demonstrating that presidential party congruence with the individual has the largest impact on individual happiness.====While these results add to our knowledge of the relative importance of presidential politics, the most striking results in the study have to do with individual political attitudes. In general, it is found that republicans report higher happiness than democrats consistent with previous results (Bixter, 2015; Carroll, 2007; Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2005; Napier and Jost, 2008; Taylor et al., 2006). Further, respondents that report having more extreme political views, that is extremely liberal or extremely conservative, are more likely to report higher happiness levels than those with moderate views. This is consistent with the previous results of Curini et al. (2014) who demonstrated a similar result using international data from the World Values Survey (WVS). This can lead to a bleak description of political discourse as people are increasingly isolated in the echo chamber of social media and apparently more happy to do so.====The remainder of this paper is organized in following manner.

Mayoral candidates establish coalitions with political parties represented on councils in the run-up to popular elections as a signaling device to voters to maximize election vote shares, and to potentially facilitate execution of their political and policy agendas post-election. On the other hand, a substantial body of research shows that political parties are often motivated by rent-seeking to join coalitions: parties make themselves available to the highest candidate-bidder and would-be mayors and their financial backers pay those parties to join their coalitions. Coalition formation at the local level in Indonesia is an integral part of the pervasive phenomenon of “money politics” that exists in the country (Vel, 2005; Mietzner, 2007; Buehler and Tan, 2007; Choi, 2007; Aspinall, 2013).====Party motivations for joining pre-electoral coalitions (PECs) in Indonesia differ substantially from those identified in the literature. In parliamentary systems, research has consistently shown that political parties are encouraged to join PECs as a function of both the desire to influence policy and to gain office (e.g. cabinet appointments) (Golder, 2005, 2006a, 2006b; Bandyopadhyay and Oak, 2008; and Shin, 2018). These motivations are, in turn, based on a judgement by parties comprising PECs that they are likely be involved in government formation post-election (Martin and Stevenson, 2001; Golder, 2006a; Carroll and Cox, 2007). The belief seems reasonably well-founded. Debus (2009), for example, has demonstrated that pre-electoral alliances significantly influence post-election government formation in parliamentary systems in Europe.====In multi-party presidential systems, executive candidate agreements established with potential political party PEC partners are often argued to lack credibility (Mainwaring and Shugart, 1997). The unreliability of executive candidates’ promises dampens office incentives for parties to form pre-election alliances. Policy motivations may still be important, however, if policy agreements among executive candidate-political party coalition partners are made public during the campaign (Kellam, 2017). Untenable commitments notwithstanding, some largely descriptive evidence suggests that presidential PECs often precede the formation of governing coalitions (Mainwaring and Scully, 1997). More analytically, Freudenreich (2016) has shown that government formation in Latin American presidential systems is largely a function of pre-election agreements made between executive candidates and political parties in the legislature.====We assume here that coalitions established prior to elections have some role in governing after elections. Case study research in Indonesia suggests that this is indeed the case, at least some of the time (Buehler and Tan, 2007; Tans, 2012). Alternatively, this study can be interpreted as a test of the hypothesis that local election coalitions matter for decision-making, post-election.====We make a second assumption related to how local legislative decisions are made. Unlike in many legislatures around the world, decision-making in both national and local parliaments in Indonesia is based on deliberation and consensus (====) and not vote-taking. Sherlock (2012) argues that in the Indonesian national parliament, consensus is essentially an agreement among party leaders. In this study, we assume that consensus in local parliament is driven by political party leaders in the coalition and that majority status of the coalition facilitates consensus. This position is consistent with recent research by Tans (2012) who notes that the most effective local governments in Indonesia are those that secure a majority in the local council. We test the assumption that council majorities matter later in the analysis.====The investigation finds that majority coalitions cause a shift in local government spending towards health sector activities and induce improvements in citizen access to health services—but only during the first year or two of the post-election period, after which the positive effects disappear. The finding that local governments with majority coalitions initially shift their focus to health spending and service delivery is consistent with recent qualitative case study research that argues that decentralized democracy in Indonesia has encouraged local governments to concentrate on healthcare policy to satisfy voter demands (Aspinall, 2013).====On the other hand, our study demonstrates that budget fraud and abuse start to become problematic in the last two years of majority coalitions’ lives. Majority coalition support for the health spending and service agenda dissipates quickly, as attention turns to corrupting the budget, via increased infrastructure outlays and associated rent-seeking.==== We hypothesize that budget fraud serves, in part, to finance subsequent rounds of local parliamentary and executive elections.====This paper makes three contributions to the literature on the determination and consequences of majority coalitions. First, to the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to empirically examine the impact of local coalitions on corruption. Second, the analysis here also appears to be the first to investigate the temporal effects of local majority coalitions on outcomes of any kind. Third, this examination contributes in a more general way to the political economy literature on the effectiveness of decentralized institutions in delivering sound local public finance and governance outcomes (Bardhan, 2002; Zhang et al., 2004; Enikolopov and Zhuravskaya, 2007; Martinez-Bravo et al., 2011; Nye et al., 2014; Gonschorek et al., 2018).====The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, some background on fiscal and political decentralization and coalition building in Indonesia is provided. Second, the data and identification strategy used in the study are discussed. Third, the causal impact of majority coalitions on local government spending, service access, and corruption is examined. Fourth, the robustness of the empirical results is tested. Fifth, public finance and governance effects of majority coalitions over time are explored.

A growing literature both in economics and political science recognizes that political competition improves governments' efficiency and economic outcomes. See, for example: Stigler (1972), and Wittman (1989, 1995) on the effect of political competition on governments' efficiency; Besley et al. (2010) on political competition and economic growth; Galasso and Nannicini (2011), Gagliarducci et al. (2011), and Merlo et al. (2008) on political competition and candidate performance. The common denominator of all these studies is that when candidates face strong political competition, voters are better able to hold them accountable; this, in turn, reduces rent diversion and induces candidates to exert more effort.====In this paper we suggest an alternative story: stronger electoral competition does not necessarily imply better political accountability. When electoral competition is stronger, politicians also have stronger incentives to weaken accountability channels. We concentrate our analysis on one aspect of public policy that is commonplace in most countries: governments' ability to finance public expenditures via multiple tax instruments. This feature plays an important role in shaping local public finance because it leaves to the discretion of politicians not only the level of taxation, but also the tax mix across the available instruments. Our work examines the different degree of salience of the available revenue sources for municipalities.====The public finance literature has extensively explored government decision making in determining the mix of taxes that will be used. Hettich and Winer (1984, 1988), for example, claim that a vote-maximizing government sets taxes such that in equilibrium the marginal political cost of each tax instrument is equalized. This is confirmed by a number of empirical papers (among others Ashworth et al., 2005, who look at the issue of tax innovation). Our analysis contributes to this literature, providing an in-depth explanation of the origins of these political costs, and their relationships with electoral competition and political accountability. In particular, we claim that political costs are better understood under the concept of tax salience. Chetty, Looney, and Kroft (2009) show how voters are likely to underestimate their aggregate tax burdens from tax instruments (such as sale taxes or indirect taxes in general) that are paid in small amounts over time, compared to tax instruments for which taxpayers make lump-sum payments of their aggregate tax liabilities on an annual basis (such as property or income taxes).====Our conjecture is that stronger electoral competition pushes incumbent policymakers to substitute more salient taxes with the less salient ones with detrimental effects on the transparency of fiscal policy and electoral accountability. To address this issue, we develop a simple political agency model based on Dixit and Londregan (1998) and Bracco et al. (2015). The model verifies and refines our intuitions regarding the loss of tax salience in politically competitive environments. We model the behavior of an incumbent local policymaker (a mayor), who is responsible for providing a local public good, and has the power to make decisions regarding its funding. Two different policy instruments to collect fiscal revenue are available, each differing in their degree of salience. When elections take place, voters base their decisions both on economic grounds and on ideology.====We then bring our theoretical predictions to the data, building a large dataset on Italian local elections and taxes for the period from 1999 to 2008. Italian municipalities derive their main tax revenues from a property tax (denoted ICI),==== but they also heavily rely on many other sources of revenues, such as waste-management taxes, personal income surtaxes, and a vast array of fees and charges.====A small but important literature has singled out property taxes as a highly salient tax (see, for example, Cabral and Hoxby, 2010). Taxpayers often perceive this tax as an unfair burden on a necessity (the home in which they live). In Italy, the focus of our empirical analysis, the municipal real-estate tax is often at the forefront of the debate in mayoral and general elections, while other taxes and smaller charges and fees play a much more peripheral role in manifestos. At the same time, however, policy debate in Italy has also highlighted the excessive number of taxes and fees, and the inefficiency stemming from this.====Taxes, such as the municipal property tax, are paid in one or two lump sums; by contrast, other government charges and fees are collected at the point of service in small increments throughout the fiscal year. Voters perceive the role the mayor plays in setting “visible” taxes, but they often lack understanding of how much leverage and freedom a mayor has in setting government fees and charges. Variations in these fees are often driven by revenue concerns, rather than by variations in the costs of provision of services.==== Taxing properties is widely recognized as one of the most efficient and least distorting ways for governments to raise money. Because of the immobility of the tax base, property taxes constitute a stable source of revenue, less prone to cyclical swings, easy to calculate and hard to avoid; property taxes are particularly suitable for local governments (see, for example, Norregaard, 2013, and Oates, 1999, 2001). A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2010) has established that property taxes are the least distortive tax instrument in terms of reducing long-run GDP per capita.====In our empirical analysis, we first focus on determining which sources of revenues are and are not salient. We then estimate an equation examining the interaction between mayors' popularity and the types of revenue sources he or she uses. We find that the probability of a mayor's re-election depends (negatively) on the extent of the property tax, but not on the other sources of revenue, such as fees and charges. We take this as a test for the degree of salience of the various fiscal instruments available to Italian local policymakers.====We then proceed to test the theoretical model's prediction. We find that a 1 percent decrease in the margin of victory (i.e., the difference in the vote share) between the elected mayor and her challenger generates a 0.53 euro drop in the ==== tax revenue from ICI (the main property tax in Italy) and a simultaneous increase in revenues from fees for “local services” by 0.66 euro ====. We find that, consistent with our hypothesis, electoral cycles also play an important role in shaping tax- and fee-setting decisions. Moreover, we find that substitution between fees and taxes occurs mainly in the years close to elections. In short, the effect is stronger when elections are coming up, and when candidates face more political competition.====In order to rule out possible alternative explanations, we carry out a number of robustness checks. First, we employ Regression Discontinuity Design to check whether partisan allegiance affects fiscal decisions, such as, for example, right-wing mayors preferring to fund services through specific charges, and left-wing mayors preferring to rely on general taxation. We find that the link between political competition and tax-mix choices is unaffected by the mayor's ideology thus ruling out that party preferences are the drivers of our results. Second, to address the endogeneity of the municipal margin of victory, we proxy mayoral-election political competition by ==== electoral outcomes at the ==== level. We do this both through a reduced form model and by instrumenting for mayoral electoral outcomes with regional (municipality-level) ones. In both cases we obtain analogous results.====The concept of tax salience is closely related to the concept of fiscal illusion stemming from complex tax systems (see the seminal works by Puviani (1903) and Buchanan (1967) ====).5In economics, this issue has been the object of a handful of studies: Krishna and Slemrod (2003) — drawing mainly from the psychology and marketing literature — review how governments exploit various behavioral biases in the electorate to decrease the perceived tax burden.==== McCaffery and Baron (2006) use laboratory simulations of tax setting to show that test subjects are willing to tolerate higher overall tax levels when the tax is imposed through many smaller taxes, rather than through a single large tax, because of the inability to correctly remember the overall tax burden.====Along these lines Chetty et al. (2009) use variation across U.S. states and over time to analyze the behavioral response of alcohol consumption to variations in excise (included in price) and sales taxes (added to price); they find that consumers respond more to the more salient (excise) and less to less salient (sales) taxes. They also describe a theoretical model, mostly aimed at assessing how the difference in salience affects the tax burden between sellers and buyers; however, they do not explore the potential electoral consequences of this. They then focus on the technical difficulties in reconciling the ==== rational behavior of consumers — who are only partially able to calculate their tax bills — within a fully rational economic model in which consumers' budget constraints are not violated.====Finkelstein (2009) shows that the introduction of electronic toll collections on U.S. roads, tunnels, and bridges has two effects: (i) it makes citizens less likely to know the amount of toll they pay, and (ii) it is associated with an increase in tolls; i.e., electronic collection increases the equilibrium toll rate by decreasing its salience. The theoretical model distinguishes between tax salience at the time of consumption (which leads agents to overconsume goods as a result of underestimating their non-salient sale tax) and tax salience at the time of voting (which leads agents to hold to account government relatively more for more salient tax policies). Similarly, our model assumes that some fiscal instruments are (politically) more salient than others. Unlike Finkelstein (2009), however, we present a fully micro-founded model of the government's tax-setting behavior stemming from the salience differentials.====This is not the first attempt in the literature to analyze the interaction between the tax mix and electoral outcomes, or the effect of government financing on political accountability. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to relate the tax mix to the degree of political competition, and to thoroughly explore the transmission mechanism between the two. In addition to the works already cited, Milesi-Ferretti (2003) studies the effect of fiscal rules on economic outcomes; Alt and Lassen (2003) look at the government's choice between taxes or debt; Coate and Morris (1995) investigates the hidden financing of interest groups; Bordignon and Minelli (2001) consider the tradeoff between accountability and efficiency; Bordignon et al. (2017) look at similar data to ours and compare the effect of the property tax to a newly established municipal income tax, and find that mayors seeking re-election (i.e., those who are not subject to a term limit) favored the new tax; the authors argue that this new tax was less transparent. Finally, our results can also be linked with the extensive literature on political budget cycle (for a review, see Dubois, 2016), which confirms that many public finance items are subject to pre-electoral political manipulation, and, therefore, shows a cyclical pattern across the electoral term.====The paper is organized as follows: the next section introduces the economic environment and the model.

This may lead to exaggerated conservatism in the voting decision (status quo bias). To investigate how complexity affects individual ====, we develop a novel measure of proposition complexity (using official pre-referendum booklets) and combine it with post-referendum survey data from Switzerland. Using Heckman selection estimations to account for endogenous variation in participation rates, we find that an increase in proposition complexity from the 10th to the 90th percentile would decrease voters' approval by 5.6 ppts, which is often decisive: an additional 12% of the propositions in our sample would be rejected.","Direct legislation provides citizens with the opportunity to directly choose policies. This influence comes at a cost, however. Voters have to decide about propositions on a broad variety of issues. Often several propositions are at stake on the same day (i.e. on the same ballot) where citizens are asked to choose between rejecting a proposition (status quo) and accepting a proposition.==== Since “a defining characteristic of many propositions is complexity” (Lupia, 1994, 63), voters may face considerable difficulties in estimating the personal consequences of accepting or rejecting a proposition. Various authors even go so far to assert that ordinary voters may not be sufficiently competent to decide about complex policy issues (Cronin, 1999; Magleby, 1984).====If voters do face such difficulties in deciding about complex propositions, how may this affect their voting behavior? First, it is likely that complexity has a negative influence on the individual decision to participate in a referendum. Voters may for instance derive less utility from turning out when they are uncertain about their voting decision (Matsusaka, 1995). Second, the theoretical literature suggests that complexity increases the likelihood that voters reject a proposition. Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) were among the first to state that the existence of uncertainty – for instance due to the complexity and a resulting poor understanding of an issue – may lead to a status quo bias. Related to this, Eichenberger and Serna (1996) argue that complexity increases the likelihood that voters make random errors in assessing the costs and benefits of a proposed ballot measure. Due to the nature of the voting procedure these random errors have asymmetric effects on the outcome of a referendum and may lead to a higher likelihood of rejecting a proposition. Finally, a behavioral literature emphasizes that heuristics are primarily used when people have to trade off the effort required in decision-making and the accuracy of one's decision (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2010). Hence, voters are particularly likely to rely on the status quo heuristic when they face highly complex propositions.====To be able to empirically investigate whether the complexity of propositions affects voters' decisions to turn out in a referendum and to accept or reject a proposition, we have to address two challenges. First, we need to find a way to measure proposition complexity. Most of the existing empirical literature on complexity in direct legislation resorts to a convenient measure of ==== which counts the number of propositions that were at stake on the same day (Selb, 2008; Stadelmann and Torgler, 2013).==== Alternatively, some studies use the number of words or lines devoted to a proposition on a ballot as a measure of ==== (Bowler et al., 1992; Kriesi, 2008; Nicholson, 2003).====The ballot complexity measure only takes into account how many propositions voters have to deal with on the same day (i.e. how crowded a ballot is) and thus does not capture the complexity of an individual proposition based on its content. On the other hand, the proposition prolixity measure refers to a point in time where a voter has already taken a first decision: she has turned out and is sitting in front of the ballot. Thus, using the prolixity measure one would ignore citizens who abstain in the first place. Second, one has to think carefully about how to capture the effect of complexity on individual voting behavior. While at first sight it may seem that the participation decision (whether to turn out) is irrelevant to the effect of proposition complexity on the referendum outcome and a potential status quo bias, this is likely not the case. Theoretical contributions such as the swing voter's curse theory by Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996) underline the importance of potential interrelations between the participation and voting decision. Therefore, one needs (i) a dataset that includes information on individual participation and voting decisions and (ii) a suitable econometric specification that takes into account that the two decisions are interdependent.====In this paper, we address both of these challenges. Our dataset covers 223 federal referendums that were held in Switzerland between 1981 and 2010. The data on individual participation and voting decisions is taken from the VOX post-referendum survey series. We combine this rich micro data-set with a novel measure of proposition complexity which we construct based on information provided in official pre-referendum booklets that are sent to all Swiss households prior to a referendum. Our regression model takes into account that the participation and voting decisions are interrelated.====We make three substantive contributions to the literature. Our first contribution is to develop a new measure for proposition complexity. Conceptually, we take a different approach than the existing literature by constructing a measure of the ==== complexity of ballot propositions.==== The complexity of a proposition that voters are exposed to ==== to a referendum is the variable of interest which we capture with our novel complexity measure based on an extensive data collection effort for 223 federal referendums in Switzerland over the 1981–2010 period. We use information provided in official pre-referendum booklets which the Swiss government is legally obliged to disseminate before each referendum since 1978 (Schweizer Bundesrat, 1978). In constructing this measure, we follow the literature which regards complex propositions as those that are “lengthy (…) and technical” (Lupia, 1994, 65). While the level of technicality is subjective and difficult to measure, the length of the description of propositions can be measured. Hence, we record the number of words in the information and debate section in the official booklets for each proposition.====Our second contribution is that to our knowledge we are the first to study the effect of complexity on individual voting behavior – or on voting behavior in direct legislation more generally – with an econometric specification which addresses sample selection. For any proposition voters face two decisions: (i) whether to participate in the referendum and (ii) conditional on participation whether to choose the status quo (reject the proposition) or the ballot measure (accept the proposition).==== Since the second decision – the voting decision – is only observable for citizens that turn out, the classic ==== arises (Heckman, 1978, 1979). In our case, the selection bias is a participation bias.==== Previous studies ignore sample selection and typically use aggregated data on the turnout rate or the share of yes- or no-votes as the dependent variable. We apply a structural approach based on two estimation equations (Heckman selection model). We solve the endogeneity problem by means of an exclusion restriction, i.e. we include a variable (the closeness of a referendum outcome) that influences the individual participation decision but which is arguably orthogonal to the voting decision. This allows us to portray more accurately how complexity affects individual voting behavior and to disentangle a direct effect of complexity on the voting decision and possible indirect effects via the participation decision.==== This contribution should not be understood as a primarily technical matter, but also as an attempt to bring the empirical analysis closer to the structure of the underlying political-economic theory on the act of voting.====Our third contribution is to validate theoretical mechanisms proposed by the literature. We examine how the effect of complexity on individual voting behavior varies with voters' education level. Various contributions in the literature suggest that voters' decisions to participate in a referendum or to accept or reject a proposition depend on how educated they are. Matsusaka (1995) points out that citizens may be more likely to turn out when their issue-related knowledge and education level is high. Gerber and Lupia (1999) argue that voter characteristics that mitigate the uncertainty due to a proposition's content should reduce the status quo bias. Hence, better educated voters have to invest less effort to understand the content of a complex proposition and are less likely to rely on the status quo heuristic.====We provide evidence that voters are more likely to reject propositions when they are more complex. Increasing proposition complexity from the 10th to the 90==== percentile would decrease the approval rate by 5.6 ppts. This decline is often decisive: an additional 12% of the propositions in our sample would be rejected. Two competing mechanisms determine the impact of complexity on the status quo bias in the vote outcome: a ==== – confronted with higher complexity, voters tend to vote in favor of the status quo, – and an ==== – increasing complexity reduces the percentage of citizens biased towards the status quo (through vote abstentions) among the voters and therefore mitigates the bias. We contribute to the literature by estimating the magnitude of both effects. Neglecting the indirect participation effect would lead us to overestimate the effect of complexity on the referendum outcome by almost 50%. The sheer magnitude of the opposing indirect effect calls attention to the importance of treating voting behavior as an outcome of two sequential choices.====Voters with a lower ability to understand complex issues (i.e. with a lower education level) are on average more than 10% more likely than highly educated voters to abstain from voting and to reject propositions. This effect is twice as large for propositions at the 90==== percentile compared to propositions at the 10th percentile of the complexity distribution in our sample. Our findings hence suggest that less educated citizens are more disinclined to turn out when propositions are highly complex. Lijphart (1997, 1) claims that such “unequal participation spells unequal influence” and thereby calls the legitimacy of referendums on complex issues into question. However, in line with the swing voter's curse theory, we find that citizens biased towards the status quo are more likely to abstain from voting which renders the vote outcome informationally superior since it mitigates the status quo bias in the vote outcome. By estimating the participation bias, we contribute a quantitative dimension to the discussion of the underlying trade-off between a ==== (Lijphart, 1997) and an ==== (Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1996).====Our objective complexity measure has the advantage that it is unrelated to individual characteristics and can thus be used to study the interaction between voters' characteristics (e.g. education level) and proposition complexity. In an additional extension we use an alternative measure of proposition complexity based on voters' perceptions of how difficult it was for them to form an opinion about the consequences of rejecting or accepting a proposition (subjective complexity). In this case, voters who find it rather difficult to form an opinion are 11.5 percentage points less likely to turn out and 4.7 percentage points more likely to reject a proposition.====We conduct five robustness tests that address potential concerns regarding our complexity measure, our identification strategy, and alternative mechanisms. First, we use data on a survey question that indicates whether a respondent has or has not used the official information booklet. We find that our estimation results for the effect of complexity on individual voting behavior do not differ between booklet users and nonusers. This indicates that our complexity measure indeed captures proposition complexity at a deeper level and that its validity does not require citizens to read the information booklets. Second, we show that our main results are not confounded by the fact that more complex propositions may be perceived by voters as more important. Third, we provide evidence that the government does not strategically manipulate proposition complexity to induce voters to vote in line with the government's recommendation. Fourth, using pre-poll data on the ex-ante closeness of referendum outcomes for a subset of our sample we obtain results similar to our baseline estimates. Fifth, we provide evidence that our baseline estimates are not contaminated by those propositions where survey bias – as identified by Funk (2016) – may be an issue.====The findings in this paper are interesting not only because they provide a comprehensive analysis of how complexity in direct legislation affects individual voting behavior, but also because direct democracy is becoming a more important tool for decision-making in various contexts (see e.g. the British referendum on EU membership or the Greek referendum on bailout packages). From a policy perspective, it is important to know how the complexity of policy issues influences individual voting behavior as well as aggregate referendum outcomes. Our results suggest that governments should invest more in general education to form politically mature citizens able to make informed decisions even if propositions are unusually complex.","Complex ballot propositions, individual voting behavior, and status quo bias",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018302799,5 November 2018,2018,Research Article,284.0

A growing body of evidence shows how this is also true at the firm level. After taking stock of earlier theoretical and empirical literature on the efficiency of state-owned versus private enterprises, while we consider ownership as the core internal governance mechanism of firms, we add quality of government as a determinant of the external institutional environment. To disentangle the effect of internal and external institutions on firms' productivity, we use different sets of ownership and institutional environment indicators.====After having identified the top 350 private, state-invested (i.e. partially state-owned) and state-owned enterprises in the ==== in EU28 and in more than 60 other countries between 2007 and 2015, we empirically investigate models of firms' productivity augmented with ownership and quality of government. Our findings suggest that, after controlling for the regulatory and competitive conditions at the country level, on average, public ownership has a negative impact on firm-level TFP. This effect is however mitigated by high external institutional quality and even reversed in some countries with a particularly favourable institutional environment.","According to earlier theoretical and empirical literature, state-owned enterprises (henceforth, SOEs) are expected to be less efficient than their private counterparts (see e.g. the popular survey by Megginson and Netter, 2001 or more recently Megginson, 2016).====Despite mass privatization reforms implemented in the past decades, governments still own and manage substantial productive assets in many economic sectors. According to Christiansen and Kim (2014), 282 out of the world's 2000 largest companies (‘Forbes Global 2000’ top corporation list) are SOEs (including state-invested enterprises where the government is a shareholder with other investors). Recent data (OECD, 2017) show that, at the end of 2015, SOEs are valued together at over 2.4 trillion USD and employ, cumulatively, more than 9.2 million workers.====As the appointment and incentives of managers in SOEs is influenced by governments, bad decisions will be taken by bad governments. But is the reverse true? In countries where the overall institutional quality is high, are SOEs relatively more efficient?====Several channels through which institutional aspects can influence firm-level activities can be envisaged. For example, if there is pervasive corruption of government officials in one country, doing business there means that a firm has to face direct extra-costs relative to a firm in another country where civil servants and politicians are more honest (see e.g. Brooks et al., 2013).====The lack of stability of legislation or of its interpretation by courts may hinder corporate investment, and this also generates inefficiency. Democracy itself is often regarded as a form of political competition leading on average to choosing more honest and better qualified politicians than otherwise, and better politicians may pass better legislation, with beneficial effects for competition (see Besley, 2006).====While these aspects have been explicitly and extensively considered in previous literature on economic growth and determinants of firms' productivity, very few previous studies have considered the differential impact that the institutional environment may have on the productivity of public versus private firms.====While good institutions are beneficial for all firms, they should exert particularly positive effects on public enterprises, since they might mitigate the structural causes of the inefficiency gap with private firms. More specifically, while for private enterprises good institutions are beneficial in shaping the environment in which they compete, for public enterprise there is an additional effect on the internal governance of the firm. Thus public enterprises benefit from a high institutional quality both in terms of operating in a favourable external environment, as all firms, but also in terms of reaping the benefits that institutional quality has on the internal governance of the firms. For example, one of the possible causes of inefficiency of government owned firms is related to the fact that owners of firms appoint managers and, in corrupt environments, the decision process may be driven by distorted motivations that deviate from efficiency. In a favourable institutional environment, instead, good government may be less inclined to cronyism in selecting executive directors of SOEs and this may reduce the gap in efficiency with private enterprises. Hence, we want to empirically test the differential impact of external institutions on firms' productivity according to their private versus public ownership.====The privatization of British Telecom was often identified as the most important historically (see Megginson and Netter, 2001), since it allowed privatization to become an established economic policy tool. Looking back to the 1980's, the telecommunications industry was the most important sector affected by privatization and liberalisation reforms in Europe (Florio, 2003, 2013), along with other network industries (Clifton et al., 2006). For an overview of the underlying motivations and outcomes of the reform process in the telecommunications sector in Europe, see Belloc et al. (2013).====For several reasons the telecommunications industry is an ideal testing ground for our question: it is the industry where privatization policy started in the UK more than 30 years ago (Clifton et al., 2006); the services provided are essential for the overall performance of the economy; the available technology is relatively homogeneous across countries (differently, for example, from the energy industry), thus efficiency comparisons at the firm level are straightforward. However, the privatization process was not homogeneous neither in its timing nor its pace: a mixed-oligopoly, where private and SOEs or state-invested enterprises==== (henceforth, SIEs) coexist, has mainly emerged in Europe in the last three decades (e.g. in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden). Nowadays, the State is still a major player in the telecommunications industry not only in Europe but also worldwide, notably in China and in other Asian countries.====However, if the difference in performance between private and public firms is due to distorted incentives for the latter, then good institutions, by shaping the environment in which firms operate, may help closing the gap, reducing the likelihood of rent-seeking and opportunistic behaviour of managers and politicians. Moreover, if the quality of institutions is correlated with firms' outcomes, then earlier empirical studies of the relative difference in performance between private and public enterprises may have omitted potentially relevant explanatory variables.====Our research questions are thus the following: is the quality of external institutions related to firm-level productivity? Is there a differential impact of institutions according to firms' ownership type? Does the quality of external institutions modify the impact of ownership on productivity?====To answer these questions we built a worldwide database from around 350 top telecommunication companies between 2007 and 2015. Firm-level information is obtained from the Orbis Database, country-level institutional features are extracted from the Quality of Government Social Policy Dataset and additional information on GDP is taken from the World Bank Development Indicators.====We find that a negative and statistically significant relationship exists between public ownership and telecommunications companies' total factor productivity (henceforth, TFP), as per earlier literature. Such effect is, however, counterbalanced by institutional quality. The lower the quality of country institutions the higher is the gap between SOEs, SIEs and private enterprises, but in countries with high institutional quality, this effect is reversed. This result helps advance our understanding of productivity determinants and their interplay, focusing on the role of both external and internal institutions. A novelty of our approach is the use of a continuous variable for public ownership, allowing to capture the impact of different levels of state investment on TFP.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews earlier literature on the role of ownership and institutions on firm productivity; Section 3 presents some key features of the industry, describes data sources and shows descriptive statistics; Section 4 describes the empirical strategy implemented, discusses the regression results and performs robustness checks.

We find strong evidence of the RAE in politics in Finland. However, the effect is heterogeneous: We find that male candidates born early in the calendar year have a significantly higher probability of getting elected to the parliament but no similar RAE applies to female candidates nor to municipal elections. Moreover, this effect only takes place in the most competitive parliamentary districts and is present only for some parties. We also find that in all the groups where the RAE does not exist, early-born candidates are under-represented suggesting attrition of talent in the candidate placement. Overall, our results show that seemingly artificial cutoffs imposed by the government have persistent consequences even on the selection to the highest positions of power within a society.","The relative age effect (RAE) refers to the possible advantage that children get when being relatively old in their cohort, that is, children born early in the calendar year perform better that those born later. The existence of an RAE in various professional sports and educational performance is well documented (see, ====, Musch and Grondin, 2001, Bedard and Dhuey, 2006, Böheim and Lackner, 2012, Fredriksson and Öckert, 2014, and Fumarco and Rossi, 2018). The academic and policy interest here arises for four primary reasons. First, there is a concern that artificial rules imposed by the society may create persistent inequality and, second, result in losing irreversibly potential talent among the relatively young in many areas of human life. Third, the existence of an RAE should make a difference for decisions that parents take in family planning and raising children. For example, parents may be making uniformed decisions in enrolling their children to school earlier than obligatory or in waiving the possibility of seeking over-age permissions when warranted. Finally, understanding the mechanisms behind RAE offers a window into understanding early-life human capital accumulation.====Despite the extent of empirical analysis of the RAE, it has remained a possibility that the RAE could be driven by unobserved heterogeneity, for example, season of birth effects due to, ====, biological, climatic, or environmental factors (Musch and Grondin, 2001). Nor it is clear to what extent the RAE exists beyond education and sports, and to what extent the RAE prevails in the long-run outcomes. Furthermore, the literature has largely focused on estimating the average RAE, paying much less attention to potential heterogeneity in the RAE. For example, there may be important gender differences in the prevalence of an RAE is sports (====, Helsen et al., 2005, Vincent and Glamser, 2006, and Nakata and Sakamoto, 2012), but it is not clear whether such gender differences in the RAE exist in other areas of human life. Similarly, a competitive environment has been understood to be a key ingredient for the emergence of an RAE in sports (see, ====, Musch and Grondin, 2001, and Addona and Yates, 2010) but it is not clear whether this insight carries elsewhere. Finally, there is not much rigorous evidence to evaluate the hypothesis (put forward by Musch and Grondin, 2001) that explains the gender differences in the RAE only by the differences in the depth of competition across female and male team sports.====In this paper, we provide evidence from the Finnish politics of an RAE on long-run political outcomes and show that the RAE in politics is not caused by unobserved heterogeneity, but rather by the factors that give a performance advantage to those of the oldest of a cohort. More specifically, the closer is the exact date of the birth of a January-born candidate to the New Year, the larger is his probability to become elected in parliamentary elections. We also find strong evidence that the RAE only applies to males in competitive political environments. In particular, we find no evidence of the RAE among female politicians nor in local municipal elections where competition is much weaker that on the nation-wide parliamentary elections, or even in those parliamentary districts that are less competitive. Moreover, no RAE appears to be present among the politicians of the Centre Party, one of the three main parties in Finland, which is known for its centralized candidate selection process.====Our results on candidate selection show that in all the groups where the RAE does not exist, early-born candidates are under-represented compared to late-born candidates. In contrast, in groups where we find the RAE, the density of candidates develops smoothly over the end-of-the-year cutoff. This suggests that the attrition of (early-born) talent in the candidate placement in some groups it at least one possible reason for the lack of the RAE.====Politics in Finland provides a useful environment to study both gender- and competition-specific RAEs. Finland was the first country in Europe to introduce women's suffrage in 1907 and female representation in politics has been since then high by international standards. For example, in 2015 parliamentary elections, roughly 40% of candidates and successfully elected candidates were female. Moreover, we use data on parliamentary elections from a period where there still were substantial differences in the level of political competition between parliamentary districts.====Our comparative evidence from the Finnish politicians supports Muller and Page's (2015) seminal findings of the existence of an RAE in the US congress (another highly competitive environment). Going beyond Muller and Page (2015), we find that gender, the intensity of electoral competition, and party differences matter for the emergence of an RAE in political selection. Our results suggest that those males who have benefited from RAEs during early-life in school seem to perform better, and thus, political selection in Finland is at least to some extent meritocratic. Therefore, we contribute to understanding political selection (see, ====, Caselli and Morelli, 2004, and Poutvaara and Takalo, 2007, for theoretical foundations, and Galasso and Nannicini, 2011, Kotakorpi and Poutvaara, 2011, Brollo et al., 2013, Folke et al., 2016, and Dal Bó et al., 2017 among others for empirical evidence). On the other hand, our result has a less encouraging implication: We seem to be losing irreversibly potential talent among the late born in the political arena due to the artificial division of children into different age groups.====A standard economics explanation for why the RAE emerges more prominently in competitive environments is that the RAE enhances performance and competition is needed to screen out better performing types, similarly as competition in the marketplace weeds out worse performing firms. This explanation is consistent with previous literature arguing that political competition correlates with improved politician quality (====, De Paola and Scoppa, 2011, and Galasso and Nannicini, 2011). According to psychology literature, a gender gap in the RAE might arise, for example, because boys and girls on average differ in their coping strategies and emotional response to various environmental factors (Aune et al. 2018; Eschenbeck et al. 2007; Chaplin and Aldao, 2013). Thus, there possibly could be heterogeneity in the RAE also on the development of boys and girls when it comes to traits that are valuable in the political arena. Taken together, these two features would explain why the RAE could emerge only for males in competitive political environment. Given the high share of women in the Finnish politics, however, our results fit less well with the hypothesis that gender-specific differences in the depth of competition would lead to the gender gap in the RAE.====Also a more complicated explanation is consistent with our heterogeneity results: If females shy away from mixed-sex competition (see, ====.====., Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007, and Niederle et al., 2013) and if the emergence of the RAE is linked to competitive pressure, we could observe the RAE more visibly in males in more competitive mix-sex environments such as competitive elections. However, for this to be the case, such attrition needs to affect talented women disproportionally, for example due to better outside options (see, ====.====., Brollo et al., 2013). Indeed, we see evidence of such attrition patterns in candidate selection. Thus, we provide a new real-life angle to the extensive laboratory literature of gender differences in competitiveness (see Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011, and Niederle, 2016, surveys). This hypothesis linking the RAE to the gender-competition nexus, together with the laboratory evidence by Niederle et al. (2013) that a quota-style affirmative action might reduce the gender gap in competitiveness, predicts that encouraging female representation in politics via quotas could result in the emergence of the RAE among the female politicians, too.==== Therefore, while our approach is explorative and there are several possible theoretical interpretations for our findings, this argument provides a hypothesis to test in future work.====Our findings also shed some light on the possible mechanisms underlying the emergence of the RAE. In particular, the heterogeneity in the RAE with respect to gender supports psychological theories (see, ====, Musch and Grondin, 2001) as the main mechanism for the human capital accumulation caused by the RAE, but fits less well with the resource-based theories of the RAE. For example, it may be particularly harmful for boys to be disadvantaged among peers. As a result, the findings help to design appropriate policy response to the RAE.====In the next section we survey the previous literature documenting the existence of the RAE, various theories proposed to explain this phenomenon, and motivate why we might to expect to see heterogeneity in the RAE. We describe our data and institutional background in Section 3. Then, in Section 4, we proceed to our empirical investigation of the RAE among the Finnish politicians.

Finally, controlling for a variety of demographic, political and socioeconomic factors, we find that high unemployment increases the probability that an incumbent loses re-election, while increasing net population migration reduces it.","Incumbent politicians have historically been highly successful in their re-election campaigns. For example, between 1946 and 2014, incumbent Congress members in the U.S. House of Representatives were successful 92.3 percent of the time when seeking re-election and 79.7 percent of U.S. Senators were re-elected (Brookings Institution, 2017). Additionally, in state gubernatorial elections, the incumbent won re-election 72.1 percent of the time over a similar period (Center on the American Governor, 2014). When looking at more recent elections, the results show that incumbent re-election rates have only increased since 1980. Incumbent Representatives and Senators have been re-elected 93.9 and 84.9 percent of the time, respectively, while incumbent governors' re-election rate has risen to 79.2 percent.==== The remarkable success of incumbent politicians in winning re-election bids has often been described as the ====. Erikson (1971, p. 395) summarized the rationale for this phenomenon:====Nevertheless, incumbent politicians do occasionally lose their re-election campaigns, despite being armed with an incumbent advantage. Such was the case when challenger Bill Clinton successfully defeated incumbent George H.W. Bush in the 1992 U.S. Presidential Election. In this election, one of the Clinton campaign's strategic tenets was the performance of the economy, as embodied in the phrase `==== This mantra was grounded in the relatively poor economic performance of the U.S. economy compared to the decade before the Bush Presidency. Prior to the start of the Bush presidency in 1988, real GDP grew by 3.5 percent per annum from 1980 to 1988 and the unemployment rate had fallen from double digits in the early part of the decade to around 5 percent by the end of 1988. Over the course of Bush's term as President, real GDP growth fell to less than 2 percent per year and the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose to nearly 8 percent during the summer of 1992 – the heart of the Presidential campaign season. The Clinton campaign's message to the American public was clear. It wanted voters to link President Bush's economic policies to the recent struggles of the economy, while at the same time reassuring them that Clinton's policies would deliver better economic performance.====This strategic focus on the economy during Bush's tenure paid off for the Clinton campaign, and it seems to have played a significant role in helping Clinton unseat the incumbent (Alvarez and Nagler, 1995). The relative success of this campaign suggests that the performance of the economy during an incumbent chief political executive's tenure can be an important consideration for voters. However, the effect of the economy was not only at the presidential level. Out of the 21 governors who won their elections in 1989 and 1990, most had negative poll ratings by late 1992 and faced significant challenges to their re-election bids centered around economic issues (Beyle, 1992).====A vast body of literature exists that examines the role of economic conditions on election outcomes (see, viz., the following surveys: Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2013; Nannestad and Paldam, 1994). We contribute to this body of literature by empirically examining the effect of changes in state economic policies during an incumbent state governor's tenure on the probability of their losing re-election. We identified 240 incumbent state governor re-election efforts over the period 1984–2015. Utilizing data from the Economic Freedom of North America (Stansel et al., 2017), we develop a variety of proxies for state-level economic policy changes during an incumbent's tenure as the state political chief executive and test whether the effects of such changes on re-election are contingent on the incumbent's political party. We augment this data with a variety of demographic, political and socio-economic factors that potentially influence election outcomes.====Using a Probit regression, we estimate the effect of policy changes on an incumbent governor's likelihood of losing their re-election campaign and whether there is a differential impact of policy changes by incumbent political party. The results suggest that decreases in state-level economic freedom during an incumbent governor's time in office are associated with a higher probability of losing re-election, although we find some evidence that the effect is attenuated for Republican incumbents. Additionally, we examine the effects of the three economic freedom sub-indices on election outcomes. These results suggest that the government spending area index appears to be driving the overall results. We further decompose the index into its ten policy components to explore their effects on the incumbent advantage. Our results suggest that increases in government consumption spending relative to personal income and the government employment share are associated with a higher probability of losing re-election among incumbents, but the effect is attenuated among Republicans, a result that we believe is explainable by the Median Voter Theorem. We also find the increases in transfer payments relative to personal income are associated with a higher probability of losing re-election, regardless of party, and that increases in income taxation relative to personal income and top marginal income tax rates are associated with a higher and lower probability, respectively, of losing re-election among Republican incumbents. Additionally, we find that higher unemployment rates during the year of an incumbent election are associated with a higher probability of an incumbent losing re-election and that net migration is associated with a lower probability of losing. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the policy-induced electoral effects are attributable to the individual incumbent rather than his/her party, results that are consistent with recent research on the incumbent advantage (Erikson and Titiunik, 2015; Fowler and Hall, 2014).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of related literature and theoretical considerations to motivate the analysis. The methodology and data used for the empirical analysis are described in section 3, followed by a discussion of the main results in section 4.

In this paper we show that non-discriminatory tax relief for private donations can arise in political equilibrium as a strategic commitment device aimed at creating and supporting political alliances that would not otherwise be able to coalesce.,"Because of budgetary pressures, governments have increasingly come to rely on the private sector for the provision of collective goods and services. Accordingly, there has been a growing focus in the public debate on how government incentives for private contributions – typically delivered in the form of tax reliefs – should be structured; and, more specifically, on whether they should be offered indiscriminately, without varying the level of relief depending on the extent to which different types of donations generate a “public benefit”, and without limit on the size of donations that can benefit from relief.====In this paper, we re-examine the political-economy rationale for non-discriminatory donation relief: can non-discriminatory donation relief, as we observe it, be rationalized as an equilibrium outcome of political competition?====Our paper is a first attempt to build a bridge between two main strands of literature on the voluntary provision of public goods. The first has focused on how tax policy and government spending affect charitable giving (Warr, 1982, 1983; Roberts, 1984, 1987; Bernheim, 1986; Bergstrom et al., 1986). With reference to the subsidization of private donations, this literature has shown that diverting public funds towards tax relief for private giving can raise the total level of provision of public goods above the level that could be achieved if the same public funds were used directly to provide the goods (Andreoni and Bergstrom, 1996).====The second, more recent, strand of literature has examined public provision choices by elected representatives when public goods can also be provided privately and the role that such provision choices play in the determination of political outcomes (Epple and Romano, 1996a, 1996b; Gouveia, 1997; Scharf, 2000; Horstmann et al., 2007; Horstmann and Scharf, 2008). One of the key conclusions from this literature is that majorities may prefer a mixed regime of public provision with private donations over either pure private provision or pure public provision, and may deploy tax relief strategically to shift the burden of provision onto minority donors.====The above-mentioned studies are concerned with situations where only one type of public good is provided and where individuals are only heterogeneous in their preferences over levels of public good provision. In practice, collective provision typically involves multiple goods and services,==== and each of those goods and services can vary in their characteristics, characteristics that different individuals value differently.==== Thus, individual preferences will also be heterogeneous with respect to the ==== of collective good provision, not just with respect to ==== provision there should be. This means that, in regimes where collective goods are privately provided, in part or in full, by minorities, these minorities will direct their donations towards the kinds of collective goods that they favour rather than towards those that the majority favours, implying a reduced scope for the majority to rely on private provision by minorities – and thus a reduced scope for leveraging on tax relief for this purpose.====In such cases the private provision of public goods can serve to fill a minority demand that left unmet by majority-driven public provision choices (Weisbrod, 1975), and so non-discriminatory donation relief can be viewed as a concession by the majority to minorities – a concession that protects minorities from the “tyranny of the majority” in relation to the composition of collective good provision. Still, why should the ruling majority agree to such a concession? In other words, why do we observe majority-sanctioned tax relief being granted on donations towards collective goods that are not valued by the majority? In this paper we argue that subsidies to private giving can be used as a locking-in mechanism that enables heterogeneous groups to cement political alliances.====The premise of this argument is that tax incentives for giving are enshrined in the tax system and cannot be easily overturned in the short run. Tax constitutions in developed countries typically prescribe a two-speed system for tax policy changes: a fast track that allows governments to easily change tax rates and levels of public spending, and a slow track for structural tax reforms.==== And indeed, over the last twenty years UK governments have changed either the tax rate or the income brackets every year, but the subsidy rate to donation reliefs has been modified only three times. The same pattern is in evidence when we look at the US case: while tax rates or income brackets have been changed almost every two years, tax relief provisions have been modified only nine times over the past eighty years.====Tax relief is linked to tax rates,==== and so changes in the level of taxation, which can be enacted upon comparatively more quickly, also entail changes in the implied level of public subsidization of private giving by minorities. Linking taxation and donation subsidies in this way can be pivotal to how minorities rank different candidates in a political contest, and can thus affect political outcomes. Non-discriminatory tax relief effectively removes a dimension of ex-post political discretion that may otherwise cause a candidate to lose the support of a subset of minority voters. What we show in the theoretical analysis that follows is that, if changes to the structure of tax relief provisions are sufficiently slow to enact, non-discriminatory tax relief for private giving can arise in political equilibrium as a means of supporting political alliances that would not otherwise be sustainable.====To develop our arguments, we focus on a model of political competition where there are multiple collective goods and where public provision can be augmented by private donations. In this setting we characterize policy choices and political outcomes with and without non-discriminatory tax relief for private donations (i.e. tax relief that does not discriminate across donations towards different collective goods).====First, we show that, if changing the structure of tax reliefs involves a sufficient time lag, an incumbent policy-maker would never want to commit to a given tax rate level but may want to introduce non-discriminatory tax relief for donations in order to secure her re-election in the next period. Second, we demonstrate that tax reliefs can arise in equilibrium at a constitutional stage – whether citizen vote over the permanent introduction of tax reliefs or just over the introduction of procedural rules that make it comparatively more difficult to overturn tax relief provisions.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the model and characterizes the collective and voluntary provision of collective goods under different tax regimes. In Section 3 we analyze how different tax regimes affect political competition. Section 4 show how tax relief can arise endogenously in equilibrium. Section 5 concludes.

By focusing our attention on neighboring electoral sections that face the same local congressional election, but different municipal elections, and assuming that political preferences for local legislative candidates remain constant across neighboring electoral sections, we exploit variation in the strength of the municipal candidates in each of these electoral sections to estimate coattails from municipal to local congressional elections in Mexico. A one percentage increase in vote share for a municipal candidate translates, depending on his or her party, into an average of between 0.45 and 0.78 percentage point increase in vote share for the legislative candidates from the same party (though this effect may not have been sufficient to affect an outcome in any electoral district in our sample). In addition, we find that a large fraction of the effect is driven by individuals switching their vote decision in the legislative election, rather than by an increase in turnout.","Electoral coattails are easy to define,==== but, as we discuss below, notoriously hard to measure empirically. Yet, their presence may be crucial both for campaigning and for the balance of forces in post-electoral government (Ferejohn and Calvert, 1984). The extent to which popular or better organized politicians may provide an electoral boost to their fellow party members running for other offices is potentially determinative both of executive-legislative balance of power and of internal party organization, especially in polities with multiple levels of government, where coattails may provide a crucial incentive for maintaining intra-party cohesiveness (Garmendia Madariaga and Ozen, 2015). In fact, existence, strength and nature of coattails, if they can be empirically established, could provide crucial evidence for the forces and mechanisms that lead to the formation of political parties themselves. At the same time, proper measurement of coattail effects is essential if one is to disentangle them from other determinants of electoral outcomes (Adams and Kenny, 1989; Levernier, 1992). It is therefore not surprising that, over the years, a large body of literature on the subject has been generated.====In this paper, we start by describing the empirical difficulties involved in consistently estimating coattail effects. We then exploit certain unique characteristics of the Mexican electoral system to recover what we argue is an unbiased estimate of the magnitude of coattail effects from municipal to state legislative elections. Finally, having identified the magnitude of these effects, we present additional tests aimed at disentangling the different channels through which coattails arise in the setting analyzed.====Though presidential coattails have received most of the attention in the literature (as, for instance, in Kramer, 1971, Ferejohn and Calvert, 1984, Campbell, 1986, Campbell and Sumners, 1990, Mattei and Glasgow, 2005, Godbout, 2013 or Erikson, 2016), we follow a number of recent studies (such as Samuels, 2000, Hogan, 2005 or Meredith, 2013) in concentrating on the subnational elections: an approach that allows us to observe variation not available in a nationwide presidential race. We exploit the fact that in Mexico state legislative districts and municipal boundaries frequently do not coincide and, as a result, neighboring electoral sections may participate in the same election at the local (district) level, but a different election at the municipal level. As the state and municipal elections are typically run simultaneously (and votes are also cast simultaneously, and in the same section), this allows us to estimate coattail effects by keeping all characteristics of the down-ballot (state legislature) election constant (by including neighboring section pairs fixed effects), while observing variations in the strength of the candidate for the local executive (municipal) office. We estimate that a one percentage point increase in votes for the municipal candidate from a party translates, on average, into a 0.4 to 0.8 percentage point increase in vote share for the legislative candidate from the same party. Nonetheless, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that coattails are very unlikely to have flipped any of the local congressional election results in our sample.====We then explore the potential forces driving these effects. First, we explore how the ==== for each party in the legislative election changes when the strength of other parties increases at the municipal level. We find that a substantial part of the coattail effect is driven by a reduction in the total number of votes for the competing candidates, implying that a considerable fraction of the effect is driven by individuals switching their vote decision in the legislative election, rather than simply an increase in turnout. Given that we observe the largest coattails for the parties with the lowest chances of winning the election (and that our estimates suggest that the winner of the local congressional elections was not affected by coattail effects), we argue that it is unlikely that the desire for coordination between the municipal authorities and state legislatures can drive the effect. And finally, using the availability of data on TV and radio reception at the level of the electoral precinct, we present evidence that our estimates remain unchanged when information flows among each pair of neighboring precincts is larger.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing empirical literature on coattail effects in a variety of contexts, discussing the underlying identifying assumptions behind these estimations. Section 3 describes the setting and the empirical strategy used in this paper to identify coattails. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 explores the forces behind coattails we estimate.

In this paper, we explore the consequences to taxation of democratic reversal using the systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans in the US South between 1880 and 1910. Following the federally-imposed extension of the franchise to the former slaves during Reconstruction (1865–1877), Southern states erected a series of legal restrictions, such as literacy tests and ","While many of the foundational theories in political economy predict that democratization should lead to a rise in redistributive taxation (e.g., Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000; Boix, 2003), the redistributional and fiscal consequences of democracy remains unresolved. ==== The vast empirical literature investigating this relationship, however, is based almost exclusively in contexts of democratization. Yet what are the consequences of democratic reversals? Does a reversal lead to fiscal consolidation, lower taxation and less redistribution?====In this paper, we contribute to this broader debate in political economy by investigating the effects on taxation from the adoption of suffrage restrictions that largely disenfranchised millions of African Americans in the late 19====-Century U.S. South. The Confederacy's defeat in the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865) resulted in not only the emancipation of millions of slaves, but also in the imposed extension of the franchise to this group, who comprised slightly less than half of the population of the former Confederate states. ==== Southern elites, through the Democratic Party, gradually regained political control of each state and over time erected suffrage restrictions, most notorious of which was the literacy test, aimed at stripping the franchise from African Americans. Between 1889 and 1908, every former Confederate state enacted these restrictions, largely removing the ==== political rights of African Americans.====We leverage a few key features of this episode to empirically examine the impact of black disenfranchisement on the size of Southern state and local governments. For one, the period of our study, 1880 to 1910, is an era of large-scale state and local fiscal expansion across US states (Wallis, 2000). By focusing on democratic reversal in a period of fiscal expansion, we are much less likely to be capturing a spurious correlation between democratic reversal and declines in taxation. Second, due to slavery and the lack of meaningful redistribution of economic assets following emancipation, African Americans were significantly poorer on average than Southern whites (e.g., Ransom and Sutch, 2001). Hence, this group's systematic disenfranchisement should cause a dramatic shift of the median (eligible) voter up the income distribution. Yet the heterogeneous spatial distribution of the post-Civil War African-American population meant that the magnitude of this negative shock varied enormously. In some counties, the effective electorate was cut by more than half, while in heavily white counties it was largely unchanged.==== Therefore, the electoral consequences of this reversal should be largely proportionate to the share of a locality's population who were African American. Unlike the cross-national literature which typically relies on categorical indices to measure regime type, the racialized nature of Southern disenfranchisement allows us to precisely measure the local effect of these restrictions on the magnitude of the “reversal”.====Our empirical strategy therefore exploits both variation across states in the timing of the restrictions' enactment and the highly uneven spatial distribution of African Americans across counties to identify the effects of this large-scale shrinking of the electorate on local taxation. Specifically, we construct a county-level panel of real per capita taxes between 1880 and 1910. We then estimate a difference-in-differences model with heterogeneous treatments in which we leverage the differential timing across states in the adoption of these disenfranchising restrictions - especially literacy tests - and spatial variation in black population share to measure the fiscal consequences of disenfranchisment.====In our baseline models, which include county fixed effects and state-specific time trends, we find strong evidence that the presence of a state-imposed literacy test interacted with a county's black-population share prior to disenfranchisement (i.e., in 1880) is negatively correlated with a county's total per capita state and local taxation. Specifically, once a literacy test requirement was introduced, an increase in 1880 county black population share by one standard deviation was associated with a nearly 5.4% decrease in real per capita total tax receipts. While this finding is strongly consistent with the “====” hypothesis, we also find that in low black-population share urban counties, the onset of the literacy-test restriction is followed by an ==== in overall per capita taxation. This increase, which we show is due in part to a post-restriction shift in the burden of state taxation onto the urban counties within these states, reveals additional consequences of large-scale changes in the size of the electorate.====Next, we test other implications of the redistributionist thesis of democratization. For one, declining tax revenues may not necessarily result in less redistribution if reductions in public spending primarily occurs on non-redistributive goods. We test for this possibility by examining public spending on education, especially public inputs into education spending on African Americans. We show that the adoption of the literacy test interacted with county black-population share is highly correlated with falling public spending on black educational inputs. We also test whether the adoption of the literacy test affected the composition of taxation. Aidt and Jensen (2009), for instance, argue that enfranchisement should not only lead to more taxation, but also a shift of the burden taxation away from indirect taxes to direct taxes borne primarily by the wealthy. We show that the adoption of literacy tests coincided with a shift in state taxes away from direct taxation, such as ==== property taxes, towards indirect taxation, such as excise taxes on alcohol and professional licensing fees.====We conduct a series of robustness tests to verify our claim that the decline in tax revenues is working through the channel of African-American disenfranchisement. First, to reduce the likelihood of bias induced by measurement error, we test whether this finding is robust to using other types of suffrage restrictions, such as poll taxes, as well as other measures of the extent of local disenfranchisement. We find that the adoption of other voting restrictions is also strongly correlated with declining tax revenues.====A second set of robustness tests address concerns that our findings are biased by omitted factors. While the reversal of black political rights was facilitated by changes in the federal-level partisan environment (which we provide more detail about below), the timing of the adoption of suffrage restrictions by each state is endogenous. We therefore conduct numerous additional robustness checks to assuage these concerns. For one, we estimate a long-differences model taking changes in taxation instead of levels over the entire period of our panel.==== We again find that county black-population share is highly negatively correlated with the change in county-level taxation over 20- and 30-year periods. In order to test whether we are simply capturing anti-African-American (i.e., racist) preferences, we show that counties voting against the referenda calling for the adoption of disenfranchising literacy tests also experienced a reduction in taxation that is proportional to its black-population share. Finally, we perform a dynamic panel model that tests whether a county-specific trend (that also varies with black share) is correlated with taxation. We show that such a trend fails to capture the underlying relationship between state-imposed voting restrictions, county black-population share and per capita taxation.====A third set of robustness tests concerns the comparability of counties in literacy-test states with those who did not enact suffrage restrictions. To address this concern of uncommon covariate support between counties in treatment and non-treatment states, we match observations on covariates in 1910 using a genetic matching estimator (Diamond and Sekhon, 2013). We also estimate the model on various samples, including only the counties in the 7 states that adopted the literacy test requirement. Across each test, we find a consistently negative relationship between black disenfranchisement and taxation.====Our findings have important implications for the core redistributionist theories of democracy (e.g., Boix, 2003; Meltzer and Richard, 1981; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000). If democratization leads to a shift of the median voter down the income distribution, then widespread ==== of the poorest members of society should lead to a new median voter who is much higher up the income distribution. As a result, the demand for redistributive taxation from the post-reversal median voter should decline and lead to lower taxation. Our findings strongly support this implication of the canonical redistributionist view of democracy, which has been increasingly challenged on both theoretical and empirical grounds (e.g., Ansell and Samuels, 2014; Lizzeri and Persico, 2004; Congleton, 2007; Scheve and Stasavage, 2010). Yet our data allows us to go farther and explore the mechanisms by which this happens. We find that not only does disenfranchisement lead to less redistributive taxation, but that also a shift occurs in the burden of non-local taxation onto the South's few urban areas. We demonstrate several channels by which this shift occurs.====Our paper joins a growing empirical literature using subnational data, especially from the US, to investigate this and other unresolved questions in political economy (Aggeborn, 2016; Cascio and Washington, 2013; Go and Lindert, 2010; Ramcharan, 2010; Nunn, 2008; Nikolova and Nikolova, 2017; Husted and Kenny, 1997; Aidt et al., 2010). Our ability to investigate the fiscal impact of large-scale disenfranchisement using sub-national units - in this case, more than a thousand counties across the South - is one of the few studies to use highly disaggregated local-level data to study this question.==== Furthermore, whether using cross-national (Acemoglu et al., 2014; Aidt and Eterovic, 2011), cross-state (Husted and Kenny, 1997) or across municipalities (e.g., Aidt et al., 2010), most if not all study the fiscal consequences of large-scale suffrage ====.==== Our evidence complements the findings of Naidu (2012), who shows that the adoption of suffrage restrictions in the South lead to declines in African-American voter turnout and public education inputs relative to whites, as well as rising values of economic assets owned by whites. Our results therefore provide additional evidence to the literature investigating the welfare consequences to African Americans from the Southern policies of systematic civil, economic and political inequality.====This paper proceeds as follows. We first provide some historical context in order to demonstrate the applicability of this case for exploring this key unresolved puzzle in political economy. We then provide a theoretical framework connecting this case with the political economy literature on democratization. We conclude by presenting our evidence that systematic disenfranchisement of African-Americans lead to substantial declines in the size of the southern fiscal state, thus providing empirical support for the redistributionist hypothesis.",Democratic reversals and the size of government,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018300594,10 October 2018,2018,Research Article,290.0

Specifically, we investigate whether inflation-tolerant central bank governors are associated with higher levels of IU than inflation-averse governors and whether IU increases during discretionary policy regimes.====While previous studies on the macroeconomic determinants of IU usually employed monthly measures of uncertainty, we opt for a measure that varies at the yearly frequency. Our new measure of long-run IU is based on the conditional variance of a two-component Spline-GARCH model.==== Since the potential effects of changes in monetary policy regimes on IU are most clearly visible at a low-frequency (Friedman, 1961; Ball and Cecchetti, 1990), our approach allows for a clean identification of such effects.====The empirical analysis covers a cross section of 17 developed economies and the period 1975 to 2015. In a first step, we separately estimate a Spline-GARCH model for the inflation series of each country and construct our measure of long-run IU. In a second step, we analyze the relation between long-run IU and its potential determinants in a seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) model that allows for cross-country dependencies and unobserved characteristics of the IU process which vary across economies and time.====Within the SUR framework, we first test the Ball (1992) hypothesis that IU concerning the next period will be high if current period inflation is high and an inflation-tolerant governor is currently in power. Economically, IU is high in such a situation because there is uncertainty about the central bank's willingness to disinflate (see Ball, 1992). We follow Sturm and De Haan (2001) and Dreher et al. (2008, 2010) and relate a governor's degree of inflation-tolerance or -aversion to his appointment date. That is, we regard governors who are appointed under liberal governments as inflation-tolerant as opposed to the presumably inflation-averse governors appointed under other types of governments. This classification is in the spirit of Lohmann (1998) who argues that “politicians may use their powers of appointment to ensure that central bank appointees share their electoral and party-political goals” (see also Nordhaus, 1975; Samuelson, 1977; Alesina and Sachs, 1988, or Berger and Woitek, 2005). Indeed, we find that long-term IU significantly increases if inflation-tolerant governors are in power during high-inflation periods. The joint effect of inflation and its interaction with the preferences of monetary policy is markedly stronger than the influence of inflation in isolation, which is a commonly adopted means of explaining IU in the empirical literature.====Second, we distinguish between rules-based and discretionary monetary policy regimes in the sense of Taylor (2012). Operationally, we measure the deviation from a rules-based policy by the deviation from the Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993): If the actual policy rate set by the central bank is below/above the rate implied by the Taylor rule, we consider the policy regime as dovish/hawkish.==== Empirically, we find that IU is higher during periods in which monetary policy is classified as dovish. Interestingly, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) reported that for several countries – which are included in our study – market expectations of future policy rates were recently below the trajectory prescribed by the Taylor rule and argues that the “the risk of normalizing too late and too gradually should not be underestimated” (BIS, 2014, p.101). Our findings suggest that such risks could materialize in terms of higher levels of long-run IU.====In addition, we provide strong evidence that a higher level of volatility in exchange rates and the stock market increases long-run IU. The latter result complements the findings in Engle and Rangel (2008) and Conrad and Loch (2015).====We consider several extensions and robustness checks. In particular, we provide evidence that our new measure of long-run IU is more appropriate than alternative measures such as ex-post inflation variability. Alternative measures can be considered as more noisy proxies of ex-ante IU which makes it more difficult to establish a relationship between inflation-tolerant/averse governors and long-run IU. Further, we show that long-run IU is lower in countries with a higher degree of central bank independence.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Over the last two decades, it proved frustratingly complicated to strike the right balance between three essential properties of sound fiscal policy rules: simplicity, flexibility, and enforceability. Simplicity has been sacrificed to ensure that more contingent (i.e. flexible) rules remained enforceable. The resulting arrangements have failed to adequately guide fiscal policy, undermining formal compliance, and ultimately, popular and political support for rules. To mitigate the risk that countries abandon rules-based policymaking, we suggest downplaying enforceability—i.e. the role of formal sanctions through enforcement—and enhancing the reputational costs of breaching rules. At the limit, the rule could consist of a simple quantitative benchmark for a key fiscal indicator. To boost reputational effects, independent fiscal councils should focus on debunking the “fiscal alchemy,” clearing the public debate from partisan smokescreens, and fostering popular support for sound fiscal policies.","The demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 inaugurated two decades of high inflation and rising public debts. As theory linked expansionary policy biases to policymakers' distorted incentives under discretion,==== interest in rules-based policy making grew. Even though theory framed the debate in terms of “rules vs. discretion,” it was clear that in practice, a regime predicated on mechanical policy adjustments dictated by a rule would be as suboptimal as unconstrained discretion (King, 1997). Thus, the concrete problem underlying the design of rules-based policy frameworks never was to find the optimal state-contingent rule, but to devise practical mechanisms containing the dark side of discretion—such as a neglect for long-term outcomes—while preserving the bright side of it—i.e. the ability to quickly respond to unforeseen developments.====In the monetary realm, failures to stick to quantitative limits on the growth of monetary aggregates (in the 1980s) favored the spread of inflation targeting (IT). Under IT, politically independent central banks are primarily mandated to achieve price stability expressed as a numerical goal for the rate of inflation. While policy instruments are not subject to any binding rule, the goal of achieving the inflation target over the medium-term shapes current policy decisions. Since the early 1990s, successful IT regimes have proliferated, keeping inflation expectations anchored around the target and providing ample room for active stabilization policy in the short-term.====Rule-based fiscal frameworks came later (see e.g. Wyplosz, 2005; Taylor, 2013, or Wren-Lewis, 2013), and often after the formal adoption of IT (Combes et al., 2018). Historically confined to subnational governments,==== fiscal rules only became the norm at the central level among the first group of European countries committed to adopt the euro (in the 1990s). Beyond Western Europe, rules-based fiscal policy became increasingly popular after the turn of the century as more countries felt the need to reduce their public debt (Budina et al., 2012).====In their most advanced form, fiscal frameworks combine numerical rules affecting key fiscal indictors with transparency requirements, strict budgetary procedures, and more recently, independent fiscal institutions (“fiscal councils”) monitoring adherence to the numerical rules and assisting in their implementation. By setting quantitative limits on aggregate indicators such as government debt, the budget deficit and public expenditure growth, fiscal rules aim at making deviations from these limits sufficiently costly to deter excesses. Costs include both formal sanctions and reputation losses associated with the breach of public commitments. Effective fiscal rules guide discretion in the short term and make future fiscal trajectories more predictable. Hence, successful fiscal rules create policy space in the short run because better anchored expectations reduce the risk of financial market stress whenever significant public sector borrowing is required.====The potential role of independent fiscal councils to constrain fiscal discretion, often alongside fiscal rules, has been acknowledged more recently (e.g. Beetsma and Debrun, 2018). The appetite for such institutions quickly grew after the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008–9 (Debrun et al., 2013; Kopits, 2011). Whereas existing institutions operate primarily as watchdogs alerting stakeholders in the budget process, proposals to give them teeth have received new attention, notably in the form of a right to set binding deficit limits for the government (e.g. Wyplosz, 2005) or to use specific fiscal levers to preserve public debt sustainability and promote fiscal stabilization (e.g. Basso and Costain, 2017, or Larch and Braendle, 2018, in the context of the European Union, and earlier proposals by Gruen, 1997, among others).====Our sense of the vast empirical literature on the determinants of monetary and fiscal policies is that explicit institutional constraints on discretion have on average contributed to improve policy outcomes. Central bank independence—and IT in particular—is widely credited for maintaining low and stable inflation in advanced as well as developing economies (see e.g. Gonçalves and Carvalho, 2009; Walsh, 2009; or Combes et al., 2018). Although great caution remains in causally linking the adoption of fiscal rules to lower public deficits and less procyclical budgets (Heinemann et al., 2018), the positive association between adequately constrained fiscal discretion and improved fiscal performance is strong (see Eyraud et al., 2018a, for fiscal rules; Beetsma et al., 2018, for fiscal councils; and Combes et al., 2018, for the combined effects of IT and fiscal rules).====Despite this apparent success, rules-based fiscal policy has been harshly criticized to the point of facing an existential crisis. After the GFC, fiscal rules have been successively deemed too rigid to support the recovery, and too lax to encourage the subsequent consolidation. More broadly, formal compliance with numerical limits has been consistently low, raising questions about the overall usefulness of rules-based frameworks (Eyraud et al., 2018a).====Although threats to rules-based fiscal policy can take various forms, they largely reflect the common presumption that fiscal rules, like traffic laws and speed limits, must be enforced. With enforceability seen as critical, efforts to make rules more flexible (i.e. contingent on a broader set of circumstances) result in more complex, less transparent setups. Escape clauses must be well defined, technical refinements, codified in detail, and the related enforcement loopholes, closed. Of the three basic properties of “good” fiscal rules (simplicity, flexibility and enforceability), only two can be simultaneously achieved. In the end, complex and opaque rules stop being a reliable compass for policymakers, and the temptation to abandon them looms large.====As delegation of fiscal levers to independent institutions is likely to remain off the table in the foreseeable future (e.g. Alesina and Tabellini, 2007; Wren-Lewis, 2013), effectively constraining fiscal discretion requires more effective rules-based frameworks. In a recent note, IMF staff see scope for better combining simplicity, flexibility and enforceability (Eyraud et al., 2018a). They suggest comprehensive reforms that (i) guarantee the internal consistency of fiscal frameworks, (ii) exploit simpler ways to make rules more contingent (e.g. a greater reliance on medium-term expenditure ceilings), and (iii) promote mechanisms raising the reputational costs of non-compliance. These proposals, however, amount to tweak existing parameters, an exercise which, considering recent history, might fall short of mitigating the risk of a return to pure fiscal discretion.====Going beyond parametric adjustments, we propose a less constrained paradigm to guide the design and implementation of fiscal rules. Specifically, we argue that the enforceability of numerical limits should not be a binding constraint. This allows for rules that boil down to quantitative benchmarks whose impact on policy behavior rests solely on tangible reputational costs. In a sense, we suggest being open to so-called “Taylor rules” in the fiscal realm.==== To enhance the reputational effects of such fiscal Taylor rules (FTR), independent fiscal councils would have to be ruthless and vocal watchdogs debunking the “fiscal alchemy,” clearing the public debate from partisan smokescreens, and fostering popular support for sound fiscal policies.====It is worth clarifying two points upfront. First, the FTR idea is not new (see among others Taylor, 2000; Lukkezen and Teulings, 2013; Kliem and Kriwolusky, 2013; and Carnot, 2014). However, the originality of our proposal is to place the FTR at the center of a rules-based fiscal framework, without formal enforcement procedure (nor other traditional fiscal rules), and operating in symbiosis with independent fiscal institutions focused on amplifying the reputational effects of the rule. Second, our proposal is not premised on the claim that enforcement per se is useless and ought to be abandoned. Beyond the credibility of sanctions (or lack thereof), there is arguably a signal embedded in the activation of an enforcement procedure. A country willing to risk even elusive sanctions might reveal an intrinsically weaker commitment to fiscal soundness compared to a country unwilling to take such risk. If so, market participants would take note, and risk premiums would adjust accordingly. As such, enforcement procedures could promote market discipline even if actual sanctions are a low-probability event. That interpretation is consistent with the higher sovereign spreads resulting from entering the Excessive Deficit Procedure under the EU Stability and Growth Pact (Eyraud et al., 2018a).====In the end, our qualm with the central role of enforcement in the current paradigm is that it can produce rules sufficiently opaque and intractable to threaten rules-based policy itself. Thus, the key differences between the current paradigm and our proposal consist in (i) breaking any mechanical link between the breach of a numerical limit and the threat of sanctions emanating from opaque procedures and arcane numerology, and (ii) actively amplifying reputational effects of rules through independent watchdogs. Our point is not that an FTR-based framework is always and everywhere preferable, but that it can offer a viable option for countries where the traditional speed-limit view of rules has failed or does not seem politically palatable. Our proposal and the underlying analysis are in the spirit of Bénassy-Quéré et al. (2018) who call for “====”====The rest of this paper first elaborates on the trilemma that makes legally enforceable rules either too rigid or too complicated (Section 2). We then discuss the extent to which such a restricted paradigm can threaten rules-based fiscal policy itself (Section 3).

In turn, two groups of agents (third-party reporting and self-reported income) are keen to evade taxes unlawfully but have limited information on how many ==== evade taxes; their tax morale is therefore an endogenous function of agents' perception on tax compliance.

Abrupt political changes might well result in a window of opportunity to implement pro-market reforms, such as the enforcement of property rights within the rule of law, broad access to those rights and predictable rules uniformly enforced by courts and regulators, all elements of a democratic society. However, the transition process has witnessed a variety of illegal activities, such as tax evasion, asset-stripping, self-dealing, consumption of perks, outright expropriation of shareholders, tunnelling, creative accounting, opportunistic managerial behaviour, and lobbying to limit active monitoring, to name a few. Some politicians and managers maintained control over physical capital from the planned economy but did not pay full market prices for those privatised assets (Campos and Giovannoni (2006)). This phenomenon was a clear infringement of the rule of law. Indeed, the ‘rule of law’ in this respect has hardly emerged in some economies such as Russia or Ukraine, where high levels of corruption - a reflection of the absence of the rule of law - are still an unpleasant reality (Levin and Satarov (2000)).====Schneider and Enste (2000),==== Schneider (2005), Schneider (2017) and Frey and Torgler (2007) document how the evolution of the shadow economy around the world as well in transition economies from the 1990s - the first decade of the transformation process towards a market economy - was paralleled by an increase in tax evasion, resembling a pattern closer to underdeveloped African and South American countries rather than highly developed OECD economies. As shown in Table 1, from 1991 to 2015 the estimated shadow economy in transition countries amounted to 35% of GDP on average, compared to 9% in the United States. This average masks substantial cross-country variation, ranging from 16% in the Slovak Republic, now an EU country, to 65% in Georgia, a former Soviet Union (FSU) country; yet it is still a clear indication of the overall magnitude of the phenomenon. Considering the states that are EU members as a cluster, they score much better than the FSU countries overall, not only on the shadow economy indicator, but also on three important institutional context variables such as the Corruption Perception Index, the Polity 2 index, and rents from natural resources.====Slemrod (2007) has looked into the details of the economics of tax evasions in major advanced economies like the United States. In line with the literature, the author concludes that deterrence and the rule of law - key elements of a full-fledged tax enforcement strategy - enhance tax compliance, which is defined as the lack of both tax evasion and tax avoidance. This paper links the two concepts - tax enforcement and tax (non-)compliance - to a third notable phenomenon which has recently received a lot of attention in the public economics literature: tax morale. Tax morale can be defined as voluntary compliance with tax law and creating a social norm of compliance, as in Luttmer and Singhal (2014), a notable literature review on the mechanisms through which tax morale operates in the context of difficult tax enforcement and compliance.====At the start of the transition process, some scholars (e.g. Boycko and Vishny (1995)) argued that applying the rule of law was a second order phenomenon, meaning that as soon as property rights became sufficiently widespread (despite the fact that they were not yet protected), citizens and economic agents like firms and corporations would form political constituencies acting as social pressure groups. In turn, lobbies would compel politicians to adopt policies with the aim of protecting precisely those property rights, such as tax compliance. These authors' stance has been challenged by Hoff and Stiglitz (2004) and Hoff and Stiglitz (2008), who argue that the probability distribution of the political outcome depends on the fraction of the population that chooses to build value, which itself depends on the probability of the political outcome. This concept of ‘conditional cooperation’ (see Traxler (2010) and Frey and Torgler (2007)) fits the context of transition economies. In other words the relationship between tax enforcement, tax evasion and tax morale is conditional upon a particular historical context, i.e. the transition from planned to market economy, where political institutions tend to change very slowly.====In light of these ideas, this paper develops a theoretical model of tax enforcement, tax compliance and tax morale where a key role is played by the institutional context. A fully-functioning institutional context could favour tax enforcement via deterrence and the rule of law. However, the emergence of tax enforcement and tax compliance will be jointly and endogenously determined by tax morale through the role of imperfections in information, that is, through deviations from the traditional expected utility theory on tax evasion, as in Allingham and Sandmo (1972), where it is assumed that all economic agents are fully informed.====For this purpose, we model the behaviour of agents who strategically evaluate whether to pay taxes or avoid doing so (e.g. by stripping assets, tunnelling and/or under-reporting income). Imperfect information on institutional quality (e.g. of the court system and, broadly speaking, of political institutions) entails a misperception of other players' actions. The model predicts that whenever there is high uncertainty over the proportion of agents evading taxes (as occurs, for instance, in institutionally weak societies) and the sunk costs the government must sustain for tax enforcement are high, we observe a convergence towards low tax morale and low tax compliance. If institutions are sound and tax evasion is costly (as would be the case given an efficient judiciary), then tax morale rises spontaneously.====This paper is organised as follows: section 2 reviews the pertinent literature; section 3 presents the building blocks of the model; the model is solved for the equilibrium under perfect information in section 4, the benchmark case, and then for imperfect information in section 5, the fully-fledged model. Concluding points are then expressed in section 6.","Tax enforcement, tax compliance and tax morale in transition economies: A theoretical model",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017304329,January 2019,2019,Research Article,294.0

I do so by utilizing the mismatch between U.S. television markets and state borders, causing some citizens to receive local television which primarily covers neighboring state politics. I find that access to relevant local television causes citizens to be more informed about their senators' roll-call votes, and more likely to hold opinions about these senators. I also find that citizens with access to relevant local television are more likely to assess their senators based on how well the senators' roll-call votes align with the citizens' policy preferences. These results suggest that passively acquired information through television can help individuals evaluate their elected representatives.","Television is the primary source of political information for many citizens, especially for those with limited education (Graber, 2006). Nevertheless, its value has been contested, where some scholars have criticized it for providing low news content, with a focus on entertainment rather than information. To what extent should we therefore expect television to be useful in providing political information to citizens? And if so, will citizens make use of this information when evaluating their elected officials?====In this paper, I study the causal effect of access to relevant local television on U.S. citizens' political knowledge and their ability to use this information when evaluating their senators for the actions these senators take in office. I do so by utilizing a natural experiment in the local television market. Some citizens have access to local television primarily covering a neighboring state, leading them to receive news about the “wrong” senators. I use this misalignment between states and local television markets to study whether access to relevant local television makes citizens more likely to know how their senators vote in the Senate. I also study whether television access makes citizens more likely to evaluate the senators based on these senators' roll-call votes. To carry out the analysis, I combine large-scale survey data with data on the structure of the local television markets.====I find that local television stations heavily bias their coverage of senators to focus more on the senators of the primary state of the media market, while spending comparatively less time on senators from other states within that media market. This biased coverage leads citizens living in counties in the primary state (in-state counties) to be more informed about their senators' roll-call votes, compared to citizens in counties of other states (out-of-state counties). I find some evidence that this increased knowledge makes citizens more likely to base their evaluation of the senators on their own policy preferences: Compared to citizens in out-of-state counties, citizens in in-state counties are more likely to approve of senators whose roll-call votes align with the citizens' preferences, while being less likely to approve of senators whose roll-call votes are at odds with the citizens' preferences. I also present suggestive evidence that the effect is stronger for individuals with less interest in politics, implying that television can play a role in reaching individuals who do not consume much other political news.====To identify the causal effect of access to relevant local television, I use entropy balancing (Hainmueller, 2012) to ensure exact balance of observable county characteristics. To address concerns about selection on unobservables, I perform a large number of placebo tests which suggest that access to relevant local television has no or small effects on knowledge and opinions about nationwide politics.====The results in this paper contribute to several strands of the literature. There exists a large literature studying the relationship between mass media coverage and voter information, both in political science and, more recently, in economics. Early studies in political science typically failed to identify significant effects of mass media on voter knowledge (Bartels, 1993), and especially television was singled out because of its relatively low informational content, and the fact that television viewers tend to have little political information. However, the negative correlation between television consumption and voter information could mask positive effects for more marginalized groups (Morgan and Shanahan, 1992; Price and Zaller, 1993; Prior, 2006). The more recent literature in political economy has instead turned to quasi-experimental approaches utilizing natural experiments to deal with the issue of self-selection into media consumption (overviews are provided by Prat and Strömberg, 2011 and Strömberg, 2015a).====Television differs from other media, such as newspapers and radio, in that it contains relatively little political information. Because of this fact, previous literature has found that the effect of television depends crucially on the existing media environment. For instance, Gentzkow (2006) finds that the introduction of television in the U.S. decreased both voter information and voter turnout, due to television crowding out high-information media, such as radio and newspapers. In contrast, Oberholzer-Gee and Waldfogel (2009) find that Spanish-language television news increase voter turnout among Hispanics. DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) find that the introduction of Fox News in the late 1990s increased both turnout and the Republican presidential vote share, while Schroeder and Stone (2015) find that Fox News had limited impact on political knowledge. Finally, Garz (2018) finds that retirees increase their level of political knowledge due to increased media consumption, where television is one of the media which is consumed more after retiring. For results from outside the U.S., Prat and Strömberg (2005) contend that the introduction of commercial television in Sweden, who mainly attracted relatively uninformed voters, increased voter information, while Enikolopov et al. (2011) argue that the availability of a government-independent television station in Russia decreased both turnout and support for the government party.====Several papers have studied how television affects how citizens hold their representatives accountable for their actions in office, Larreguy et al. (2014) find that Mexican mayors revealed to be corrupt loose more votes for each additional local television, or radio, station available.==== In addition, Fergusson (2014) finds that voters are more likely to punish U.S. senators for receiving special interest contributions when they have access to relevant local television. These papers focus on how television helps citizens holding the incumbent accountable for rent-seeking behavior or influence from special interests. In contrast, in this paper I analyze whether television affects citizens' ability to evaluate their politicians for the policy positions these politicians take in office.====Specifically, I study whether television helps citizens evaluate their senators based on how well their own policy preferences correspond to the voting behavior of their senators. The notion that voters evaluate politicians based on the extent to which they agree with the politicians' policy positions is at the core of many models in political economy, going back to, at the very least, Downs (1957b) and the median voter model. While theoretically appealing, a large literature in political science has discussed whether voters are sufficiently informed to make such judgments. Some scholars have argued that voters with limited knowledge can use cognitive shortcuts to emulate “fully informed” behavior (e.g., Downs, 1957a; Popkin et al., 1976; McKelvey and Ordeshook, 1986; Conover and Feldman, 1989). The idea is that while voters are unlikely to possess all relevant information about the policy positions of politicians, it is sufficient to observe some simple shortcuts, such as party label. A voter who identifies as a Democrat need only observe which candidate is a Democrat and vote accordingly. Any additional information is not going to change the vote decision in any significant way.====In contrast, there are empirical findings that more informed voters exhibit different voting patterns, and are more likely to vote for politicians whose policy positions are closest to the voters (e.g., Bartels, 1996; Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996; Jessee, 2009; Nordin, 2014). The extent to which access to television increases the prevalence of “fully informed” behavior depends both on whether television increases voter information as well as whether voters use this information when evaluating their politicians. In this paper, I address both of these questions. Furthermore, much of the conclusions in this literature are based on correlations between voter information and political behavior. The empirical strategy used in this paper allows me to deal with potential self-selection concerns in terms of media consumption and information acquisition.====Finally, I also relate to the literature on how the mismatch between electoral districts and media markets affect political outcomes (Campbell et al., 1984; Niemi et al., 1986; Stewart III and Reynolds, 1990; Snyder and Strömberg, 2010; Lim et al., 2015). Snyder and Strömberg (2010) study the congruence between newspaper markets and congressional districts. They find that newspapers cause citizens to be more informed about their House representative, affecting voter turnout and causing the representative to exert greater effort in Congress. My study differs from Snyder and Strömberg (2010) on a couple of important points. First, there is a significant difference between newspapers and television, where the former is generally considered to be more informative. On the other hand, television has the potential of reaching individuals with less interest in politics, thereby providing information to a group of citizens unlikely to acquire it in other ways. Second, in this study I explicitly focus on citizens' policy preferences, and whether more information about the representatives' policy positions affects the way citizens evaluate their politicians. The empirical strategy used in this paper relates most closely to Ansolabehere et al. (2006) and Fergusson (2014), who both make a similar division into in-state and out-of-state counties as I do in this paper, in their studies of the incumbency advantage and voter responses to special interest contributions.","Local television, citizen knowledge and U.S. senators' roll-call voting",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017304780,January 2019,2019,Research Article,295.0

To explain lobbying effectiveness, I introduce a new measure into Grossman and Helpman's (1994, American Economic Review 84: 833–850) model of protection-for-sale (PFS). Differences in effectiveness are explained on the basis that some groups make a better case for protection by sending a signal regarding information they possess and that is considered by policy makers before setting trade policies. I begin by estimating a standard PFS model for India using a measure of political organization, a common approach in the empirical literature on PFS. To overcome the need to define such a binary political organization variable, I then use panel data to estimate the new measure of relative lobbying effectiveness. For the most effective sectors, a high output to import ratio translates into higher trade protection; for the least effective sectors, higher output to import ratio translates into lower trade protection. Examining some of the political economy influences on lobbying effectiveness, I find that producing similar goods reduces the positive effect of geographical proximity on effectiveness. Hence, within a sector, firms in close proximity and producing similar goods compete to lobby rather than cooperating or free-riding.","Despite the economics profession's attachment to the policy of free trade, protection is still common, and among the questions it still poses is ‘why do some sectors receive higher trade protection than others?’ A seminal contribution to this question is Grossman (1994) protection-for-sale (PFS) model, which has spawned a large empirical literature.==== However, this literature is not without its limitations, either conceptually or practically, especially as far as developing countries, lacking data on political contributions or lobbying, are concerned – see, for example, Gawande et al. (2015). The main contribution of this paper is to address one of these limitations– the need to decide exogenously which sectors lobby; I do so for Indian manufacturing, applying the PFS model to panel data spanning 1990 to 2007.====The standard PFS model treats the ability to advocate for protection as exogenously given by a sectors' political organization. Organization is a binary indicator, such that some sectors are fully organized to lobby and the rest are unorganized. A substantial part of the empirical literature makes use of this binary approach,==== but it implies that only the existence of a lobby matters (Eicher and Osang, 2002) and that there are no differences within the sets of organized and unorganized industries, due, say, to different degrees of free-riding within different organizations. The standard PFS model also assumes that the government places the same value on political contributions from every sector of the economy, yet both theorizing (Hillman, 1989) and experience suggest otherwise. For example, the political asymmetries between expanding and contracting sectors can easily create biases – e.g. as in Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2007).====In this paper, I introduce what I term ==== into the PFS model, based on the government placing different weights on the political contributions from different sectors.==== Varying weights have been introduced in earlier literature such as Maggi and Rodrıguez-Clare (2000), who assign different weights for producers and importers to reflect their different lobbying strengths, and Swinnen and Vandemoortele (2011), who also include lobbying by consumers.==== In this paper, on the other hand, lobbying effectiveness varies across sectors, and results in the government applying different weights to the contributions from different sectors.==== Taking this modified PFS framework to panel data for India, I overcome the need to define a binary variable for political organization by introducing a continuous measure. This measure is estimated using PFS' sector-specific relationships between trade protection and import penetration, revealing sector-specific lobbying effectiveness.====India provides a good case study for the new, modified, PFS framework. First, while India has always acknowledged the importance of the international trading system, it has equally always stressed domestic political imperatives in determining trade policy. Second, India has historically had among the highest trade barriers in the world, so that inter-sectoral differences are easily observable. Third, while the reforms of 1991 were essentially apolitical, having been imposed by the IMF, subsequent multilateral and unilateral reforms arose from domestic political processes and thus permitted significant differences across sectors.====There is, however, a major challenge in applying the standard PFS model to India – there are no lobbying data and so no easy (even if approximate) way of dividing sectors into organized and unorganized sets. Cadot et al. (2007) and Cadot et al. (2014) overcome this problem by estimating PFS using a multi-stage iterative procedure based on grid-search to generate an organization variable. Bown and Tovar (2011), on the other hand, confirm the PFS hypothesis for 1990 and 2000–2002 in India, treating an industry as organized if it lists membership of at least five organizations in the World Guide to trade associations for 1995 (Zils and Verrel, 1995). In the first part of this paper, I apply the approach of the latter authors to my sample from 1990 to 2007, but make use of a new measure of organization for lobbying reflecting the proportion of firms in a sector that belong to apex industry associations which have strong links with government.====In the main part of the paper, I pursue a completely different approach. Despite the absence of data, lobbying, especially lobbying to convey information, undoubtedly occurs in India. The application of the PFS model to the United States, based on (measured) political contributions, has focused less on the informational channel through which lobbies can influence policy, although Facchini et al. (2011) have suggested it and Lake (2015) has attempted to unpack it. I place it at the center of the PFS framework, explaining lobbying effectiveness in India, arguing that such information signals are useful to policy makers and help to engender government responsiveness to industry concerns. Using this modification of the standard PFS model, I estimate lobbying effectiveness directly from panel data, and thus overcome the need to define political organization a priori. Finally, I ask, for I believe the first time in a developing country, what determines lobbying effectiveness in terms of potential resource advantages, such as geographical concentration, intra-sectoral heterogeneity and opportunities to interact with the government. I find, inter alia, that, within a sector, firms in close proximity producing similar goods compete to lobby rather than cooperating with each other or free-riding.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the theoretical framework of the modified PFS model with lobbying effectiveness. Section 3 presents the econometric models, data and methodology, followed by the PFS and effectiveness results in section 4. Section 5 examines the question of what determines lobbying effectiveness.

Based on 51 fiscal rules in force in EU member states from 1995 to 2015, the analysis identifies determinants among specific rule characteristics and their fiscal frameworks, as well as their political, (socio-)economic and supranational environments. While the average compliance across all rules and countries is around 50%, compliance with rules constraining stock (rather than flow) variables, set out in coalitional agreements, as well as rules covering larger parts of general government ==== is significantly higher. Furthermore, independent monitoring and enforcement bodies (issuing real-time alerts) turn out to be significantly associated with a higher probability of compliance. Several theories of the deficit bias of governments due to government fragmentation, decentralization and political budget cycles are also significant with regards to compliance with fiscal rules. However, neither the economic environment or business cycle, nor forecast errors (except for an unexpectedly higher primary balance) on average seem to play a significant role.","In recent years, the EU member states decided to significantly strengthen their supranational and national fiscal frameworks. This has been especially true for the “so called” Six-pack==== and Two-pack regulations==== at the EU level, as well as the Fiscal Compact==== at the national level, which introduced new measures designed to lead to more fiscal sustainability. Key elements of this new EU fiscal framework are numerical fiscal rules, also at the national level, restricting the discretion of governments. The following quotes show that the new legislation emphasizes specific characteristics and supporting measures, such as the legal basis of fiscal rules or the institutions monitoring and enforcing them.====The new initiatives shifted the optimal design of fiscal rules and their effects into the focus of public and academic debate. The theoretical rationale for introducing fiscal rules is well established and based on the theory of the deficit bias of politicians and governments (see e.g. Wyplosz, 2012 or Debrun et al., 2008 for an overview).====In empirical studies, the general effects of fiscal rules on public finances seem widely accepted. Various papers show that the introduction of fiscal rules leads among other factors to lower fiscal deficits (see e.g. Heinemann et al., 2016, for a meta-analysis), lower sovereign interest rate spreads (e.g. Heinemann et al., 2014; Iara and Wolff, 2014), lower output volatility (e.g. Fatas and Mihov, 2006) or more fiscal space (e.g. Nerlich and Reuter, 2015). Those and similar studies analyse the effects of introducing or strengthening fiscal rules (depending on various characteristics of those rules) on macroeconomic and fiscal variables independent of the countries' compliance with its fiscal rules.====This paper does not analyse the effects of (the introduction of) fiscal rules, but contributes to the literature by providing one of the first analysis of actual compliance with various types of national numerical fiscal rules in an empirical framework. Although, as shown in Reuter (2015), actual compliance with fiscal rules might not necessarily be needed for their economic effects, the analysis of the determinants of compliance can shed light on the optimal design and framework of fiscal rules. Assuming fiscal rules were introduced for good reasons (e.g. to overcome the deficit bias of the government or to reduce spillover costs of excessive fiscal deficits) and the numerical limits were set at optimal levels, then compliance with fiscal rules becomes an important issue. Based on a sample of 51 of these rules in the EU28 member states from 1995 to 2015, this paper analyses which features of fiscal rules and their fiscal framework, as well as their political or economic environment are associated with higher probabilities of compliance.====To the best of the authors knowledge, there are only two other studies that analyse the compliance with fiscal rules in a larger sample of countries (Delgado-Téllez et al., 2017, analyse compliance on the subnational level in Spain). Cordes et al. (2015) describe features of compliance with 31 expenditure rules in advanced and emerging economies. By looking at averages of compliance, they find expenditure rules to be complied with more often than other types of fiscal rules, especially if they are set out in coalition agreements or statutory law and entail specific nominal targets. Nevertheless, they do not use their data on compliance with expenditure rules in an econometric framework or to identify determinants of compliance. Frankel and Schreger (2013) look at the (forecast) compliance with the supranational EU rules set out in the Maastricht treaty. They find that the forecasts of governments are biased when a country is in danger of non-compliance with the 3% deficit rule. Furthermore, they show that this bias is smaller in countries with strong national rules as well as independent forecasting institutions.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the sample of fiscal rules and the potential determinants analysed in this paper. In Section 3, some general observations regarding the average compliance statistics of various sub-samples and correlations between fiscal rule characteristics are presented. Section 4 introduces the econometric frameworks which are employed in Section 5 to identify the determinants of compliance.

First, we show that countries belonging to different civilizations have a higher probability of interstate conflict before and after the Cold War period, but not during the Cold War. Second, we explain the differential impact of civilizations on conflict over time by providing evidence that civilizational differences were suppressed during the Cold War by ideology and super-power camps. Third, we provide evidence that the component of civilizations that matters the most for conflict in the post-Cold War period is language, and not religion. Fourth, we analyze the long-term cultural, geographical and historical determinants of civilizational differences, and show that language has the largest explanatory power.","Interstate conflicts are ever-present throughout the history of mankind and understanding their determinants remains important. For instance, primordialist elements such as deep cultural differences might be a key factor in shaping interstate conflict.==== At the same time, the rapidly shifting sociopolitical landscape of the post-1990s shapes the evolution of the influence of cultural differences on interstate conflicts. In his “Clash of Civilizations” thesis, defining a civilization as the broadest level of cultural identity, Huntington (1993a) conjectures that the primary source of conflict in the post-Cold War world will be along civilizational lines.==== Put differently, in the post-Cold War era, cultural fault lines separating the largest blocks of cultural groups - the so-called “civilizations” - will be a cause of conflict. Despite the controversy around Huntington's thesis, there is no conclusive empirical evidence on the very existence of a “clash of civilizations.” Thus, the question remains open. We take Huntington's hypothesis to the data and evaluate how the effect of civilizational differences on interstate conflict evolves over time.====The impact of civilizations and culture on institutions and the economy has been extensively studied.==== In the context of culture and conflict, there are studies on both intrastate and interstate conflict. For example, while Fearon and Laitin (2003) suggest that more ethnically or religiously diverse countries are not more likely to experience civil violence, Ellingsen (2000) argues that ethnic diversity increases the propensity of domestic violence in the post-Cold War period.==== Spolaore and Wacziarg (2016), on the other hand, study the relationship between interstate conflicts and the degree of relatedness across countries.====More specific to Huntington's hypothesis, Russett et al. (2000) and Henderson and Tucker (2001) find that inter-civilizational dyads are less conflict prone in the periods 1950–1992 and 1816–1992. Using data between 1946 and 1997, Chiozza (2002) also argues that states across the civilizational divide do not clash more. Gartzke and Gleditsch (2006), instead, examine the relationship between sharing a cultural heritage and conflict involvement using data on religion, ethnicity and language. They show that, while sharing the same religion reduces the likelihood of conflict between two states, sharing the same ethnicity or the same language increases it.====There is no conclusive general message emerging from the previous studies. While Huntington's thesis has a specific reference to the post-Cold War era, previous studies do not look for a structural break in the relationship between the civilizational divide and interstate conflict before and after the Cold War. Importantly, previous studies do not scrutinize the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the underlying mechanisms of the clash of civilizations in the post-Cold War period as well as on the long-run determinants of civilizational membership.====The objective of this study is fourfold. First, we evaluate the evolving impact of civilizations on militarized interstate disputes in a rigorous econometric framework.==== Evidence from both cross-sectional and panel analyses suggests that a pair of countries belonging to different civilizations have a higher probability of conflict before and after the Cold War period, but not during the Cold War, a finding that runs counter to previous studies (Chiozza, 2002; Gartzke and Gleditsch, 2006; Henderson and Tucker, 2001; Russett et al., 2000). During the post-Cold War era, two countries that belong to different civilizations are on average 63.6 percent more likely to fight than another dyad belonging to the same civilization. In contrast, during the Cold War, there is no statistically significant difference between two such dyads in terms of their propensity to fight. We additionally run a battery of sensitivity analyses. The findings are robust to controlling for temporal dependence, past conflicts,==== geographic, political, military and economic factors. Results are also robust to alternative estimators, alternative dependent variables, alternative Cold War cutoff points, highly conflict-prone dyads, and politically relevant dyads.====Second, we suggest an explanation for the differential impact of civilizations on conflict over time. To that end, we argue that civilizational differences were temporarily suppressed during the Cold War by the ideological competition between the two super-power camps, and that they come to the fore once the Cold War's artificial ideological bipolarity disappears. Pre-Cold War analysis shows that civilizational differences affected conflict involvement before the Cold War started, suggesting that ideology and super-power rivalry temporarily forced civilizational differences into the background only to reemerge after the Cold War ended. Additionally, we show that the impact of different civilizations on the conflict probability in the post-Cold War is stronger for former different Cold War blocs countries. This suggests that the interaction of civilizations and ideological blocs during the Cold War is the reason for the increased impact of different civilizations on conflict after the Cold War ends. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing empirical evidence on the underlying mechanism for the enhanced salience of civilizations in the post-Cold War era.====Third, given the debate on the definition of civilizations, we break down the concept of civilizations into more standard culture measures of religion, language and ethnicity. We show that the component of civilizations that matters the most for conflict in the post-Cold War period is language, and not religion as Huntington (1993a) proclaimed. This is the first attempt to empirically show which components of civilizations matter for conflict.====Fourth, we analyze the long-term cultural, geographical and historical determinants of civilization membership. We show that language, and not religion, has the largest explanatory power - again contrary to Huntington's claim. In addition, geographic variables such as distance and north-south axis, and historical variables such as colonial links explain part of civilizational alignments. This is a novel finding compared to previous studies in that we complement our main findings to better understand what shapes civilizations.====The paper proceeds as follows.

As this has come at a time of high and rising income disparities, policy-makers have fretted about the ==== and personal taxes are the most suited to reduce inequality while at the same time minimizing the equity-efficiency trade-off.","Following the build-up of large public debt stocks in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the ensuing recession, consolidating public finances has become a priority in several advanced economies. As an example, in the Euro Area the structural balance grew from −4.8% of potential GDP in 2009 to −0.9% in 2015. Fiscal policy in the United Kingdom and the United States followed a similar path, with the structural balance ratio being increased respectively from −8.5% to −4.1% and from −7.7% to −3.4% during the same period (IMF (2016)).====Many commentators have raised concerns that this wave of fiscal consolidations may exacerbate high and rising income and wealth disparities, with adverse consequences for long-term economic growth. Indeed, a vast strand of the literature argues that inequality may compromise economic growth through a number of channels. First, it creates political instability, which may discourage investments (Alesina and Perotti (1996); Berg and Ostry (2011)). Second, in a highly unequal society, the majority of citizens are not in a condition to save or to invest in education, which reduces investments and the accumulation of human capital (Perotti (1996); Aghion et al. (1999); Galor and Moav (2004); OECD (2014); OECD (2015b)). Third, inequality may also create financial instability. Indeed, some studies maintain that inequality played a major role in the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 by contributing to the debt accumulation by lower- and middle-income class agents (Fitoussi and Saraceno (2009); Rajan (2010); Kumhof et al. (2015)). In this light, policy-makers have become more concerned about the consequences for inequality of their policy actions.====An obvious way in which fiscal consolidation may influence income inequality is through changes in the amount of government redistribution. For instance, lowering government transfers reduces the disposable income of low-income agents, thereby raising inequality. Conversely, raising the top marginal income tax rate penalises richer agents and therefore should decrease inequality. Fiscal restraint may also induce behavioural responses by agents. As an example, a higher labour tax lowers the net wage and may induce agents to either substitute away labour for leisure (substitution effect) or supply more labour in order to maintain a similar level of consumption (income effect). Hence, depending on which effect dominates – and assuming agents' heterogeneity in either the type of utility function or labour supply elasticities – the inequality effects of higher taxes through the labour supply channel may differ.====Further, fiscal consolidations may affect inequality through its general equilibrium effects. Ball et al. (2013) argue that fiscal adjustments reduce output and increase unemployment. This decreases the wage share, which in turn tends to increase inequality due to the relatively higher share of wage income in lower-income groups. Moreover, Bastagli et al. (2012) suggest that the tendency of employers to hoard high-skilled workers, who usually have higher income levels, could be another factor potentially raising inequality at times of fiscal restraint. On the other hand, in countries with rigid labour markets, it might be more difficult for firms to shed off labour, thus limiting the scope of these channels. To sum up, a theoretical prediction on the impact of fiscal consolidations on inequality depends on both the specific policy measures used and the assumptions underlying the economic structure.====In this context, the aim of our analysis is twofold. First, we empirically assess the effects of tax-based consolidations (i.e. consolidations in which tax hikes are larger than spending cuts) on income inequality, output and labour market conditions. Second, we establish some stylized facts about which particular tax instruments are typically used during tax-based consolidations and investigate the composition effects, distinguishing between direct and indirect taxes and their main sub-components. Although we are aware of the centrality of both income and wealth inequality in the debate, we focus on income inequality due to limited time series data availability on wealth inequality. Moreover, as income directly impacts living standards, rising income inequality has likely played a more prominent role in fuelling the recent wave of social discontent that policy-makers are now trying to address (Rajan, 2010).====Our primary focus is on disposable income inequality, since ultimately this is what matters for the relation between inequality and growth. However, in order to assess the direction and strength of the government's redistribution channel, we also evaluate the impact of fiscal adjustments on market income inequality. Further, we investigate the effects of tax-based consolidations not only on inequality, but also on economic activity and labour market outcomes. We do so in order to disentangle the other channels through which consolidations affect inequality. We only analyse tax-based consolidations since, as we will see below, this is the area with most disagreement in the literature.====The empirical literature on the effects of fiscal consolidations on income inequality has been limited in scope and has provided inconclusive evidence. Ball et al. (2013), Agnello and Sousa (2014), and Woo et al. (2017) all start from the same action-based consolidations dataset of Devries et al. (2011), which contains information about spending cuts and tax hikes during fiscal consolidation episodes in 17 OECD countries between 1978 and 2009, but employ different methodologies: Ball et al. (2013) use local projections, Agnello and Sousa (2014) adopt seemingly unrelated regressions (henceforth SUR), and Woo et al. (2017) use SUR and fixed effects. All these contributions distinguish between tax-based and spending-based consolidation episodes, where tax-based consolidations are defined as having tax hikes larger than spending cuts, and ==== for spending-based consolidations. While they all conclude that spending-based consolidations increase income inequality, Ball et al. (2013), Woo et al. (2017), and Agnello and Sousa (2014) find, respectively, significant positive, negative but insignificant and significant negative effects of tax-based consolidations on income inequality.====These different findings appear to be due to the way in which tax-based consolidations are accounted for and to the horizon considered. Agnello and Sousa (2014) focus on the impact effects and employ both a dummy variable to denote all years of tax-based consolidations and the original variable constructed by Devries et al. (2011), which accounts for the differences in the size of the fiscal packages.==== When employing the dummy variable, Agnello and Sousa (2014) find negative but statistically insignificant effects on inequality. On the other hand, they find statistically significant negative effects (lower inequality) when accounting for the size of the consolidation. Woo et al. (2017) use the original Devries et al. (2011) variable to analyse the 1-year response of inequality to tax-based consolidations and find negative but not significant effects. Finally, Ball et al. (2013) employ the local projection method to derive impulse responses over an 8-year horizon and find positive effects. This result needs two qualifications. Firstly, the authors use a dummy variable taking value 1 in the first year of the tax-based consolidation cycle and 0 otherwise. As shown in Agnello and Sousa (2014), this identification strategy might lead to estimates that are biased upward. Secondly, they report one-standard-error confidence bands for their impulse responses. Hence, their results are only significant at the 69% confidence level.====Our analysis contributes to the existing literature in several aspects. First, the studies reviewed above estimate the effects of fiscal consolidations in a single-equation setup.==== To the extent that fiscal consolidations are not random assignments and that they also impact economic activity (see Guajardo et al. (2014); and Alesina et al. (2015b)), we argue that this approach might forgive potential feedback effects from economic activity to inequality. We opt instead for a multi-equation setup that takes into account both the direct effects of changes in fiscal policy on inequality, output and labour market variables and the indirect (feedback) effects among them. Second, we note that economic inequality is typically slow-moving. Hence, improving on Agnello and Sousa (2014), and Woo et al. (2017), we study the dynamic (long-term) effects of tax-based consolidations on inequality. Differently from Ball et al. (2013), we account for the size of the consolidation. Third, we borrow from a recent and growing literature which documents how real-time fiscal measures tend to overstate the actual ==== impact of fiscal consolidations (see Beetsma et al. (2009); Castro et al. (2013), Frankel and Schreger (2013); Gupta et al. (2017); and more recently Beetsma et al. (2017)). Hence, we use ==== realized data as opposed to ==== real-time data (as instead done in the existing literature) to measure the true extent of a consolidation effort and avoid potential measurement errors.====We also contribute to the literature in other aspects. The studies reviewed above limit the analysis to changes in overall tax revenues and neglects potential composition effects. An attempt to empirically study the impact of tax policy changes on inequality in a multivariate framework is carried out by Martínez-Vázquez et al. (2012) and Muinelo-Gallo and Roca-Sagalés (2013). However, these contributions study the effects of budget-neutral tax changes rather than of consolidation episodes. Moreover, they do not address the potential endogeneity between fiscal variables and economic activity. Our paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing the effects of specific tax policy measures on income inequality in the context of fiscal adjustments that are not driven by output stabilization considerations.====Our sample includes 16 OECD countries during the period 1978–2012. To identify episodes of fiscal consolidations, we use the action-based datasets compiled by Devries et al. (2011) and Alesina et al. (2015b). These two databases exclusively consider consolidation episodes aiming solely at reducing the government deficit, and not at stabilizing economic activity. This allows us to limit the potential endogeneity between tax-based consolidations and GDP. Next, we make use of the OECD Revenue Statistics Database (OECD, 2015c) to measure the actual extent of the tax consolidation effort. The OECD Revenue Statistics Database also allows us to quantify changes in specific tax instruments, and therefore pin down which particular instrument was most used during each consolidation year and analyse its effects. As measures of income inequality, we use both the market and the disposable income Gini indexes, as well as data on top income shares and income ratios. For the estimation, we rely on a panel vector auto regressive (PVAR) methodology. Although our analysis is at the macro level, we explore potential heterogeneities in the labour market outcomes of fiscal consolidations for groups of agents of different sex and age.====We begin by establishing some stylized facts about the design of tax-based consolidations. We show that governments normally rely on either direct or indirect taxes (rather than a combination of them) to consolidate the budget, which further highlights the relevance of our research question. We also show that personal taxes are by far the most preferred instrument, with general consumption taxes (such as value added and sale) being a distant second. Turning to the empirical analysis, our results point to statistically significant and economically meaningful positive effects of tax-based consolidations in reducing income inequality. However, this comes at the cost of a contraction in economic activity. Next, we find that using different tax instruments matters; that is, indirect taxes reduce income inequality by more than direct taxes. Looking at the specific tax instruments, personal taxes seem to be the most suited to reduce inequality while at the same time minimizing the equity-efficiency trade-off. General consumption taxes also have substantial positive short-run effects on the labour force participation rate, which dampens their recessionary effects. Finally, we do not find corporate taxes to have any effect on income inequality.====Our findings point to the existence of a positive labour supply channel of indirect taxes. Higher indirect taxes decrease the amount of goods that households can buy given a certain income and create incentives for agents voluntarily out of the labour force to start searching for a job. That is, the income effect dominates the substitution effect. This in turn promotes labour force participation, especially of middle-aged women, and reduces income inequality. Instead, we do not find evidence backing the hypothesis of a negative labour demand channel through which fiscal consolidations jeopardise income equality.==== Lastly, we find little evidence pointing to a positive government redistribution channel of tax-based consolidations.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the dataset and explains the empirical methodology. Section 3 contains our baseline results on the overall effects of tax-based consolidations. Section 4 focuses on the composition of tax-based consolidations and disentangles the specific effects of each single tax instrument. Section 5 concludes.

We examine the cases where both players are either informed or uninformed about the size of the discriminatory power, as well as the case where only one player has ","Consider a situation where, say two, firms lobby a foreign politician to obtain a license for a monopoly position on a market in the politician's country. It might happen that both firms are uncertain about the local political culture, i.e. the extent to which the politician rewards their lobbying activities (Che and Gale, 1997). It can also occur that one of the firms is local while the other one is foreign. The local firm might be able to acquire information about the politician's responsiveness to lobbying efforts, for instance if it has direct contact with people close to the politician, whereas the foreign firm might not have access to these sources of information and remains uncertain about it. We investigate how firms' lobbying efforts and payoffs depend on this kind of uncertainty.====In order to do this, we consider a rent-seeking contest between two players competing for a single prize that will be awarded to one of them (Tullock, 1980). Each player can exert effort in order to increase the probability that he wins the contest. The winning probability of a player is given by a contest success function (CSF), which includes a discriminatory power parameter that represents the effectiveness of the players' efforts in determining their winning chances. For larger values of the parameter, winning becomes more sensitive to efforts. Skaperdas (1996) shows that this CSF is the only one that satisfies a set of reasonable axioms. In the standard contest the players have complete information. The contest then has a (unique) pure-strategy Nash equilibrium if and only if the (positive) discriminatory power parameter is smaller than or equal to two (Nti, 1999). The contest can be used to analyze lobbying behavior, as well as a variety of other settings, like patent races, litigation, political campaigns, etc. See Konrad (2009) for a comprehensive survey of the literature.====We examine the case where the value of the discriminatory power parameter is uncertain. For simplicity, it is either high or low with given probabilities, where both values are smaller than or equal to two. We call a player informed if he learns the true value of the parameter, and uninformed if he only knows the distribution. We investigate three cases: both players are informed, both players are uninformed, and one player is informed while the other is uninformed. Information is symmetric in the first two cases and asymmetric in the last case. We demonstrate that in each case there exists a unique pure-strategy (Bayesian) Nash equilibrium. We give the equilibria for the two cases with symmetric information in closed form; they closely correspond to the equilibrium of the case with complete information. It is not possible to derive the equilibrium of the case with asymmetric information in closed form. Instead we characterize the properties of that equilibrium. First, the equilibrium effort of the informed player is largest if the value of the discriminatory power parameter is high. This is intuitive since winning is more sensitive to efforts in that case, which makes the informed player compete more fiercely. The equilibrium effort of the uninformed player is of intermediate size, since this player takes into account the realization of both values of the discriminatory power parameter. Second, a priori it is not clear how the ex ante equilibrium efforts, winning probabilities and payoffs of the informed and uninformed player are related to each other. We find that the ex ante efforts of the two players are the same, but the informed player wins the contest with a larger probability than the uninformed player, and hence also has a larger payoff.====We also compare the equilibria of the three cases. We find that the ex ante aggregate efforts are smallest in the case with asymmetric information. The payoff of the informed player in the case with asymmetric information is larger than his payoff in the two cases with symmetric information. Interestingly, numerical analysis shows that the payoff of the uninformed player in the case with asymmetric information can be larger than his payoff in the two cases with symmetric information. Hence, both players can be better off in the equilibrium under asymmetric information.====A number of papers have considered rent-seeking Tullock contests with uncertainty about parameters of the model. The case with an uncertain prize is investigated by Hurley and Shogren (1998a, 1998b), Malueg and Yates (2004), Schoonbeek and Winkel (2006), Wärneryd (2003, 2013) and Wasser (2013); uncertain costs of effort by Fey (2008) and Ryvkin (2010); and an uncertain number of contestants by Münster (2006) and Myerson and Wärneryd (2006). Einy et al. (2015) and Ewerhart and Quartieri (2016) demonstrate the existence, respectively the existence and uniqueness, of a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium for general contests that allow for uncertainty in the prize, costs of efforts and CSF. Their models cover our contest as a special case, but only for the situation where the discriminatory power parameter is smaller than or equal to unity, which is smaller than the range of values considered by us. Moreover, Einy et al. and Ewerhart and Quartieri do not derive additional properties of their equilibria, like we do in our paper (see above). Epstein and Mealem (2013) consider a two-player contest in which the CSF has a discriminatory power parameter equal to unity, while one player is uncertain about the ability of his opponent (a player has a larger ability than his opponent if his effort has a larger effect on the winning probability than the same effort would have if exerted by the opponent).====Grossmann (2014) investigates a model where two players are uncertain about which contest they will play, similar to our case with two uninformed players. In his model there are also two possible contests which differ with regard to the sensitivity of the winning probabilities to the players' efforts. Grossmann's model employs an alternative CSF in which a given noise parameter is added linearly to each other player's effort, see also Amegashie (2006). This CSF does not satisfy all axioms of Skaperdas (1996). We focus here on the CSF of the standard Tullock contest.====The paper is organized as follows.

This result is robust to alternative identifications of ====, to different ways of defining periods of private debt overhang, and to controlling for the state of the business cycle and the level of government debt. We explore different channels through which our findings can be rationalized.","In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, many governments implemented large-scale austerity programs in order to reduce budget deficits. While the long-run gains of lower government debt levels such as an increase in fiscal space and more balanced longer-term growth are widely acknowledged, debates among economists and policy makers are circling around potential threats to short-run economic stability and social equity. In this paper, we add to this debate by conducting an empirical investigation of how fiscal consolidations impact income inequality. In particular, we show that the level of private debt determines whether or not austerity affects income equality.====Rising income inequality may not only affect the welfare assessment of consolidation measures and undermine public support for it, it might also endanger the ultimate success of fiscal consolidations in improving fiscal sustainability through its potentially adverse consequences for economic performance and socio-political stability.==== While some papers find evidence that rising income inequality has negative consequences for economic growth (see, e.g. Alesina and Rodrik, 1994, and Persson and Tabellini, 1994), there is competing evidence of beneficial effects (see, e.g. Barro, 2000, and Li and Zou, 1998). Adverse consequences of rising inequality on socio-political stability, such as an increase in social unrest and a higher degree of political polarization, are documented by, e.g., Alesina and Perotti (1996) and Duca and Saving (2016). At the same time, Alesina and Tabellini (1990) and Azzimonti (2011) predict, based on political-economy models, that more polarized political systems produce higher public debt and lower economic growth.==== Taken together, this suggests that ==== fiscal consolidations have significant adverse distributional consequences, the potential vicious cycle between rising inequality, political polarization and a worsening of public finances might be a threat to the ultimate success of fiscal consolidations.====The question we address in this paper is whether or not austerity increases income inequality. The effect of austerity on inequality is a priori ambiguous because of the various channels through which fiscal consolidations may influence the income distribution. In the following, we describe four distinct theoretical channels through which austerity affects the income distribution and discuss why these channels are likely to be shaped by the level of private debt in the economy.====The first channel is the earnings heterogeneity channel. This channel explains changes in income inequality through heterogeneous dynamics of labor earnings of high-income and low-income groups. Heathcote et al. (2010) show that labor earnings at the bottom of the income distribution are most negatively affected by economic downturns. This can be explained by the fact that employment losses fall disproportionately upon low-income groups, see, e.g., Jefferson (2008) and Carpenter and Rodgers (2004). Thus, the earnings heterogeneity channel predicts that austerity leads to an increase in inequality if fiscal consolidations have contractionary effects on the economy. Analyzing the interplay between fiscal policy and the private debt cycle, a recent stream of literature shows that the contractionary effects of fiscal retrenchments are amplified during periods of private debt overhang, see, e.g., Bernardini and Peersman (2018) and Klein (2017).==== One explanation for why private debt elevates the effects of fiscal policy is the existence of borrowing constrained households. Such households are characterized by a higher marginal propensity to consume out of income, compared to non-constrained households. If the share of these agents is large enough – which is positively related to the level of private indebtedness – Keynesian-type multiplier effects emerge (see, e.g. Eggertsson and Krugman, 2012, and Andrés et al., 2015). Similar considerations may apply for borrowing-constrained firms, see Giroud and Mueller (2017). Taken together, this implies that the adverse distributional consequences of a short-run decline in economic activity in response to a fiscal consolidation are amplified if firms and households have a lot of debt.====The second channel is the income composition channel. While the earnings heterogeneity channel focuses on heterogeneous outcomes within one income source (labor income), the income composition channel explains changes in income inequality through heterogeneous dynamics across different sources of income (capital versus labor income). While, for most households, labor earnings are the primary source of income, others receive a larger share of their income from capital income. Low-income households typically rely on wage income, whereas high-income households tend to receive a relatively larger share of their income from capital income. When fiscal consolidations affect these different types of income heterogeneously, then the different household types experience different income outcomes. A private debt-dependence of this channel can be explained by evidence showing that the bargaining power of workers falls with economic activity, see, e.g., Morin (2017) and Aronsson et al. (1993). Consequently, if the level of private indebtedness elevates the economic contraction after a fiscal consolidation (and it does according to the aforementioned literature), this will lower the share of income accruing to labor and lead to an increase in income inequality.====The third channel is the savings redistribution channel. This channel attributes changes in the income distribution to changes in real interest rates. An unexpected increase in real interest rates (through a rise in the nominal interest rate or a decrease in inflation) hurts borrowers and benefits savers. To the extent that borrowers are generally at the lower end of the income distribution, this tends to generate a more unequal income distribution. By studying nominal asset positions in the United States, Doepke and Schneider (2006) provide evidence for the importance of this savings redistribution channel. The response of real interest rates to fiscal consolidations is a priori ambiguous. Standard macroeconomic theory predicts a decrease in real interest rates when the fiscal deficit decreases. Notice, though, that recent empirical evidence suggests that U.S. deficit reductions are associated with rising real interest rates, see, e.g., Mountford and Uhlig (2009) and Ramey (2016). The response of real interest rates may also be private debt-dependent. Klein (2017) provides evidence that fiscal consolidations implemented in periods of high private debt lead to an increase in sovereign default probabilities which puts upward pressure on interest rates through an increase in risk premia. In sum, these considerations imply that it is more likely that austerity leads to an increase in real interest rates (and thus a rise in inequality via the savings redistribution channel) if firms and households have a lot of debt.====While the previously discussed channels attribute changes in income inequality to the heterogeneous effects of movements in aggregate economic activity on different groups within society, the tax redistribution channel focuses on the direct distributional impacts of adjustments in the tax and transfer system implemented to improve the fiscal balance. The tax redistribution channel can affect inequality in both directions, depending on the chosen measures of the austerity program. Cuts in public transfer are likely to increase net (after-tax, after-transfer) income inequality as households in the lower part of the income distribution receive a relatively larger share of their income from public transfers than households in the upper part of the income distribution. In contrast, increasing taxes on capital income, wealth, and inheritance or raising the progressivity of income taxes is likely to lower net income inequality. The composition of fiscal consolidations and thus their redistributive impact might as well depend on the level of private debt in the economy. This could be the case, for example, if a majority of voters is highly indebted and may thus favor austerity programs that rely more heavily on increases in wealth taxes. Likewise, measures like the elimination of tax deductibility of private debt will likely face a stronger opposition during periods in which a larger share of households has a lot of debt.====In short, these different channels imply that the effect of austerity on economic inequality is a priori ambiguous and is likely to depend on the state of the private debt cycle. As a result, we turn to the data to investigate the effects of fiscal consolidations depending on the level of private indebtedness. To do so, we estimate state-dependent impulse responses of income inequality to exogenous changes in the government budget deficit using local projections, as suggested by Jordà (2005). Income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient. The estimated responses are allowed to vary according to the state of the private debt cycle, defined as fluctuations in the ratio of private debt to GDP around its long-run trend.==== High-debt states and low-debt states are identified as periods when the ratio of private debt to GDP was above or below trend, respectively. Identification of fiscal consolidation is achieved by using the narrative measure proposed by Devries et al. (2011), available for 1980–2009, which we extend to include 2010 and 2011. The baseline dataset of our analysis covers a panel of 17 OECD countries from 1980 through 2011.====We find strong and statistically significant differences in the distributional consequences of austerity across private debt states. Austerity leads to a severe and significant increase in income inequality when firms and households have a lot of deb. A 1% of GDP reduction in the primary deficit translates into a rise in income inequality of around 2 Gini points in high private debt states. In contrast, when private debt is low, the inequality effects of fiscal consolidations are found to be small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Thus, an estimation approach that abstracts from debt-dependence may well lead to wrong policy conclusions.====We conduct various robustness checks that confirm our findings. In particular, we take into account possible anticipation effects due to fiscal foresight, we consider alternative ways of defining periods of private debt overhang, and we restrict our sample to the period before the Global Financial Crisis. Moreover, we rule out that our results are driven by the state of the business cycle or the government debt level.====We also provide direct evidence on the debt-dependence of the channels underlying these distributional consequences of austerity. While we find strong evidence in favor of the debt-dependence of the earnings heterogeneity channel, the income composition channel and the savings redistribution channel are found to exhibit more muted debt-dependencies. In contrast, we find no evidence that the tax redistribution channel plays an important role in explaining our results.====Our paper is related to the literature that explores the distributional effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy, in general (see, e.g, Coibion et al., 2017, Anderson et al., 2016, and Mumtaz and Theophilopoulou, 2017), and fiscal consolidations, in particular (see, e.g., Agnello and Sousa, 2014, Schaltegger and Weder, 2014, and Ball et al., 2013). However, none of these studies allows the effects to differ according to the state of the credit cycle. This is surprising given the aforementioned evidence suggesting that credit plays an important role in shaping the effects of fiscal policy interventions. In fact, we demonstrate that the inequality effects of fiscal policy vary considerably depending on the state of the credit cycle.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the empirical strategy. Section 3 presents the main results and conducts various robustness checks. Section 4 tests the channels through which our results can be rationalized.

Along an equilibrium trajectory with increasing debt, the tax burden increases and public sector activities are crowded out due to the increasing costs of debt servicing. A debt ceiling may halt this process leading to less debt, more public consumption and higher welfare.","Fiscal frameworks (institutional/procedural rules, e.g., a budget law) have become widespread and are an integral part of the EU policy framework.==== An essential element is numerical fiscal targets, or intermediary fiscal policy targets. These frameworks have been developed as a response to deficit biases and debt accumulation (or failure to consolidate debt after crises) observed for a number of countries as well as a concern for fiscal sustainability in relation to changing demographics. Fiscal rules are thus serving a commitment role to provide fiscal discipline==== and to increase transparency and accountability in fiscal policy to achieve better outcomes in the medium to long run.====The discussion on fiscal rules has been heated. The criticism of budget rules has both a business cycle and a structural component. The former relates to the ability to pursue a sufficiently active countercyclical policy, and thus whether such norms leave sufficient room for fiscal flexibility. An excessively rigid interpretation of budget rules has been argued to be at the root of austerity policies, causing a slow recovery after the financial crisis.==== The structural issue relates to the size and structure of the public sector, in particular, whether tight budget rules restraining deficit financing or debt accumulation are part of a political agenda to attain a leaner public sector. Related, it has been claimed that tight budget rules introduce a bias in public activities away from investments, detrimental to the long-term objectives the rules are meant to serve.====Considering the empirical evidence, there is no clear-cut relation between debt levels and the size of the public sector.==== Fig. 1 gives a cross plot of debt and core public expenditures (total expenditures less expenditures on debt servicing), and the two are not related.==== Hence, the simple view that the extent of the welfare state is related to debt levels is not substantiated. It is particularly noteworthy that the Nordic countries known for their extended welfare states are among the countries with the lowest debt levels.====High debt and debt servicing costs may crowd out other expenditure types for a given size of the public sector measured by total expenditures or tax revenue. Total expenditures less debt servicing equal the expenditures on the core activities of the public sector like education, health, pensions etc. Fig. 2 shows debt servicing expenditures as a share of core expenditures as a simple metric of the budget off-setting effect; that is, for an unchanged tax burden it shows by how much core expenditures can be increased if there were no debt servicing costs. For some countries this off-set is rather large, and for countries like Italy, Greece and Hungary expenditures on debt servicing exceed those on e.g. education. This is suggestive that debt may have implications for the structure of the public sector.====Although there is by now a rather large literature on the institutional specificities of fiscal rules and their possible effects, see e.g. Lledó et al. (2017), the above-mentioned “structural” criticism that fiscal rules affect the size and structure of the public sector has not been much analysed. Is this criticism justified when considering explicitly both the reasons for deficit biases and how a deficit/debt restraint affects the political process? This paper analyses these issues considering why the political process causes a deficit/debt bias and explores its consequences for the size and structure of the public sector. It is considered how the political process and thus fiscal policies are affected by a budget/debt restraint.====A political economy literature has developed arguments why deficit biases may arise; for an overview see, e.g., Persson and Tabellini (2000), Calmfors and Wren-Lewis (2011) and Alesina and Passalacqua (2017). The key explanations run in terms of short horizons of voters, informational problems, political fragmentation and common-pool problems. This literature has laid the foundation for understanding the basic reasons why deficit biases arise. However, the arguments are developed in two-period models ruling out the dynamics which is at the heart of the problem.==== This is important since the debt dynamics may feedback into the political process causing a deficit/debt bias and therefore affect the structure of the public sector (different expenditure types and taxation). Moreover, two-period models force a repayment of debt in the second period, whereas it is well-known that a positive level of debt can be sustained in steady state.====This paper develops a dynamic political economy model with overlapping generations of voters.==== Specifically, a standard overlapping generations model of the type used to analyse macroeconomic dynamics is merged with the so-called probabilistic voting model (see Lindbeck and Weibull (1987)). The key mechanism is the finite horizon of agents in combination with a recurrent conflict of interest between old and young (and yet unborn) voters; cf. also Musgrave (1988). The analysis considers both the mechanism causing a deficit/debt bias and its implication for the size and structure of the public sector as well as the welfare consequences. The role of a fiscal rule in the form of a binding debt ceiling (balanced budget requirement) is analysed with particular focus on how it affects the level and composition of public expenditures.====The role of finite horizons for voters is also considered in a rather large political economy literature on pensions, starting with Browning (1975); for a survey see e.g. Galasso and Profeta (2002) and Mulligan and Sala-I-Martin (2004). A key insight from this literature is that the political equilibrium may support the introduction of a PAYG pension, even though such a scheme reduces welfare in the long run. More recent work along the same line considers the entire welfare package, including education for the young and pensions for the old; see e.g. Lancia and Russo (2016) and Bishnu and Wang (2015).====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the overlapping generations model and the political process in the case where the fiscal platform includes public consumption financed either by current taxation or debt. Section 3 extends the political decision problem to include both productive expenditures and pensions as well as distortionary taxes. Section 4 offers a few concluding comments.

Based on data from a large sample of countries, we demonstrate that female representation leads countries to adopt more stringent climate change policies. We exploit a combination of full and partial identification approaches to suggest that this relationship is likely to be causal. Moreover, we show that through its effect on the stringency of climate change policies, the representation of females in parliament results in lower carbon dioxide emissions. Female political representation may be an underutilized tool for addressing climate change.","Climate change is a serious threat, and it demands prompt policy response (Stern, 2008). Political commitment to address the issue is critical, yet sources of large differences in such commitments across countries are not fully uncovered. This paper focuses on the relevance of political identity, and in particular, the gender of politicians. We ask whether representation of females in political decision-making contributes to climate change policy action around the world.====That politician's gender identity may have implications for policy outcomes has been established in the literature. Studies have shown that female political representation contributes to significant changes in domestic and international policies including higher spending on health (Bhalotra and Clots-Figueras, 2014; Mavisakalyan, 2014) and education (Svaleryd, 2009; Clots-Figueras, 2012), more laws and expenditures relevant to female needs (Chattopadhyay and Duflo, 2004; Clots-Figueras, 2011), higher disbursements of foreign aid (Hicks et al., 2015, 2016). Furthermore, female politicians have been associated with outcomes such as better quality of institutions (Dollar et al., 2001; Swamy et al., 2001) and higher rates of economic growth (Jayasuriya and Burke, 2013). While the existing studies on the determinants of climate change policies across countries have highlighted the relevance of countries' formal and informal institutions (Fredriksson and Neumayer, 2013; Fredriksson and Wollscheid, 2015; Ang and Fredriksson, 2017; Mavisakalyan et al., 2018), to the best of our knowledge the role of politicians' identity has not received dedicated attention in this literature.====Gender differences in attitudes towards climate change identified in the general public suggest that females have greater awareness and concern about climate change than males do (McCright, 2010; McCright and Dunlap, 2011). Based on theories of gender socialisation, these differences can be linked to differences in values and social expectations conferred through socialization whereby cooperation and carefulness - values relevant for climate change action - are more emphasized in females than in males (Gilligan, 1982; Beutel and Marini, 1995). Gender differences in climate change concern can also be linked to differences in social roles performed in the society with production of climate change seen to be more closely linked to activities performed by males than females (Spitzner, 2009). Furthermore, consequences of climate change are likely to be gender-differentiated as well, with females more disproportionately bearing the costs of climate change due to their ‘gendered labour and care roles and social status’ (Seager et al., 2016, p.13).====In ‘citizen candidates’ models, in the absence of complete political commitment, politicians implement policies consistent with their preferences (Osborne and Slivinski, 1996; Besley and Coate, 1997). However, it is unclear whether we should expect to observe gender differences in preferences of politicians similar to those observed in the general public. Indeed, it is possible that females who pursue leadership roles in a predominantly male environment are similar to males (Adams and Funk, 2012). Consistent with this proposition, Sundstrom and McCright (2014) do not find robust evidence for gender differences in environmental concerns among Swedish parliamentarians although such gender differences are observed in the general public in Sweden. In the context of the US, however, Fredriksson and Wang (2011) find that female parliamentarians in the House of Representatives have more pro-environmental views compared to their male counterparts. Building on these observations, our study evaluates the implications of female representation in politics for climate change policies adopted by countries around the world.====From an econometric perspective, we are confronted with a problem of omitted variables: adoption of climate change policies and election of females to parliament may both be the product of underlying characteristics of countries we do not observe. We employ two key strategies to ascertain that our estimates are not driven by confounding factors. First, we use an instrumental variable based on countries' history of female political empowerment and estimate a 2SLS model. Second, we use a partial identification approach proposed by Oster (2016). The main idea of this approach is to study how large would the amount of selection on unobservables need to be, relative to the amount of selection on observables, to explain away the entire casual effect of female representation.====Based on a large sample of countries, we document a robust positive association between female representation in a country's parliament and the stringency of its climate change policies. The impact we identify is statistically significant and economically meaningful. As an illustration, our 2SLS estimation results imply that lifting the female representation in Bahrain, a country where females comprised just over 2% of parliamentarians in the study period, to the level of Denmark, a country with over 37% female representation, could lead to a 6-fold increase in the stringency of the country's climate change policies (in practice Denmark's climate change policies are around 8 times as stringent as Bahrain's). In extended results, we further demonstrate that through its effects on the stringency of climate change policies, female parliamentary representation results in lower carbon dioxide emissions.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The next section describes the data used in the study. This is followed by a discussion of our empirical approach and the results of baseline analysis in section 3. In section 4 we test the sensitivity of the results to the choice of control and dependent variables, and functional form, while section 5 is dedicated to addressing the issue of endogeneity employing instrumental variable and partial identification approaches. We extend the analysis to study the implications of female representation for carbon dioxide emissions in section 6.

This paper provides a disaggregated manufacturing approach that reveals different effects of democracy across ,"The theoretical and empirical sides of democracy-growth literature fail to offer a consensus on whether democracy enhances or diminishes growth. The vast majority of studies to date focus on the effect of democracy on the whole economy. Those studies generally employ nationwide economic indicators such as the level or growth rate of GDP per capita as their dependent variable.==== This paper however considers that the growth effect of democracy might differ from one sector to another within economies. It focuses on how rising levels of democracy impact on the economic performance of manufacturing industries, and employs disaggregated growth rates as a dependent variable. This disaggregated manufacturing approach reveals that democracy affects industries differently within the same economies. These results suggest that this effect is contingent on the technological development of industries.====In the words of Przeworski (2016), the functions and limits of democracy are a never-ending quest which has sparked a flourishing scholarship on the growth effects of democracy.==== This literature features three main opposing arguments that have fired up the research agenda on this topic. The ==== suggests a negative effect of democracy on growth. Huntington (1968) argues that democracies lend themselves to inefficient popular demands whereas autocratic regimes are better able to implement unpopular, profitable investments needed for growth. The experiences of the Tiger economies - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - which introduced democracy after economic reforms and that of the Chinese economy reinforce the conflict view of the growth effect of democratic regimes (Huntington et al. (1976), Guo (2007), Xu (2011), Bell (2016)). In sharp contrast, the ==== states that democracy promotes economic growth (Gerring et al. (2005), Acemoglu et al. (2014), Madsen et al. (2015)) and encourages more stable, higher quality development (Rodrik (2000), Bhagwati (1995)). Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005), and Papaioannou and Siourounis (2008) find that democratisation tends to produce higher rates of economic growth in the future. This view notes that democracy enforces growth-enhancing features precisely through the provision of political rights and civil liberties (North (1990)). A third, sceptical view finds that democracies make little or no difference, and consequently calls into question the causal effect of democracy on growth (Bardhan (1993), Bhagwati (1995), Przeworski (2000), Mulligan et al. (2004), Glaeser et al. (2004) and Murtin and Wacziarg (2014)).====These opposing approaches to the growth effect of democracy may result from the complexity of conceptualising political regimes (Fukuyama (2007)). Different conceptualisations, and thus alternative measurements of democracy, are an issue that is exacerbated by differing modelling and research designs (Sirowy and Inkeles (1990)). The meta-analysis of 84 studies of the effect of democracy on GDP growth performed by Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu (2008) shows the wide variety of methodologies used, and finds that the overall effect of democracy does not seem to be detrimental to growth. Indeed, a large body of research suggests that the indirect effect of democracy through socioeconomic, political and demographic features is conducive to growth. Political economic literature accounts for growth-promoting mechanisms of democracy through the accumulation of physical or human capital (Helliwell (1994), Baum and Lake (2003), Dawson (1998)), political stability conjecture (Alesina et al. (1996); Rodrik (1998)) and economic freedom (Sturm and De Haan (2001)). However, growth-diminishing channels through democratic trade-offs between property rights, entry barriers and redistribution taxes have been also suggested (Plümper and Martin (2003), Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005), Acemoglu et al. (2008)).====The main questions that this paper seeks to answer are whether democracy exerts a different effect on different industries within the same economy, and if so whether those effects are contingent on technological development. I combine the industry approaches employed in Rajan and Zingales (1998) and Aghion et al. (2009)) with the old suspicion that democracy exerts a positive effect on economic performance contingent upon other factors (Lipset's hypothesis (1959), Przeworski and Limongi (1993), Acemoglu et al. (2014). Building on the linkages between democracy, economic freedom and regulation (De Haan and Sturm (2000), (2003), Lundström (2005), Djankov et al. (2002), Rode and Gwartney (2012)), I explore whether the interplays between democracy and technological development might determine the sign and magnitude of the effect of democracy on growth. I surmise a mechanism that works through the promotion of democracy of lower market-entry barriers and higher levels of economic freedom. This influence favours the economic performance of advanced industries, which might be better able to adapt and thrive in more competitive economic scenarios than backward industries. Consequently, technologically advanced industries might benefit from more democratic political institutions whereas backward industries become worse off in more democratic environments.====I employ an informationally demanding database with data on 61 International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) industries operating in 72 countries from 1990 to 2010. I use a novel, sensitive measure of democracy (Gründler and Krieger (2016)) and control for a wide variety of empirically informed drivers of economic performance in manufacturing. My results show that the growth-effect of democracy varies from one industry to another within an economy. These results further reveal that the growth-effect of democracy is contingent on the technology with which industries operate. Advanced industries benefit from political regime changes towards more democratic institutions. By contrast, the same political changes harm the economic performance of backward industries. These results are robust to alternative conceptualisations of democracy, which also serve as a review of the state-of-the-art indices of democracy. The final effect of democracy is scrutinised for different levels of technological development and it turns out that greater democracy has no effect on highly backward industries.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses theoretical reasons and empirical findings to date on the interaction between democracy and technology and its aftermath for growth. Section 3 explains the data and specifies a panel data model for analysing that interaction. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 tests the sensitivity of those results to alternative specifications and estimation techniques.

Collecting local-level data of two infrastructure funding programs and using the voting gap percentage between the coalition candidate and opposition competitors in a Sharp Regression Discontinuity methodology, we find causal evidence in favor of three hypotheses: (i) a coalition criterion influences the funding allocation to the local level; (ii) an electoral cycle exists in local funding; and (iii) the degree of coalition targeting varies based on a locality's history of coalition alignment. In sum, the central government regards politically aligned mayors as valuable electoral assets, especially in municipalities historically aligned with the coalition.","In a basic model, a social planner that maximizes welfare will allocate central resources to localities according to needs. In practice, however, resource allocation from central governments to local governments might be driven by electoral motives, which we call tactical distribution. Given this contradiction, the question of tactical distribution has long been explored by economists and political scientists. Ever since Downs (1957) declared that public expenditure might be affected by political issues, a branch of the literature has focused on the political allocation of funding to influence election results (Ward and John, 1999; Schady, 2000; Johansson, 2003; Diaz-Cayeros, 2008).====In particular, the literature has found evidence from developing countries (mainly Brazil) that the political alignment between the central government and the local government is a variable used in tactical distribution. Two hypotheses can explain that finding. On the one hand, Arulampalam et al. (2009) and Litschig (2012) suggest that if the goodwill rewards from centrally allocated resources are shared with the local government, then central governments will favor politically aligned local governments to avoid sharing with the opposition the goodwill generated by resources and maximize the coalition electoral prospects. On the other hand, Brollo and Nannicini (2012) suggest that the government favors aligned local incumbents because aligned local authorities are important electoral assets for central government elections.====This paper makes three main contributions to the literature. First, we provide evidence of tactical distribution from the central government to municipalities, across different years of the municipal election cycle. Second, it is the first paper to estimate causal instead of correlational evidence of tactical distribution in a developing country with extensive expenditure controls and disciplined macroeconomic policies.==== Third, it is the first paper to analyze the role of a locality's coalition history in tactical distribution.====Despite Chile's extensive expenditure controls, we still find causal evidence of three chief phenomena: (i) localities that are politically aligned with the central government's coalition receive more funding from the central government than unaligned localities; (ii) the funding gap between aligned and unaligned localities is synchronized with the mayoral election cycle and only takes place in the last two years of the mayoral term, quite similarly to Brollo and Nannicini (2012) results; and (iii) the degree of coalition targeting varies based on the local history of coalition alignment, which suggests that localities with longer histories of political alignment with the central government's coalition have a higher electoral value to the central government.====In this study, we analyze funding allocated from the centrally administered department of regional development, known as SUBDERE (====), to Chilean municipalities during the 2012–2016 mayoral election cycle. Similar to Brollo and Nannicini (2012), we use a quasi-experimental Sharp Regression Discontinuity (SRD) method to obtain causal evidence about two discretionary infrastructure programs allocated by the central government: the Neighborhood Improvement Program (NIP) and the Urban Improvement Program (UIP). Infrastructure programs like these are regarded as highly profitable electoral investments for local governments (Calvo and Murillo, 2013). Interestingly, these types of programs are the cause of frequent allegations of tactical distribution from the political opposition in Chile.==== Our results support that complaint.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the theories and evidence of tactical distribution. Section 3 details the political, expenditure control, and local funding institutions of the Chilean case.

Hence, decisions in two-member groups should result in highly unequal distributions of benefits. With increasing group size, however, VBV should generate more equally distributed outcomes. We examine the effect of group size under VBV in a series of laboratory experiments where groups with a varying number of members play a ‘divide the dollar game’. Our results confirm that larger groups choose more equal distributions than smaller groups. However, we also find deviations from the model's predictions. Some committees in our experiment do not select Pareto-optimal alternatives. An ==== of possible explanations suggests that individual behavior is most likely motivated by a combination of material self-interest and ==== such as reciprocity and fairness.","In many real-world decision-making situations, the relevant actors are small groups such as cabinets, parliamentary committees, boards of directors, works councils, or families. Often these groups make important distributional decisions for their members. For instance, heads of departments in a company might need to decide how to allocate bonus payments, while co-workers may have to distribute work on a joint project among themselves.====In more abstract terms, groups often have to divide a benefit ==== among their ==== members. Provided the group wants to decide democratically about the distribution of ====, it can employ a large variety of voting rules. Choosing between different voting rules, however, is not trivial, because, as Kenneth Arrow (1963) has shown in his seminal impossibility theorem, there is no optimal democratic decision-making mechanism for such a situation. All decision rules either do not guarantee the aggregation of individual preferences into a complete and transitive collective ranking or they violate some essential democratic fairness criteria. Consequently, choosing among different decision rules involves difficult tradeoffs (e.g. Buchanan and Tullock, 1962). Collective preferences under majority rule, for instance, are usually cyclical and therefore inherently unstable. Thus, for any proposed distribution of ==== there exists another proposal that a majority of the group members will favor over the first. Moreover, if stable coalitions actually do form under majority rule, there is always the possibility that a bare majority entirely excludes the remaining group members from the distribution of benefits. Such a ‘tyranny of the majority’ might be highly undesirable from certain normative points of view (Guinier, 1994; Madison [1787], 1945).====By assigning absolute veto power to every single group member, unanimity rule prevents the exploitation of a minority of group members by the majority. At the same time, however, unanimous decision making might lead to costly delays and lengthy negotiations until all group members consent to a proposal. Moreover, individual group members might use their veto power and strategically block proposals in order to earn a higher share. Besides, the status quo has a distinct advantage over all other alternatives under unanimity rule. Thus, any single group member can block a new policy, even if all other group members would massively profit from a reform.====Dennis C. Mueller (1978) has developed an innovative voting mechanism that combines majoritarian elements and veto rights. ==== [VBV] is a two-stage voting mechanism for small and medium-sized groups or committees.==== In the first stage, every group member makes a proposal for the distribution of ====. An additional alternative ‒ for example, the status quo ‒ supplements the group members’ proposals. Then a random mechanism determines the order of voting in the second stage, wherein all group members sequentially eliminate one alternative each. After all group members have used their veto, a single winning alternative remains.====VBV has several interesting theoretical properties and avoids most of the shortcomings of majority or unanimity rule. For one, it is decisive, as it always yields an unambiguous decision. It also satisfies neutrality, because no alternative, including the status quo, has a structural advantage under the voting rule. Moreover, VBV has some interesting theoretical fairness properties. Individual group members can prevent their worst outcome by vetoing it; VBV thus allows the strength of individual preferences to affect outcomes directly.==== In addition, VBV is expected to lead to an equal distribution of benefits when group size increases. Furthermore, it is procedurally fair. As the voting sequence is determined randomly, every group member has an equal chance of voting first. Overall, due to its theoretical fairness properties, VBV could present a viable decision rule in highly conflictual situations by providing incentives for consensual decision making.====However, empirical evidence for the workings of VBV is extremely sparse. To the best of our knowledge, it has never been applied to any real-world decision making. The only existing evidence comes from three studies testing the mechanism in laboratory experiments. Yuval (2002) and Yuval and Herne (2005) study group members' voting behavior in the second stage of VBV. Both studies analyze whether committee members use sophisticated strategies or display myopic behavior by vetoing the alternative offering the lowest personal payoff. While group decision making in small groups (==== = 3) seems to be driven by strategic behavior, the sincere decision calculus, i.e. vetoing one's worst alternative, dominates in larger groups (==== = 5 and ==== = 7). Sauermann and Beckmann (2017) test the workings of both stages of VBV. They study five-member committees where voters first make a proposal and then eliminate one alternative each. The even split of payoffs among all five group members is the dominant outcome of the experiment. Moreover, Sauermann and Beckmann find evidence that social preferences like fairness and reciprocity influence decisions under VBV.====Our study is also related to other contributions to the literature examining the effects of veto power and sequential voting schemes in small groups. For instance, Kagel et al. (2010) find that veto power reduces the efficiency of group decisions in a committee decision-making experiment. They also show that veto power weakens the distributional fairness of chosen bargaining outcomes. In a similar experiment, Bosman et al. (2013) demonstrate that rotational voting has distributional implications. Uneven voting power translates into uneven distribution of benefits. Hence, the specific institutional design of voting mechanisms has important implications for the allocation of benefits within small groups.====In light of the existing literature on small-group decision making, we argue that the distributional aspects of VBV deserve further attention. Mueller's (1978) model predicts that the equality of the resulting distribution of ==== under VBV varies with group size. As we will discuss in the following section, VBV decisions in two-member groups should result in highly unequal distributions of benefits. With increasing group size, however, VBV should generate more equally distributed outcomes. We test the effect of group size under VBV in a series of laboratory experiments. Our results confirm that larger groups choose more equal distributions than smaller groups. However, we also find deviations from the model's predictions. Some committees in our experiment do not select Pareto-optimal alternatives. An exploratory analysis of possible explanations for these findings suggests that individual behavior is probably motivated by a combination of material self-interest and social preferences such as reciprocity and fairness.",The influence of group size on distributional fairness under voting by veto,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S017626801730455X,January 2019,2019,Research Article,306.0

We offer some political economy perspectives on how best to manage that risk.","General fiscal rules are legislative agreements intended to mitigate the deficit bias usually associated with fiscal policy and typically due to myopia by governments. Recent empirical research suggests that national fiscal rules are helpful in achieving greater budgetary discipline (Debrun et al., 2008; Nerlich and Reuter, 2013; Foremny, 2014). The question of which specific rule is most effective in promoting fiscal discipline has recently attracted a lot of attention. For example, Bergman et al. (2016) find that a combination of an expenditure rule and a balanced budget rule, or a combination of an expenditure rule, a balanced budget rule and debt rules, give significant positive effects on the primary balance for virtually all levels of government efficiency.==== However that does not guarantee acceptable economic outcomes.====In this paper, we take a different route. Rather than formulating generic rules designed to reduce the deficit bias, we set up specific rules aimed at maximising economic growth.==== This enables us to condition those rules on population parameters and age-related spending, and to show the impact of population change on fiscal balances and debt. We ask: first, whether, to what extent and when do changing demographics affect the net fiscal position; second, whether it is acceptable to allow larger debt burdens, or whether tax and spending austerity are always necessary when demographic change leads to pressure on public finances.====Then, rather than evaluating alternative forms of fiscal rule, we restrict attention to a rule for public debt. This is in line with previous work where we have argued that debt targets are superior to deficit targets for theoretical and practical reasons (Hughes Hallett and Jensen, 2012).==== But choosing a debt target is not a trivial task. A key issue is how to account for (the discounted value of) future spending liabilities. If the implicit liabilities created by ageing populations are ignored, the debt criterion will ignore the future revenues required to avoid default despite the obvious need to cover the benefits promised to existing and future beneficiaries.====This is the case for extending debt targeting rules to account for predictable demographic changes. Put differently, forward looking fiscal rules are needed to allow for future liabilities created by adverse demographics. The implication is that governments facing demographic change, or the need for higher social spending, will have to adjust (most likely restrict) their fiscal plans to accommodate those changes. Hence our key contribution is to make debt control forward looking by designing a rule where fiscal policy reacts, not only to changes in existing levels of debt, but also to anticipated changes in future liabilities.====This study provides a comparative static analysis of the problem. Within that framework, the paper makes three new contributions.==== First, we offer a formal evaluation of the optimal debt level around which the economy needs to stabilise.==== Second, we study how the optimal debt level varies with the key population parameters. Third, we show how fiscal rules designed to stabilise the economy around that debt level need to react to population age, life expectancy, the birth rate and rising welfare expenditures.====While general fiscal rules primarily address the deficit bias, this paper also looks at specific rules to deal with ageing and lack of growth in the work force. Such policies imply three roles for public policy: i) to improve the incentives to raise children, to maintain the number of taxpayers and a capacity to sustain a certain level of public debt; ii) to improve the volume and effectiveness of public capital in order to boost productivity and growth; and iii) to smooth the distributional consequences of demographic change and offset negative effects on growth. In this paper, we focus on all three roles because they explain ==== we can reach a benign steady state and good fiscal outcomes despite adverse demographics: an explanation that has been missing in the literature so far, but is perhaps the main contribution of the paper.====How and whether the government should incentivize child-rearing is a controversial issue. Since the children of today are the workers of tomorrow, we consider how demographics and sustainable government finances are related. We do that by allowing social spending aimed at alleviating the private cost of child-rearing. We include fiscal balances because a growing population has a feedback that can help maintain a certain level of public spending and debt. Specifically, we model government spending related to child-rearing; and then analyze how those expenditures influence the economy.====We consider public and private capital to be labour productivity-enhancing factors in production. Public capital can be interpreted as education, R&D and the social infrastructure that underpins human capital formation ==== leads to a more skilled and productive workforce. Private capital, however, provides the incentives for innovation and competition. The ratio of public to private capital is therefore a key factor for economic prosperity. The government seeks to improve the volume and effectiveness of public infrastructure, helping to raise productivity and the economy's rate of growth. Having a government with this mandate enables this study to present an optimal (public) debt policy which allows for demographic factors.====The roadmap of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we set out our analytical framework: an OLG model extended to allow for public debt. Section 3 derives the optimal debt-to-GDP ratio; section 4 outlines policies to manage demographic change and introduces the political economy forces that underlie the main issue: intergenerational equity and transfers. Sections 5 Calibration, 6 Steady state characterisation provide a simulation treatment of the effects of population change on optimal debt. Section 7 then illustrates the political economy trade-offs that underlie policy problems of this type. Section 8 provides our principle conclusions and an agenda for future research.",Sustainable fiscal strategies under changing demographics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017305499,March 2019,2019,Research Article,307.0

We also obtain results that are counterintuitive, but only at first sight. First, it can be shown that the incumbent wants to ==== the manipulation when her ego rent increases. Second, the optimal magnitude of manipulation does not necessarily go up when the share of voters suffering from fiscal illusion rises.","Many countries have a demographic problem which implies increased financial needs for future pension payments.==== The problem is more serious in countries which largely rely on pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension schemes because a smaller number of employees has to directly finance the pensions for the growing older generation (Selén and Ståhlberg, 2007). To alleviate the problem pension reserve funds have been established in many countries (Yermo, 2008; Mulder et al., 2009; Clark and Monk, 2011). Their purpose is to accumulate assets now and release them later. However, during recessionary periods it is difficult to save for the future. Between 2007 and 2010, for instance, it was expected that social expenditures in EU countries would increase by 3.3% of GDP (Natali, 2011). At the same time, there was pressure to abide by the deficit and debt rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. As a consequence, several countries used the funds prematurely or intervened in their operations during the Great Recession of the late 2000s. Casey (2014) discusses three examples. The French Pension Reserve Fund was used to cover increased deficits. In Ireland, 60% of the pension reserve fund had been diverted to bailing out and recapitalising the banking sector by spring 2011. In Poland, 50% of the pension reserve fund was used to help the country satisfy the Maastricht requirements.====Pension reserve funds are classified as sovereign wealth funds by the IMF (2007). Like any trust fund, they accumulate resources which can potentially be freed up at any time, not only during recessionary periods. In fact, they are always threatened by political intervention (Yermo, 2008). According to Clark and Monk (2011) “former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan famously said in 1999, ‘Even with Herculean efforts, I doubt if it would be feasible to insulate, over the long run, the trust funds from political pressures … ’”.====This paper focuses on the political threats to pension reserve funds irrespective of there being a recession or not. Tapping into a pension reserve fund means that the government can dissolve part or all of it without the obligation of subsequent replenishment. Our paper and its results could also be interpreted in the more general context of trust funds. We embed a pension reserve fund in a modified Shi and Svensson (2006) political budget cycle (PBC) model. While separating voters into fiscal realists and persons suffering from fiscal illusion (henceforth FISPs, i.e. fiscal illusion suffering persons), we investigate how voters perceive policies and the competence of politicians. Will politicians try to manipulate voters' perception in order to increase their re-election chances by prematurely spending parts of the pension reserve fund?====Our research is based on Shi and Svensson's (2006) model, but with two modifications which, taken together, allow us to study the essence of political manipulations of pension reserve funds. First, instead of the increase in debt, the politician's instrument becomes the reduction of an existing pension reserve fund. Different from pension funds, the beneficial owners of pension ==== funds are institutions or governments, not individuals. This feature leads to the aforementioned possibility that reserve funds can be raided by the government for political purposes. Second, we assume that voters can be fiscal realists or FISPs (fiscal illusion suffering persons). Fiscal illusion refers to a misperception of fiscal parameters.==== Fiscal realists can adequately perceive the cost of public spending, but FISPs lack this ability or are unwilling to do so.==== This paper posits that FISPs underestimate the amount of fund reduction (costs) required for benefitting from public goods spending. The typical result from fiscal illusion (based on underestimated costs) is overspending. In our model, it manifests itself in political budget cycles.====Overall, we obtain three results. First, we find that the premature spending of parts of the reserve fund allows the incumbent to increase her re-election chances, but with limitations. Dissolving parts of the pension reserve fund allows the incumbent to increase the provision of public goods which is beneficial per se and ==== help increase political support. However, the optimal degree of dissolution of the pension reserve fund exceeds the degree which would lead to the largest winning probability. Politicians are willing to overmanipulate at the expense of vote shares in order to achieve a higher provision of public goods. In fact, there is a trade-off between economic gains (the public goods provision) and re-election chances at the equilibrium.====Overmanipulation with respect to optimal re-election chances also explains the second result. At the equilibrium, the level of manipulation ==== when the ego rent goes up. This seems counterintuitive at first glance, but not any more when we think in terms of overmanipulation at the equilibrium. A larger ego rent increases the incentive to stay in power. Hence the policymaker would like to reduce the manipulation in order to raise re-election chances. The re-election motive dominates the public goods provision motive in the trade-off between the two at the equilibrium. This means that politicians with stronger self-serving inclinations (with higher ego rents) may actually not be an additional threat for existing pension reserve funds. As a third result, we can show that an increase in the share of FISPs does not necessarily increase the optimal degree of manipulation, i.e. the degree of dissolution of the pension reserve fund.==== Thus societies with lots of voters suffering from fiscal illusion do not necessarily have to worry more about the depletion of their pension reserve funds.====The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 Core model, 3 Model solution, we present our core PBC model with pension reserve fund manipulations and its general solution. Several propositions are discussed in Section 4. There, we also widen our discussion to, for instance, an extended model with both types of manipulation (deficit and pension reserve fund). We summarise the results and show that our findings from the core model are confirmed. Details on both, the core model and the extended model, are presented in the appendix. Section 5 concludes.","Pension reserve fund, political budget cycles and fiscal illusion",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268017306080,January 2019,2019,Research Article,308.0

Since fiscal councils are often recent and heterogeneous across countries, assessing their impact is challenging. Using the latest (2016) vintage of the IMF Fiscal Council Dataset, we focus on two tasks expected to strengthen fiscal performance: the preparation or assessment of forecasts, and the monitoring of compliance with fiscal rules. Tentative ==== evidence suggests that the presence of a fiscal council is associated with more accurate and possibly less optimistic fiscal forecasts, as well as greater compliance with fiscal rules.","In a perfect world of fully informed policymakers solely motivated by social welfare maximization, complete discretion enables them to optimally respond to changing circumstances at any time. In the real world, however, information asymmetries are pervasive, time-inconsistency looms large, and policy behavior is shaped by other considerations than pure social welfare. Hence, even the best designed democratic systems require institutional constraints on policy discretion to complement democratic controls and prevent undesirable policy outcomes. The delegation of monetary policy to politically independent but accountable experts can be interpreted along these lines (Thomson, 1981); as can be more recent efforts to tie the hands of fiscal policymakers with numerical rules expressed in terms of deficit caps, public debt limits, and expenditure ceilings (Kopits and Symansky, 1998).====Even though constrained discretion is a broadly accepted regime governing most public policy choices, the inherently political nature of the public purse can, more than in any other area, undermine the effectiveness of formal constraints, including fiscal rules. While many countries subject fiscal decisions to formal policy rules (Lledó and others, 2017), weak compliance and widespread attempts to flout these rules have raised doubts about their effectiveness (Reuter, 2015). In the European Union (EU), this led to repeated attempts to make the rules nimbler and more resilient while simultaneously beefing up enforcement. The result is an inextricably complex fiscal framework (Debrun and Jonung, 2017; Eyraud and others, 2018). Not surprisingly, EU member states have been at the forefront of introducing new institutional mechanisms, in the form of independent fiscal councils (IFCs), to better anchor future fiscal decisions in sustainable fiscal trajectories.====At the most basic level, IFCs are non-partisan, technical bodies entrusted with a public finance watchdog role (IMF, 2013; Kopits, 2013; and the contributions in Beetsma and Debrun, 2018). Their analyses and assessments of fiscal policy help clear the smokescreens (intentional or not) often surrounding the public debate about government budgets, including the adequacy of the fiscal stance and the sustainability of public finances. In principle, better-informed voters can more easily reward good policies and sanction bad ones, leading to welfare improvements on average (Beetsma et al., 2017). Thus, instead of tying policymakers' hands, IFCs are expected to raise the reputational and political costs of financially irresponsible choices. This watchdog role is common to all fiscal councils; and the hope is that the barking will be loud enough to raise the odds of sustainable policies (see Debrun et al., 2017). Beyond that role, fiscal councils increasingly provide direct inputs to the budget process through the assessment or provision of macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, formal interactions with key stakeholders, and monitoring compliance with fiscal policy rules.====The rise of independent fiscal councils extends beyond Europe, with prominent institutions operating in Asia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere. However, because most IFCs are recent and vary substantially in terms of their remit, resources and tasks across countries, the “treatment effect” of adopting such an institution is particularly challenging to capture. Yet, as more countries envisage establishing an IFC, evidence about their effectiveness is in high demand. This paper aims at addressing such demand and draws key lessons from the most recent data.====Our analysis focuses on the performance regarding two specific, though important, tasks entrusted to IFCs: the preparation or assessment of macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts and the monitoring of compliance with fiscal rules. Hence, we measure the performance of fiscal councils with respect to these two objectives. A better-performing or more effective fiscal council is one that leads to more accurate forecasts or better compliance with existing fiscal rules. Regarding the latter, the question is whether overachievement of a fiscal target should be seen as stronger or weaker compliance. This paper considers both possibilities. It is important to realize through that we do not directly identify performance with an IFC's effect on fiscal conservatism or citizens' welfare. Apart from the difficulty to choose an appropriate welfare criterion, judgement of empirical performance based on the latter would hardly be possible to operationalize, as the welfare effects of IFCs would be swamped by more important factors. Judgment of performance based on fiscal conservatism would be misguided, because too tight fiscal policies can stifle the economy.====The econometric part of our paper extends IMF (2013) and Debrun and Kinda (2017), who look at the potential impact of IFCs on forecasting, and Reuter (2017) who studies the IFCs’ role in fostering rule compliance. Our paper does so using the 2016 vintage of the IMF Fiscal Council Dataset and a panel fixed-effect approach that tries to address concerns about self-selection. We focus mostly on the EU Member States. The reason is that IFCs are very heterogeneous, while our panel approach requires some homogeneity. However, the heterogeneity in the IFCs is less for the EU, where they have in common a mandate to monitor compliance and to produce/endorse macroeconomic forecasts. Moreover, by focusing on the EU we have comparable data on macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts from the Stability and Convergence Programs. Although it remains a first pass at the data, our econometric analysis first suggests that the presence of a fiscal council may be associated with more accurate budgetary forecasts. Second, IFCs also appear to foster compliance with fiscal policy rules.====Our work is grounded in earlier work that explores biases in fiscal forecasting. Examples are Strauch et al. (2004), Brueck and Stephan (2006), Pina and Venes (2007), Marinheiro (2010), Frankel (2011), De Castro et al. (2013) and Frankel and Schreger (2013). There is also quite a substantial literature that explores how institutional and governance structures, such as budget procedures and fiscal rules, impact on fiscal outcomes. For example, for a set of 15 EU countries over the period 1985–2004, Hallerberg et al. (2007) find that centralizing budgeting procedures lowers public debt. This is achieved through delegation of decision power to the finance minister when political competition is low and through fiscal contracts in environments with sufficient ideological dispersion and political competition. Beetsma et al. (2009) show for the EU that tighter medium-term budgetary frameworks are conducive to better implementation of fiscal plans. Bergman et al. (2016) find that fiscal rules reduce structural primary deficits, but that the effect is smaller the more efficient governments are. Hence, fiscal rules and government efficiency are substitutes in enhancing fiscal sustainability. Reuter (2015, 2017) and Lledó and Reuter (2017) explore compliance with fiscal rules. However, the empirical literature on the consequences of installing an IFC is still in its infancy.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The average annual rate of inflation for the euro area measured in terms of the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices dropped to zero in 2015, having decreased in each year starting in 2012. The inflation rate quantified with the GDP deflator – a more direct indicator of home-grown price pressures than the HICP – remained between 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent in every year from 2009 to 2015. Since 2008 the ECB has brought its policy interest rates essentially to zero and has engaged in multiple kinds of unconventional monetary policy. Meanwhile, while national fiscal policies were accommodative in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, they became non-accommodative soon thereafter, even in the member states with relatively strong fiscal fundamentals. The primary budget balance for the euro area as a whole improved in each year between 2009 and 2015, from −3.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2015, including in 2012 and 2013, two years in which euro area output contracted.==== The euro area has been gradually recovering from the 2012–2013 recession, but if a sizable negative shock were to occur again in the near future, there would be few reasons for optimism about the euro area's resilience to it.====Below we review standard business cycle models commonly used in academia and in policy institutions with an eye to formulating lessons for business cycle stabilization policy in the euro area.

Disaggregating investment by ownership-type shows that only private investment is affected by corruption, but not investment made by state-owned companies. The negative effect is larger for companies with full or partial foreign ownership. Additionally, we look at the relationship between corruption and foreign direct investment (FDI): similar to the investment in fixed capital, we find a negative relationship; however, its statistical significance varies across specifications with different data sources for FDI and different corruption measures.","Corruption has long been recognized as detrimental to economic growth (e.g. Myrdal, 1989; Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Mauro, 1995; Blackburn et al., 2006; Aidt, 2009). While corruption affects growth in different ways, its primary and by far the most important channel is a reduction in domestic investment as several studies show (e.g. Pellegrini, 2011; Hodge et al., 2011). By creating uncertainty in investment outcomes and by reducing the expected returns, corruption discourages the investment activity of the businesses, which translates into forgone economic growth (e.g. Knack and Keefer 1995; Mauro, 1995; Wei, 2000). Yet, a significant strand of literature challenges this consensus with a so-called “grease the wheels” hypothesis as proposed by Leff (1964) and Huntington (2006), which suggests that corruption allows economic agents to overcome the inefficiencies created by ill-functioning institutions. For example, some recent research shows that corruption facilitates firm entry in highly regulated economies (Dreher and Gassebner, 2013), improves economic efficiency in countries with weak institutions (Meon and Weill, 2010), and was positively associated with output and productivity of manufacturing plants in Indonesia during the rule of Suharto (Vial and Hanoteau, 2010). If corruption helps to fight a rigid bureaucracy in developing countries, would it also promote investment or would its negative consequences outweigh the benefits?====The previous empirical literature does not provide sufficient evidence on the topic. The majority of studies are cross-country comparisons, which often find a negative correlation between corruption and investment but suffer from an unobserved heterogeneity bias and do not establish causality.==== When cross-national analyses control for country fixed effects, they tend to find the relationship to be inconsistent across world regions: Asiedu and Freeman (2009), for example, find significant negative effect for firms in transition countries but no effect for firms in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa; on the opposite, Das and Parry (2011) show that corruption is bad for investment in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, but not in Asia. Another potential weakness of the previous literature is that it uses almost exclusively perceptions-based measures of corruption, which are often criticized for being biased (Treisman, 2007; Aidt, 2009). The bias can arise if corruption perceptions are influenced significantly more by the quality of institutions (Andvig, 2005; Weber Abramo, 2008) or by political competition and press freedom (Sharafutdinova, 2010) than by corruption.==== Finally, very few studies deal with the potential endogeneity of corruption since good instruments for corruption are hard to find (as discussed in Treisman, 2007: 225–226). The only two cross-country studies on investment that employed an instrumental variables (IV) approach are the seminal work by Mauro (1995) and its follow-up by Shaw et al. (2011).==== Mauro (1995) used ethnolinguistic fractionalization as an instrument for corruption and established a strong negative effect on investment; a finding that was later refuted in a replication study by Shaw et al. (2011), who found the instrument to be weak and, thus, unable to prove causality. When Shaw et al. (2011) employed the predicted geographical component of the country's trade share of GDP as a better instrument for corruption, they found no effect on investment or economic growth and called it “a result opposite to the wide spread belief in the literature”.==== While the empirical evidence is weak, the “widespread belief” of corruption being bad for the economy is often reinforced by the publication bias in economics (Brodeur et al., 2016), and especially by the publication bias in the literature on corruption and growth as noted in Campos et al. (2010). The bias potentially explains why the majority of published papers report negative effect of corruption and only few of them show that the effect does not exist or holds only for certain regions.====Since the cross-country literature is unable to provide clear evidence on the consequences of corruption on investment, there is a growing need for studies of corruption within single countries, which benefit from better measures of corruption and stronger homogeneity of political, economic, and social conditions. Focusing on a single country also allows the researcher to employ novel instruments for corruption, which may not be applicable in a cross-country setting. The only single country study on corruption and investment is Johnson et al. (2011).==== The authors investigate the relationship between corruption, economic growth and investment across the USA by using official data on convictions of public officials. Their instruments for corruption are corruption determinants specific to the USA: residency requirements for voting, restrictions on campaign financing, and the time of adoption of state constitutions. The study finds a negative relationship between corruption and investment; however, the small sample size of only 50 observations and low values (all below 6) of the first stage F-statistics for their instruments leave its results inconclusive.====Our paper attempts to fill the gap in the existing literature in several ways. First, we contribute to the growing literature that studies corruption within one specific country.==== We focus on Russia, which is a particular interesting case for this purpose as it is a former superpower and currently the 13th biggest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP (World Bank estimation for 2015) and suffers severely from corruption, being ranked 131 out of 176 countries by Transparency International in 2016.==== While corruption is wide-spread in Russia, its regions are neither equally corrupt (Baranov et al., 2015), nor are they equally economically developed.==== They are, however, homogeneous in terms of official language, system of law, culture, history, and traditions, which provides an ideal setting for econometric analysis. Moreover, very few empirical papers study the consequences of corruption in Russia and none of them focus on investment.====Second, we employ a new measure of corruption based on actual incidents of bribe taking by public officials as registered by the police authorities. Corruption incidents registered by the police is a measure similar to the conviction-based corruption measure traditionally used in the empirical literature on corruption in the USA (e.g. Goel and Rich, 1989; Goel and Nelson, 1998; Glaeser and Saks, 2006; Johnson et al., 2011; Alt and Lassen, 2014). However, it is more appropriate for countries with highly corrupt environments since it is not directly affected by persistent corruption in the judiciary as compared to the conviction data. The measure was previously employed to study the determinants of corruption in Russian regions by Schulze et al. (2016). The data are available for the period 2004–2013, allowing the use of a panel estimation with region and time fixed effects, thereby controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. We also check the robustness of the results using alternative measures of corruption based on bribery experiences of the population.====Third, we introduce new instruments to control for the endogeneity of corruption. We take advantage of an idiosyncratic development of the regional mass media in Russia and introduce indicators of regional press freedom as instrumental variables for corruption. Previous studies have found that a free press effectively reduces corruption both across countries (Brunetti and Weder, 2003) and in Russia (Schulze et al., 2016). We assemble two measures of the regional press freedom based on expert surveys by ==== (GDF) and on actual data on the violation of journalists' rights in Russia and show that they are strong predictors of regional corruption. At the same time, we find no empirical evidence that press freedom is associated with any regional characteristics such as revenues in advertising, income inequality, natural resources, state financial support of local press, relative salaries in television and radio broadcasting, or profitability of mass media. The idiosyncratic occurrence of regional press freedom has been reported previously by a wide range of studies of the Russian media (Koltsova, 2006; Azhgikhina, 2007; Roudakova, 2008; Beumers et al., 2008; Erzikova and Lowrey, 2010) and was attributed to a chaotic and unstable local media environment. It was caused, on the one hand, by the fact that the federal authorities, which exercised increasing political pressure on the national mass media, paid little attention to the regional press (Becker, 2004: Eismont, 2007; Gehlbach, 2010; Lipman, 2010), and, on the other hand, by pluralistic and fluid cross-institutional power arrangements at the local level (Erzikova and Lowrey, 2012: 138).====Finally, while the majority of the literature uses aggregate investment, we are able to show the effect of corruption on investment in fixed capital differentiated by its ownership: we distinguish between state and municipal companies and companies with full or partial private ownership. Additionally, we look at the domestic investment made by companies with a foreign ownership share exceeding 10% of their capital since we expect them to react more strongly to insecure property rights caused by corruption than completely domestically owned companies as they may have other options for investment (e.g. Habib and Zurawicki, 2001; Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2008). While the main focus of our research is investment in fixed capital by companies residing and operating in Russia, we briefly test the effect of corruption on foreign inward direct investment (FDI) in Russian regions using our data and estimation strategy. In the cross-country literature, the evidence on FDI and corruption has been very mixed. For instance, Egger and Winner (2005) and Barassi and Zhou (2012) find a positive correlation while Wei (2000), Egger and Winner (2006) and Marthur and Singh (2013) find a negative association. We study this relationship at the regional level in Russia and improve on the previous literature by Ledyaeva et al. (2013) and Kuzmina et al. (2014) by using more reliable data on FDI and better measures of regional corruption.====Our results show that corruption decreases overall investment in fixed capital in Russian regions. The effect is significant for companies in private ownership, but it is statistically insignificant for fully state-owned enterprises. Investment in fixed capital by companies with foreign ownership is most sensitive to corruption as predicted by the literature (e.g. Habib and Zurawicki, 2001). Our estimations also suggest a significant negative correlation between corruption and the inflow of FDI in the regions. Our main findings are robust to the inclusion of various social-economic controls, proxies of regional law-enforcement, different measures of corruption, and the use of instrumental variables.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains our methodology and data; Section 3 presents the results using fixed effects estimations, alternative measures of corruption, and the instrumental variables approach; Section 4 investigates the relationship between our corruption measures and FDI; Section 5 provides robustness checks, and Section 6 concludes.",Does corruption hinder investment?

Actions designed to shore up sovereign markets often lowered risk assessments in bank bond markets and policies designed to ensure safety and soundness of the European ==== system in some cases significantly impacted sovereign debt markets. Finally, a number of policies designed to stabilize markets had surprisingly little immediate impact on either sovereign or bank bond market risk assessments.","In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, government budget deficits and debt ratios in many countries in the Euro Area (EA) climbed to the highest levels seen in the post-war period and banks were incurring large losses. Market interest rates and credit default swap (CDS) spreads on sovereign debt and bank liabilities increased sharply in response, signaling lack of confidence in fiscal (and other) policies and bank solvency. The European sovereign debt crisis was characterized by tumultuous markets and technical defaults (Cyprus and Greece) or near-default by other EA countries (Ireland and Portugal) and widespread bank fragility. Against this background, policymakers responded with a multitude of programs designed to provide short-term liquidity to stabilize EA countries' sovereign debt markets, provide governments with short-term financing, restore long-term sustainable public finances, support banks, and restore confidence. Programs by the ECB, EU and IMF — the “troika” — and national governments were announced and implemented.====European policy programs were announced successively over time, somewhat hesitantly at first, and gradually grew in size and breath as the sovereign debt crisis continued and intensified. It is evident that the cumulative impact of policies, culminating with the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, eventually had the desired effect of quelling, if not resolving, the sovereign debt crisis. However, each policy program in itself may have had some marginal contribution to stabilizing markets.====This paper addresses how various European policy announcements, designed to quell the sovereign debt crisis, changed market assessments of sovereign and bank bond default risk. Immediate market reactions to policy announcements are one metric of gauging whether these policies were perceived as helpful in stabilizing markets. Using this metric, we shed light on three fundamental questions. Firstly, which of the ECB (monetary and financial support), EU (financial, fiscal rules and financial support in crisis countries), and domestic government (austerity) programs were most effective (ineffective) in immediately stabilizing sovereign debt markets? Secondly, which of these programs were initially most effective (ineffective) in stabilizing market concerns over bank fragility? And, thirdly, were there unintended market consequences of the programs apparent at the onset? That is, were program announcements targeted toward banks (sovereign debt) helpful in reducing the immediate anxiety about sovereign debt (banks)? Measuring reactions to policy announcements indicate how market participants initially evaluated the likelihood of program success and updated default risk perceptions.====Using panel regression and event-study frameworks, we investigate the response of sovereign and bank CDS spreads to European policy announcements. The linkages between sovereign and bank risks are evident, as we show below, and are a motivating factor behind moves to create a full banking union in Europe. We divide policy actions into several policy distinguish categories, and whether they are designed to stabilize sovereign debt markets or provide support to banks (liquidity and capital injections).====Section 2 reviews the literature on how policy actions are incorporated into market perceptions of default risk. Section 3 evaluates CDS spreads as a measure of sovereign and bank risk perceptions, linkages between sovereign and bank risk, and the empirical methodology and data for our study. This is followed, in Section 4, by a presentation of our empirical results on market perceptions of risk and policy impact effects. This section reports our results on how markets price sovereign and bank risk in four European countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain), whether European policy measures affected market pricing of risk and how banking fragility affects risk perceptions.

Kim Duk Gyoo,"Department of Economics, University of Mannheim, Germany","Received 12 February 2018, Revised 21 June 2018, Accepted 21 June 2018, Available online 25 June 2018, Version of Record 14 January 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2018.06.004,Cited by (5),The two observations that (1) some low-income citizens demand low redistribution and (2) as income ,"My research questions originate from Kelly and Enns (2010) who reported that the more severe income inequality is, the more inclined the poor are to oppose redistribution.==== Why are some of the poor economically conservative?==== Why do more of the poor demand less redistribution when income inequality becomes more severe? These observations are a bit of a conundrum because economic models, such as Meltzer and Richard (1981) that assume self-interested rational agents, typically predict that anyone whose income or productivity is below that of a decisive voter should vote for redistribution; and that more severe income inequality, which leads to a larger gap between median income and mean income, raises social demand for redistribution. Even if we understand the higher income earners' support for redistribution by taking into account some types of social preferences (such as altruism and/or inequity aversion), it is still hard to explain the lower income citizens’ low demand for redistribution. Understanding the main driving factor that leads to the economic conservatism of the poor is important for policymakers in that it could affect the desirable form of economic redistribution. Thus, the primary purpose of this research is to answer the following question: What can policymakers who deal with economic inequality learn from the changes in economic conservatism of the poor?====There are several studies that address the economic conservatism of the poor. These are discussed in detail in subsection 1.1. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an additional attribute that has not been explored well but which significantly helps us to understand the low demand for redistribution by the poor. I provide a stripped-down model that yields the following two predictions: (1) The poor and the rich oppose a proposed redistribution policy that offers some help to the poor and only the middle supports it (henceforth this is called ‘the observation’)==== and (2) as income inequality gets more severe, the economic conservatism of the poor becomes more pervasive (this is called ‘the dynamics’).====Specifically, I consider a continuum of workers whose labor productivity (type) is low, middle, and high. Each worker compares his or her indirect utility under a “laissez-faire” economy with that of an economy that has an income tax rate of ==== ∈ (0, 1) and a lump-sum transfer. Although I believe that concern for a future generation's welfare would enable us to describe the dynamics across generations, and the coexistence of labor and capital income earners would help us to understand interactions between classes, I consider neither the overlapping generation nor capitalists, on purpose, to focus on how public opinion on the redistribution policy for the current generation is formed while shutting down all other possible channels. Within this model, my goals are reduced to (1) showing a reasonable set of assumptions that predicts ‘the observation,’ and (2) examining whether a larger set of parameters predicts ‘the dynamics’ within such assumptions. This approach is parsimonious in the sense that it does neither consider exogenous preferences over political parties nor heterogeneous beliefs about the state of the world and the state of themselves. It also allows better comparative statistics.====To capture economic mobility positively associated with the policy changes (Chetty et al., 2014), I assume citizens' productivity is slightly perturbed only if a new policy is implemented.==== Then, positional concern would play a role to explain both ‘the observation’ and ‘the dynamics.’ By positional concern, I mean that citizens care about their relative position in a ranking based on consumption.==== Even if a redistribution policy allows the poor to enjoy more resources for consumption in ==== terms, some of the poor may have a ==== smaller amount of resources compared with others who previously had the same amount under the status quo policy. If the expected marginal disutility by positional concern exceeds the marginal utility from redistribution, they prefer to stay with the status quo. The rich prefer the status quo because under a new redistribution policy their resources decrease in absolute terms, and for some of them, decrease in relative terms, too. The middle-income group may prefer the new policy under a reasonable assumption about utility from the relative rank.====The last-place aversion (LPA) reported by Kuziemko et al. (2014) is one of the key assumptions I rely on. If a last-place-averse citizen is concerned about his or her relative position, in general, then the marginal disutility of moving down from second-to-the-bottom to the very bottom must be strictly greater than that of moving down from third-to-the-bottom to second-to-the-bottom. Thus, the utility function that captures the positional concern should be increasingly concave in position.====Another contribution of this paper is to provide a way to find the desirable form of redistribution policy by observing the changes in public opinion about redistribution. I show that if positional concern is the main driving force behind the economic conservatism of the poor, then the right skewness of income distribution is positively related to the increased economic conservatism of the low-income group, while the increase in the income gap between groups is negatively related to it. The prospect of upward mobility works in the opposite way: If the low-income citizens believe that opposing redistribution will be beneficial for them in the future, the right skewness of income distribution will negatively affect the economic conservatism of the poor, while the increase in the income gap between groups is positively related to it. Thus, if positional concern is the main driving factor, utilitarian policymakers should focus more on increasing the low-income citizens’ standard of living to the middle class; if the prospect of upward mobility is the main factor, minimizing income gaps by cutting down the top-income earnings could be of their primary interest.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In the following subsection, I review related studies. Section 2 describes economic models and some results from those models, Section 3 shows the dynamics of the model, and Section 4 discusses the relationship between the model and the prospect of upward mobility hypothesis and possibility of conducting empirical and experimental follow-up studies.

More currently, the international diplomatic landscape has been inundated with rising political tensions between states accompanied with both threats and impositions of sanctions. As current as January 2016, China issued a threat to impose sanctions on US defence companies that sell arms to Taiwan.==== However, there exist no empirical studies that focus on the dyadic impact on the sender and its target before the actual imposition of the sanctions, especially the implications of threats of sanctions on international trade. Previous research has focused exclusively on the trade effect of imposed sanctions (Caruso, 2003; Hufbauer et al., 2007). A few number of studies argue that the threatening stage is critically relevant in understanding the outcome of sanctions and the threat of economic sanctions may even be more important than the actual imposition (Eaton and Engers, 1992; Lacy and Niou, 2004). There are also studies that attribute the general conclusion of sanctions being ineffective to the exclusion of the threat stage in the sender-target interactions (Whang et al., 2013).====The target's behavior at the threat stage or before the actual imposition may affect the outcome of sanctions. There may be different courses of action available to the target at the threat stage. A target may decide to comply with just a mere threat by the sender in order to avoid any negative consequences of the actual imposition. Conversely, the target can defy the threat by adopting strategies ==== that could minimize the eventual imposition of the sanctions. Any possible adjustment to minimize the sanction damage will not be limited to the target alone, as there are also economic agents within the sender state that will be adversely affected when the threat is actually implemented. Thus, anticipation of international sanctions can trigger perverse actions by economic agents within the sender and the target states that may have negative or positive consequences for international trade (van Bergeijk, 2009). Adopting adjustment measures prior to the actual imposition may not be improbable in practice because, even in cases when sanctions have been imposed, targets adopt strategies such as trans-shipment to circumvent the sanctions.====Analyses of the effect of trade agreements have changed significantly as a result of considering the anticipation effects. For example, McLaren (1997) shows that the anticipation effect of negotiating trade agreements can substantially increase the estimated impact of signing a free trade agreement. Conversely, Baier and Bergstrand (2007) highlight the fact that firms may delay trade temporarily in anticipation of an impending trade agreement. In addition, there is a literature pertaining to safeguards and anti-dumping measures that has pointed to anticipation effects – for example, stockpiling, or immediate diversification away from a source of supply that may become subject to a trade measure (see for example, Hoekman and Leidy (1989)). It was van Bergeijk (2009) who linked the possibility of stockpiling to threat of sanctions. He points to the fact that threat can act as an incentive for potential targets to stockpile against future negative effects of sanctions. Thus, the net impact of a threat of sanctions depends on the behavior or attitude of the targets towards risk and their expectation formation process (van Bergeijk, 1995).====Thus, the basic question in this paper is whether there is any empirical evidence of anticipation effects of stockpiling when it comes to sanctions. If agents anticipate sanctions based on signals or threats given by the relevant entities, do they adjust ====? Do firms adjust production and trade or do consumers adjust consumption ==== in order to minimize any ==== damage when the sanctions are eventually imposed? Does the data provide such empirical evidence, and how based on theory can we explain the reaction of firms and consumers? Is it the case that the effectiveness of sanctions is reduced if traders can anticipate and adjust sourcing accordingly? Does the impact of threatened sanctions differ qualitatively or quantitatively from actual imposed sanctions? These questions have become more relevant today as we witness the re-emergence of a ‘sanction decade’.====Theoretically, it has been argued that the anticipation or a threat of sanctions produces a trade-deteriorating effect comparable to imposed sanctions (Morrow et al., 1998; Fuchs and Klann, 2013). Their main argument is that the threat of sanctions produces political, legal and credit risks for businesses engaged in international trade. Exposure to these risks will reduce expected profitability for businesses and ultimately reduce the trade flow between the sender and its target. However, anticipation of sanctions could also trigger stockpiling by producers and consumers, especially in the short-run. The tendency of threatened sanctions to trigger stockpiling may either change the net effect of threatened sanctions qualitatively or minimize any negative effects quantitatively. In fact, van Bergeijk and van Marrewijk (1995) point out that the passage of time between the threat and the imposition acts as an important incentive for the target to build stockpiles and adjust its economic structure in advance. Thus, it is plausible that the anticipation of sanctions may not produce similar effect as actual imposed sanctions because economic actors can act differently under imposed sanctions compared to threatened sanctions.====In this paper, we empirically compare the trade effects of threatened and imposed sanctions by relying on a recent and detailed compilation of the Threat and Imposition of Economic Sanctions (TIES) database by Morgan et al. (2014). Previous studies that focused on the trade effects of sanctions such as Caruso (2003) and Hufbauer et al. (2007) restrict their analyses to the US as the only sender of sanctions while Morgan et al. (2014) have shown through their TIES database that there are other frequent senders of sanctions apart from the US. Interestingly, the data shows that developing as well as developed countries resort to the use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool. Although the US is the most frequent sender, there are other countries such as Canada, Russia, the UK and India that are also frequent senders of sanctions. Furthermore, the TIES data distinguishes between sanction cases in which they were mere threats as compared to actual impositions. In addition, it provides detailed information on different sanction instruments employed by the senders.====Generally, the focus of previous economics literature has been on the effectiveness of sanctions in altering the behavior of the target state so it complies with the intentions of the sender state (Bapat and Morgan, 2009; Oechslin, 2014; Pape, 1997; van Bergeijk, 1989). The majority of these studies tend to conclude that sanctions are ineffective in persuading the target to change its objectionable policies. However, whether sanctions are effective or not, they can still adversely affect the dyadic relationships between the sender and its target. This could result in reduced dyadic international flows such as trade flows, foreign direct investment, migration and foreign aid between the sender and its target.====Apart from the dyadic effects, current studies have shown that sanctions have adverse consequences for target states. They show that the imposition of sanctions has adverse distributional effects and it is more severe for the poor and the civilian population (Afesorgbor and Mahadevan, 2016); it triggers currency crises (Peksen and Son, 2015); it retards the targets' economic growth and development (Neuenkirch and Neumeier, 2015) and it widens the poverty gap (Neuenkirch and Neumeier, 2016). These adverse consequences of sanctions have shifted the attention of the international community and researchers to how to minimize the impact of sanctions on the poor or target the sanctions at specific groups (so-called smart sanctions).====The focus of our study thus fills an apparent gap in three ways. First, we will be the first to empirically address how the threat of sanctions affects international trade using a more detailed cross-country analysis. This provides a unique opportunity to explore theories within international political economy as to how sensitive trade is to a mere threat of sanctions compared to the actual imposition of sanctions. Secondly, a focus on different sanctions instruments at a more disaggregated level provides a new perspective in the sanctions literature, and offers knowledge of the effect of each instrument and how to apply them efficiently. This is relevant given the increasing debate about sanctions being regarded as a double-edged sword that cannot distinguish innocent civilians from political leaders. Thus, identifying how these different instruments affect international trade will improve the ability of different actors to apply them. Lastly, a product-level analysis also provides new insights as to how the imposition of sanctions restricts the flow of different product categories. This is relevant as the Geneva Convention has specific provision for the unrestricted passage of products essential for human survival even in sanctioned states. Understanding which product categories are affected will provide information about the consequences of sanctions on different segments of the population, especially the civilian population.====In summary, our results show the impact of threatened sanctions differs qualitatively and quantitatively from that of imposed sanctions. Whereas imposed sanctions lead to a decrease in the trade flow between the sender and the target, threatened sanctions lead to an increase in the trade flow. The positive impact of the threat may be due to economic agents in both the sender and its target resorting to stockpiling prior to the actual imposition of sanctions to minimize any adverse consequences of the sanctions. More specifically, we find strong evidence of stockpiling especially in the case of medicines and pharmaceutical products when senders issue threats without imposition. In addition, we find varying effects for different sanctions instruments and the detrimental effect of sanctions extended to essential products.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides possible theoretical arguments on how threatened and imposed sanctions affect bilateral trade between the sender and its target.

What are the factors affecting innovative activity in a country? Several studies identify research and development expenditures (Acs et al., 2002; Furman et al., 2002; Schneider, 2005), openness (Furman et al., 2002; Schneider, 2005; Tebaldi and Elmslie, 2013), and education (Chen and Puttitanun, 2005; Varsakelis, 2006) as possible factors explaining the variation in innovative activity across countries.====Institutions play an equally important role in technological progress. In a corrupt country, lack of institutions to protect property rights leaves productive activities such as innovation vulnerable to predation. According to Baumol (1990, p. 893), “… while the total supply of entrepreneurs varies among countries, the productive contribution of the country's entrepreneurial activities varies much more because of their allocation between productive activities such as innovation and largely unproductive activities such as rent seeking.” Corruption affects the returns to innovative activity and makes it less likely for entrepreneurs to capture their share.====Although there is a vast empirical literature on how institutions, particularly corruption, affect economic growth, the relationship between corruption and innovative activity is largely overlooked by economists.====In this study, I investigate the long-run relationship between corruption and innovative activity using annual data from 48 contiguous U.S. states between 1977 and 2006. I find that corruption indeed slows down innovation in the long-run.====My study contributes to the literature in several ways in terms of data and empirical methodology:====The study is organized as follows.
